Just look at the photos...!!  Of course the best was the pistachio soufflé with a dab of chocolate ice cream....hmm hmm, yum yum!!Great food, service and old school ambience, that deserve a 5 star.  Yes highly recommend it!!",21,15,23
1,D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,100,541,3.0,10/8/2018,"Clocktower is nestled in a cosy space above the lobby of the EDITION hotel across from Madison Square Park. Being a collaboration between the famed restaurateur Stephen Starr and British Chef Jason Atherton (enjoyed his Michelin starred Pollen Street Social in London) -- it's no ordinary hotel dining room. Given the talent backing The Clocktower, as well as its Michelin star, it seemed like a solid choice. Overall, though, while we found the menu to be well conceived, the dishes need more editing and finesse. Would love to give 4 stars to the very personable staff and cozy environment, but the food fell short of expectations at this level and our wine selection was served at an improper temperature, so rounding down to 3 stars.Atmosphere- Clubby enclave that really suits the concept, not staid/stuffy though.- Warm and inviting with several distinct rooms, dimmed lighting and classic British design elements.- Tables are nicely spaced for NYC.FoodEverything sounds great in concept, and to be sure the flavor profiles were all nice. Some dishes felt like they were missing components, while others could use a touch more refinement. Menu descriptions are elaborate and try overly hard to connote farm-to-table. The anticipation generated is fulfilled unevenly. Entrees were lackluster, while apps and desserts hit high notes. We had:-Hudson Valley Foie Gras And Chicken Liver Parfait (london stout, lentils, smoked duck - $19): Highlight dish - foie with lentils and stout very innovative pairings. Well done!-Long Island Tomatoes (sauternes and tomato gelée, shaved brooklyn burrata, olive biscuit, peppermint - $20): Tasty, but unexceptional, despite the enticing description.- Long Island Duck Breast (spiced peppercorn, grilled peach with Argan, pickled kohlrabi, five plum sauce - $ 39): Cooked to good temp, but wish fat was a bit further rendered. Served as one large piece of meat, without any accompaniment to add balance and interest.- Berkshire Pork Chop (beetroot soubise, white balsamic puffs, semi-dried chioggia beets, black pudding, charcuterie sauce - $37): Moist, with the white balsamic puffs lending a nice textural element. Favorite of our proteins.- Strawberries and Cream (vanilla custard, olive oil cake, red verjus sorbet -  $15): Loved it! Top caliber with nice nuance and great interplay of textures; sweet but not overwhelming.BeverageHaving had cocktails downstairs at The Lobby Bar (nice environment), went straight for wine. Upon seating, you will be presented a ""Champagne cart"" which seemed cool in concept (some may find it hokey). In general, wine list had good breath across regions and solid options in various price points, including sub $150. Somm suggested the 2013 Odoul-Coquard Aux Saint Jacques ($152), a very solid Nuits-Saint-Georges Burgundy - good recommendation. Sadly, it was served very close to room temperature, which is unexpected for this caliber of venue. Should we have made a comment? Probably, but hated to see a nice bottle go to waste and everyone was just too nice. It didn't kill the experience, but was disappointing.Service- Waitress very personable and attentive, delivered great service.- Somm did good job interacting, happy to discuss the wine list and perceptive to our tastes and budget. Really nice job, except should have detected wine temp before serving.",,,

Updated review","Maybe I had very high expectations from last time, but didn't think this time things were as good. The two appetizers we got had gelatin in it, which I get it, it is great to offer something different and mix different flavors, but I thought it was over used.We got (2 people):- Scottish Langoustine Tartare ($22): grapefruit gelée, avocado, finger lime, anise leaves. A shrimp tartare, without the egg yok and little grapefruit jello mixed in. Loved the taste, hated the texture. Made it seem like caviar from a far, but it wasn't - Marinated Yellowtail ($21): seaweed custard, bonito gelée, spring onion and ginger salad. Square pieces of marinated yellow tail on a base of - again - jello like base. This put me off.- Braised Atlantic Halibut ($44): salt baked baby carrots, dulse seaweed, yuzu, lobster, pink grapefruit. Really good tasty fish. The baby carrots abnd the grapefruit had a mild sweet taste that went very well with the fish. Lobster is just  a tiny bit, don't expect too much.- Long Island Duck Breast ($39): spiced peppercorn, grilled peach with Argan, pickled kohlrabi, five plum sauce. My bf licked, I tried it and liked the plum sauce it came with.I will wait a few months to come back again, so they change the menu a bit and I can try things without gelatin.",2,,1
3,Sam E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1465,396,4624,3.0,7/24/2018,"Breakfast service at the restaurant was not what we expected. Our waitress was extremely inefficient and rude and did not write down our order so naturally all of it came out wrong. When we asked her for the side of potatoes we ordered, she had an attitude about it and we ended up getting it after we ate our meal. I had specified my allergies and told her that I could not have banana but she failed to write that down so naturally she brought me granola with giant slices of banana. We had to constantly ask for our plates to be taken up, get refills or flag down another tables waitress to eat our order right. Since we were staying at the hotel attached to the restaurant, she didn't give us our check at the end and said it will be billed to the room. To our surprise, the check had items we didn't even order and the charge was much higher than what we calculated. Overall, the waitress left us with a  sour taste in our mouth. As far as food, there are no gluten free or vegan options other than avocado toast. They don't even have gluten free bread. I had to order oats with berries which was $20. If you are staying at the hotel, head somewhere else for breakfast and try them for dinner or lunch when the head chef is there.",8,4,4
4,Jonathan Z.,"San Diego, CA",229,142,288,4.0,8/13/2018,"We came in for lunch for restaurant week that runs about $26 for a two course menu. Our server was great and the food was also very good. The bread they serve looks good, but was really tough. The butter was delicious but breaking through the tough, rubbery exterior of the bread made it tough to eat. Looking around, most people didn't even touch it. The foie gras parfait was nicely plated and came with a side of bread. The lentils added a nice texture to the creamy liver dish. It was also sort of sweet and nutty, with small prices or duck sprinkled around. The risotto with lobster reduction was very good but could have been a little warmer.The ox cheek and ale pie was delicious. It came with an oyster sauce they pour tableside and had a delicious dark sauce that encircles the pie. The crust was perfect, but again, I thought the food could have been warmer. The flavors were great, service was spectacular, but the timing at which the food came out could have been better. We saw them bring our entrees out right after our first courses made their way to the table so they turned around and brought it back in, which is probably why the food was more on the lukewarm side. Maybe a little miscommunication on the part of timing. But don't let that stop you from paying them a visit. The restaurant is up a set of spiral stairs. They've also got a cool bar to sit and grab a cocktail while you wait.",1,,

Updated review","Recently revisited for a date night, and had a much better experience this time around. I made a reservation online easily for 7:30 a few weeks in advance, but the restaurant didn't have many empty tables while we were there so I'd definitely plan ahead.Started off the night with the Royal Engagement and The Don for drinks, both of which were very sippable. The Don came with a side of chocolate candies to enjoy with the drink as well.As many other reviewers have noted, the complimentary bread and butter is amazing. You get an entire mini loaf of fresh baked bread (seriously, when we cracked it open it was still steaming) and salted, whipped butter. For food, we split a half dozen oysters, ox cheek mac and cheese, and the baked chicken for two. Everything was delicious (especially that mac and cheese). The chicken was prepared 3 ways - the white meat came plated with morels and some sort of puree, while the dark meat came in mini sliders and a separate pot with jus poured over it. So good! Not as good as the Nomad chicken, but still delicious.Dessert was the apple tarte tatin for two (the panna cotta from last time is no longer on the menu, thankfully), which was seriously one of the best desserts I've had. Nothing fancy about it, just a perfectly prepared apple tart with caramel sauce drizzled all over it, and I couldn't ask for more.Meal ended with complimentary almond financiers. Would definitely come back here for another special (or even not so special) occasion. Also - they have the best smelling hand soap I've ever used.",10,5,9
8,Jason E.,"New York, NY",50,11,17,5.0,10/27/2018,"Great food, atmosphere, n service. For food that I found outstanding: the scallop in broth (app), pork chops (main), venison dish (main). Sadly the pigeon dish was not available at that time. A lot of stairs to get to the restaurant lol.",,,
9,Kate Y.,"Queens, NY",211,189,587,3.0,4/25/2018,"Had dinner here last weekend for F's birthday. I like the ambiance in here; dim and romantic. The high ceilings and the wall to wall gold framed images make quite a statement. We were told by the hostess that we only had until 9:15 until they had another party booked for the table. It's always annoying to hear this; I'm sure it's a necessary practice so that they can seat as many parties as possible in a night, but please keep that practice behind closed doors. In the end, there were plenty of tables open and we weren't asked to leave... but in the back of our minds, it was lingering there and we opted not to order extra drinks after we finished our bottle of wine. They started us off with a small glass of sparkling wine because they knew we were there to celebrate a birthday, which was very nice. We ordered the $125 seafood platter to start. It read like it would be huge and at that price point we thought it would be so we didn't order any additional appetizers... but it turned out to be very small. I'm sure I could've easily finished the whole platter myself. I ordered the pork chop. It was well cooked, but there was lots of fat - and in the dimness of the restaurant, you couldn't always see if it was meat or fat. I don't eat the fat on meats so whenever I got a bite of fat, I had to suppress the urge to spit it out (fancy place as it is). But others who love fat might like this; A joked that it sounds delicious. Friends ordered the duck, lamb and burger and all seemed to enjoy their dishes. F got the pistachio soufflé. This takes 20 minutes to make but it's worth the wait. It was light, fluffy and delicious. A and I shared the warm mango pudding. Texturally, I thought it was kinda weird and flavor wise, there was nothing special about it. F and J tried a bite each, but no one on the table liked the dish much. Most of it was left. The service isn't very warm or affable. It started out very friendly when we got the sparkling wine and waters... but we waited a while before a waiter came to take our order and even then, he only came by after we waved him over. (We had been told we had to leave by a certain time, so we wanted to make sure we can place our appetizer order early so we would have timers leisurely enjoy our entrées.) When he came by, he told us he would prefer if we ordered everything all together instead of just the appetizer cuz it would make things easier. Ok. Luckily, by the time he arrived to our table, we all knew what we wanted so it was fine. Overall, we had a solid 3 star experience. The chef has a Michelin star restaurant in the UK, so I am glad we tried it, but I don't think I will be looking to dine there if I'm ever visiting the country based on this dining experience.",1,,
10,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",22,113,23,4.0,1/29/2018,"As a disclaimer, I came on a Sunday night, and the restaurant was fairly empty, so a lot of the issues that people had with service didn't really apply. Our (party of 3) waters were always filled, and the food came out at reasonable times.From the hotel lobby, you take a winding staircase up to the second floor, where the restaurant is actually located. The interior is dark-ish, with countless photographs lining the walls that gave off a very swanky, country-club type feeling. It was definitely unique, but I can't say for sure whether I was a fan or not.Bread service was good - the butter was served at a temperature where it bordered being solid and melting, which was a nice surprise.For entrees, we opted for the Long Island duck, the pork chop, and for the rack of lamb, of which I honestly think the pork was the best option. Lamb was tender but relatively flavorless, and the duck was overcooked and tougher than anticipated. Also as a heads up, if you're looking at the duck for the foie gras skewer, don't bother, because they really skimp out and give you this tiny little piece, and it was overall disappointing. Oh well. Still, the pork was really well-seasoned, there was a TON of meat, and the sauce/crust combo really did it for me. I didn't even mind the pumpkin, which I'm usually extremely averse to.For dessert, we got the apple tarte tatin for two and the warm mango pudding, both of which were pretty good. I wish they hadn't drizzled the caramel sauce on top considering nobody in our party really liked caramel, but I know others can't have apples without it, so to each their own. The mango was fantastic, and I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Positive overall experience, but I think their brunch menu is a more enticing reason to come back than dinner.",3,3,3
11,Chloe K.,"New York, NY",229,92,368,5.0,3/19/2018,"Service and ambiance were impeccable and the quality of the food outstanding. Great attention to detail. After we rejected the goat cheese desert as being a bit heavier than what we desired and ordered simple sorbet, the server brought us that desert complimentary because she felt we just had to try it.  She was right! The sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and didn't try to up sell us. We had a wonderful bottle of The Mascot.",,,
12,Joelle C.,"Queens, NY",129,18,16,5.0,9/30/2018,"From the moment we sat the service was so friendly and attentive. Complimentary champagne and a handwritten note was given with seemingly every special event. Great way to start our anniversary dinner. Every bite of food we had was amazing. We had the chilled Boston lobster, steak tartare and fois gras for our appetizers and all were absolutely delicious. For dinner the duck and pork chop, typically I don't have a pork chop as my number one pick on a menu, but it was so tender and flavorful. For dessert we had the ice cream and sorbet selection. We were congratulated on our anniversary by the lovely gm David. I would absolutely visit again so experience more of what The Clocktower has to offer.",,,
13,Ali K.,"Manhattan, NY",110,239,1311,4.0,1/12/2018,"Unique.Chef Jason Atherton's creation. You can tell that the menu has British inspired items infused with contemporary flavors and presentations.I think a must try is the Long Island duck with the Foie gras skewer but I'd go with medium or medium well rather than the medium rare recommended. The duck sits on a preserve of plums and shallotsAlso tried the pigeon and quail pie (see picture) cut in half. Very unusual and I think also a signature of this place.Also tried the fries (were OK, a wee bit dry) Berners Tavern macaroni and cheese with mushrooms and slow cooked on cheek (amazing and rich!) $26 and the Brooklyn burrata which was 'OK'Also tried the steamed green vegetables which vary from time to time but surprisingly small helping After trying all of the above I had to have green tea (they might consider changing the brand, very forgettable tea) and the apple and berry tart (cute, bite sized and fragrant) and a scoop of Banana and Passion fruit sorbet ($13 a scoop:/ )The interior looks old school with dark wood, huge marble fireplace, a billiard and bar room. Something that fits into the insurance row and credit Suisse clientele. Sort of.When you enter the door you have to take the spiral staircase up.The service may in general need to be pulled up to the Michelin Star level a little as well. Not bad at all, just hasn't gotten up to the five star level yet.Asked to wait at the bar where they would come and get us in two minutes which became fifteen minutes and seated after we went back and checked . But friendly and professional through out",2,,
14,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",70,302,103,5.0,1/16/2018,"Upscale experience with thoughtful service (personalized to the occasion), creative drinks, and impeccable food!!We chose to come to Clocktower because of their Michelin star and we were thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Up a set of winding staircase from the Edition Hotel lies an expansive restaurant, complete with a bar and a pool table. The dining space spans three rooms, and it feels like you're dining in a mansion's drawing room. With tasteful gallery-style black and white portraits on the walls and a stately crackling fireplace, The Clocktower provides a cozy and intimate experience for all diners. We were celebrating our anniversary, which the boyfriend thoughtfully included in our reservation. The Clocktower, in response, provided us with a hand-written card that greeted us at our table, congratulating us on our anniversary. We were served complimentary champagne by the sommelier. And after our meal, we were treated to complimentary dessert, comprised of a mango mousse cake (with a candle!), and two almond tarts, all of which were delightfully light and not too sweet.Our meal:- Complimentary bread: The softest and warmest (actually quite hot) complimentary bread! The hot steam escaped as I broke apart the bread and for once, I didn't have to gut the bread because the crust was crisp enough to have a bite but not sharp enough to cut the roof of my mouth. - Roasted Maine Scallops: Hands down, BEST scallops we have ever had. Yes, we do have a running list because we both love seared scallops. These were perfectly seared at the top so that it was a light crisp and the whole dish was so cohesive paired the bed of cauliflower crumble, which was both tart and creamy. -Dry aged Creekstone Beef Tartare: We love a good tartare, and the wild mushrooms were such a nice touch (we love mushrooms). The penny bun biscuit that topped the beef tartare can be described as giant Chex mix rye chips, shaped like mushrooms. A playful and creative touch.-Roasted Long Island Duck: Hands down, BEST duck (aside from Hong Kong style duck) that we have ever had. The presentation of the duck was much like a thick slab of pork belly, and the cut had the juiciness and richness of pork belly, which we've never experienced with roasted duck. It was the most tender and succulent duck and we highly highly recommend it. The foie gras skewer was a surprising addition but paired nicely with the duck to yield a rich mouthful. -Braised Atlantic Halibut: Great dish that was overshadowed by the perfect duck. The halibut had a nice crispy sear on the top. We really enjoyed the chestnut gnocchi, which was smooth in consistency. The drink menu was filled with creative cocktails. My French Connection, served in a rustic tin moscow mule-like cup, was sweet and fragrant. I appreciated the candied ginger that topped the drink. The American Cereal Killer was more whiskey than I would like, since I was drawn to the ""cereal milk"" that it boasted. It was served in a glass version of the traditional single serve paper milk carton. Really cool glassware.Thank you so much to The Clocktower for a wonderful dining experience. We will be returning with friends in tow and we can't wait to see what you'll cook up next!",1,,1
15,Dorothy R.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",65,31,3,1.0,11/17/2018,"The service was terrible and the food was okay. This was a big disappointment and I was expecting so much more. Since the minute we were seated, it seemed the waiter didn't want us there. He didn't give me a menu, but gave one to my male partner which was odd. It could be a slip of the mind but for the prices and what the restaurant is trying to present, it didn't seem acceptable. We finished our appetizers and he gave us the dessert menu before we received our main dish ( which was the duck for two). Again like he wanted us to leave. At that point the manager or someone got involved. When the duck was finally served, it was completely cold. We returned the food and left. I can't believe we had to pay for this meal thankfully they didn't put the cold duck on the bill. It was a terrible experience. For the prices and vibe they are trying to pull off The staff should care about their patrons. The shake shack outside in the park would have been better service and hot food.",,,
16,Hung Yu C.,"Fremont, CA",53,59,100,5.0,12/15/2017,"Excellent service, variety of dishes, and pacing for dinner. We got the Black truffle risotto ($25),  Long Island Duck ($39), and Rack of Colorado lamb ($45). FYI - they do not serve the uni risotto anymore.Service was awesome and I can see why they're a Michelin star restaurant based on that alone (along with the bread but we'll get to that later). They bring out a full set of plate, fork, and knife for your starters. Then, when you're finished they help clean the table up a bit and bring you a new set. Also, they're pretty attentive when it comes to refilling your beverages and asking if everything's good. Nothing ever felt rushed or too slow. Pretty standard stuff for a high class restaurant, I know, but still isn't the norm at all restaurants. Highlight: THAT BREAD, SOMEBODY PLEASE GIVE ME SOME MORE! The fluffy bread is the perfect warm temperature along with that somehow solid from a glance until you grab a slice of almost melted salted butter. I could eat this forever and this comes from a guy who eats sushi all day every day. I would come here for that alone, but let's not take away from the rest of the meal.The risotto with truffles was pretty standard stuff although the grains were a bit hard. However, the main courses were great and each done two ways. The duck breast was very complex in flavor with that persimmon and shallot chutney + duck juice, then the foie gras skewer was a delight as well. The lamb wasn't as good as the duck breast, though I think it was because I was too full at that point. One way it was done was a mini lamb mint stew like pot and of course as a rack too.Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 9This is definitely on the higher end for meals to pay for, but it's well worth it. The main courses are deceptively filling, especially with how heavy most dishes are. That is definitely not a good thing, but it's British cooking - how can you not expect copious amounts of cream and butter in your dish. My dining companion and I were beyond full (time to unbuckle the belt) with only a starter and two main course dishes.",3,1,

It was served warm but honestly it's some of the best bread I've ever had. Chewy, flavorful.... the pieces were big but I think I had at least 2 if not 3. SO GOOD. I had the French Connection which tasted like a Moscow Mule. Their cocktails were interesting and I loved the presentation but the serial killer was a bit too strong for me. Interesting, but just way too strong. On to the food.... the beef tartare and scallops were amazing! The potatoes were a bit too cheesy/buttery for me. The asparagus with truffles was so unique and surprisingly pretty tasty. Duck was amazing - and so was the steak. Overall, great meal with great company. Highly recommended!",1,1,3

24,Sabina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,65,0,4.0,3/17/2018,"Came here for an anniversary dinner with my husband. Loved the ambiance, very different, did not feel like your typical New York restaurant which I appreciated. They welcomed us with a card wishing us happy anniversary as well as a toast. We started with the macaroni and cheese appetizer, typically served with ox cheek, but we asked for it vegetarian. It had this really delicious saltiness to it that I liked, could have been warmer but overall very good. I had the creekstone skirt steak medium rare, which was a little fatty, but flavorful and well cooked. My husband ordered the filet mignon, which was extremely tender and delicious. Both of our steaks came with frites, but we opted to substitute one of the sides for the potato gratin-- I cannot recommend this enough! Creamy and garlicky, the gratin was my favorite part of the meal.The only reason The Clocktower gets four stars instead of five is the dessert- the apple tarte tartine for two was underwhelming. Served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream on the side, it was not warm enough, and the tarte itself was somehow too sweet with average crust. Definitely check this place out, just skip the dessert!",,,
25,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",212,130,1433,5.0,7/24/2017,"First stop of my restaurant week summer 2017 adventure.  Me and a few friends had this place on our lists, so we decided to come as a group of 3 and tried one of everything. Firstly, I love the decor of the restaurant. It's very old fashioned I would say, a little dressy, but at the same time very comfortable. It's a great place to catch up with your friends and have a good meal and a chat. Also there's a pool table which is super cool.The bread: amazing! I would come back for this bread, no joke. Apparently there's a ""normal sized"" and ""restaurant week sized"", with the RW one obviously a bit smaller. Not sure why the waiter felt the need to point this out to us, but I guess it was good to know. I will say that the normal sized one was superior to the RW bread because of the size - the normal one had more soft bread inside, while the RW one was mostly the crunchy exterior. I love the soft part of the bread.Japanese eggplant: easily the weakest appetizer in my opinion, but I may be a bit biased because I hate eggplant, but my entire party was not fond of this dish. Somehow the Aubergine caviar component saved this dish from complete disaster, as it changed the taste of the eggplant to something more palatable (but they're both eggplants... weird huh).Heirloom tomato salad: I quite enjoyed this! The tomatoes were perfectly ripe and sweet, and I loved the crunch of the sliced cucumbers. The lemons added sourness, acidity, but also sweetness. Overall a very light and refreshing appetizer to start off the meal.Shellfish linguine: the STAR of the show. I was so surprised to see this offered as an appetizer, because it would no doubt be a entree at any other restaurant week location WITH an extra charge. The broth was absolutely delicious - rich and decadent, and I loved the foam component. The linguine was a perfect al dente, and they were VERY generous with the king crab. 10 stars for this- definitely get this if you're a fan of seafood!Pork belly- a bit disappointing for an entree, as it was a pretty tiny portion. The pork itself was quite juicy and tender, and super flavorful. While the taste was there, the portion size left a little to be desired.Maine cod- the fish was cooked to perfection, and it was the perfect amount of flakiness. The green olive tapenade took me by surprise, as I normally hate olives, but this was really delicious. The sauce did not overpower the delicate fish at all.Lancaster chicken- the biggest portion of the entrees, and super worth it in my opinion. You get a big piece of chicken breast, SKIN ON (YES), with some radishes, kohlrabi purée, and chicken gravy. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and super moist and flavorful. The skin was the perfect crispness, simply amazing! I wish they gave more gravy actually. The kohlrabi purée was a great addition, and it's a taste I've never experienced before. I am not a fan of the radishes however; they were super hard and quite bland.Strawberries and cream, rose sorbet: the stronger of the desserts. It's a cream base, with a strawberry mousse:jelly on top, with an olive oil cake and a scoop of rose sorbet. I loved the addition of the cake.Peach Eton mess- a literal mess of a dessert. It's a ring of cherry whipped cream (yuck), with some peach compote I wanna say, with a scoop of peach sorbet (I assume) with pieces of meringue sticking out. The flavor profile was overly sweet in my opinion- I would avoid this one.Overall a fantastic place to go for restaurant week - the dishes I recommend are the shellfish linguine, the chicken, and the rose sorbet. The shellfish linguine alone gives this restaurant week experience an extra star because of the amazing value. Highly highly recommend The Clocktower.",2,,

Also enjoyed the monkfish, the sauce is very tasty but the chunks of monkfish in the sauce were not the best for me. I would have preferred the whole fish to come out but I get it might not have looked as nice. What a nice place overall!",,,
29,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,3.0,12/19/2017,"3.5 Stars? We wanted to try it out after The Clocktower received a Michelin star.  Six of us came for dinner on a Sunday night with a reservation on open table. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the hotel and is surprisingly spacious and has kind of an old library feel with wooden paneled walls. The menu is al a carte, no tasting menu. We each got a cocktail to start as well as ended up sharing 3 bottles of wine between the 6 of us over dinner. We ordered 3 starters to share: the foie gras pudding which was okay, weird texture because almost too gelatin-like and mushy for foie. We also got the truffle Mac and cheese with pork belly which was delicious and the quail pie which was also so tasty and fried. For entrees we got the halibut, sea bass, duck, pork chop, burger, and lamb. My friend said the  sea bass was mediocre. The burger was huge and comes with crispy fries. My lamp was delicious as were the duck and pork chop. The halibut had sounded amazing with the oyster and roe but didn't end up being that outrageously great. My lamb came with a side of vegetables and various other meat parts of the lamb, which was tasty and very filling. We also shared the steamed vegetables (broccoli) and potatoes gratin sides for the table. The potatoes were really yummy, but overall these sides are very small for $8 each. We each literally got like maybe 1 or 1.5 pieces of broccoli. The reason for the major hit to the stars was the service. Waiters were friendly and knowledgeable but seemed to disappear and never come back. Our glasses stayed empty for over 10 minutes even though we still had wine left in our bottles. My friends first glass of champagne he ordered was completely flat (they gave him another when he told them.) When we wanted to order, it took a long time to do it. When we were handed dessert menus, some of us were in a rush and she still never brought the check. Took over 15 min for them to come back to actually let us order dessert that we almost said forget it. We ended up getting three cheeses which came with a nice bread and jam spread. To top it off, there are two private unisex restrooms for the entire restaurant, and both were found dirty whenever we went in. Toilet paper was all over the floor, and another guest had even thrown up IN THE SINK without any staff noticing and cleaning it up!! Overall pretty pricey too at about $35-50 per entree, $20-30 per starter, and $8 per side. Food was not the worst experience at all, but service really messed with the experience. We weren't trying to have a 3.5 hour Sunday night dinner, especially not even being a tasting menu.",3,,

The burger was one of the best I've had in the city--tender, flavorful, and on a tasty bun. The fries were also great and the aioli they had was very good.We also enjoyed several of their cocktails--all of which were very unique and had nice flavor profiles.Even though it came at the end of the meal, the bread was as good as advertised--so soft and just fresh out of the oven, with their creamy butter...mmmmmm.Overall, this place surpassed all expectations that I had and was really one of the best lunches I've had in the city. The service was super friendly and the food came out decently quick. Definitely a place worth checking out--just make sure you try that bread and a burger!",3,,1

Tip: there is an elevator; staircase is longer than I thought !Restaurant Week Winter '171) Lifechanging Salad. Endive, roasted chickpeas and other green stuff..I was like, let's be healthy, this'll probably taste ok. WHOA. Best salad ever! I don't get it how it was so good. It was perfectly crunchy and dressed but not too dressed like your grandma heading to bingo bc she swears they crank the ac, jeez we'll call them grams! But this salad was just right. 2) Braised Pork Belly with Apple Puree - The portion is typical for RW, but the execution was spot on. All of the surrounding vegetables and apples were perfectly seared, the apple sauce had a slight tartness (not too sweet) and the pork was seared and cut in beautiful small chunks. I usually hate the pork and apple combo but I liked this3) Dessert was a non-distinct toffee molasses cake. *Their house bread is phenomenal. Yea I said it. Come at me Wonder Bread. Movie room (see pic) is brilliantly adorned with pics of celebs of past, very cool. They also have three separate dining rooms, all with their own theme, uber coolThe Clocktower's regular menu might have you reaching for your checkbook applying for a loan and refinancing your house, so RW for $29 was a good tease. However, this was one of the rare RW encounters that left me wanting more. Every dish was meticulous and executed flawlessly. And who doesn't want some good ol' spotted dick. Yes. they have spotted dick. LOL, joking aside, The Clocktower convinced me and I will definitely be coming back for a special occasion. Can't wait!",18,7,9

BUT... if we're going to start the new year off right, I'm going to go for the 4, because the knock in star is something that can easily be improved. The upstairs dining space is nice; bar, 'pool room', dining area. The food was really good. We were a table of 3 and started with a few cocktails... the dill - so delicious, and the presentation was on point. Absolutely lovely. Order that foie gras... I could have eaten that and the bread, all night long. Main dishes, we got the pork chop & lamb chop - both good. Dessert was tasty & creative. The service - this is where the lack of star comes in. I would typically not ever mention service unless it was really bad - this was not bad service, however, you do have a Michelin Star and your service should reflect that. There were times that our water glasses stayed empty for 10-15 minutes, while waiters were walking by us. And twice, when the wait staff came around to fill the glasses, they would randomly fill them 1/4 of the way, 1/2 of the way, etc. Great - 3 sips & we're ready to wait another 10 minutes.

I love the ambience, the vibe, the cocktail menu. Service is phenomenal, staff is exceptional and standards are high. It is all about the guest here. Special occasion place for sure. The rumors about the bread are true: It's amazing! All I needed was a piece of cheese and that could've been my entree. Although the menu is quite adventurous and I wouldn't order the same thing again - I'm glad I tried it. Nothing is bad! Save room for dessert as 'hand on bible' the pink lady apple tart tatin is the best dessert I've ever had. Lastly, thank you for making my birthday dinner truly special.

41,Gwen G.,"New York, NY",52,188,1105,4.0,5/10/2017,"I love the ambiance of this place. Don't get lost the restaurant is not on the first floor, you will go up in the narrow spiral staircase leading up to 3rd floor, although if laziness hit you, you can use the elevator as well. It is a 3 room dining areas. The rooms are surrounded by antique dark mahogany, the old style doors are gorgeous, rooms are high ceiling, old gold frames with black and white photos hanging near the top crown moulding down below, the dark tables and chairs, the image is classic NYC.  The music is soothing 60's and 80's. Not loud. Very intimate ambiance.They have pre-fixed lunch which composed of a choice of an appetizer, an entree and a choice of a dessert for additional $6. They serve the bread right out of the oven, very warm and still smoking when you pick a piece paired with a soft butter. They bake their own bread. The crust is crispy and the bread is soft and moist. I ate almost half of the bread. My pre fixed selection is the salad, very surprising as it was overly substantial. The salad itself is a heavy lunch choice already. I did not finish it even after we shared it, so I elected to take the leftover home. Had a taste of the burger. Quite a big portion for a small person like me. It was perfectly done for my taste. It came with a juicy French fries which was not consumed hence another take home. The foie gras was creamy and it almost look like a compote to me. Very delicious.  The fish and chips wasn't oily and the mashed pea pairing intensified the smoothness of the fish. We preferred not ordering the additional dessert for our figure sake. Unexpectedly they serve a small sweet cake that goes well with my cappuccino. Very good experience and the lounge downstairs is very elegant and good for some photo shoot.",1,,
42,Luciana C.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",148,23,115,3.0,1/29/2018,"This year, the Clocktower was given its first Michelin star, so I decided to check it out. The space is absolutely gorgeous -- beautiful people, dark wood, a pool table, and chic architecture. We had a 2:15 reservation and were seated at 2:30. As it is still Restaurant Week, I decided to go with the  Restaurant Week Lunch menu for $29. The bread service is a delicious sourdough served warm so that when you rip it open, hot steam rises and melts the sea-salted butter right into the bread. My only critique of this is the fact that the bread itself is only slightly cut to indent where one should take a piece. The bread is not served with a knife so ripping oppen the crusty sourdough made quite the mess.I ordered the Kale, Sunchoke, and Salsify Salad with buttermilk and cider dressing as my first course. It was a nice portion, was well seasoned, and the dressing complimented the crispy sunchoke chips. We also ordered the Goat Cheese gnocchi with mushroom puree, black garlic, and lettuce sauce ($18). These gnocchis were light, pillowy, and just tasty. The lettuce sauce was poured table side and I enjoyed every bite. The goat cheese flavor was not prominent, so if your not a goat-cheese lover you would still enjoy these. If you are a goat cheese lover like myself, however, you will that a little more of that tang from goat cheese would have elevated this dish to a next level.For my entree I ordered the Roasted Atlantic Cod with braised baby leeks, hollandaise, and hazelnuts. The fish was succulent and very fresh and the leek was perfectly tender. The chive hollandaise was executed perfectly and had a wonderfully smooth moutful. The hazelnuts did not necessarily contribute to the dish and I wish they were salted a little more to bring out the mild flavors of the cod. The dessert here, however, is worth it's weight in gold. The Sweet Potato Pudding with chocolate sorbet and hazelnut crumble was topped with gold leaf and could have seriously brought me to tears. Think of the best sticky toffee pudding you've ever had with a crunchy-toffee like component from the hazelnut crunch, an earthy undertone from the sweet potato, and a bitter and velvety coldness from the high-quality dark chocolate sorbet. This dessert was utterly heavenly and I could have easily eaten 3 portions worth (please make your desserts bigger!!!). While I truly enjoyed my meal at the Clocktower, I just wanted to mention that their sodas are not free refills. I know you may chuckle that I even pointed this out, as the fine dining restaurant will cost so much to eat anyway but when the diner serves large portions of unlimited soda for $2, it is slightly disappointing when you have to pay $10 for two half-can portions of Diet Coke. Our meal was concluded with complimentary almond petit fours with a raspberry jelly which were a very nice bite. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at the Clocktower, but there are many other restaurants I would like to eat at before I'd return here.",,,

Presumably from the new Michelin addition. The somalier was the first of many waiters to offer service, and recommended a perfectly medium-bodied red that matched my palette. Following some light research of online reviews, my date and I opted for two appetizers to share and dessert. The beef tartare was the more hyped dish, but a massive disappointment; the meat, while well prepared, was totally overpowered by horseradish. I couldn't stomach more than two bites. Where the Kitchen redeemed themselves was with the scallops. Oh my, they were perfectly cooked and surrounded with comforting complementary flavors. For dessert, we tried the warm mango pudding, with banana passion fruit sorbet and shredded mango. So bomb. I keep thinking about the blend of opposite textures, temperatures, flavors - you had creamy, smooth, crunchy, cold, bitter, sweet...we were totally blown away. Also recommend the Tea!

It's not cheap, but worth the extra price compared to my hotel bar. Ambience:  was the reason I chose to come here, and it did not disappoint. The first floor was terrific blend of modern and classic. The spiral stairs take you to the second floor, where many rooms await. One has a pool table, all of them have a bevy of framed art and comfortable seating. Service:  very good. Kimberly (1st floor) and Natalie were great, and she had a team of staff that was great about waiting on us without being intrusive. Asparagus appetizer:  good - it's white asparagus, which may throw you off, but it tastes goodBread:  you could have the bread and biutter alone for dinner and would walk away a satisfied customer. The bread was artisanal, the butter had enough salt to bring a solid flavor. Skirt steak - I know this had a lot of butter and lime. Healthy?  Probably not. Tasty?  You bet. And the accompanying fries were enjoyed by all. Wine selection - they either had very cheap or very expensive. Not much in between.

49,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,4.0,2/5/2017,Enjoyed restaurant week lunch. Started with complimentary warm sourdough bread. 1st course was the duck sausage cassoulet creatively packed in a mustard jar. Hearty and tasty - could be someone's full meal (but not me of course)2nd course was the 6oz roasted chicken that had a subtle creamy dark green sauce tucked under the skin. Served atop lentils. Much lighter than the 1st course.3rd course was the sticky toffee pudding. Served ball-shaped and covered with hazelnut crumble. Accompanied by pear-ginger sorbet.Not my typical cuisine to try but I did enjoy the meal and experience.

The space itself is very cool - make sure to wander through all the rooms and check out the purple billiard room! Service is great and you definitely will not feel rushed at any point!Favorite appetizer was the quail frumenty. I had no idea what to expect but it was a small bowl of a risotto-like stew with pieces of delicate quail, a tiny scotch egg, and the wonderful flavor of wild mushrooms. Served with a mushroom tea on the side and a liver mousse. It was fantastic and perfect for a cold winter night!! Also delicious was the king crab and the marinated yellowtail.For entrees, both the duck and the lamb were sensational and cooked beautifully. The macaroni and cheese with slow cooked ox cheek and mushrooms was also delicious but unfortunately was over salted. So salty that my mother couldn't eat more than half the plate! I noticed my lamb was too salty, as well, but not as overpoweringly so as the mac and cheese. This was definitely disappointing.For dessert, don't miss the apple tarte tatin- it's HUGE and decadent doused in thick caramel sauce. The sticky toffee pudding was possibly the best sticky toffee I've ever had.All in all, a very delicious meal with great ambiance and service. Prices are steep so save for a special occasion!",3,1,1

57,Larry T.,"Manhattan, NY",453,5,0,5.0,8/15/2018,"I came on a Sunday, but was surprised that the place isn't more buzzing - the food totally justifies many more customers! Guess it's a hidden gem, since it's hard to know from the outside where the restaurant really is.This is my second time visiting (came here over a year ago), and enjoyed it just as much. It's a very unique concept done by two starr (pun intended) restaurateurs, and you can definitely feel the ""UK-ness"" of the place with the framed pictures of celebrities and the city covering the walls and the dark stained wood decor. The lobby is really something with the billiards table and bar while you wait for your friends or table. Food wise, we got the foie gras, sea urchin, duck breast, halibut, and chocolate dessert. The bread was quite nice, crusty on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside. It was a really rich dinner, but I finished every bite, and was particularly impressed with quality of the halibut (a fish that can easily be overcooked and dry). Standards have not dropped with age, evidently.",,,
58,Amanda P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",567,225,268,4.0,10/25/2016,My review for The Clocktower is long overdue but here it goes! My Aunt and Uncle took me and my here for my birthday dinner when I visited New York. We arrived a little early for our reservation and went straight to the bar. The bar was very lively filled with people mingling. I can't remember my drink but I remember that it was really pretty and it had an orchid for the garnish! When our table was ready we sat down and the waiter greeted us with the most amazing fresh bread. I could have eaten this crusty warm sourdough all night. I ordered the steak tartare to start and it was so delicious. It was served beautifully and it was the perfect way to start my meal. I ordered the crispy duck for my entree and they were very accommodating with my request to leave out the fennel that is usually an ingredient with the dish. We were all too full when the meal was over so we skipped dessert but the check came with a tin of cookies and caramels! Overall The Clocktower is very good. It gives off an old New York vibe. I have been able to experience a lot of the food scene in New York and it didn't quitemeasure up to other places with a similar price. I had a good experience and enjoyed my food here but 4/5 is my overall opinion of The Clocktower.,8,8,8

So worth scoping out, but not repeatedly.",10,9,7
61,Jenn Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",223,169,1452,4.0,7/24/2017,"Made a reservation for 12pm for Summer 2017 Restaurant Week. Overall, I think it was worth the $29 RW lunch price and it was a beautiful restaurant to eat in. The restaurant itself is located on the second floor of The Edison hotel, you just take the elevator up one floor. The décor and ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy, English and elegant. The pictures on Yelp do not do this beauty justice! Can I just say, their bread and butter is SOOOOO GOOD. It's fresh and hot out of the oven and their butter is so soft and creamy. I could eat that all day. & as far as I could tell, other tables loved it too because everyone seemed to have asked for more.Appetizers:    The Japanese eggplant with black sesame tahini, aubergine caviar, feta and cilantro made me feel very bougie. In simple words, this appetizer is a sesame seed coated eggplant with some black sesame sauce on the side. They somehow made a very mushy, messy, not the prettiest - looking vegetable taste, look and feel sophisticated.       The heirloom tomato salad, green strawberries, smoked Persian cucumber came with pickled lemons and tasted extremely refreshing and healthy. It was delicious, probably not worth the $29, but I'm sure its accounted for in the high quality of the ingredients.     The shellfish linguini, lemongrass king crab, lobster bisque was definitely worth the money. The portion was a lot bigger compared to the other two appetizers, there was a lot of crab and lobster chunks in there. They foamed the bisque which made the dish more bougie. It tasted great, nothing to complain about.Entrees:     The 36 hour braised pork belly, crispy polenta, roasted apricots, golden thyme was very tiny. I was kind of disappointed because the ""36 hour"" description makes it seem like the pork will melt in your mouth when you bite into it. But the meat was very lean for it being a pork belly, and I wasn't blown away by the taste or texture. It tasted like pulled pork without all the pulling. The crispy polenta was good though, it tasted like fried potatoes.     The Pan-roasted maine cod, mussels minestrone, green olive tapenade, purple artichokes was very aesthetically pretty, but I think the fish lacked some salt. I think this dish was better than the pork belly. There were more components to it, whereas the pork belly was just too boring.    The Lancaster chicken, kohlrabi puree, radishes, chicken gravy was surprisingly good. I think no one wanted to get the chicken because chicken sounds boring. But it was a really big slab of chicken and it was cooked beautifully. The meat was incredibly moist and the flavors were not overpowering. I thought the chicken was the most delicious out of all of the entrees.Desserts:    The strawberries and cream, rose sorbet looks like a crème brulee and was super yummy. It is vanilla crème with a layer of strawberry jam (which doesn't sound good together but trust me - its good) topped with a tiny tiny piece of olive oil cake (which doesn't sound good either but trust me again - its good) and fresh strawberries. Highly recommend.    The peach eton mess is a composite of meringue (that has been made into a chip/chocolate bark - type form) with whipped crème, jam, and a tiny tiny scoop of peach sorbet. The sorbet was delicious but everything else was a bit too sweet and not what I expected. I wasn't really crazy about the concept.. would not recommend.",,,

65,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,4.0,11/20/2017,"Despite living right by Madison Square Park and seeing the namesake of this restaurant countless times, it never occurred to me that there was anything inside the building boasting the bright clock at the top until last year, when someone mentioned they were eating here. I certainly knew the restaurant across from it (EMP), but despite being a Stephen Starr production (having lived in Philly, he is 'the guy' when it comes to defining a Philadelphia food mogul), we didn't make it over until we decided to go grab a nice yet casual dinner last Friday. While peak reservation times were occupied, grabbing a 6 PM reservation after Daylight Savings Time ends doesn't feel as late anymore. Getting up to the dining area once you enter the hotel isn't that hard - go to the back left and take the modern-looking version of a spiral suitcase up - and the folks at the front will get you seated in one of the many larger rooms that comprises the Clocktower. As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was back in London - perhaps because my last meal there was at Berners Tavern, which is also run by Jason Atherton. It definitely captures a similar vibe, with a huge smattering of photographs adorning the walls, but with wooden frames to the windows and rooms as opposed to the more ornate (and a tad over the top) finishes that Berners exhibits. With very high ceilings, it has a bigger feel to it and helps to diffuse the noise from all the diners - it can get a bit louder as it fills up. Service was pretty solid overall, with the only possible benefit(?) being that I was originally charged more than $40 less(!) than the receipt had said (I told them about it - no worries). I went with Dill or No Dill, which was a little too tart of a cocktail for my liking, but it was still a decent cocktail overall. The beer selection was a bit generic (they had crafts, but fairly accessible ones), and my wife's glass of wine was okay but nothing too special.Unsurprisingly, just like Berners, the food here was overall quite delicious, if not mind-blowingly so. We started off with a dozen oysters (2/3 East Coast, 1/3 Kumamotos)...in a switch from my usual preferences, I actually enjoyed the Blue Points and Wellfleet oysters more, largely due to the slightly milder finishes, whereas the Kumamotos were a bit larger than I preferred, diluting the impact of their typical creamy texture. The mignonette was solid, and while the small, penny-sized slices of wild boar sausage were good, I'm not sure what business they had being served as an accompaniment to shellfish. The steak tartare was more interesting, as it had a very earthy flavor - enhanced by the mushrooms - that gave it a bit more of an interesting texture. That said, I felt the additional toppings were distracting, and I didn't get the impression that the steak itself was the best cut of raw beef one could use. Once we moved on to the entrees, though, it was a real treat. My wife's duck was cooked perfectly - a proper medium-rare, where the meat is succulent and juicy but still firm to the bite without being chewy. I went with the braised halibut served in a truffle sauce that not only had a strong flavor but was also thick - making it a great contrast against the lightly grilled but flaky halibut meat. Usually seafood is treated as a lighter dish, but I really enjoyed the very savory approach to the fish. We finished up sharing a cheese plate - not the largest selection in the world, but I did enjoy the 2 imported UK cheeses on the menu, particularly the mild hard cheese from Lincolnshire.Overall, I did enjoy the meal here, and I would probably come back again. It's got a decent price point for NYC, but it's not cheap (although cheaper than some other similarly Michelin-starred spots). That said, the food is pretty good on balance, and I do enjoy the fact that I felt like I was across the pond while eating here, even if Madison Square Park was just outside the building.",2,,

The BM was alright. Nothing special. My burger was good. It was a good sized burger with cheese and bacon. My friends ordered the lobster omelette and even though there was good lobster to egg ratio, they couldn't escape the consensus that it was bland and boring. The avocado toast was ok. Hubster's fish n chips were good. Service was on the stuffy side. Our passive aggressive waiter kept coming back to ask if we wanted anything else while we were finishing up even though it wasn't busy. When we said NO, he came back and took one item every few minutes. We were kinda annoyed at the passive aggressive-ness so a point taken off for that.",,,

This sounds funny but the tables are tiny, and can hardly fit our food. Because the chef loves to use gigantic presentation plate! So during the dinner, we spent a lot of time moving our plates around and try to be comfortable. And the server/busser didn't attempt to help at all. They just put everything on the table and leave us struggling on our own. Such a waste on the good food. Also, the manager was extremely arrogant, when we complained about the the service.

We had a new addition to my team at the office and I planned a welcome lunch at one of our go-to's. Luckily my coworker mentioned it was restaurant week and that Clocktower had been on his list. One quick call later, we were on our way.The interior and decor is on point. You walk through the lobby of the Edition hotel, up a winding staircase that feels like a portal into another world, and you end up in a fancy, British-style dining room adorned floor to ceiling with framed portraits and scenes from the streets of London.Service was okay. It took a while for us to get the attention of anyone, and I liked the touch of new silverware every course. However, the forks and knives were just arbitrarily placed in front of each person and wasn't neat looking at all. If you're going to do something special, go all the way; halfway is just messy. They were very accommodating when we needed to dash out earlier than expected and our dessert and check was expedited.For food, our table covered every single choice on the menu. I went for the shellfish ravioli, pork belly, and toffee bread pudding. The ravioli was quite tasty, and I loved the sauce they poured over it. My pork belly was cooked very well, which made the dish. The sides, including the pear and the charred fennel, were pretty forgettable and I wished they used a different starch with the dish. The dessert was a little sweet for my tastes, and I thought the toffee was a bit too hard in bigger chunks. It went well with coffee though and the sorbet helped cut through the density of the pudding (but not the sweetness; it was equally sweet if not even sweeter).If you want a bigger portion, the kale salad is HUGE. Like overflowing from the bowl huge. At any other places, add a protein and you've got a meal. The greens were very fresh and I loved how well they dressed it. The deep fried sunchokes added a nice crunch. The cod was a bit undercooked for my coworker, and I didn't love the sauce. My other coworker commented that his chicken was way too salty. All in all, it's a good choice for a restaurant week lunch.",1,1,4

We sat at the gold bar and had a tough time getting the bartender's attention to place an order and we were rushed because I had a flight to catch. I requested a margarita not on the menu. Most of the cocktails didn't have tequila and that's what I wanted. Also, all the cocktails were ~$16 so I assumed mine was the same. NO ONE asked what kind of tequila I wanted, then just hit me with an $18 PER DRINK. I know it's New York but come on. Some warning would be mice-- would have gotten a cheaper tequila.  When it came time to close the tab, the bartender failed to listen when I asked him not to automatically charge the card used to open the tab. Total nightmare with everyone having to Venmo me. On top of all that, the clientele attracted to this spot had gone downhill greatly. Used to be young chic attractive and unfortunately not anymore. A couple was seated next to us and they were hell bent on harassing us, screaming loudly and hurling insults toward everyone at the bar.

The Clocktower is a beautiful establishment on top of a captivating spiral staircase with walls lined with gold frames in the dining room, bar room, billiard room, etc. My boyfriend and I arrived half an hour early since we didn't want to carry a bouquet of balloons around town and were able to play a few games in their classic billiard room. They don't allow balloons in their dining room, but the manager made an exception to let us have them at our table until the birthday girl showed up. We checked them in after. Totally understandable for this type of dining ambiance (especially since they were Spongebob). Their drinks were delicious and fun. They made me contemplate ""dill or no dill"", ""give peas a chance"", and nobody can say no to cheerios (milk). After drinks were served, we were blessed with warm, sourdough and creamy butter. More restaurants need to serve warm bread. We ordered the steak tartare and scallops to share, along with two orders of the mac & cheese as appetizers. The chips with the steak tartare were basically pork rinds - amazing! The mac & cheese was addicting, the ox cheeks were incredibly soft. The scallops were just OK as well as the halibut entree. I was not a fan of the cucumbers and the chartreuse was very faint. The duck entree was fantastic however, with the skewer of sweetbread and chanterelles being a highlight. I would come back to have that and maybe the dover sole if my wallet is feeling heavy.We had brought a cake for after the meal and didn't intend on it being a surprise, but after some confusing yet hilarious signaling with one of the servers, it was a perfect surprise.Also, I totally forgot to ask where the bar carts are from, but would love one of those for my living room (please advise if anyone can answer this!).",3,2,2

81,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,5.0,12/27/2016,"An amazing time and experience at The Clocktower, which went much better than anticipated. I made a reservation a month before for my boyfriend's birthday, and I was so glad I made the choice of Clocktower. The food was absolutely delicious, atmosphere was perfect for a celebratory occasion, and service was attentive and unpretentious. Five stars/bonus point that my boyfriend had a really great time and very much enjoyed his birthday dinner, and who doesn't want to try to impress their loved one on their birthday.For those of you like myself who have limited exposure with a very basic understanding of British food, this is a place to try. Or rather, it is a must try. The menu looked outstanding upon reading, but note it all comes at a bit of a steep but all worth it price. I wanted to find a place that was somewhat fancy but without the necessites of a particular dress code. You can come and be yourself. It borders between casual but high end enough for any special occasion. There are three rooms plus the main bar. We sat in the middle room, or what I call the Hollywood room, with framed pictures upon pictures of well known celebrities. The lighting is nice and dim at night for what felt like a mostly intimate but comfortably spacious space for two people to converse. Meanwhile, food and drink -- I personally thought A-mazing. Cocktails are a worthwhile try ($16), all of which were expert mixtures and a lovely complement to our meals. Give Peas A Chance was our favorite of the night, a mixture of Bombay gin, Yellow chartreuse, Salted pea cordial, Lemon juice, Fresh mint, Butterfly absinthe, and Egg white. The Los Pollos Hermanos (ode to Breaking Bad perhaps) was refreshing as well. We ordered some appetizers -- 1/2 doz bucket of oysters bits and bobs and quail frumenty scotch egg with wild mushrooms, tea, liver parfait. For main, I had the Colorado lamb (spiced pistachio crust, mixed grains, caramelized yogurt, artichokes). My bf had the Berkshire pork chop (piccalilli, black pudding, crackling, apple sauce). We loved our dishes. I tried some of his pork chop, which was succulent and tender. My lamb chop was real tender and slid easily right off the bone. I would get this again, but I would also be curious to try one of their seafood dishes, like the sole or halibut. We ended our meals with a bit of dessert, but 'a bit' might be an understatement. The Pink Lady apple tarte tatin for two, Madagascar vanilla ice cream could have fed 4 people easily. But I would go for this in a heartbeat again. It was a truly sweet end to our meal. Overall, a really pleasant experience at The Clocktower and a successful birthday dinner for the two of us. I would recommend it for a special occasion, if you are looking for this sort of experience/food. It's not over the top but fancy enough to satisfy a more celebratory occasion. Otherwise, I would definitely return for brunch or lunch and see their offerings during the day. The dinner was exceptional, and I was very happy with The Clocktower in its entirety. Hopefully your experience will speak the same on your first visit because I highly recommend.",26,14,24

84,Simon L.,"Somerville, MA",726,831,1534,4.0,2/7/2016,"The second floor setting accessed by the elevator of a tony downtown hotel makes Clocktower a spot worth reserving. A London bred, Michelin starred chef has brought his show to NYC and it is an excellent show. The exceptional hamburger ($25) is a hearty patty made of dry aged blend beef. There is sharp cheddar draped and melted onto the burger. The Churchill sauce is a mayo ketchup  mix that pairs well with the hot red pepper pickle slices, lettuce and red onion. The patty is seasoned well and charred with nicely. The temperature is precisely medium rare. Juices flow freely and the beef stands up and through the toppings. This is a well balanced tower of meat, bread and condiments. Although the brioche style bun appears lofty and large, it holds the sandwich and its' juices in a neat package. An order of tuna tataki ($18) involves Yuzu sauce and pickled English cucumbers, whipped avocado, sesame seeds and baby radish. Seared quickly these tiny roulettes of tuna are rich and tender. Buttery. Drizzled with olive oil. The plate is airy and simply perfect in its presentation and combination of flavors. Mario Battali sat next to us with a large party. Always a good omen. The Saturday lunch service is professional and well timed. The drinks are mixed with exactitude.The atmosphere is clubby - a bar sits in one room connected to the dinning room via pool room.

We checked in and were just standing there, the host didn't offer for us to wait at the bar, take our coats, offer a drink or to be seated while we await our friends. We walked downstairs on our own to wait at the lounge. After we were seated for dinner, the waiter asked what kind of water we wanted. I think he asked but never listened. They poured everyone the same Perrier water, after 2 of us asked for still water. Then they screwed up the entrees by bringing the wrong mealTo the wrong person.

One of our guests actually got sick from the meat.The seafood tower was embarrassing for $125. We needed to order more seafood to ensure our 6 guests had a taste of everything.

The drinks service was great as well.What fell short for me was the burger. And before you read on, know that I ordered it well done, which could have taken away from it's glory. That being said, I did not love the flavors that went into this creation. Something about the smokey bacon, or the bread that was a little too toasted, or the coleslaw that it comes with- did not hit the spot.

A substantially sized golden art piece arrived.  The waiter gave us the option to combine the coco gelato now or if we preferred it on the side.  The pistachio and chocolate consummation resulted in magical delirium.  Aahhh still thinking about it.Wait staff was top notch.",3,1,

We were excited to try this restaurant since we heard it had the same owner as our other favorite restaurants, Buddakan and Morimoto. We started with the poached then smoked salmon and big eye tuna tataki appetizers. Both of these apps were great but the salmon dish is the reason why I might have to come back to The Clocktower! Really exceptional.Then I had the scallops app for my main dish since I wasn't very hungry and my boyfriend got the North African spiced Colorado lamb. Both of these dishes were tasty but so small. The small portions was a theme the entire night, which is why I had to deduct one star.For dessert we had the chocolate cremeux which reminded me of a ferrero rocher- delicious! I definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you're in the area. The plating could not be more beautiful.

Drawings on the wall with candles lightened on the table and fireplace. However the music was fast-paced and people around were chatting pretty casually.Food was for sure, great. We started with oyster platter and beef tartare, followed by lamp chop and grilled duck, finished with a apple tart for two to share. Beef tartare was absolutely delicious, accompanied by the bone marrow and soured artichoke. Tart was indeed even too large to share; however I do recommend dip it into the vanilla ice cream, fantastic!",5,2,4

The decor is dark and masculine with artistic photographs of celebrities on the wall. The bar area is lively and a destination itself. The crowd is well dressed with most men in blazers and stylish women. The menu has a good mix of meats and fish choices.  There is even a quality burger on the menu if you can't decide. We had the sea bass and gratin potatoes, which was excellent. The scallops as a starter was a good start.  The duck was a good main course.  The steaks looked good but we will save that for another visit.  Drinks such as the French connection was a standout. Service was good and attentive.  At times we felt somewhat rushed when the food was announced. The restaurant was busy and the staff was in a hurry.  I must mention the bread was excellent and butter was at a good temperature. I hate butter that's too cold.  If you're looking for a meal in trendy restaurant with good meats the Clocktower is a good choice.",1,,

First off, the ambiance is great-- The restaurant is beautiful and has an ""old school New York City"" feel. The sommelier came to our table right away and was charming and informative.Onto the food-- We got the beef tartare and the pressed chicken/foi gras to start. I love both beef tartare and foi gras generally speaking. With that said, the starters were the biggest miss for me. I didn't love the beef tartare and I wasn't expecting the foi gras appetizer to be a terrine. If I had know that, I wouldn't have ordered it-- I didn't think it was that great. BUT the bread-- the sourdough bread they bring out is amazing.For the entrees, we ordered the Duck and the Bone in 40 day dry aged prime NY strip. Both were very good. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but it was a very good steak and I thought the duck was delicious. For dessert, we got the sticky toffee pudding-- very small, but good.If I were to go back, I would try other starters, but really enjoyed the entrees and the wine.",1,,2

Nice touch.For starters we had  the scallops and the steak tartar which were both great but the Pigeon and foie gras pie might be trying a little to hard .For entrée I ordered the  spiced Colorado lamb . Dam you lamb in America why is it such a challenge . At $ 43 for 2 small lamb chops you better be good . Sadly they were a little chewy and tasted more fatty than spiced . Now the Dry Aged burger, be a bit rude not to after reading the  amazing reviews. Ordered medium rare but sadly it was served well done .Of course it was whisked away with an apology and then served again to perfection but to add insult  they even charged me for new fries even though I sent them away and they were given to another table next to us .The dessert of strawberries and cream is must , oh and those little berries are frozen blackberries broken down to mini berries . 100% my highlight of the meal .Still I see this place being a winner as its a much a scene as it is a restaurant .Oh don't be put off if you call up for a reservation  and cant get one , I went straight on open table and got it after a negative telephone conversation with someone that assured me there wasn't any available .I will be back even if its for a cheeky burger and a cereal killer !",8,4,1

The pool room next to the dining area is a nice plus as it is free to play. Three rounds of pool post lunch was a nice addition. The only negative is It is a bit hard to find (have to climb the winding staircase which doesn't have a sign).The sourdough bread to start (free) was delicious. It comes to the table still warm with soft butter. I had the burger which was solid - not the best burger I have ever had but still worth the money.

The only reason for 4/5 stars is because, relative to other similar restaurants, this was good but not necessarily a stand-out.1. Food: let's start with the basics. The bread is so good! It's a round sourdough that is piping hot, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Apparently the burgers are famous here based on other Yelp reviews; one person in my party tried it and pronounced it as a ""superior burger"" and I had a delicious duck l'orange that was perfectly done, with crispy skin and tender duck meat. They serve complimentary cookies and sweets when they deliver the cheque, too.2. Drinks: I had two of their red wines - good selection, good temperature. Also tried one of their cocktails, the American Cereal Killer (michter's bourbon, Cheerios milk, Madagascan vanilla syrup, and angostura bitter) which was pretty strong and served to me in a milk jug.3. Vibe: upscale, relaxed, elegant. The rooms are filled with paintings, and near the bar area is an open room with a billiards table.

The bread was hot, fluffy, and crisp! My party of two had two orders of the bread! We started off with two appetizers: split pea risotto and the tuna. I'm not usually a fan of risotto, but this one was so flavorful and not too heavy. The tuna was also fresh and the shiso and sauce on top complemented the dish well. For the mains, we got the halibut and the burger. The halibut was recommended by the waitstaff and didn't fail to disappoint. The burger was melt in your mouth juicy, and also came with large block fries which were delicious. Everything was well seasoned and so flavorful! We shared the pistachio soufflé for dessert.

I ordered the English breakfast and my friend the eggs Benedict. The food, which came out promptly was simple and fresh. The sausage and pork belly were perfectly cooked and the eggs were just the way I like them. My only complaint was that the tomato was a bit soggy.

From the pictures it looked elegant and we also assumed the pool table would be totally open in the middle of a Saturday afternoon.We met the bartender and (naturally) challenged him to fashion us two drinks with Bourbon and Gin. I received an incredible orange-coffee-bourbon cocktail, and my boyfriend received a delicious citrus-y Gin creation. After this we were blown away and proceeded to challenge him over and over (and over, whoops). Not only did we enjoy beautiful cocktails, and a cool chalice cup that my boyfriend said made him feel like a king, but we also got our pool fix in! The pool room has one table and is in between the dining room and the bar. The perfect distance from our next cocktail :)Beware of the pool sticks however. They are shorter than normal ones!

We had the Boston Lobster cocktail, Mac and cheese, scallops, pork chop, and halibut.  The Boston cocktail lobster and Mac and cheese were good...not amazing but good.  The Mac and cheese was nothing special.  The gnocchi with halibut tasted so strongly of truffle oil that my wife couldn't eat it.  It didn't mention on the menu it had truffle oil. (also wasn't real truffles it was fake truffle oil)  My pork chop was very sweet and tasted very strongly of clove.  I don't like clove at all.  Also, wasn't mentioned on the menu.  That being said, vodka soda was dammed good. Although I had to ask every time for another. Basically, the service and food were not worth the price.  Skip this place.  Not worth it on any level.",,,
119,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1404,1149,1019,4.0,8/5/2017,"Gosh, this place is unique and wonderful. Was visiting friends and they suggested we come here after dinner. The feel of this bar is just so different, there is a gorgeous pool room off the bar area, the decor is just fascinating to look at. The actual bar area is fairly small, semi-circle shaped and when we arrived on a Friday night around 9:30, we had the entire place to ourselves. I think craft cocktails are fantastic, I personally do not drink them because I cannot keep track of how much I am drinking. Well that went out the window this night because our friend who brought us here insisted we do cocktails. The glassware the drinks came in were hilarious, my friend ordered some sort of milk based drink, which came in a glass like see through milk carton. I had some refreshing vodka drink that went down far to easily and followed up with a mezcal drink garnished with a flower that went down even easier and was probably the best tasting cocktail I've ever had, smoky from the mezcal but perfectly balanced. My boyfriend got a coffee based cocktail, highly recommend, I mean everything was inventive and delicious, and with a price. Worth it though, however the rest of the night was interesting so drink slowly. I guess the place will close when people start to leave so they were closing up around 10:45 ish. I likely never would have known about this great spot if my friend hadn't brought us here, must check it out.",1,1,3

A couple of suggestions: talk to the Sommelier and tell him what you like. You wont't be disappointed.I asked the waiter about the burger and he described it as ""outstanding.""

Heard The Clocktower inside was great for Brunch.The restaurant feels like an old library. Huge fireplace and Billiard table. Dark & Cozy.We were seated at a lovely table for two. The wait staff could certainly be better, they seemed to stumble over one another. Maybe trying to work out kinks of a new place. The Clocktower is trying to give you an Old World feel... Nice menu.We started with bottled water, coffee & tea served in silver pots and a bowl of sugar cubes. Sweet I ordered the Avacado Smash on Toast with Poached Egg. Really nice! Side of roasted potatoes that were quite yummy.Hubby had their French Toast... Bread was overly thick. Not much flavor  and accompanied with a beaker of ordinary syrup. No special attention made here! Quiet Brunch. Very Quiet... In a word, The Clocktower, just.... OK",2,,2
131,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",193,212,4275,5.0,2/13/2016,"My wife and I came here for an early Valentine's Day date. We chomped though a good deal of food, so I'll just get right to it.The decor here is incredible. It's elegant yet old fashioned-inspired. High ceilings, big fireplace, wide-planked dark wood floors, dark wainscoting, etc.The bar is a destination in itself, and they make some really unique cocktails that utilize ingredients you never expect to see in a drink, like chicken stock and pea puree.Table bread is a nice warm and toasty loaf that's served with a soft, freshly salted whipped butter.We started with a dashi cured smoked salmon appetizer that was topped with puffed rice, greens and a soft boiled quail egg.This had a bright and acidic pop to it. A great way to start the meal.Our next course was a burger, which we shared.This this was pretty much perfect. By far, this was the best thing we ate here.It was seared to a nice crisp on the outside, and a beautiful medium rare on the inside.On top was lettuce, bacon, red onion, pickle, cheddar cheese and special sauce. Nothing too fancy - just really good quality shit. The bun was toasted and warm on the outside but soft like a potato roll on the inside. Just the right balance.The fries were thick, long and hand-cut - like John Bobbitt's dick - only crunchy on the outside and soft inside, like mashed potatoes. They could have used a little bit more seasoning or salt, but they were so perfectly cooked that I didn't mind.Our awesome waiter Jake, who had really great suggestions on drinks and food items, cleared the table and presented us with these kickass plates as we awaited out main course.For our main course we ordered the cote de boeuf for two, which was a 40oz bone-in rib eye that came with gratin potatoes (two servings), a green bean salad, and bone marrow jus.This thing was beautiful. The sear on the outside was like a salty and crisp meat bark, and the aroma was out of this world. It was dressed up with some lightly roasted garlic cloves and thyme.As you can see, the meat was cooked to a gorgeous pink medium rare, and every bite was tender and juicy. The fat was so soft and mushy too - completely edible. Nine out of ten!I wasn't much of a fan of the bone marrow jus. For some reason it wasn't working for me in the flavor department, but it did smell wonderful.The potatoes were pretty good. With gratin style potatoes, I always find myself wishing that the chef had done several thinner crisped preparations and then layered them before serving, that way there is some more of that delicious top crunchy texture as you work your way down into the middle.The green bean salad was nothing to scoff at. It was topped with truffle and tossed with foie gras! This thing was so earthy from the truffles, the truffle oil, the toasted hazelnuts and the foie that it was almost like having another meat course.By time dessert rolled around we were pretty full, so we just shared this chocolate custard item with a cocktail that was made from cheerios milk and bourbon called ""The American Seriel Killer.""To our surprise, Jake later brought over a tin of shortbread, brittle and English toffee, along with a special dessert plate of grapefruit sorbet since he learned that we were celebrating a special occasion. Killer service here.I highly recommend this place. At $25 the burger may seem a bit steep at first, but it's a half pound of some of the best eating you'll ever have, and it also comes with those delicious fries. Similarly, at $135 the steak for two may seem steep, but you get three sides with it, and I guarantee you will go home full and satisfied.",2,2,1

136,Brady B.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",18,62,48,5.0,11/18/2015,"Went on 11/15. Hot damn. This is definitely a destination for...essentially 1 star Michelin dining (fine dining at a reasonable price). Possibly one of the best places I've been all year.First off, do not mistake the downstairs bar for the Clocktower's bar, at your peril. The downstairs bar is, I believe, called Edition. I accidentally thought it was the Clocktower bar, due to the similar unique names of the drinks, but once the bartender had to look at a book to figure out how to make the FIRST cocktail listed, I knew there was something wrong.The Clocktower bar is upstairs, adjoining the restaurant. The cocktails are clever (particularly the Cereal Killer, using momo milk-style cereal milk and bourbon), and the non-alcoholic ones (like the Ps and Qs) are interesting enough to satisfy your loser teetotaling friend (kidding, buddy!). May want to consider sticking with cocktails for your meal, because there were less than 10 or so wines under $100, which is an issue.The restaurant arrangements are going to be my only major quibble. We definitely got seated in ""dammit this is a three top taking up a four top"" zone, right in front of the fireplace. Meaning it was HOT. Very hot. Sweaty hot. I get the need to jam as many tables as possible, but c'mon.Oysters - definitely east coast oysters, though they weren't identified by name. Slightly overpriced, but large, juicy, and perfect for slurping while making eyes at your date...or at your two married companions where they have like, ""a problem"" with you wearing a nametag that says ""Third Wheel"" on it.Lobster on Half Shell - perfectly cooked cold lobster, apples, fennel, little touch of some emulsion, perfect seasoning. Gonna go ahead and say a must order.Risotto - I'm not going to lie, I think I missed out a bit given the uni is no longer on the risotto menu (I get it, but still). The risotto was highly flavorful, though a tad overcooked (not toothsome and soupy like I prefer), but that was a minor issue. The fried sweetbreads were fantastic, and as usual, an utter surprise to the non-organ folks who think they're eating sublime chicken nuggest. This is why you need Third Wheel. He'll show you his thymus gland.Pigeon Pie - I think the restaurant misses out on not making this an entree. It should be three times the size, with a full lobe of foie and a full filet of game bird. It's hard to discern the flavors because it's so small, and I would 100% order an entree-size of this. It's game bird, crust, and foie. The only thing anyone could want is more.Duck A l'Orange - Intense portion of perfectly cooked duck, thick demi glace orange coating that means Third Wheel is going to lick your plate clean. Second only to Le Philosophe in recent memory.Roast - The other sign, besides the pigeon, the the chef is British. It's a well-cooked roast, with a delightful yorkshire pudding, and then a large pile of throwaway cabbage (eat only the crispy outer coating). The box around this item makes me feel like this is a very cheap moneymaker for the restaurant. Skip. Instead, getBurger - Holy crap, bruh, this burger is unctuous as FAAAAHCK. Edges out Bowery Meat for best new high end burger. Mineral finish, cheddar so sharp I'd use it to cut my enemies, powerful kick of bacon, and I don't know what Churchill sauce is, but I bet it would sober Churchill up immediately. Get this. Get two.Pistachio Souffle - intense as F souffle, double the size of the ramekin, with a strong eggy component that most places cook right out of the dish. Fantastic.Concord Grape and Goat Cheese gelato - Get this if you want super strong flavors. I'd have a spoonful goat cheese ice cream every night before bed. I'm going to buy a goat for this purpose, and also so I can bring it along instead of being Third Wheel next time.Petit Fours are nothing special (some cookies, some brittle), but totally enjoyable and a nice bonus.I can see this being a big hit for the corporate Eleven Madison Park spillover lunch crowd, but it's definitely a date spot, a Mom's birthday spot, and, you know it, an ideal place to bring your Third Wheel.",10,13,7

American Cereal Killer (Michter's, Cheerios Milk, Madagascan Vanilla syrup and bitters) is unlike any cocktail ever had, and that doesn't even include the fact that it's served in a glass milk carton.  Great presentation and tastes even better.Meal was impeccable. For starters, wife and I split the poached and smoked salmon and the mac 'n cheese.  Salmon was a beautiful piece of fish. Great smokiness paired perfectly with grapes, walnut and celeriac.  Mac 'n cheese was the most elevated Mac 'n cheese you'll find. Thick cut pasta, creamy cheese, mushrooms and ox cheek. Delish. Oh, and the IPA Beer bread - insanely good.For mains, we split the venison and the duck. Can't say I eat venison often, but this was far and away the best I've had. Perfectly cooked. The spiced plum sauce was delicious, and all paired perfectly with the cabbage and carrots. The granola balls were a tad tough on the teeth, but once cracked open, added another layer of texture and complexity to the dish.  The duck was also perfectly cooked and the sauce l'orange, turnips, fennel and endive all came together wonderfully.For dessert, had the chocolate mousse.

So do ask for directions when you are in there. I check out the restaurant for restaurant week (summer 17'); for my pick I had the shellfish  linguini, the main cod, and the peach eton. The shellfish linguini was one of the best appetizer as if it were served in a different restaurant, the appetizer can be an entre by it self.

155,Hamilton Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,51,2,4.0,12/9/2016,"Clocktower was a pretty good experience and my rating is closer to 4.5 stars than 5. I tried the American Cereal Killer cocktail which was interesting but I didn't love. It wasn't that far from milk with a shot of bourbon was pretty expensive.I really didn't enjoy the pressed chicken appetizer. The pickled veggies on the side I thought were too hard and too sour. They were likely there to help cut the richness of the foie, but I ended up just avoiding them. It came with garlic bread and the chicken also had cobnuts so texture wise there was too much hard and crunchy. The main however was phenomenal. I had the cote de boeuf and shared with one other person and it was definitely more than enough food. Perfect medium rare with a bone marrow gravy that was incredibly decadent. The greenbeans were cooked to perfection too though I'm not sure the foie gras cubes tossed in brought anything to the dish. I love gratin as well so that was a great addition.I ended the meal with the pistachio souffle and it was definitely worth the wait. Relatively soft and light with the chocolate ice cream melting down the center it was a great finisher that I would love to have again.Service was on point though the lay out of the restaurant is a bit labyrinthine. Multiple people finishing their meals at the same time is a bit annoying though as the coat check is behind the maitre'd which is in between a bunch of fairly narrow hallways.",,,
156,Mark M.,"Roslyn, NY",37,93,155,5.0,9/12/2015,"So, I read a lot of reviews and had somewhat high expectations going in, so already that is a recipe for disappointment. But none the less, I was still blown away.  This is only my second 5 star rating for a restaurant. The restaurant is on the second floor above the lobby of the hip Edition Hotel, so we entered the building to a cool lobby bar scene before heading up the spiral staircase to the restaurant. The second floor is the former executive floor for the Metropolitan CEO back from the Mad Med era with beautiful dark wood detail and fireplaces in several rooms, all with hundreds of nouveau framed photographs to bring it to modern hip.    Our night started with a few signature drinks at the bar. I had the Cold Fashioned which was an interesting adaptation of an old fashioned with coffee and really good. My wife and friend had the Cobblerplolitan, which tasted nothing like a traditional Cosmo, but was delish.  We were seated and given the obligatory bread, and while the bread was good ( way better than average)  the butter was like a drug.  I could not get enough.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers and main courses and every dish delivered.  Of course we tried tar tar, how could we not, and as reported, it was excellent. For a main, I had the lamb chops which were tender and had an excellent sauce.  My buddy got the burger ( I was a little jealous) and reported it was one on the best 5 burgers he had ever had.  I got a taste of the fries, and despite some negative reviews, we all thought they were great.  Moving on to desert, we ordered the apple tarte tatin and it was amazing.  We were all served an individual portion of vanilla ice cream to go along.  There was not a bite left, I made sure of that.  And then, of course, the cookies that were served at the end. This is a nice touch, even if they are just ok, but the shortbread cookies melted in your mouth....and the caramel / toffee candies with sea salt ( I am guessing) were amazing.   And finally, not that some will think it is s big deal, the coffee was amazing, even for a Starbucks snob like me.  So often restaurants fail here and at such a critical part of the meal. As far as service goes, it does not get much better.  Bryn, who is also a sommelier in training, was engaging and at our beckon call, and made some excellent recommendations.  As a plus, we were by chance seated next to an A-list celeb, so that put a little icing on an already legendary night.  I have to come back, if for nothing else, to try that burger.  It is a bit pricy, especially the cocktails, but you are getting what you pay for, unlike so many overpriced average hip but not-so-hip places. Come and enjoy!!!!",1,,
157,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,7/28/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10British cuisine has always been neglected in the gastronomic world, falling way behind French, Spanish and Italian counterparts in the rankings of European cuisine. I've never heard about people going to London for culinary journey, and I haven't seen any place in NYC that really shows what British cuisine is all about. That changed recently when acclaimed English chef Jason Atherton formed a partnership with a famed restrauteur Stephen Starr to open The Clocktower inside the chic Edition hotel. I was overall very pleased with the dining experience on a recent Friday night. There is nothing fussy about the food at The Clocktower. They seem somewhat predictable if you just skim through the menu. The level of execution and balance of flavor and texture of most dishes, however, were on a very high level. I could eat lobster with shaved fennel, mussel and apple salad every day for my meal. Lobster was perfectly cooked with crunchy texture to my delight, and the unexpected combination with apple salad worked quite nicely. While I was expecting a bit more spice from North African spiced Colorado lamb, it still was a perfectly cooked lamb dish that wasn't overpowering in seasoning to my liking. Some dishes fell somewhat flat. I was puzzled why uni risotto with peekytoe crab tasted a bit on the sour side, and thought it would've been a perfect dish if not for that sour seasoning. Braised halibut was perfectly cooked and created intense flavor with pink peppercorn sauce. I did like the spicy kick from the sauce, but felt the seasoning could've still been toned down a bit. Both desserts that I tried, on the other hand, were marvelous. I've never had pistachio-flavored soufflé before, and the combination of the soufflé with chocolate ice cream was pure bliss, with silky smooth texture of warm soufflé working wonders with the cold sensation of ice cream. ""Strawberries and cream"" dessert that consisted of vanilla custard, olive oil cake and verjus sorbet was also quite delightful with its elegant flavor without being too sweet. The Clocktower is one of the hottest spots these days (not just for food but for its throwback-style décor that would make for a hip and pleasant dining experience), so make sure to book early. I loved the classy yet energetic vibe coming from the restaurant. The restaurant has full bar menu (with some creative cocktails coming from the bar area next to the dining space). The Clocktower is a welcome addition to the New York dining scene with its introduction to what sophisticated British cuisine would look like.",2,,
158,J C.,"New York, NY",156,25,54,5.0,1/5/2017,Wonderful setting for a long overdue catch up lunch. Love the cozy fireplace. Was a stark contrast to the gloomy weather outside. Very inviting. Beautiful red roses at every table and delicious crispy hot bread with amazing sea salt butter. The tartare was beautiful and tasted just as good. Burger was very decadent and chips were lovely and quite filling. Fish and chips may have been the unexpected star. Lightly breaded and fried and served on a gorgeous pea tendril mash. Service was great and I will be returning quite soon.,,,
159,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",125,291,1096,4.0,6/9/2015,"It is amazing all around, from services, decor to food.Why it is not 5 stars? creativity.Came here on a Monday night and the bar is bustling. Very good sign. A mix crowd from out-of-towners staying at the Eition Hotel to finance guys working in the hood. Dining room is gorgeous. Main dinning room has enormous Victorian-style fireplaces and walls covered with 500 black and white photos of the city and iconic New Yorkers. It is perfect setup for a first date or a business dinner. To start, I went with the American Cereal Killer. An innocent looking drink with a deadly punch! Made of Mitcher's whiskey.\, cheerios milk, Madagascan vanilla syrup , angostura bitter, served in a cute milk carton. It is easy to sip at first and potent after taste. Not a girly drink and I love it! Onto the food. We got the uni risotto with peekytoe crab, bottarga and zesty yuzu peel. It is creamy and savory , the citrus flavor from yuzu really stands out and a good contrast. But somehow not as harmonious as I hope. Prob better decorated with nori instead?Come along the risotto, roasted diver scallops, ragout of line caught squid, crepe , bacon in celery root purée. It is savory tho a tad too salty to my taste. The scallops are perfectly cooked, soft and juicy.Again, not bottom-shaking but it is well executed. Fave tonight! Long Island duck, sauce l'orange with fennel, endive and salt baked turnips . It is amazing. The bird is cooked medium rare while the skin is crisp, the muscle is juicy and scrumptious. The sauce is fragrant and just the right sweetness and consistency. The turnips are the best part which soaked up the #duck juice and sauce. Beautiful presentation. Service is attentive and each dish was introduced in details. That's what fine dining should be.Considering my office is close by, I will stop by every now and then, even just for drinks.",3,1,2

162,Roni J.,"Manhattan, NY",60,92,201,3.0,7/19/2016,"This is a restaurant that makes you feel cool and in the know but also a little foolish for liking it's silly gimmicks and paying ridiculous prices for certain dishes/drinks. You walk in to the lobby area with music pulsating from the  multiple dining rooms and bar areas.  The host/hostess were very chic but friendly and we were seated quickly.  I ordered the the gin cured salmon and filet mignon.  The salmon was an unexpected, 2 inch high mini block (I'm used to sliced) and was paired with an iced tea.  The salmon cut beautifully- almost like a terrine or foi gras but the texture was mealy and off- putting.  In addition the flavor was two mild (apparently gin curing doesn't add a whole lot of flavor) and some fishiness came through.  The tea was refreshing and a great palate cleanser but otherwise didn't add much.The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was wonderfully tender but was served on a wooden board next to an empty dinner plate (with a skull design).  What was the point?  I moved the meat onto my plate and they took the board away.  My partner ordered the chicken Kiev that was brought table side in a wooden drawer.  The server opened the drawer and took out the piece of chicken.  Is this some historical reference or a warming technique?  Kind of perplexing and cool but then we wondered what the point of this was, other than some indulgent showmanship.  We order the dessert for 2- a tartartine for $25.  It was very tasty but $25 for an apple dessert?  The other desserts were all$15.  Our check was almost $400 for 2 people with 2 courses each, a shared dessert and a couple of drinks.  The service was pretty good and mostly consistent.I will go back but will walk, not run.",1,,

I've secretly been wanting to come here for brunch so brownie points for him for picking this place. Let me start off with the decor: This lovely restaurant is located in the Edition hotel on the 2nd floor. I love restaurants that have that dark, woody atmosphere-such a mysterious vibe. They have several rooms all named after different colors- or so my dinner companion informed me. Not sure if it's true since I didn't go exploring. Now onto the food- we started with the scallops and the steak tartar. His scallops were really yummy, I wish I'd gotten it. The tartar to me was so so. I've definitely had better. He got a gigantic roast for his entree and I stuck with the salmon. Both had good flavors. He noticed that the chef left off the mashed potatoes from his dish. The waiter took care of that and gave him a separate side of mashed potatoes. We shared the apple tart for dessert. It was HUGE. I wish it came with a larger ice cream portion though. I'm definitely coming back here for brunch though. It's what I've been craving for this entire time.",,,

168,Sheila C.,"Manhattan, NY",143,211,44,5.0,4/5/2016,"FIVE STARS FOR THE BREAD.My favorite thing is when a restaurant has really solid bread for the table.It's a whole wheat sourdough that comes warm (ours was actually PIPING hot) with a side of butter.  Not only is it plenty for two people, they asked use TWICE if we wanted more bread.  Crazy self control on my part that I denied it twice.  If they asked one more time I might have said yes.  I had the chicken kiev which is I think fried with panko on the outside.  (It doesn't take like a greasy fried chicken though)  When you cut open the chicken buttery juice come pouring out...not sure if they stick a chunk of butter in there before frying but it is seriously decadent.  I can't even remember the sides that were on my dish, but I cleaned my plate, didn't leave a single thing behind.My boyfriend had an equally pleasing experience with his choice which was a the halibut.  Halibut is one of our favorite fish and it's hard to find in NY so he had to get it.  His came with some sort of carrot puree?  and some other delicious veggies.  There was nothing left on his plate either.  He did leave some mushrooms behind that I was more than happy to take for him.Dessert looked amazing but just couldn't possibly do it.  I secretly knew they would give us cookie with our check so I was looking forward to that. There were two buttery shortbreads, some brittle and some sort of caramel.....We had everything and left a couple tiny pieces of brittle behind.  It was a pleasant palete pleaser! NOTE: we tried making reservations on open table and they only had an opening for 8:30-9PM on a Sunday but were able to get in at 7-7:30 by calling them.  They tried to make it sound like it was be difficult but we were seating in one of the rooms with only one other table taken.",3,1,1
169,Deborah K.,"Glendale, CA",43,8,2,1.0,7/22/2016,We had waited so long to go to this restaurant. I live in LA - my daughter in NYC. When this restaurant first opened she said we have to go. But it was hard to get a reservation the few dates I was in town. So last night - when other plans fell through - we scored a same night reservation.  What a beautiful hotel and a beautiful bar. Very impressive. My daughter had been there for drinks before and thought they were fantastic. We were ready for a wonderful meal. We sat at a cute table by the fireplace and yelped everything we wanted to eat. The reviews and pics were all good. But somehow the menu had changed and nothing we ordered for appetizers looked like they did online. The streak tartare - probably one of my favorite dishes elsewhere  - hand chopped - tasted like raw hamburger you mixed with ketchup for meatloaf. Neither of us wanted a second bite - and just stared at it. The Parmesan crusted scallops were raw and the little crust was a hat that quickly fell off. I suggested to her that we Iove sushi and so why does this taste so bad?  Again - stared at it. I considered the fact that it was 20 and I cut my one (if two) in 4 pieces so each horrible bite was 2.50. I still just had one bite. At that point we had also ordered the burger and considered stopping it. The other dishes we were ready to order fell from our  minds. Perhaps we leave and go to an old favorite?   The waitress knew we were unhappy and started to ignore us. No manager was called.  The burger was good. No question. Even great. And the fries were to die for. Really good. But that's it. In the end - The appetizers were credited to the bill - thanks I guess - and the waitress gave us two horrible desserts as a token. They gave us spoons - but the poached peach we had was so hard I considered  asking for a steak knife. I wanted to tell the manager a few suggestions - or even to go and taste the food they were producing that night - perhaps the chef was out ill?  But he or she was not to be found. I wish you guys the best of luck. Please pay attention to my review as I will not be back and will not have an opportunity to help you with the other dishes. But I might stay at the hotel. Hopefully they have other restaurants to recommend to the guests. Thanks NYC!  Three more nights to go!  Hopefully fate and Yelp will send me to a great and conscientious restaurant tonite!,,1,

Although my fish came out warm and not straight from oven the taste was amazing and was one of the best seafood meals I had in a long time . I honestly felt I was at a 3 star Michelin resturant but at a fraction of the cost. My wife ordered the filet steak which was one of the best steaks she ever had . I was able to taste it and I cut with my regular knife and it just cuts so effortlessly .

The ladies at the door were effective in their jobs, but exuded no positive energy.

Once we gave in and placed our order, mostly to put an end to his awkward interrupting, he all but disappeared. The somm was at our table within seconds after I cracked their expensive and aggressively marked up winelist, i.e. $74 for a bottle of Oregon Pinot that wholesales at $13??  That's obnoxious. The service wares are nice, but they don't begin to justify the beverage prices. When it was time to close out, the check was literally dropped on the table with no form of ""thank you"". Not a great way to close out a $150pp experience- mind you this was without an overpriced bottle of wine. The place was busy, filled with beautiful people so they've got that going for them.

Best part was the free dessert box in the end. It had delicious caramels and brittle. We were told by our server that they have someone just to find unique boxes, which I thought was neat. Expensive restaurant with great service. As we were leaving, around 8:30pm I noticed the lobby bar was packed. Will definitely go back to the bar for drinks.",,,
187,Justine F.,"Dover, NJ",0,8,2,5.0,11/30/2015,"My girlfriends and I visited for Sunday brunch and we had a great experience from the moment we entered the building. Our server, Shawn, was very attentive and our food was AMAZING!!!! We ate a number of dishes (mac and cheese, French toast, fish and chips, eggs Benedict, istachio soufflé, etc.) and they all were AMAZING--full of flavor and presented wonderfully. We will be back to taste other menu items and shoot some pool!!",1,,
188,Antonio L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",337,2,0,2.0,9/4/2017,"Honestly very disappointed with this place, I was visiting with a couple of friends, all from different states and the service since the beginning was very unpleasant. I don't believe there is a dress code or age requirement to have dinner here, but the host placed us in one of the first rooms which was empty isolated from other customers. The waiter was very rude never really gave us any attention and was very pushy for us to start drinking wine or liquor, but we had to leave back to our states later on, so we stick with water and a strawberry drink with no alcohol. Moreover, since there was no consumption of liquor and after 2-3 times he asked us to drink, he left and came back one time to get our order. In a very rude way told us there was no way to add or remove any Ingredients (as if there are no food allergies) but we finally decided for stake, duck and scallops. The food was great but the service was very bad.  ""Our"" waiter never came back after he took our order and the person in charge with a grey suit every time he picked up a glass of wine from a customer that was leaving he helped himself by finishing their glass. Honestly I've been to other restaurants with same  and/or higher reputation and rating and never felt like they were treating me as a foreign or as if I didn't have the money to pay the food even when We were dressed casual as well as other people inside the restaurant. As a business owner I would never treat any customer like this and I hope you resolve this and talk to your team to make a good experience all the way in your location.",,,
189,James T.,"San Francisco, CA",23,16,0,3.0,9/21/2015,"Reading the reviews and walking up the cocoon-like white circular stairway, my expectations were high, and I was excited for the meal.  The decor was similar to Nomad's but a bit more casual and sparse.  With 3 separate dining rooms, the flow of the space was a bit off - but notwithstanding, let's go to the food and service.Delicious starter bread and butter.  Lobster with fennel and apple was unique and refreshing - perhaps a bit too much vinegar but still tasty.  Tartare was good, the bone marrow taking place of egg yolk.  And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our hostess, after 20 or so minutes, finally came around and let us know the chef had to re-fire the halibut (could not hear the rationale).  Ten minutes later (water not refilled, picking at the bread without any plates), the food arrived and looked great.  We ordered the fish (tasty), duck (a bit salty but very tender + flavorful), and skirt steak (per Eater's rec).  Down by my side came the bone-in strip steak - not what I ordered, but it looked amazing and was $20+ more.  I was more than happy to keep it, informing the waiter so, but he insisted that I should get what I ordered.  Five minutes later it arrived with a ""thank you"" - not so much an apology for the extra delay or incorrect order, but a simple ""thank you"" - at which I was taken aback.'Strawberries and cream' was not too sweet and a solid ending to the dessert.  In the end, dessert was taken off the bill, but I still felt slighted.  I had really high hopes for the Clocktower, and while the food was solid (once it finally arrived), the service was off, which I would not expect from such a high-pedigree establishment.  Tables around us seemed happy and were receiving their dishes in a timely manner, so to not only have longer wait times AND receive the wrong dish (which I was not allowed to keep!), I felt slighted.  With just one of these issues, I would still recommend highly to friends - but with both, I felt the need to post.Overall, solid meal but the service was mis-aligned.  I'm not a perfectionist, but I feel like there should be certain standards at this type of restaurant.  Give it a try - hopefully you'll have a better experience than me.",2,,
190,Paulina J.,"Staten Island, NY",498,23,3,5.0,2/12/2017,"Anytime there is a restaurant at any of the edition hotels I already know it's going to be good and this place is amazing. I loved everything about this place, from the wine to the food to the atmosphere. Definitely get the mac and cheese its to die for. Great wine list. Pricey but so worth it, it's a Michelin star rated restaurant. Go early and enjoy drinks at the awesome bar area.",,,
191,Molly O.,"Manhattan, NY",99,66,8,4.0,3/2/2016,"Stopped by the bar for a late afternoon cocktail with friends. Great cocktail menu, only complaint was that it was definitely a bit cramped by the bar. Finding a seat and not getting shoved by neighbors was tough.However the cosmo was great and my friend thoroughly enjoyed the cocktail the bartender recommended. We will be back, maybe at a less peak time.",,,
192,Lindsay K.,"Manhattan, NY",191,9,0,3.0,8/3/2015,"I came for a business lunch. + /Food was delicious. The space itself was gorgeous. I had the tuna with ponzu and a crab salad, and an espresso. The complimentary desserts were delicious and such a nice touch. The salted caramel melted in my mouth. - /Service sucked.We had our drink orders taken. A minute later, another gentleman asked for our drink orders. We said thank you - but we just put them in. He seemed annoyed, didn't say anything, raised his eyebrows and walked away. We laughed it off. Time to order. I asked how big the Gazpacho was because I was considering getting that and a salad for lunch instead of one larger dish. The dry answer: ""it's an appetizer."" Really? I can read and didn't see it was under ""starters,"" how'd you know? Thanks. So I just went with the salad. For two salads, two appetizers, and espresso, our business lunch took 2.5 hours because we had to wait so long for the check. Being a new ""hot spot"" in town I would have understood if it was as bustling as one would expect, but it was pretty dead. Maybe they were annoyed we weren't a big ticket table and wanted to freeze us in their blasting A/C in retaliation. I don't know. Not impressed. At least I expensed it.",3,1,1
193,Katie B.,"Berkeley, CA",51,113,1,4.0,1/14/2016,"Definitely not cheap, but can't complain! I had the risotto, skirt steak, and pistachio soufflé, and they were all fantastic. The real standout, though, was the ""Dill or No Dill"" cocktail. Lots of bars have a variation of this, but this is BY FAR my favorite in New York. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was beautiful and quiet. Makes a great date spot!",,,
194,Jacqueline L.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",473,17,37,4.0,6/26/2017,"lobby + hotel different cool from restaurant. menu a short list of delights, but sea bass entrée was by far the best thing we ordered. other tastings included a refreshing pea salad and scallop crudo with a strange frozen accompaniment (which was weird + hugely disappointing). the warm bread was a special treat especially when a burst of steam was released as we broke into it. our favorite compliment by far was the almond jam baked goodness delivered to the table with a glass of rosé. the perfect end to a nice night out!",,,
195,Melissa B.,"Manhattan, NY",181,94,51,4.0,10/21/2016,The food at The Clocktower made me HAPPY. Delicious and the service was fantastic. The restaurant itself has got a old school library kind of feel. I think the building it's in is now a landmark. Definitely worth visiting for lunch or even dinner.,,,1
196,Scott H.,"Manhattan, NY",74,293,61,3.0,11/28/2015,"Right as this place opened in the spring, we visited. The space was so new that the photos were just being taken. The bar scene is very swank, hip, and lively. Multiple rooms with a huge bar as the centerpiece. This is Manhattan, so a $16-18 cocktail can be found though I'm still not convinced is worth it. The dining area reminded me of a library with many small rooms. The food was very good, but the portions were very small. My halibut and the accompaniments took up 1/4 of my plate. It looked empty, as was my stomach after paying just shy of $40.The complimentary bread they serve is fantastic.",,,
197,Stacey F.,"Tampa, FL",12,129,5,5.0,7/7/2015,"Swanky, hot new resto of the moment and it hit the mark for me. Three separate dining rooms w/old Hollywood photos adorn the walls. Sounds a bit cheesy, but the decor totally works. Mixed crowd...couples, bankers, B&T...seems like everyone wants to check this place out. Wine list definitely pricey, but a really nice list and settled on a lovely French red which didn't completely break the bank. (Extra points for having my fave rose, which is from a small producer in Italy.) Food was excellent. Scallops and tuna tartar to begin. Scallops served alongside cauliflower accompaniments and the tuna was served as bite sized pieces w/cucumbers. Both delicious. Skirt steak was a nice size and cooked perfectly (and eaten on really nifty plates w/skulls on them). Came w/great chips (fries) and a side salad. Pork chop was big and juicy, served w/delicious beets. Strawberries and cream for dessert...very different interpretation...light, yet decadent.  Complimentary cookies (shortbread was so yum!) are served in an old fashioned tin when the check arrives. Service was great all around...from water guys to main waiter to the somm and host...good stuff. All in all, a very enjoyable night out and look forward to returning. Side note: check out the cool billiard room and back bar for an after dinner drink before heading home!",2,1,1
198,Melanie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1286,564,381,5.0,5/24/2015,"Uhhhh....yes yes and did I mention YES?Friends of mine were visiting from Miami (where there is also an Edition Hotel) for MDW and informed me that an Edition Hotel opened in NYC recently and that they wanted to have dinner there. I had no expectations and was blown away.The staff was welcoming, knowledgeable, and actually acted like they enjoyed working there. I hope that over time this won't fade...+ My water was constantly re-filled throughout the night and the staff seemed on point. AmbianceDark wood and perfect lighting. Need I say more? Very romantic vibe yet also could see business dinners conducted here. There are two rooms directly next to each other but yet separated so each room feels very intimate. We sat next to Fredrik Eklund (from Million Dollar Listing) so I assume a lot of ""celebrities"" will be pouring into this hotel.Wine+ They have great options for all price points. I was really surprised at the range. I wasn't let down as I had the Austrian wine (Gruner Vetliner, which I seem to find on every menu in NYC which leads me to ask who the hell is their wine rep?!) and it was yummy yet very inexpensive. FoodI ordered a salad to start. I can't remember the exact name of the salad and can't seem to find their menu anywhere online but basically it was just a mixed green salad with a light yet fruity vinaigrette dressing. The salad was excellent. I'm not usually a fan of paying a large amount of money to eat lettuce and I seem to always find that the dressing portion applied to salads are either too heavy or too light.Thiswasperfect.A really light and refreshing way to start my meal. I would say this is a MUST ORDER.I followed the salad with the uni risotto despite it being listed as an appetizer. I was still a bit hungry after the salad and risotto but not too bad. I wasn't in the mood for a huge entree and wanted a smaller portion for dinner as I had a late lunch. It was quite tasty and I would definitely order it again. It was a tad too creamy for my taste (I'm lactose intolerant yet still consume a lot of dairy, don't ask) but nonetheless was very good. My friends had the filet mignon (which was cooked perfectly) and the chicken (which she loved).+ I was impressed with how on point the experience was from start to finish despite it being a brand new restaurant.I definitely will throw this restaurant into my rotation!",5,2,3
199,Juan R.,"New York, NY",0,24,0,4.0,7/30/2017,"Beautiful space. You could spend an hour just walking around and looking at the pictures. The food was good, and the service was great. I am baffled, however, by reviews that describe the ambiance as intimate and romantic. It felt about as intimate as a Who concert. Perhaps it depends on the room where you sit (we were in the large room with the big mirror), or perhaps the above reviewers have already incurred hearing loss from dining at places like Estela. But (if you go at the wrong time and sit in the wrong place), you should anticipate ringing in your ears by the time you get to the dessert (the tarte tatin is awesome).",,,
