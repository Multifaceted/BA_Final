0,Jonathan C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1,10,0.0,5.0,7/12/2018,"A great spot with simple Americana and reasonable prices and great service to go to for a meal in middle of a hectic ny day.Had a very delightful dinner here. Began at the bar, where I had the Summer Thyme. It was tasty,  refreshing, and was not watered down. There is a fresh baked onion bread that is dangerous to serve because it can easily be eaten to fill before the main courses! Be careful, but definitely do not deny yourself of it for an enjoyable simple starter. Served in a small cast iron tray, the baked in onion and silky whipped butter spread just magnified the sweet and warmth of the bread.The dinner was simple. We ordered the chicken wings to start, and had burgers and fries for entree. I enjoyed he unique taste of the wings. They had bite, but the tzatziki sauce in lieu of bleu cheese or ranch was a nice Mediterranean reprieve from the humid nyc summer heat. The shoestring fries were crisp, fresh, and hit the spot in terms of salty cravings. I enjoy ketchup with my fries in almost all situations, but this was one where I was fine without any condiments, and might have preferred it without them.The burger was actually of a higher caliber, except I ordered medium rare, and it came out more like medium. I chalk this up to the unique techniques of each restaurant, but be aware of this when you order. The patty was nonetheless juicy, and the bun was subtle and complimented the meat well.The service was superb, from the host onward, they were young yet professional and attentive. They would all fit in perfectly in some of the establishments of a finer caliber.If this restaurants can maintain this level of product and service, it could easily become a staple of ny dining, and with improvements, find itself inching into a higher tier.I look forward to trying their other offerings in the future.",,,
1,Jennifer N.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,74,266,5.0,11/16/2018,"This place is amazing. I had a Macy's gift card and decided to eat with it. I started with a choppedSalad with cranberry's and pistachios. It was so good!! Then I had the steak frites and it was really really good. The service was top notch, I would highly recommend this place.",2,,1
2,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,3.0,12/19/2017,"Decided to venture here after visiting Santaland. It only made sense because Rowland's is located in the cellar of Macy's.The staff was friendly and immediately came over to assist us with seating. It's a nice comfortable setting with ample amount of seating. I went for the Philly Cheesesteak and didn't care for it too much. To be honest, it may have been one of the worst I've ever had. I can't put my finger on it but I wasn't pleased with it whatsoever. However, my daughter had the chicken and waffles and the waffles were excellent. My seasonal Sangria was pretty good too. Overall I would recommend this place if you're in Macy's and looking for a bite to eat. However, I wouldn't venture here to eat if I were simply around the area looking for dinner.FYI: they have some pretty good happy hour options.. too bad we arrived too late to partake.",2,2,2
3,Claudiana C.,"San Antonio, TX",3,56,62,4.0,9/27/2018,"We stopped into this grill and sat at the bar for a quick drink on a trip into Macy's. The bartender was friendly and offered some good conversation. She winded up being from our city and so it was a nice touch to talk about some things back home. The atmosphere was nice, casual and laid back. We had a quick drink and were back off into the Macy's madness. But this was a nice place to take a break. Also they had some pretty cool rooster decor, i know it's random, but true",,,
4,Ebony K.,"Phoenix, AZ",553,610,106,5.0,4/27/2018,"O M G! I swear I had THE BEST BLT I have ever had in my entire life at Rowland's last week. If you like spicy, start off with the Strawberry- Jalapeno Margarita that is made with Cuervo silver, jalepeño infused simple syrup, strawberry and topped off with a salted rim. Next order the best damn BLT EVER! It is made with sriracha honey glazed bacon, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and placed on a challah bun. For $1 more I got the sweet potato fries instead and it was so worth it. The bacon was crispy, sweet, and spicy all at the same time (and they gave me a lot of bacon too). As I type I am sitting here thinking about this BLT, that is just how good it was. I usually don't get tomatoes on my BLT (I know I'm strange) but I am so happy that I did as it was the perfect balance to the sandwich.  I am telling you if you like spicy and you like bacon, please try this sandwich at Rowlands (along with the Strawberry - Jalapeno Margarita) because it is definitely worth it.",1,,1
5,Philip S.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",1,1,4,5.0,8/11/2018,"This is a fantastic restaurant for comfort foods such as succulent burgers and amazing sides such as mozzarella sticks, sweet potato fries. The house baked onion pull apart bread is a must try; combined with the house churned butter is out of this world! The RH burger is huge and the beef is cooked wonderfully. I highly recommend this place for awesome food!",1,,1
6,Jim K.,"Camillus, NY",0,91,4,5.0,6/28/2018,"This is my first trip to Rowland's...I love it...World Cup happy hour specials and three tv's playing the game while the family shops at Macy's...who could ask for anything more! Also, I had the onion bread on onion rings and both were fantastic. Highly recommend especially if you are all shopped out but the rest of the family is not!",1,,1
7,Ava H.,"Birmingham, AL",216,198,742,5.0,11/3/2017,"I'm a fan! When with a group of shoppers and you have reached your limit, this place quickly brightened me up. From walking up, the staff was great and attentive. My sister and I decided to sit at the bar since we were going for dinner in a few hours with the group. This was going to be a quick grab of cocktails until the group was ready, but we saw the smoked wings. I am glad we got them as our appetizer....to dinner elsewhere. These were easily top 3 of the best smoked wings I've had. Right here in Macy's!!!! The bartender was great and so were her drinks. Glad we came in.",1,,2
8,Nicole S.,"Burlingame, CA",1,16,0,2.0,10/28/2018,"Very bland food. The prices are on the high side ($17 for a BLT, $9 for a baked potato). I don't mind high prices if the food is tasty but we didn't feel inclined to finish anything. My husband said the salmon was fine. The onion rings, fresh baked bread (which was room temp), Mozz sticks and burger were all sub par. Service was very friendly.",,,
9,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,37,1,1.0,4/19/2018,Came here on a Sunday with few friend and sat at the bar. We've order couple drinks while waiting for one more friend to seat on a table. The bartender was unfriendly and made it look like we were bothering her. We drank our drink and left to get burger at shake shack next door. If you don't want to come to work just don't but don't put your anger and frustration on people that are here to enjoy their time,,,
10,Kevin L.,"FLUSHING, NY",26,109,174,1.0,12/12/2017,Located in the lower level in Macy's. Place is very expensive for lunch. $18.50 for a cheeseburger with shoestring fries. More bread than burger. Reuben with very thick slices of marble bread. There was more bread than meat. For a $20 sandwich I expected more. Expected to get a refill on my $4 ice tea. The food was average. Service was average. I should've could've would've gone to McDonald's in the upper floors in Macy's or across the street if I knew I was going to get this average lunch with these outrageous prices. Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me. I won't be fooled twice.,1,1,1
11,Shannon K.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",0,5,0,1.0,3/29/2018,"We had hoped for a casual, delicious lunch after a morning of sightseeing, but were left feeling 100% disappointed. The service was bad and the food was worse. I am accustomed to paying NYC prices for food, so that wasn't the issue. But paying NYC prices for terrible food and mediocre (at best) service leaves on feeling nothing but shortchanged. $10 for dry (possibly day old?) chicken tenders from the kids menu???? My 10 and 6 year olds wouldn't touch them. The fries were ok though- so yeah kids! Fries for lunch. The Simple Salad is nothing but a plate of spring mix with little to no dressing and a shaving of cheese- to the tune of $15. Again- I'm fine paying $15+ for a salad as long as it tastes good. It literally tasted like dry greens with some sort of bitter dressing. Simple greens tossed with a delicious Vinaigrette can be really delicious. This one missed the mark. Our server was less than helpful, almost to the point of being curt, and seemed to avoid our table all together after a sandwich was sent back (thousand island slathered on the bun when it was ordered dry). I so wish we would have skipped this and dined in the Macy's food court instead. Total waste of money. Will never go back and would by no means ever recommend it to anyone else.",,,
12,Gavin G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",33,26,0,5.0,7/10/2018,"This is a great place to relax. Especially if you're exhausted from shopping in Macy's. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The ambiance is congenial, and it's not loud! Yay! I recommend the Moscow Mule and a tall glass of club soda on the side. Refreshing.",,,
13,Denis M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",124,1,0,5.0,10/21/2017,"Knicks opening nite. Went to Rowlands in the basement of Macy's. We found this place when my wife was shopping and I sat in the bar watching the game.Tonite, we were a party of six and were seated quickly and were given ice water and menus. Started the meal with their house baked onion bread. This is addicting. We had the steak, Steak and cheese sandwich, mozzarella sticks and I had the pastrami. Food is excellent, service was excellent. Recommend this restaurant highly!",1,,
14,Stephanie M.,"New York, NY",5,190,187,3.0,4/2/2018,"Service was quick, location is inside Macy's. Wait time was about 20 minutes which is average. Pricing is average for NYC. Food was good, but not exactly as ordered. One medium burger came out medium well instead, another came out medium rare instead of medium. Feels a bit rushed in there too, but the decor is nice.",1,,
15,Sarah H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,2,5.0,5/4/2018,"Love this place!!! After a rough afternoon of trekking around the city and then stopping inside of Macy's for ""just one thing"" we were exhausted. Someone told us to go to the lower level for a bite, but when we got there we (of course) went straight for the bar! Firstly, it's so nicely decorated and the staff are sweet and helpful. Secondly, it was great to come in to a relaxed atmosphere, take a load off, and have a beer - in a frosted glass! We started with the house baked onion pull-apart bread. Words cannot describe. Just get it, ok? We also got the wings - such a cool twist on a classic - full of flavor and not breaded so we felt better about the bread  Then we got the BBQ chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and the pastrami with shoestring fries, and they let us add avocado to everything! I can't explain how good it was. We didn't have room for it but we had to do the BK blackout cake after we saw it in the open kitchen. Perfect finish for an unexpected delicious break in a daunting day. Thank you, Rowland's! I'm coming back for the Brussels sprouts next time!",,,
16,Susan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,14,1,1.0,9/9/2017,"Step away now, walk straight ahead, take the escalator to the 6th floor and get a table at Stella 34 Trattoria instead.  Save your money and possibly your health.  Just dined here, the most oily onion rings, they were swimming in a bowl of oil.  Tried the ""house special"" fried chicken and waffles, cut into the chicken and it was raw and pink. Gross. Management was uncaring, said it was the ""brine"". Rigggght. A simple sorry would have done, assuring us you'd talk to the chef, that would be pretty nice too.",,,
17,Tyler A.,"Yonkers, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/24/2017,"A perfect place to dine after shopping, the service was exceptional and management was attentive, caring and pleasant. My party and I were seated right away and I was immediately impressed by the set up, overall look and the vibe Rowland's gives. We started our meal with this delicious baked onion bread followed by my main entree of choice being the steak and cheese sandwich that came out cooked to perfection and packed with flavor. Refills were frequently brought to our table which conveyed a level of attentiveness you don't find everyday. Based off the service, food and warm welcome by management, I will undoubtedly be dining here again. Highly recommended!",,,
18,Pedro M.,"Bayonne, NJ",85,39,8,3.0,7/24/2017,Ate here once for a team builder with my sales team and the burger was solid ordered it medium well. Prices aren't too bad. They're known for their onion bread which was sweet and salty and always a kick ass combo. Also had a beer. Big negative though is that there's so many homeless people wandering around in Macys basement and a few of them don't smell very good. We were sitting close to the walkway and as I was about to talk a bite of the juicy burger a potent urine scent wafted into my mouth and ruined me forever.,,,
19,Nilsa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,276,287,3.0,10/24/2016,"Rowland's was fairly quiet on a Saturday evening and I was happy to grab a bar seat for some solo dinner and get away from the crowd. I decided to go all out and order an appetizer and entree (after all, I am dining solo, so that is quite a bit of food) because the shrimp and grits really caught my eye and I've seen good reviews on the salmon. The shrimp and grits came with two large prawns that were cooked perfectly and on a bed of grits drizzled with a bacon sauce. I actually really liked this dish. The bacon sauce was on the salty side, but if you mix it in with the grits well enough, it balances out. The salmon dish was mixed reviews for me. I loved that the salmon skin was crispy and created a much needed crunch for the dish. The filet was also cooked perfectly. However, I wasn't a big fan of the curry sauce. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't my thing. I found myself trying to drain off the sauce from the salmon on the side of the plate. Despite the mixed reviews, I would actually come back to Rowland's if I'm shopping in the area and wanted a sit down meal in a quiet restaurant.",1,1,1
20,Jim R.,"Chantilly, VA",0,2,0,4.0,6/26/2018,"Great place to catch a burger and a drink. Don't let the bottom floor of Macy's fool you. Light, open, and airy atmosphere with great food. Would highly recommend for a shopping break luncheon or to escape the summer heat.",,,
21,Pooja G.,"New Brunswick, NJ",43,14,5,3.0,11/23/2017,The food is good! But I'm not sure about the staff here. They seem kinda rude and we're acting arrogant. Meh. Not visiting again,,,
22,Sofia C.,"Santiago, Chile",0,4,8,1.0,12/9/2017,"Disappointing food and bad service. We went there because we got hungry while shopping only to be extremely disappoint, we got mozzarella stick, that resembled a real wood stick more than something edible, hummus, that was okay, and a sandwich, pepper with seeds (extremely spicy, only Hot Ones host could handle it). When we asked for the check, it took them over 10 minutes to bring the printed detail and then 10 more minutes to take the cash and bring our change back. We payed $60 for wood like mozzarella sticks, one sandwich, two drinks and some hummus (with less than one piece of pita bread). I don't know if we got bad service because we look young or whatsoever but my goodness, worst place in NYC.",,,
23,Ms G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,4.0,6/13/2018,"The best fried mozzarella sticks in NYC , we live here and have been twice after shopping, the chopped salad with fried chicken is fantastic, so are the burgers.

24,Angela C.,"Sherwood, AR",0,24,0,4.0,11/29/2017,Food was good along with a great atmosphere and service. Fish and chips were fantastic! We enjoyed the complimentary pickles as well!! Great restaurant if you are shopping in Macy's or just wanting a great meal.,,,
25,Jim F.,"Sebring, FL",1,26,0,2.0,10/21/2017,"We love Macy's Herald Square.  We liked the old grill in this same location in the basement.  We weren't very keen on the food in this new place.  The onion rings had to be sent back because they were still white and not fried sufficiently.  The bread on my Rueben sandwich was simply awful.  My wife's burger was subpar except for the meat itself.  All in all, a big disappointment.",,,
26,david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,371,1028,2.0,8/17/2016,"I've been here for lunch twice with my last visit for Restaurant week. The food the 1st visit was much better with the Salmon cooked and seasoned well paired with a yogurt sauce and  salad very tasty. I can say the restaurant week food was a miss. Everything lacked flavor from the Salmon, quinoa and English peas to the Half of Fried chicken which was not half of a chicken as stated on the menu. The chicken was dry. The deserts was really dissapointing. Biscuit strawberry shortcake was stale and the blackout cake was just dry and had no flavor. Only the Matzoh ball soup tasted pretty good. The Matzoh ball was nice. The service was also a bit disappointing. Everyone is friendly and professional but it was slow. Food took its time to come out",,,
27,Hannah R.,"Valdosta, GA",0,6,0,5.0,12/11/2017,"This is probably one of my favorite shopping break restaurants in the city. The service is excellent and the prices are very reasonable for NYC.

I'm not from NYC but visit frequently and was very pleased with our experience.",,,
28,Ray T.,"New York, NY",162,13,32,5.0,1/26/2016,"Went in for lunch with my boss and we ordered the Smoked Fish Chowder. I'm not a soup guy and wanted the burgers that looked amazing but didn't have time for the 20 min wait for them. The staff was very pleasant and we sat at the bar, watching each chef prepare their dishes. They were real pros caring about the preparations to the presentation. The manager was putting on the final touches on each dish before she allowed them to be taken to the customers. Watching her, you can tell she was a pro at this and really cared about each dish. We made sure to let her and the chefs know how pleased we were.The soup came out a short time after our order and my God did it look beautiful. It also tasted amazing. It wasn't salty or watery like all the other soup places. This was made with love. Can't wait to go back to try the burgers when I'm not in a rush! Ray T.",2,,1

The Ambiance was so nice and calming, and the food was amazing. We had the mozzarella sticks which he tries in every restaurant that offers them and likes them all but these were difference, not greasy at all. The chopped salad with diced fried chicken was fresh and delicious and the chicken was warm. I had a steak that was perfectly grilled and they allowed me to substitute a baked potato for the fries , he had a perfectly done cheeseburger ( the bun could have been more creative, maybe because it was it was from the kids menu?

Rancid taste                      3) chicken wings-- undercooked                     4) deep fried onions-- best thing I had out of everything. Not worth going back at all.

First of all, the service here is ridiculously slow, almost non existent.Party of 6. 2 of us didn't even get anything off the restaurant week menu. It took about 45 minutes for the appetizers, 3 ceasar salads and 2 soups. Really??Fish Soup was really quite tasty. The Ceasar Salad was ok. Except for the fact it allegedly had anchovies in it. 3 ceasar salads, not one anchovy in sight. It was really obvious because 1 person wanted the anchovies on the side. Still waiting.Salmon. Excellent. Very tasty. Very tender. Crispy Chicken. Good. Not too oily. Also very tasty.Halibut. Good. Not as good as the salmon but very well prepared.Brussel Sprouts. Awful. Half raw with bacon thrown on to distract you. Couldn't finish it.Crispy onions. Very small portion. Very tasty.

After a harrowing experience of their being an Active Shooter false alarm which sent Macy's and Rowland's patrons alike scrambling for safety their staff stepped up!Having sat down for a late lunch/early dinner post shopping, we had only just placed our order when scores of patrons went scampering past in a panic as rumours of a fight or active shooter swirled.The staff quickly ushered patrons that didn't initially dash for the exits to the kitchen to shelter in place as thw situation was assessed. In the ensuing maylay I'd gitten tripped up by another nervous patron and sustained a minor but uncomfortable injury.Management and staff took the time to reassure patrons, tend to those who'd been injured and displayed excellent comradery. Nothing like enjoying one's meal while administering an ice pack surrounded by police carrying out an investigative sweep...The culinary fare and imaginative drink menu was quite good under the circumstances and the composed and courteous staff quickly restored a sense of calm and normalcy.

Nothing against the amazing batter but I wound up stripping the chips to just eat the fish by itself. So flakey and tender without having that fishy taste at all.

50,Lauren S.,"Frederick, MD",164,12,0,5.0,2/14/2016,"This new hidden gem is a true treat, located near the new ""Chef Street"" in the basement level of Macy's. The brussel sprouts with pancetta were to die for! The ambience of this bustling authentic NY cuisine pub add a fun feel to a delicious meal. The waitstaff was very attentive, and the cocktails were a hit. I have a lot of food allergies (gluten, dairy, & nuts), and the staff and management were very considerate of my needs and extra accommodating. This restaurant is run by the same restaurant group as Stella 34 on the 6th floor, and the excellent service was consistent with upstairs. Can't wait to come back!",1,,
51,Aaron G.,"Silver Spring, MD",69,14,0,5.0,4/2/2016,"Attractive restaurant with great food and good service. Had a delicious burger for dinner. Nice dining room with whitewashed brick walls and open kitchen. Surprised to find this downstairs at the Macy's, would recommend for lunch or dinner.",,,1
52,Susan F.,"North Bergen, NJ",22,5,4,5.0,1/26/2016,"Sat at the bar for lunch today and had the most delicious White Fish Chowder. The restaurant is in the Cellar at Macy's and they did a great job...space is lovely, staff is friendly, and most important the food looks and tastes great. If you sit at the bar you can watch the chef's prepping the dishes. The mgr took pride in seeing that every plate that went out was perfect! Great neighborhood place for lunch.",1,,
53,Noah N.,"New York, NY",0,73,0,1.0,12/20/2016,"Horrendous. Everyone involved with this establishment should be ashamed. The food is terrible and egregiously overpriced. This is a trap, a mirage in the Macy's desert for exhausted shoppers and tired boyfriends too hungry or uncomfortable with venturing out into the streets nearby for infinitely better food and drink. Alas, they have u held hostage akin to being at a baseball game and submitting to the old $10.00 hot dog + soda. The cheeseburger, at $25, was unacceptably greasy, the bun soggy and limp. A $23 chicken Caesar salad was nearly inedible with chicken that appeared strikingly similar, if not actually, canned shredded chicken. $4.00 gets you a soda. If you dare to try Rowland's, you will be disappointed when your food arrives and you will be furious when your check arrives. If the decision makers here think they are in the restaurant business they are simply dishonest. They are in the scam industry. Shame shame shame.",1,,
54,MM V.,"Edgewater, NJ",24,53,13,2.0,12/30/2016,"The crispy chicken was fantastic, as a spicy mayo sauce comes with it to give it some kick. It was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The small Caesar salad was boring and tiny. The prices for the food were way off base!",,1,
55,Mollyana W.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",1088,144,139,3.0,3/19/2016,I read that the food is good here but the service......SLOW. We just wanted a quick bottle of wine to split and the bartender must have had other things on his mind rather than bartending. Finally a sever helped us but seriously....it was like pulling teeth.,,,
56,Andres P.,"New York, NY",7,3,10,1.0,5/1/2016,"Services is to slow. That have plenty of employees, waited 1hr 45 minutes for a 2 burgers and wings? For real though ?",,,
57,Sheila Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,1,0,5.0,3/26/2016,Great food and excellent service.  They start you off with their house made pickled vegetables which was a great change from your typical bread service.  The matzo ball soup was absolutely delicious and their pastrami sandwich was a hole-in-one. Simply amazing!  Desserts were ginormous and would recommend to share.  Came in for brunch bur definitely looking forward to come back to try the rest of their menu!,,,
58,Ian B.,"New York, NY",355,69,0,2.0,2/21/2016,"There's some promise here, but the service is a shit show. It's as if the Keystone Cops (forgive the dated reference, my hipster brothers and sisters) decided to open a restaurant. After not being able to get any service the first ten minutes, no fewer than four people showed up to take our drink orders within the next 10 minutes. This included two who seemed to bicker over whose table it was, a third who explained that the two were bickering and therefore banned from our table, and then a fourth who was assigned after #3 told us his shift was ending. At 1 pm. The food is okay but overly ambitious with simple dishes. Hot pull-apart bread smelled and looked wonderful but was under-baked and doughy. What should be simple matzo ball soup inexplicably served with a heaping quantity of kale leaves floating about and rubbery chicken chunks which had clearly and rudely been introduced to the broth at the time of plating. Burgers are solid but overly complicated for no good reason. And for all those servers milling about (and few customers to serve), good luck getting a drink refill or a check before Macy's starts their Thanksgiving Parade. Things should improve, but for now this is an overpriced work in progress better left to some poor tourist's discovery.",,1,
59,Anthony F.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,9,0,1.0,5/3/2016,"The cashier doesn't understand the concept of you don't touch people's food, the service is slow AF and after waiting so long they almost gave my meal to another customer that just ordered food. The service severely lacks every since it first opened and not worth the money!!!",,,
60,Royalty R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,62,0,5.0,3/9/2016,"Rowlands is worth every penny.  Located in the basement of Macy's, Rowland's offers great food, ambiance, and service.  Everyone is so friendly.  I will definitely go back.",,,
61,Alen J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/6/2016,"Absolutely worst food ever. Had a chicken soup with literally two strips of chicken and brown water. The salad was overtly salty. I sent the salad back in the nicest way, but they were the rudest bunch of people ever. They were so offended I sent back their terrible salad. The waiter came up to me complaining that I shouldn't be complaining. Worst meal in New York and overpriced. Also the slowest service ever. I've eaten around the world and I must say this really was the worst food. The other reviews are fake.",,,
62,Juliana R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,5/31/2016,"I just visited your burger truck downstairs Macys' (Herald Square) something I've done quite often.  Only this time I stood there (well after going to see what kind of sweets were by the coffee today) - I ordered a cheeseburger and fries (which I only walked out with the burger) - while waiting other customer's came and ordered burgers, double burger, double cheeseburger (all with fries) and one man ordered a hot dog.  So the worker put the burgers on the grill (with gloves) and then proceeded to grab burger buns out of the package with the same gloves he touched the raw beef with...yuck (a recipe for Salmonella and many sick customers) - I pointed it out to him and he threw the buns (except mine which was already prepped since I was there before the other folks) wish I had stood around to watch what he was doing (I really wish now that I didn't consume the burger at all - but I was starving) (hope I don't' get sick) anyway he put new gloves on put the buns in the container then grabbed a raw hot dog and with the same gloves prepped the rest of the buns (you know lettuce, tomatoes pickles etc....  he then proceeded to put the burgers on the bun (the only problem is he never dropped fries in the fryer) so I said to him you don't have any fries - he said they will be done in a few...OMG - he obviously needs to be retrained on all aspects of his job and the board of health would have a fields day on your company should they ever witness what I did today...",,,1
