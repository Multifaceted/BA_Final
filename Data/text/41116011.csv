0,Teri D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",6,215,18,3.0,6/19/2018,"Cafe Plaza is a good place to have lunch where different people have different preferences.Cafe Plaza is just off the 4/5 near Battery Park and the Bull statue.  It is downstairs.  It has an electic choice of food - sandwiches, Korean, salad bar, pizza.  Everything is okay.  We weren't disappointed, but we weren't overly impressed either.  In NYC, you expect better.  You can sit down to eat.  Bottom line go somewhere else if you have time.",,,
1,Jenny W.,"New York, NY",0,57,2,2.0,4/10/2018,"Your standard deli place but grimier. The selections at the buffet are small and taste a little sub-par to comparable deli buffets around. The Korean options in the back were my go to but recently they changed up the ingredients. Maybe they were trying to make it nicer, healthier or whatnot but to me it just seems like veggie scraps all tossed in there at random.  Last but not least, the ambiance is, yeah, no. The lights are dim and what's worse it that there is no ventilation in there. After standing around for around 10 minutes waiting for my order, my hair, my close and my skin just smell like grease. So while I've their Korean dishes are passable, I think this will be my last visit.",,,
2,Caroline O.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",168,4,2,1.0,3/12/2018,"Would give 0 stars. They have a serve yourself buffet, so I served myself a small helping of chopped fruit as a side. Maybe 10 pieces of chopped fruit? It was $8.22. $8.22 for 10 pieces of chopped fruit that I served myself! What???? Absolutely crazy, felt like an idiot walking out!",,,
3,Drew B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,13,0,1.0,1/4/2018,"Unfortunately this place just isn't good. So far I've ordered an egg and cheese wrap that had egg shells in it, an egg sandwich where they left the bagel raw (apparently that's not just assumed I'd like It cooked?), and today they randomly put ketchup all over my bagel without asking for It. Really sucks because the place is convenient but I've got to find somewhere else to go I guess.",1,,
4,F ..,"New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,1/28/2018,"DON'T BOTHER.  I have had multiple bad experiences here and am finally getting around to reviewing. The deli counter staff is out of control rude at this place. I'm empathetic to people having a hard day and having to deal with customers all the time, I don't expect super friendly service, but I also do not deserve to be screamed at for asking for a sandwich. Ordinarily when I come here I just get the bibimbap, which is fine if a little overpriced (charging an extra dollar for an egg on bibimbap is ridiculous - the egg is part of the meal everywhere else I've had it, it's like charging an extra dollar for putting tomato on a BLT). Any time I've tried to get a sandwich at the deli I was treated like human garbage. I've been overcharged (e.g. ordering a simple turkey sandwich no cheese and being charged $2 more for that sandwich than items on the menu that had more meats and cheeses on them) and yelled at on several occasions. Last time I came in it was late in the afternoon; I asked the cashier if the deli was still open. I am a little hard of hearing so she said something in response and I couldn't hear her. When I asked her to repeat, the deli man next to her looked angrily at me and literally yelled ""WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!?"" with a super nasty tone. I said I was looking for a reuben and he said the grill was closed with that same tone.The cashier, who seemed nice enough, also seemed to be looking to help me find something else they could make off the grill but after being yelled at for being slightly disabled I had no interest in interacting anymore. I try to be empathetic as maybe he was having a bad day but it was really just over the top. Don't waste your time or money here - there are plenty of other delis around with similar food and where the staff doesn't make you feel like crap and yell at you.",,,
5,Kirk C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,26,3,1.0,11/8/2017,"!!!!AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!I work in the building connected to this sub par establishment . When I first moved into my office I gave this place a try and what a mistake that was.The deli workers cannot grasp the process of  taking correct orders (probably due to the fact that everyone in this place seems to be fresh of the boat & the concept of a deli is new to them).If you want a clean and sanitary place to eat I would not recommend this place (even the bottled water has a weird film on it), its more of a meeting place for the dregs of the area & the shysters that try to sell everyone cruise tickets, along with the poor people that cannot afford to eat somewhere else. DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK",,,
6,Nina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,2,8,1.0,9/26/2017,"Absolutely the worst Korean Fried Chicken. The meat is so dry and no taste, If you looking for a real Korean fried chicken, be avoided this place.",,,
7,John T.,"Charleston, SC",0,1,0,3.0,6/13/2017,Good cold sub sandwiches. Large portion for $8. Perfect to grab sandwiches to take with you to Statue of Liberty.,,,
8,Xida Z.,"New York, NY",246,290,432,3.0,10/20/2014,"Come here for the bulgogi over riceI just come here for the Korean food. I've had the bulgogi bibimbap and the seafood bibimbap here, but I'm not a fan of the choice of vegetables. It's too diced, julienned would be better and I hate raw lettuce in bibimbap. The seafood was good. Spicy chicken over right was alright.On the other hand, the bulgogi over rice is highly recommended. The mouth watering meat came together well with the sautéed onions and peppers.",,,1
9,Katherine F.,"Bronx, NY",2,103,158,5.0,8/28/2015,I go to school around the area. The breakfast is always hot and toasty. Great coffee.,1,,
10,Frankie L.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,1.0,6/17/2017,"The guy at the counter always with the Bandana on his head I think he is from Mexico, is extremely rude and unfriendly. Use to go there all the time stopped because of his horrible attitude. Maybe someone should remind him that he works in customer service.",,,
11,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1,2.0,3/13/2014,"This unimaginatively named establishment is located next to a DMV. They share a similarity utilitarian aesthetic and lack of reputation for good cuisine. This place occupies the basement of a large office building. If you don't work inside I doubt there would be a single reason to come. (I do.)There's an attempt to do all sorts of dishes here from American Chinese classics like sesame chicken and lo mien to a Korean bar with kimchi fried rice and bulgogi sets and even a pizza oven. None of it stands out, although some things are less offensive than others. The ramyun - the Korean version of ramen - isn't bad, especially when ordered with an extra helping of the fiery sauce. Three chicken wings and a scoop of white rice makes a cheap, if not particularly nutrias lunch. The oatmeal is nice and rich, although I wish more toppings were included.Never, ever order the pizza. Avoid the roast meats that sometimes appear on the steam table. Skip the pressed sandwiches. All of these can be had for better within three blocks.This is a place of convenience and a captive audience. I just wish the recent renovation would have also brought with it a rethink and improvement of the food on offer.",,,
12,Jana L.,"New York, NY",209,368,684,2.0,3/27/2013,"OK service and food.Got the Korean bibimbap LOL.  Weird they would have this in a deli in Wall Street!!  It was okay.  The beef was good but they didn't give too much.  Whatever.  It was like a last minute scramble to find food.  I would stick to sandwiches.OH!  AND, you have to pay mother trucking 10 cents for a plastic cup and 75 cents for a cup and ice????  NYC Wall Street, you are ridiculous!  :(  thumbs down.  I don't know if all places are like that in NY, but that was just plain stupid.  I won't be drinking any ice or anything! -__-",,,
13,Kimberly B.,"Hooksett, NH",0,1,0,5.0,3/3/2017,Nice and clean. Tourist waiting to go to the Statue of Liberty.  We grabbed some breakfast sandwiches and they were great. They have a little bit of anything you could want.,,,
14,Susan L.,"New York, NY",179,1921,0,4.0,4/12/2012,"I was walking by here at 4:00 p.m. today and decided to have an early dinner from their salad bar (they also have a hot food bar, but by that time most of the choices were gone because they close at 5:00 p.m.).  However, they had a very decent amount of salad-type items (including pasta) and everything was tasty & fresh.  The price was $6.99/pound.  The young (female) cashier was very nice - and so were all of the guys working there, with the exception of one who was rather brusque.This place has an ""A"" rating from the Health Department.",2,,1
15,Victor H.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,68,18,4.0,9/10/2015,"This place has a lot of stuff: Pizza, a deli, Korean food, and something else that I forgot. The pizza is not the best, but the burger is good.",,1,
16,Billy T.,"Montclair, NJ",129,25,10,1.0,8/14/2014,"I'll keep it short and savory, the opposite of my experience waiting 30 minutes to get ramen here. Ramen. Really. The whole point of this trip was to pick up something quick to go, but the cooks lost my order. The best part is that it isn't even my order being lost because I get that mistakes happen even in the best establishments. I'm here yelping because the cashier was a jerk when I mentioned what happened. This portly, lamenting, unsympathetic cashier did nothing to recognize the service issue and instead shrugged me off. Our conversation was over when his response was: ""in the future you can just call in your order for pickup""",,,
17,Polly H.,"Queens, NY",187,785,616,3.0,3/31/2014,"I came here to get a smoothie.  It was a decent portion.  The prices here are high though.  A small banana and strawberry smoothie came out to $4.30.  I guess it is FiDi, and most people have money to spend on the salad bar which is $7.99/lb.  I saw breakfast meals as well as pizza, Korean meals, and even fried foods and rice.",,,
18,Ant T.,"Perth, Australia",4,11,11,1.0,10/3/2015,"This place is for tourists. Don't get the food from the hot/cold food bar!! They charge by weight, and my lunch cost $25!! This place has a bit of a mean streak, they put up signs everywhere, don't be holding drinks bought from outside. Toilets were a bit gross too.",,,
19,A S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/23/2016,"1. The spread is not very appetizing.  2. $10 minimum charge to use debit/credit cards. 3. Staff is extremely unfriendly. I did try to ask for an exception to the $10 rule, which I feel like is no big deal to just ask. All the guy had to do was smile and say ""Sorry, I can't."" Instead, he glared at me, pointed to the small sign that I hadn't even seen (given that I was a first time customer), and yelled ""$10 minimum!!!"" Given that this is downtown NYC and there are many other similar venues in the area with better quality on all three of these criteria, do yourself a favor and eat anywhere but here.",,,
20,Raquel P.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,40,12,3.0,3/31/2015,"This is my first time going to the Cafe Plaza Deli and I must say that I am surprised. I love korean food and didn't think that there was any place around my work place (I work on broad street) that would serve korean food. I ordered the bulgogi over rice and it was delicious. I am definitely planning on going back. If you don't just want korean food, i would suggest that eating from the buffet they also have which serves a variety of foods (fried chicken, rice, vegetables, fruit etc...)",,,
21,Mariuxi P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",37,12,9,1.0,8/5/2015,"Absolutely the wrost Ramen. It taste like cup of noodle with some red spices n mushrooms. I didn't have time to go back and voice my complain. But avoid having what they call "" Ramen"" here.",,,
22,Sukhrob B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,0,3.0,6/10/2014,"This place has everything from sandwiches to pizza and Korean food. I get a bagel and coffee here every morning and both are always good. I ordered a burger from here once and it was terrible, the meat was dry and overcooked. Their salad is usually fresh and worth trying. Stay away from the pizza, you can find better pizza in the area. The prices are on the expensive side, but its FiDi so that's to be expected. Service is fast and the cashiers are friendly. Overall it gives you options, some are better than others. Its worth a try.",3,2,2
23,Annaline D.,"New York, NY",1,33,25,3.0,4/5/2013,"OK folks, let's be real here. It is a deli on Wall Street. There are going to be things that they do better than others. It is not going to be particularly innovative or fancy-schmancy. It has counter-service so don't expect to get the white glove treatment. That said, however, most of the items are tasty, the prices are competitive, and, compared to a lot of Wall Street lunch staples, it is rarely terribly crowded. So if you need to pop in somewhere for a quick sandwich and coffee - you might as well do so here.",,,
24,Ganesh H.,"Eatontown, NJ",44,1,0,5.0,1/3/2016,"Can't believe this is the best pizza I've had in the US. Pizza was so soft I couldn't even feel biting into it. The topping was very flavourful. The stuffed fajita was also as good. If you lunch out near Broadway/Rechtor St a lot, give this place's pizza a shot, I assure you will love it.",,,
25,Tom B.,"Suffern, NY",27,27,1,4.0,1/12/2010,"A Friend stopped by on his way for a haircut, said he was in a Deli what did I want. I told him to grab a Roast Beef & Swiss. When I opened the sandwich I was surprised, it was decently portioned, and even more surprised when I bit into it. It was really good. Don't get me wrong it was no Rosario's but it was a good healthy sandwich.They use Boars Head which is always a plus, and they are competitively priced at $7 a sandwich (Competitive for Downtown NYC). They seem to never be that busy and they have a nice selection of Sandwiches, Buffet Items, and a sushi bar.We went back today tried the Terrayaki Chicken Sandwich, Glad to say they are 2 for 2. Give em a shot much better than most of the Downtown Delis.",1,,1
26,Yan P.,"New York, NY",6,58,1,5.0,1/11/2014,"If you work in the area and need a breakfast sandwich or lunch,  Cafe Plaza Deli is solid.  They will get you out the door quickly and the food is great.  I come here for a breakfast sandwich almost every day and lunch once or twice per week.",1,,
27,Ricardo K.,"Deerfield, IL",152,426,83,2.0,1/21/2013,"In the financial district, crowded, jump-in and the food is fresh. Stopped in for a hot cup of coffee. No free refills here.",,,
28,Cesca B.,"Brooklyn, NY",78,183,12,4.0,1/28/2009,"This is another staple of the financial district. It's close to my workplace, inexpensive, and offers variety. It's easy to miss this place (Stephanie J and I affectionately refer to it as ""the downstairs place"" because it is, essentially, downstairs from street level), and maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot by reviewing it because it's never crowded even at lunch, but I had to give Cafe Plaza Deli some love. It's kind of like the Variety Cafe's little brother. There are many of the same food options (sandwiches, pasta, pizza, panini, salad bar, burgers) but it's much smaller scale than Variety. I tend to choose CPD when I'm jonesing for a turkey burger -- they're really good and so are the fries that they make freshly for you. I haven't had much else here save the occasional tuna sandwich, but I'm planning to try the vegetarian panini next time. The guys who make the sandwiches are all super nice -- that helps. This place is pretty secluded and hard to find, but well worth the effort to get away from the throngs of bankers and tourists that clog up the more popular lunch venues.",3,,1
29,Das B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,1,1.0,11/2/2011,"These guys are pretty dodgy.  Hot breakfasts served cold.  Poor system of paying, long lines, etc.  Generally slow and rude service at the breakfast/sandwich counter.  The checkout woman is the only redeeming friendly quality of this place.  I recommend going elsewhere.",,,
30,Ready G.,"Flushing, NY",9,13,1,1.0,3/29/2009,"""NG"" -- No Good. Rude. Poor, overpriced food. After three chances this place struck out for me. The first time, they were just straight up rude. Second time I was overcharged for the breakfast combo (even after pointing it out). But the final straw was the poor excuse for a burrito that was nearly 8 duckits. This thing was scrawny. I ordered the first one listed on the menu (w/ chicken and bacon). Asked the cook to put in avocado, and thank got that I did, b/c without it, it would have been inedible. There aren't many places open around here on weekends, but avoid this place and take your $8 to Chipotle across the street instead.",,,
31,Jessica M.,"Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/2/2014,"The word disgusted does not provide due justice to my first and last experience with this place.  I am a pregnant women who was just looking for a quick bite to eat.  Upon arrival into the restaurant, I first figured let me use the restroom before placing an order.  I walked up to an employee and politely asked where the restroom was - his exchange was muttered (incomprehensible), I figured due to the language barrier.  I inched closer excusing myself for not understanding him the first time and in return he responded by popping up and screaming - again something incoherent while pointing at the door gesturing me to get out like a lunatic.   I just stood there for a good minute before basically running out the door, staring at him in shock, wondering what the causation could be for me to be treated like this.  Clearly he saw that I was pregnant and I wouldn't have even been upset if he told me the facilities were for paying customers as I would have either insured him that I was planning on dinning there, or ordered something first.  I am so wound up over how I was treated, I urge everyone and anyone who plans on stopping by to keep it moving as you will find CLEANER spots to in addition to decent service.  The upkeep of this place and customer service are enough to persuade you to skip a meal, talk about losing your appetite.",,,
