1,Wendy S.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",56,17,0,1.0,9/23/2018,"We went here for brunch and to listen to the Beatles cover band. The band was super entertaining totally worth the cover.  The service was awful, they used one kitchen for an upstairs and downstairs seating. I asked for water for the table 3 times and then went to the bar and got it myself.  We ordered three drinks , only two came, so again I went to the bar and got it myself.We waited 1.5 hours for food and half of it came and one meal was wrong. One person in our party never got their meal.  We waited 20 minutes for a bill that was wrong. It was very frustrating!!  Go here for music not for food.",,,
2,Pascal D.,"PRINCE, NY",125,14,46,2.0,9/4/2018,"The only working winery in the city "" said the MC at a recent visit to watch a concert by bebel Gilberto .Do not assume the wines to be discounted though as a matter of fact the prices are anything but reasonable and the pour is well Poor at the very special price of $25 for a Special California Syrah or $22 for a Bordeaux st Emilion. At that price you better savor it , the 4oz pour will go down at the third sip! Imagine a farmer telling you he has the only working chicken farm in the neighborhood and the dozen of eggs from California are $15 ....Bebel concert was short 1 hour ,  the Artist was irritated by the acoustic and the sound engineer who did not get it right. I have to agree with her but we did not get to hear her In an encore performance as she left abruptly and disappointed my partner K...I who purchased the 2 best seats in the house! I have been a local for over 3 decades and it's sad to see establishments like city Winery ""the only working winery in the city"" to only be concerned with profits to the detriment of the guest experience.",1,,

Updated review","Enjoyed this spot as a music venue. Cozy, intimate place to catch a great show. I recommend sitting in the VIP seating. It's elevated a bit, and the tickets are that much more expensive. The food wasn't that good, but wasn't terrible. I expected a little more, but I suppose that is not their focus. Great wine selectionUPDATE - 7/28A little after I posted the review above (originally 4/5 stars) the manager contacted me and told me he wanted to have us back to see if he could put a better taste in our mouth. Obviously we said yes and we picked a show in July for the new upstairs ""Loft"". Everyone was extremely friendly and enthusiastic to ""show us a better time"". I had to go back and re-read my review because I didn't think it was that bad!  This time we had the arugula salad, hummus, and burrata. Naturally, with a few glasses of wine. The food was really good. Salad was fresh and had a mix of greens, avocado, strawberry, quinoa, and hearts of palm. It was a perfect mix and the quinoa added a nice texture to the plate. The hummus was perfect. The burrata was served on a tomato jam and came with fresh warm bread. All very tasty. I really appreciated the request to go back to try the new menu. It's not like I trashed the establishment with my first review, so I think it shows how much they care about quality and customer satisfaction.",2,,
4,Carlos D.,"Butler, NJ",39,56,71,4.0,9/17/2018,"Stopped in this place before going upstairs to the Loft, for a pop up concert. Was busy but seated fast. Has some tables but mainly long tables with stools and group seating. The bar is big and has the winery next door. Offering tours at different times. We ordered the charcuterie board to start and was satisfied. Not a lot of variety but everything was really tasty and went well together. The wife and I both ordered the duck tacos, which was a great choice. Again not a lot but super tasty, the tortillas are made fresh. Service was good and prompt, especially for being busy and us being time sensitive. Would stop by again if around the area.",2,,2
5,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,12/15/2017,"I came on a Monday night and decided to sit at the bar. Opted for a wine to wind down the night. Most of the wine menu is actually from Napa and coming from California I wanted to try something else. Tried several wine samples before settling on the syrah wine, which has black currant and blackberry undertones. Very smooth and easy to consume. The pour was quite generous and definitely more than a glass. One neat thing is the walk to the restroom is also where some wine barrels are stored and aged. It's temperature controlled so felt like walking into a refrigerator. Service at the bar was good since there weren't too many other patrons. Lighting was dim and had a more romantic vibe.",4,1,3
6,Fred T.,"New York, NY",5,1,4,1.0,11/16/2018,"My friend and I went to brunch last Saturday to see a wonderful group called the Nightingales. That's where wonderful ended. Everything else about our experience was terrible! None of the cocktails on the menu were available. Our waitress wasn't familiar with the ""new"" food items. Our food came out cold except for the side of bacon which never came out at all. Sent it back. My friend's came back cold and mine came out tepid. The potatoes are more than likely in a steam tray which means it's not up to temp which can cause food poisoning!!! Had a hard time getting coffee refills. Ordered draft beers which weren't draft but in cans. I owned a restaurant for 10 years before I sold it. Watching how this space is run was excruciating. They all worked harder not smarter. It was the managers first day but instead of making sure everyone's experience was the best it could be by helping his staff, he stood in the back of the room watching the music. Dreadful. Save yourself the frustration and only come for the music.",,,
7,Ethan G.,"Washington, DC",6,36,7,5.0,9/15/2018,"The ORIGIONAL City Winery, this place is really cool! It is the headquarters for the whole operation (New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington D.C., Boston, and Nashville). They make the wines on site, which is super cool. They really know what they are doing. And the food is amazing.",,,
8,Amanda P.,"Hoboken, NJ",11,62,53,2.0,8/31/2018,"Without a doubt, the absolute worst service experience I have ever had and do not plan to return. Had it not been for the manager who adjusted our check to reflect the quality of service provided to us, my rating would have been a -5 stars. We waited and waited and watched as the wait and bar staff fooled around and completely ignored our group of 6. It was our friends' birthday dinner and being a group of 6, it's understood that we may need to wait a little longer than a group of 3 or 4. Please note that the restaurant was not what I would consider ""busy"" (approximately 15-20 patrons including us). Our orders were eventually taken and that's when things went really downhill:1) Many of us wanted to order the chicken special, but were told that the special is for tomorrow not tonight. Um, ok. So don't include an insert to the menu that says ""Today's special"" if it's for tomorrow.2) Our appetizers never arrived. We were given so many excuses as to why 1 order of risotto balls and 1 order of Brussels sprouts was taking almost 35 mins. First, the bus boy fell (which if that is true is terrible). Then, the ""head food expediter"" was going to bring them. We also had to ask for silverware and water multiple times as they weren't provided. 3) 2 of our groups meals arrives. Still, no apps.4) We spoke to the bartender/server and wanted to know where the food was and to say that it's been almost 45 mins since we put in our order and all it is , is a few burgers. 5) Waitress brings over 2 beers and a glass of wine to apologize for the long wait. She later claims she brought over drinks for the whole table. Still, no apps.6) The food came out and while the fries were good, there was something incorrect about everyone's meal (example, I ordered cheddar and got Swiss but at this point I was starving so I ate it). 7) About half way through dinner, the risotto balls came. Still, no Brussels sprouts.8) As I finished my meal, I said to the waitress, ""What happened to the Brussels sprouts?"" She said, ""The kitchen is redoing them right now."" Huh? One of our group members requested to speak with the manager after seeing that we were charged for the Brussels sprouts. After an exhausting exchange with him, our bill was greatly adjusted. I was also very clear with him that I would be posting a review on Yelp. While I would like to believe that it was an ""off night"" I will certainly not take my chances and go back (btw, prices are a little high for the overall quality of food.",1,,
9,Davaish S.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",63,246,171,3.0,4/27/2018,"Service here is actually pretty good, just a weird space for large groups. We were there on a night where 3/4 of the place was closed off to a private event. We ended up as a group of 8 on a tightly packed high top table. The food selection is pretty limited and steak was decent but the sides and potatoes were very good. The spinach dip and burrata were the best parts of the meal and overall very good. Duck tacos were ok and did not come made you had to assemble. Drinks were good especially bourbon, wine  and cocktails.Overall it would be four stars if the seating was better. The waitress for the space and crowd handled it well",2,1,1
10,Kim W.,"DeLand, FL",244,311,19,5.0,8/23/2018,"A great place to have dinner, drinks and see a show. The food was delicious. Out waiter, Stephen, was enthusiastic and attentive. G&Ts were on point.Our table mates were interesting and fun, and Glenn Tilbrook sounded great, as always. I highly recommend.",,,
11,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",135,110,275,3.0,3/21/2018,"My fiance and I are regulars here as we often attend shows here since he is a VinoFile member.The shows here are great, 5/5. It is a very intimate setting and seating is always a plus, I mean who likes to stand in large crowds right? However the seating arrangements are TERRIBLE because there is absolutely zero personal space. You're literally sitting on top of the person next to you. The food here is a solid 3/5. It's not great, it's not terrible, it's okay; definitely not memorable. For the price you pay, you'd expect something more in quality not quantity. Last night we ordered the mushroom flatbread and finger cut fries because we were running late and did not get a change to grab dinner before hand like we usually do. The fries were all small ends, barely had a handful of actual fries. The flatbread was burnt to a crisp and hard but the mushroom and arugula on it was good. The service here is 1/5. 1 for the hostesses in the front, they are friendly and efficient in getting you seated right away. The waiter and waitresses here are so SLOW, and this is every time! Its bad enough you barely get served in a timely manner but you have to keep asking and waving just any server down. The bottle with a card for service did not solve their issue, they don't even look at that. A tip I have is always ask for your bill as soon as you're done ordering because the bill doesn't come out to the end of the show and then for them to actually take your card, you're waiting another 20-30 minutes. Overall a 5/5 for shows but everything else is just A-Okay.",1,,
12,Cheryl N.,"Manhattan, NY",165,292,1038,4.0,9/16/2017,"Great venue! Vino, food, great bands, what's not to love. I have been here twice in the last year, most recently a couple of days ago to see Parachute play. I love the intimate nature of this venue even though it seems to seat a lot of people.  We were in the first row of tables which is a high traffic area, but great view. If you are off to the side though you may not see all of the stage.  Seats are crammed together, but not too close, still enough breathing room.Wine: great selection of wines. My friend and I loved their French Malbec (hiccup). Wine will run you $11-14 per glass but it is a full pour.Food: Surprisingly good. I had the crusted tuna special. It was seared to perfection and juicy. My only complaint was that one small section was heavily peppered distracting from the tuna flavor. The French fries are also great their and their salads and pizzas are generously portioned. *Note: You can arrive 2 hours before the show to eat... you can eat during the show too, but best to get there an hour before so you can see the menu and order without distracting from the performance. Also, there will be less people there and less likely to bump elbows with someone.Service: Our server was top notch, she was there for us when we needed her. There was a guy walking around with wine samples, and I was disappointed that he never came over to us. We got their early and wasn't crowded (sniff sniff) :( Great idea, though, if you are one of the lucky ones.",1,,

15,Elizabeth D.,"Plainview, NY",73,198,119,5.0,3/17/2018,I loved the City Winery! We came here to see a show. The wine selection is fantastic! You can buy the wine they make their and take it home. They have great food as well! This place is huge and downstairs you can see the wine barrels. I had so much fun here. I'm going back soon and bringing a guest from out of town.,,,
16,Lauren R.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,116,356,3.0,2/4/2018,"City Winery is a fun spot to catch a show in Tribeca. I saw Joe Purdy a folk singer play this weekend.One great perk is they offer assigned seating so you can book ahead of time and don't have to stand. However, the tables and seats are close together so it's definitely cozy. City Winery offers a full menu you so you can order dinner, drinks, or dessert before or during the show. My friend and I shared a great bottle of wine and the sommelier was able to help us choose a fantastic red from Portugal. They happened to be sold out of many of the less expensive bottles on the menu ($45-55). They have a good variety of wines at almost any price from $45-$200+.Overall, I recommend City Winery for a show. It's a comfortable setting with good sound. It would be a great place to take your parents or go with a group of friends. My only two minor drawbacks are that they don't give you a lot of space between tables so it felt a bit cramped and they had run out of many of the reasonably priced bottles of wine, which left fewer options outside of increasing our price range.",1,,
17,Sophia B.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",430,222,188,4.0,5/12/2018,"What an amazing experience! I discovered a new band, and that they were playing here like 2 days later. While the show was sold out, I showed up in person like 1.5 hours early, and they were able to squeeze me in. This venue is absolutely beautiful, though it's clear it wasn't expressly designed as a concert venue (sort of a little of the fun too). It's also so nice to go to a concert where there is great food to be had-I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the roasted carrots with hazelnuts, and I thought that was just such a wonderful side order. Totally filling, tasty, and not bad on the wallet! The prices are definitely up there, but all of the ingredients look like they are worth it so I can't even be mad. Excited for the next time I get to be in this fun venue.",3,,1

Made a reservation on Open Table as we had been here before and it can get very busy. Came directly from Penn Station with luggage which they kindly stored. We were seated by the window and had a magnificent view of a snowy winter night in Soho. The waitress was amazing and gave great recommendations. They had Hip music playing in the background which made the atmosphere even more enjoyable. It was quieter that our last visit but it was a nice change. We ordered the rice balls to start and they were absolute perfection. I highly recommend City Winery- we will definitely be back. The food was excellent. Also, They make there own wine and brought us complimentary mulled wine which was delicious. Highly recommend!",,,

Decided to keep driving to City Winery since we had visited before for a wine tasting event. We looked on their site and saw a well known performer was scheduled to play that night. Parking on the street was pretty easy and they were pretty good about accommodating us at a table we were comfortable with. The menu was kind of plain so we decided to go with the special that our waiter recommended and the dishes sounded much more exciting than the menu offered. I chose the fish and my husband the steak and it did not disappoint. Meal was terrific. We ordered a bottle of wine from their bid selection. We were offered a sample of the performers wine. The show was AMAZING! They always seem to choose amazing and well known performers and Ruthie Foster was incredible! We had a great experience. The ambiance, staff, food and show were perfect! My only complaint was trying to pre-reserve on the site which was difficult because when we arrived our table had been sold. However they did make it up by accommodating us at another table. Will definitely be back!",,,

Good wine choices, there were merchandise vendors in the back and you could even purchase a bottle of wine and/or album signed by the artist! (Which included a photo wine label of the artist).

I came her to see Alice Smith (if you dont know her you better get to it). I've seen her before but usually standing room only spots. So when I saw yhis was a seated venue where every seat looks like a good one... I jumped on it. Sadly, the service wasn't stellar. I took into consideratiom that it's a music spot, but if you're gonna be a spot that does drinks and food with music you better bring it. Our waiter was incognito foe most of the night... i woyld see other wait staff milling atound continuously but our person might as well been non existent. It took my frienf and myself 30mins to flag them down for a second drink... which wasn't great at all.  Basically the next time I come I'll eat beforehand and have water all night, while I listen to amazing artists and musicians.",5,2,5
25,Saiki D.,"New York, NY",1,38,22,3.0,2/15/2018,"Mrs. Saiki D surprised me with a concert with Mark Cohen.   Now there is some confusion so please be aware.   There is a difference buying the tickets when you click on the photo of the entertainer on the web site and added tickets by the concierge, we did the later...which gets the potluck for seating.    The  confirmation email you receive says first come first serve so we show up when the doors open and we're shown to our seats near the door....Mrs Saiki D took this up with the concierge.   We bopped around to a few more seats but were told everything was booked.   We were even told the bar stools were occupied.    I have attached the open tables and bar stools that were supposedly taken.   Also note if you are a bigger patron the smurf sized tables and tight seating arrangement might make the evening a bit uncomfortable. Now onto the venue. Coat check is downstairs.....the young lady had a plastic container of food she brought from home.   I asked her why she said she was a picky eater.   I was worried my meal would be suspect.   We ordered a bottle of wine, meat and cheese platter,  burrata and farro dish.   All tapas style and all served at once... again smurf tables do not accommodate 4 plates a bottle wine blah blah.     Food was decent so this was a pleasant surprise.    The show was very good with some surprise guests.    Other than the smurf tables and the seating disaster .. it was a nice gift by Mrs Saiki D.    If you do chose visit the establishment we recommend getting another couple to come with this way you can have some extra room.Bathroom is down stairs and very clean and spaciousFood: 6.

36,Brian F.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",367,195,314,3.0,3/15/2017,"First off, when you ask a New York hotel concierge for a suggestion of a cool, unique place to go for your first night in NYC, you expect that they'll recommend a local staple, a representation of the community and the city that never sleeps!You don't expect to get sent to City Winery, especially when you know that there's one in Chicago that is like 4 times the size.But I digress. I assume on the positive side, that the recommendation was just due to the ease of getting there, its proximity to the hotel, and the lack of knowledge of my preferences and tastes.One thing that was spot on was that the service at this place was above average, after having to wait a little long to be handed a menu. The server was attentive and knowledgeable about the wines and the menu, so she made up for the delay. There was also just the right amount of checking in and beverage refilling.I sat on the south side of the building, the ""left"" entrance, since there was a live band in the main area of the venue. It was nice, the music was muffled from the other side, so I was able to relax in a peaceful calm.As far as the meal, I had the LaFrieda Burger and added cheese, bacon, and avocado. It was definitely mouthwatering delicious, requiring two full hands to encompass the breadth of ingredients (IG @bjflores). I would definitely recommend to anyone craving a burger.In the end, I don't think I'll be back here. And this is not because I had a bad experience, or the food wasn't good. This place is a fine establishment and would probably be a great place to enjoy live music. There just wasn't enough for me to say, ""Wow!"", and with the diversity and expansive options of restaurants and venues close by, I'd rather explore other options.",5,4,3

Paired with S'mores and Creme Brulee, it was ""Girls Night Out"" heaven. The place has much charm. We were seated in the barrel room.

My friend and I ordered two different salads for lunch and when they arrived, we both looked at each other and commented how ""sad"" our salads looked. I've dined all over the world and eat out a ton but can say this is the worst salads I've ever seen. Nothing like the pic shown here! Maybe the chef was out. Still would have not been excusable. If only I had taken a pic...The waitress, about 30 larger woman, gave terrible customer service, too. We ordered wine and she never brought water even though we asked. When we asked again when the food was served she showed attitude. Then when she brought us a check when waters were already empty and never refilled them. Go to enjoy the outdoors in NYC summertime here. Nothing else.",2,2,

Did not know they even existed let alone that they have these scattered around the US. The concept is a music venue meets a wine bar. Very casual elegant decor. I can easily see someone renting this place for a reception or anniversary. The staff is friendly and attentive. I give them night marks for rising orders and serving your food while doing their best not to disturb the show. They have a great lunch/dinner menu and wine selection. I opt d for the hummus platter and was very pleased. I have a slight obsession with hummus and they receive high marks from me! The party next to me ordered the flatbread and it looked amazing! Note that if you attend a concert you are assigned seats at the same table with other guests unless you buy out the entire table/booth. Some people were surprised to find that they were sharing their table.  Overall a great night, great food and great atmosphere!",2,1,1

44,Jeannette L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1436,781,2455,4.0,1/19/2017,"I'm rounding up a 3.5 to 4 star rating. City Winery is a beautiful spot - classy and sophisticated - but it's not for me. I went here to see a performer, who was great, but the venue was OK to me. The food and wine is really good here, but it will cost you. I came here with my partner to see Booker T & and the MG's play. It was a great show. There was an audio issue with the house sound though - it was noticeable enough where Booker T. needed to improvise (what a professional). Fortunately, being a seasoned musician, he knew how to handle the situation and the show went on. Had it been another act on stage, the audio would have been a big problem and the audience would have been bothered. City Winery is a nice venue and offers a variety of musical performances. My only complaint is that seating was super tight and cramped. I felt like the dude next to me was practically sitting on my lap. Plus, what could have also soured my experience was the there were really annoying winos sitting at our table who wouldn't stop talking during the entire performance (I hate that). Outside of that, I'd say it's a fine music venue. If you see an act on the calendar that you want to see and they're not playing anywhere else, go check them out at City Winery.",25,13,27

The ""service"" was non-existent. I had to go up to the host stand and ask if I should order at the bar because no one came to my table for over 20 minutes to even greet me! Grant it, I had reserved for a table for 6, and was the first to arrive, but I still would like to be acknowledged and offered the option of a beverage while I wait. Whether you are dining solo or in a group of 8 - you should receive the same service. I had to flag someone down for every little thing. After watching the hostess/bartender scarf down her dinner at the bar, she then noticed me and offered me a drink. The entire staff was un-attentive and unfriendly.

I go here for any Tyrone Wells concert, and any time someone I like is there, or sometimes just for the wine and experience. Tickets are SO reasonable!! SO sad to hear they will be closing down soon! Hopefully they will relocate. It's hard to find a little slice of peace in NYC, but you can certainly find it in City Winery. The decor is very warm and inviting, for either a date, or night out with a friend. The wines are SO full of flavor and really great, and the servers are all so knowledgeable in the wines and describing their flavor as well if you are deciding between a few. They'll even let you try one or two. The food is really delish. The Burrata is one of our favorites. The flatbreads are really good too. Shows here are just SO great. I always sit in the front, because if you sit in the back it can get a little loud. Service here is excellent as well.

Anyways, small issue because lucky for us the other 2 people at our table didn't show up till a half hour before the end of the show. We got some menus and ordered. We waited over 20 minutes for our food but no complaints there, the food was really amazing. We ordered flatbread pizza, burger, artichoke balls and 2 amazing bottles of wine and of course 2 desserts. Pictures below. Loved everything we ordered, especially the wine.

54,Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",269,745,79,2.0,12/16/2016,"Disappointing. For a place called ""City Winery"", I would have expected a more expensive wine list, but  there were only about 10 options if you wanted to order by the glass. Slightly more options if you opt for a bottle, but most restaurants do a better job. We had a large reservation for 1:30 PM as this was for a corporate lunch, but got told once we arrived that we would need to be out the door by 3 PM for a private party. It would have been nice to know about this in advance so that we didn't feel like we had to rush. The wines themselves aren't too bad - nothing to rave about and I would recommend the flight, but I didn't think any of the ones I got served were amazing or that memorable. I ordered the ravioli as my entree and was really surprised to find that it only comes with 4 pieces of pasta for $19... it was pretty good, but definitely not worth it at all and I was still very hungry after. All in all, not really worth the experience. Everything about this place was underwhelming.",6,,

The wording in there email explains arrive two hours early for a private tour of the wine cellar.  I didn't have much interest in the tour.I paid for a meet and greet, four course tasting menu with wine paring, and show tickets. When we entered the venue where it was indicated for Mastercard Priceless Experience to enter we talked with the host.  The host couldn't even find our name, and when she did she sat us upstairs with a regular menu.  After being confused for a while, we finally found a manager who escorted downstairs to the private area where dinner had already taken place.  We were promised our dinners would be served upstairs... during the opening act... and the food never came.  Whoever checked us in, (I'm still not sure if she was employed by Mastercard or City Winery) should have sent us directly downstairs to enjoy the meal with everyone else.  I still don't understand why were brought to out seats upstairs. Awful employees ruined my experience.  Two waiters came from downstairs to check how my food was, and I explained I never got it and I did not want to eat during the main show. I was compensated with a beer...This place might be great, but if they are going to be hosting these types of special events which I paid a few hundred dollars to enjoy, the execution has to be priceless!

Updated review","I went back to City Winery and saw a fantastic show with the one and only John Hammond (okay, he's technically ""Jr."") and I have to say, the more time I spend there, the more I've come to appreciate how smoothly the place works: before the show, the staff is attentive and there's a nice choice of food and beverage (the fries in a cone are super), and during the show, they stay out of the way so that you can enjoy the music, and then about a half-hour before it ends, they discreetly get you your bill and handle your transactions. I've heard they will have to move out eventually, but if the management can transfer this to a new location, I'll keep coming back. Thanks!",,,

Overpriced drinks with a rude bartender who seemed not to know much about mixed drinks. She was annoyed when I asked for some suggestions, she came up with only one.The waiter was very kind, he was on point with his service. A tip for the manager, you need a nicer bartender, especially for that kind of venue that rips customers off. Do not waste your time at this place. There are local places in NYC with great service.

The pizza was also delicious, and how could you go wrong with pizza and wine? You can't, that's the answer. The Wassasbassco show was really fun, the seating was a little cramped, but we went there early and got really good seats. So there's a pro-tip for ya. The bathrooms are in the basement, which I had a hard time trying to find the stairwell, but it's literally in the middle of the restaurant. if you go to the Halloween show, plan on wearing a really awesome costume, you may win their costume contest!",5,1,3

66,Priti R.,"New York, NY",320,405,57,3.0,10/20/2015,"I am very conflicted about this place! Came here on a Monday night with 4 acts presenting.THE  BAD: Holy crap, is this place cramped! We had ""great"" tickets - and I say ""great"" because... we were a few tables from center stage and it almost felt TOO close. But more importantly, we got there a bit after the first act started, and as a result we were left with cramming into our seats that were sandwiched between tables on every side. I couldn't move my chair an inch without hitting someone else's. I couldn't whisper something in my friend's ear  or even pour myself a glass of water without receiving glares from others for being ""too loud"". I mean, we paid a lot for these seats, I didn't realize we would have  only a box to sit in. Additionally, the acoustics were a bit off the night we went (10/19). If you're sitting too close to the stage, it doesn't sound that great. Also when the last artist came on to play, something funky was going on with the cords and there was static being heard during his act. It was clear that the musician was getting frustrated. Granted, I get the sound guy probably just had an off night - we all do, I understand. THE GOOD: Well, it's a winery! It's got gorgeous decor inside, and it IS actually quite spacious - I just wish they would make better use of the space! The service was pretty normal and the bathrooms were clean. The wines on tap are decent (cheapest bottle is a SB for $40).   Aside from the bad acoustics / sound difficulties, all the musicians were really great. This is a great place for a group and is just such a nice, intimate space with fantastic lighting. Big open windows lining the street. Avg. price for wine is $14-15, for an appetizer ~$12, and a dish ~$17. Honestly, my family is coming into town and honestly, given the location and space of this place, I would like to take them here. Likely so, but I hope we won't have super cramped seats!",6,3,2

Could not have been happier! We first heard about it at the Botanical Garden Wien tasting event. The wine is great. The place is absolutely adorable. It was a little hot, but otherwise the ambiance is great. Our waiter was incredibly kind and accommodating and let us know what we were able to choose using our voucher. You could choose pretty much anything, including dinner specials so they certainly don't cheap out on the offerings! We chose Pork Belly and Artichoke Risotto balls as our appetizers to share. The pork was so good!! Tasted amazing and pretty unique. I love rice/risotto balls so I was pumped about those. You got a lot with an order and the tomato sauce for dipping was delicious. My only let down was that you didn't taste much Artichoke. For dinner I had the fried chicken and my boyfriend had the steak. We were both very happy! The steak was cooked a little bit more than my boyfriend had asked for, so beware of that! But the fried chicken was probably the best I ever had. I don't understand some of the negative reviews. The seasoning was delicious and it was so crispy. The chicken remained moist and I loved the corn win pieces of ham. It all went together so nicely. For dessert we opted for cheesecake and crime brûlée and we were pleased with each. The wine at each course was delicious! The dessert wine was a little too sweet for me but I really loved the red & white. Absolutely recommend this whether you have a voucher or not!",7,,

But this show was actually fun and more funny and silly than racy. The host was non stop funny and the women (and one man) dancers in the show were playful and talented. We had one of the only non community tables for 2 which I think is is better for a date. Drinks. Initially I was apprehensive to order a local wine as I am particular. I ordered a Mezcel old fashioned which wasn't so great. Next time I ordered a Grenache and was very pleasantly surprised - the wine was very good.Food.

Regardless of the venue's shortcomings, that's good.I don't have dinner here, because it is just too cramped to eat, but, last night, we ordered the cheese plate ($18). It wasn't enough food to feed a family of ants at a picnic. Four tiny slivers of cheese, half a miniscule fig, a few dried cherries, and the smallest dried apricot I've ever seen. Also, about 1/8 teaspoon of honey. Good with the cheese, but you needed a magnifying glass to see it.The wine is pricey. There's too many choices on the menu, and if you pick something, there's a good chance they're out of it. The pours are small for the per-glass price. Our tab was $56, plus tip, for two glasses of house wine, one bottle of beer, and the cheese plate.Our server was excellent, but the people sitting near us were beyond obnoxious. I can't blame the venue for that, but it did dampen the experience. The guy sitting in my lap was filming the entire show on his cell phone and texting it. The couple from Texas across the table were screaming and whooping at the top of their lungs, catcalling, singing along, and stomping their feet. I was waiting for the artist on stage to stop the show and tell them to STFU. Whattaya gonna do...we live in the age of ""me"".Would I come back to City Winery again?

80,Jenny R.,"Bronx, NY",0,21,0,5.0,5/12/2018,"This is an example of lemons into lemonade. I'm not trying to dwell on negative so I'll try to be succinct. There were some scheduling issues, when I first arrived with a friend, and the response by one of their employees was completely unsatisfactory. But this is where it turned around. Once manager Randall came to assist. It was nothing but uphill from there. Randall calmed the situation, gave us a very interesting and detailed wine tour of the facility and how it produces wine. Served us a beautiful flight. You must try their cab and petite verdoux, they're delicious and comped us tickets to their performance venue. The piece de resistance was Ed singing me happy birthday. My frown was really turned upside down. Randall then called up City Vineyard and we were treated wonderfully by Matt and Rodrigo. Even comping some items to make up for the initial challenge. This could have been a no star review and I was going to only put 4 but then as I began to write this I felt that City Winery had put so much effort into making this up to me they deserved their 5 stars. City Winery is beautiful, their manager is a gem. Their wines are delicious. They definitely deserve your visit.",,,1

But the last two times I've been, the service has been almost laughably bad and the food has been terrible. Highlights: Waiting 45 for service and being told 3 times someone would come, snotty waitresses that are defensive and rude (at no time were we rude to any of the staff), raw shishito peppers, lukewarm tea water, pizza that shouldn't be served in NYC. The best moment, though, was when they refused to steam vegetables for someone with a limited diet and told them it would be a $15/$25 plating fee (depending on who you asked) to eat her own food out of her own container with her own fork. She ate in the bathroom because it was too cold outside. Anyway, bottom line is, go for the entertainment but eat somewhere else before hand.",,,

I do not recommend this place to anyone. Save yourself money and time, and grab an Uber to Le Bain",1,,
84,David B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,12/27/2017,"I really like the space but the reason I'm leaving only one star is because of the wine steward who basically ruined my evening. Long story short, she embarrassed me in front of my girlfriend by saying how I should not order pinot noir on a date and instead I should go for something ""bigger and bolder like Russian cab"" or whatever else she said in her native tongue. My girlfriend thought that was very funny and couldn't stop laughing and making fun of me for the rest of the night. The wine steward came to our table couple more times just to ask more random questions so I kept feeling uncomfortable. Obviously, I couldn't wait for the show to be over.",,,

Our server was nice but didn't know much about the menu, confusing the eggs benedict my dad ordered with salmon benedict. She returned to our table to let us know they were out of salmon, even though she had written down ""eggs benedict"" - so we're not sure where the communication got lost.  My mom's and my's meals arrived cold; after a few minutes we asked where my dad's eggs benedict was. The server said she ""put it in the computer a couple seconds after the others,"" so she went to check on it. After 15 minutes, my dad's eggs benedict finally arrived. In his first bite, he found half a shell still attached to the egg. The server said she would comp his dish but this wasn't reflected on the bill. Overall, a pretty mediocre experience, especially when the ticket cost and meal totaled $200 for 3 people. Will not be returning or recommending to others.",,,

They  brought the french toast but completely forgot the sausage. After we reminded them, it still took anoter 15 minutes before the sausage came out. The waiter spilled the syrup and never came back with syrup for us to put on the food. What really made this place horrible was the slow and uncaring service. From the manager to the waitress they seem to be lacking the concern to please the customers.

I ordered before the show started and didn't get my appetizer until the show was almost over and it was really crappy - fried risotto balls that were dry and flavorless and had almost none of the promised tomato sauce. The slow service wasn't exactly my waiter's fault - they were clearly severely understaffed, for which management is to blame.

92,Marisa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,612,638,3.0,8/2/2017,"I came here for a concert and think it is a pretty cool venue to see a show at. You were seated at a table which is quite small so there isn't too much room for your food or drinks but it keeps it feeling cozy and intimate. I think no matter where you are you have a pretty good view of the stage and the bad. We went to see a band called Kings ask which had a pretty relevant opener. The show also ended pretty early. Unfortunately I was not impressed by any of the food. We had that talk tacos, shishito peppers and I had one of the worst kale Caesar salad's. So, I don't recommend going for more than picking finger food. The wind was pretty good and we got their in-house bottle but it also wasn't particularly affordable when it came down to it. All in all I would be back if there was a good show here because I like the atmosphere so much but I would be pretty cautious about the food because nothing really stood out to me.",1,1,1

If you don't, prepare to be obstructed by all the foot traffic from the servers and the patrons heading to the restroom. The seats are also very packed in and not very comfortable.  oh and the food is mediocre, but the wine is good. One other tip. If you buy tickets to the show there is no way to resell them on ticket trading sites ( stub hub etc.) since there are no physical tickets. Unexpectedly, I had to be out of town and when i asked management about this they told me that i can post the tickets on social media. That did not work for me and i threw out $140.

97,Hyesil C.,"New York, NY",341,122,162,1.0,8/2/2017,"With an immense array of phenomenal wine bars in the city, you really need to hit all the basics to even stand a chance. City Winery, however, fell short. Let me start off by saying that the place itself is very quaint and cute with a few tables and communal bar-type seats- the vibe is great. You also walk through a room with barrels of wine to get to the bathroom and then there is an actual music hall/ venue in the back. With that being said, the service, food and wine was disappointing. Our server was inattentive and quite frankly, rude. She seemed to pass on some judgment when we asked for the happy hour menu. We ordered a carafe of the rose which didn't even give us two full glasses each- maybe 1 1/2 glasses each. We were better off just ordering by the glass. We then ordered the cheese board and zucchini fries. The cheese board was very lackluster. I can make better cheese boards at home. The zucchini fries, however, were phenomenal and I could've eaten a whole plate of them. Then came the kicker- we get the bill and she charged us full price for everything. So I flagged her down and made her aware that we had ordered everything during happy hour and she proceeded to answer that ""its only a few dollars..."" I still asked her to rectify the bill and she just huffed and walked away. She came back 15 minutes later with a corrected bill and no apology whatsoever. We paid and left and I will most definitely not be back.",1,,

There is also a  private room that looks to seat around 20 in the cellar. They can organize tours of the winery itself and can set up multiple additional bar stations as well as food stations. At one event they also allowed us to set up a photo booth, corn hole, and beer pong.From awards ceremonies to big company holiday parties, it's a good spot.",1,,

It's just standard scrambled eggs, sausage, mushy French toast, potatoes (they were much better last year), so-so salad, very good smoked salmon and ok bagels w/ cream cheese.   The service is not the greatest, but our server made a good attempt once she found us!!  She seemed a bit lost.That aside: 5 stars for the band & the woman with the great voice: ""shooby dooby...""  Jazzy Klezmer!

I wanted to see the band live, but that was a private event, they did have them playing on a television as we ate. I loved my waiter/bartender his name is Mario, so far the best service since I have in the city (and I have been to nicer more expensive restaurants). He was very friendly, sweet and attentive the whole evening. We started with a glass of red wine and the cheese board the cheese was perfect. For dinner I ordered the filet mignon special and honestly, I have had better cuts of filet, but the topping was great.

The ""ground level"" seats were all reserved. At that point, the staff energetically stepped up and prepared a private party for us in the winery. I had seen this in the photos on the website. They quickly set up a table and chairs in this unique industrial space. The brought in a high chair for my grand-daughter and were totally accommodating.Even though there was a concert going on in the main hall and the restaurant was packed, the staff managed to attend to us with a smile.The food and desserts were  good-and of course, the wine was exceptional.

(It feels nothing like Joe's Pub, for example, which feels like downtown NYC).  And the sound system isn't particularly good if your not seating at the first set of table immediately in front of the stage. The food and service is fine.Update - March 2018.  I went here again recently and all the staff were particularly welcoming and friendly.  So I'll add one star for now. But the part of my review about this place being quite corporate hasn't really changed.  Its kinda like dinner theater for music.",3,,

Nearly all of the staff was rude and just seemed like they couldn't be bothered. Not just the hostess or our server, even the staff inside behind the bar. Unfortunately we'll never go back.",,,

This is the second time this has happened and won't be returning for food anytime soon. Also service is mediocre and with an attitude. The only good thing about this place is the quality of the shows. Come for that but eat somewhere else !,,,

Updated review","The 5 stars is for the music venue. This is a great small space with good sound where lots of really different types of musicians perform, and tickets prices are very reasonable. Wine selection is great and much of it is made there. You can't beat sitting down with a glass of pretty decent wine or beer and food and listen to live music. I am however completely astonished that people come here simply to eat. The food is decent and some of it is quite good, but it is pricey - $17 for a burger and you still have to pay $2 for every topping, even onions. There are far better places to eat in the area.   2-3 stars at best for the food. But you can't go wrong coming here for a show.",1,1,2
135,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,3.0,4/23/2015,"It's difficult to rate City Winery because there are aspects that are four stars or so and others that are two stars or less.  The good:  Great performers, stylish space, and the food is better than average, particularly for a performance venue.The bad: Concerts here tend to be more expensive than a lot of other venues featuring similar styles of performers (such as Joe's Pub, Subculture, Rockwood, etc.) The awful: Considering the premium pricing of most shows, the uncomfortable, crowded seating is inexcusable. The tiny tables aren't even wide enough to accommodate the two chairs on each side, and then they line up tables into narrow rows until there isn't enough room for people to sit and eat, much less swivel chairs to watch the show. On top of that, the HVAC seems to be lacking, as tonight's show (the second I've seen at City Winery) was sweltering hot (even though the temps were in the mid 40s.)  Plus, the servers were loud in the kitchen (which competed with the performance) and kept bumping into the chairs (I guess that may be unavoidable given the density of seating). It all makes for a significantly unpleasant concert experience.Tonight, as my thigh was smashed against a stranger's and I was sweating through my clothes and my back was hurting because my legs, shoulders and neck were at three different angles trying to see the stage and I wanted to visit the restroom but realized I couldn't without asking six people to move, I decided I would rather see the performer at any other spot in NYC than The City Winery.Five-star performers; four-star food; one-star comfort.",4,2,1
136,Mefaret A.,"Jersey City, NJ",59,9,4,1.0,1/20/2018,"I was there for Alejandro Escovedo show last night with a friend who was subscribed to their concert ticket priority membership so he goes there a couple of times a month. This was my second time there. The concert was excellent as expected. But the food...  Man, the food is awful. I ordered duck tacos, shishito peppers, risotto balls as appetizers for the table and the burger as my entree. My friend  ordered the steak. None of the food except the shishito peppers was good. The medium rare burger was inedible and half of it was burned. In the dark I didn't realize till I had a bit of it. I told about it to the server and thankfully they took it off the check. It is not about money though. I am very disappointed that I couldn't get a decent, edible meal. My friend's steak was tiny and sad. The duck tacos was the worst duck tacos i have ever had. It looked like they heated up some frozen shredded duck, sent it with the most tasteless fresh avocado paste I have had (Not guac, no onions, no flavoring, and warm), a ton of onions. First of all duck tacos is a big thing in NYC right now. It's everywhere from Masa to steak houses, from some upscale diners to hipster bars. But none of these places serve shredded, frozen duck. They serve beautiful, tender pieces of duck meat in tacos with real sauce / salsa / guac etc... Also at City Winery, you have to build your tasteless tacos, in the dark, while the band is playing, into a supermarket bought soft tacos. I had better tacos through delivery. At a beautiful place like that, with such good music you expect the food to be much better. There are about 15 hipsters walk around pouring wine, some of them are sommeliers, most others look useless. You can't just run a place on the principle of ""look good good"". Winery is a beautiful space, with great music but unfortunately the kitchen adds nothing to this. I don't blame the kitchen for this. I blame the ownership / management who don't care enough to make it a better place. Side note: Shishito peppers were excellent. But when you pay $300 dollars with the tip, you expect a little more than 8-10 pieces of tasty peppers.",,,
137,Sasha O.,"Edgewater, NJ",20,50,5,2.0,11/13/2016,"The place is really cute, the server was attentive, and the appetizers were good. We also enjoyed the first wine, a sauvignon blanc. That's about where the good ended. The overall meal was disappointing and underwhelming. Also, being advertised as a dinner with a wine pairing (at a winery) I expected each dish to be paired with a wine that was selected specifically for it.  Instead, you were served three pre-selected wines regardless of the course you chose. Not really a pairing.First course: I got the tuna tacos and she got the risotto balls. Both were delicious so  we were excited about the rest of the meal.Main course: I had the scallops and pork belly, and both were basically inedible. The scallops were way over salted and the pork belly was extremely dry. I didn't think it was possible to ruin pork belly, and today I was proved wrong. My friend had the dukkah crusted tuna, and while seared well, it lacked overall flavor. The best part of her dish was the puree. We were both served a Pinot Noir that was ok.Dessert: I had the apple crème brulee. The texture was good, however I could not taste any apple and because the sugar was burned in a few spots I was left with a burnt flavor in my mouth. She got the pumpkin donuts, DO NOT ORDER THESE. To say these are donuts is disrespectful to good donuts across the nation. These are dense blobs of flavorless dough that even a yummy scoop of ice cream can't save. The reisling this was paired  with was syrupy and overly sweet.Having used a Gilt City voucher I walked away less annoyed than I would have if I paid full price for the food. Maybe the other side is worth it if seeing a show.",,,

We were seated at these ""premier"" seats, (expensive tickets!) at an oval table to the left of the stage on outer seats, nearer to the stage, specifically, seats 109 and 110.I was very uncomfortable, and did not enjoy the concert at all.The problem was that those seats are directly in the wait staff's pathway.  My enjoyment of the music was constantly interrupted every time a wait person had to pass in front of me, which was several times every minute.  I had to sit with my feet tucked tightly, uncomfortably underneath me for the entire time, to avoid getting stepped on or causing a waiter to trip.  It was impossible to get the least bit immersed into the concert experience.  I spent the whole concert worried about getting stepped on, and simply being interrupted over and over again.In my opinion, those seats should be eliminated, or sold as ""discount"" seats. Our waitress was very nice. Service was very good.",1,,

143,Karen D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,3.0,7/21/2016,Leona G hit the nail on the head regarding the oval seating.  My complaint about them is that the table is NOT large enough to fit 8. Plus our seats weren't facing the stage but rather facing the opposite wall.  Second complaint:  I approached the concierge / box office desk and stated how unhappy I was about the table.  My husband had called earlier after I shared Leonas feedback about seats 109-112. The person who answered the phone assured us they were great seats.  They were NOT.  When I expressed my disappointment the gentleman seemed frustrated and agreed to move us to another table.  The table was basically what in any restaurant would be a 2 top. We were a party of 4.  After agreeing to move we went to the bar to grab a drink.   The bartender told us those seats where ticketed seats but since we were early and no one was there we ordered a drink.  The bartender told us if we were more comfortable there we should ask to move our seats. Just then the gentlemen who moved us came over and reprimanded me for sitting at the bar and asked us to settle the tab and go back to our seats.   Not in a nice way either. Martin Sexton was amazing and the sound quality from where we were sitting (close to the back bathroom) was good. By the way.  The entire bar was empty all night.  Turns out no one ended up sitting there.  City Winery. Train your staff to be hospitable and accommodating whenever possible.  And rethink your seating plan. Or provide a floor plan to view before purchase.,1,,

I have tried their cab, merlot, malbec, pinot and chard.  I think the best is their pinot always I really wasn't overly impressed with any of their proprietary wines.  Given it is a working winery, you would think their juice would be a bit better.  I don't know the owners, but a good friend of mine does.  Maybe time for a hint.  However, as far as a venue for shows go, it is a must.",,,

Anyway! On a Sunday evening we grabbed two stolls at the bar and ordered a caraffe of red wine, it was a bit cold for my taste but coming from a tap that tend to happen. We weren't super hungry but wanted a taste so we ordered the Burrata and some french fries. The burrata was made by a chef behind the bar but directly in front of us so that was interesting and ended up being delicious. The fries were not impressive but hey, they were just fries. About an hour into being there I decided to use the restroom which I was directed to as being through a heavy door and down a hall way. I go down the hallway and was shocked to find out there was a MASSIVE dinner space that was FULL of people. I couldn't believe how loud and lively the scene was considering there were no more than 10 people quietly listening to smooth jazz just a door away.

Not only were they prepared poorly, but they are grossly expensive. $17 will get you basically a burger and bun (and fries or small salad). If you want cheese, onions, bacon... Add $2-$3 each.

169,Joe B.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,150,0,3.0,11/1/2017,"Four stars for the music as the sound system is nice and clear. Due to the size of this place unless you get seats up close its somewhat too large for intimate type shows. The food itself is tasty enough and their selection of wines, as expected, is quite large. That said service is very disorganized, in part due to their set up of waitresses taking your order and busboys/servers actually bringing out your meal. Our side order of carrots came out way before our entrees, when the entries did show up, the burger order was wrong and had to be sent back and they redelivered another order of carrots that , once we told the server our order had come much earlier, was taken away. Their mistake , they should have been left especially since the burger order was wrong.  I also noticed servers not knowing where to bring the orders, with one poor soul actually going to the wrong table four times before finally finding the correct table. This would not happen if the waitresses actually followed the order to delivery, or at least check in once and awhile to see if the order came in properly.  My conclusion is this is a good place for catching some good musical talent and having some wine along with music. It's not a place to have a meal unless you are ok with hit and miss service.  Unrelated to the above, my friend ordered the tickets for tonights show months ago and is fairly sure she ordered table seats. When we got there we were seated at high chairs. About 20 minutes latter a hostess came to us and asked if we were in the right seats,implying that someone else was supposed to be sitting there, and perhaps we were in fact in the wrong seats. She went to go check after I gave her our name but never returned to let us know if the seating was correct or not. Unfortunately my friends email auto deletes after 2 months so the mail with the actual order info was no longer available to check if the error was our's or the venues.

Order whatever minimum may be on that night drink-wise but spare yourself anything on the menu.",4,,

I recall walking by this place once before about a year ago on a date and noticing there was live music going on here.  The dude was like, let's go in, but I was like it is in the middle of nowhere and the crowd seemed older.  I'm still not sure what the music scene is like here but the location is definitely a deterrent to coming here.  I had the salmon eggs benedict which was good and comes with yummy roasted potatoes, side salad and lovely bread.  My friend had an omelette which also came with the potatoes and side salad. We found service here exceptional.  Not only were they prompt, attentive and nice, but they gave us no grief for spending hours talking over brunch which was much appreciated.",1,,2

Tables that are obviously made for two are sold with 4 seats and then full meals are served. In order to face the stage, I had to turn my chair sideways which further impinged on my space. Never mind having to move also to make room for the servers (they should get paid hazard pay).

175,Leah K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0,2.0,1/25/2017,"I have to add to the chorus about the Klezmer brunch. Wonderful music and beautiful venue, but the food and service was some of the worst I've experienced in the city. The oatmeal was cloyingly sweet (seriously, how do you mess up oatmeal) and the home fries that came with my eggs tasted like cardboard. The tomato soup and grilled cheese my table mate got was also disappointing - the soup tasted like it was from a box, and the grilled cheese was small and pale.The real disappointment was the service. Food took a while to come out which, whatever - maybe their kitchen was busy. But once it was dropped on our table, our waitress disappeared. Nobody asked if we needed anything. We actually needed ketchup, salt/pepper (which bizarrely wasn't on the table to begin with), and jam - but there was literally no one to flag down. Likewise, no one came to refill water glasses or check if we needed more coffee throughout the duration of the 45 minutes or so we were eating. We actually had to flag down 2 busboys to pay the check! Look, they book good acts and the venue itself is pretty special. But they really need to step it up on the food/service game. I'm not expecting it to be like dining at Daniel - but it should be at very least serviceable.",,1,

Duck tacos tasted like they were made from Purina cat food ... I had braised short ribs ... a real mistake disappointing to say the least.  They were cooked well but everything on the plate tasted the same. They should added some polenta, or mashed potato for contrast. Next time stick to the lofreida burgers they can't messup.

You have to buy them quickly to get good seats. The seating is the one problem with the venue because the tables are small and most seat four people per table. Since most people are also eating dinner or snacks this can be quite cramped. You get used to it quickly though since the music more than makes up for it. Service is usually good as well, though there are times when one person hasn't gotten their meal until at least 10 minutes after the rest of us. I do think they could come up with a better wine selection, given the name is City Winery. But this is definitely worth coming. Just get the tickets as soon as they go on sale, as it books up quickly.",,,

186,Texican J.,"New York, NY",6,66,61,2.0,12/7/2015,"I went to City Winery for the first time last night to see John Waters' Christmas Show. The venue itself is spectacular. The stage is small and similar to what you might find in a middle school cafetorium. I was seated in front of the stage - and YIKES - talk about a tight squeeze! I attend cabaret shows all around the city but have never had so much trouble getting to / in / out of my seat. The service was TERRIBLE. Our party arrived an hour early so that we could eat and order drinks. The waitress didn't take our order until a minute or two before the show was about to begin. The wait staff also completely ignored our table, not even replacing the water bottles on the table (all the other tables were served and taken care of.) When the order did arrive, they were all incorrect - the waitress was extremely disruptive. Long story short, out of the four people who ordered, only one drink was served and no one received their food / drinks.She was even more so when attempting to give us the check (literally going through a stack of checks, ""Is this one yours? Is this one yours?"") Finally, we told her she was bothering us and she went away. This was literally just a few feet away from John Waters, who somehow managed to keep focus and perform.Would I go back? Sure. I don't think this was their usual service, but it didn't make a very good first impression. One other note (sorry, I should entitle this review the City Whinery) the restrooms are extremely nice - ridiculously so. The men's room has a urinal  that looks like a modern art sculpture, with a wall water feature and widescreen television that plays an image of a bubbling brook. They in no way accommodate the number of people packed into the place. The line for the women's restroom was VERY LONG.So, word of advice: eat a bite before you get there (just in case), arrive early, and pee before the show starts.John Waters was brilliant and the rating does not reflect his show at all.",1,,1

Distinctive location! I enjoyed the layout inside. It's not often you get to eat a meal inside an urban winery, especially in Manhattan. The hallway to the bathroom is literally the fermentation room, which is kind of cool. They had some live music playing when we arrived, however I think it was for a private event, although it was still nice to hear!It got a little cramped at times, but it was a lively place with some good standard brunch dishes.

Updated review","HORRIBLE!!! My boyfriend and I came to this place for Valentine's Day dinner. We did not expect the horrendous service and further more the grotesque food platters. I'm extremely surprised, considering the reputation this place has. We are in the barrel room and it was freezing. I couldn't take off my jacket and there were other patrons with theirs on as well. There was also no bread on any table, nor salt and pepper. Therefore if you are looking for a place to dine on Varick Street, DON'T make it City Winery!!!I'd like to review the city winery. Our experience tonight was much better than our previous one. Service was on par as well as the food and wine pairings. I recommend the city winery on any given evening and suggest to try the specials! The wine tour was also sufficient in regards to all questions I had.",,,

194,Jessi S.,"Carlstadt, NJ",276,133,115,2.0,7/30/2015,"You'd think after reading all of these reviews where people complain about the cramped seating, City Winery would do something about it.  One would think.  I've been to two shows at City Winery.  My first experience was nice because it was no where near a sold out show, but last night I had the pleasure of experiencing a sold out show and it was NOT pleasant!Yes, the venue is beautiful and nice.  Yes, I could hear the band perfectly, the acoustics were great.  Yes, the wine I ordered was delicious.  But could I enjoy any of that?  Not really.  My friend and I were cramped side by side at a two top table, surrounded by other cramped tables.  Nothing says good times like getting elbowed in the side every now and then, and a nice mouthful of hair as the woman sitting next to me tosses her hair.  Seriously City Winery?  You expect your customers to have a nice experience listening to music and sipping wine when you cram in that many tables?  It's an utter nightmare if you are trapped in the middle of a table.  Don't drink too much wine because if you need to use the restroom you are going to cause a SCENE.  If you have a phobia of tight, cramped spaces, run far far away from this venue.  Also, it's not easy for the servers to gracefully put your wine / food on the table as they have to lean over you to even reach the table.I'll probably never see a show here again.  If I do decide to make that questionable decision I think I will try for one of the high top tables by the bar, they seemed to be the most comfortable and roomy.  Though you may have standing room people hovering over your shoulders.  Sigh.",9,7,7
195,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",2,144,0,1.0,9/16/2017,"Arguably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in recent memory.  However, before I get to the negative I do want to say I did enjoy the wine!  Yet, unfortunately the rudeness and immaturity of the staff overshadowed the quality product they were pouring.  My friend and I last minute decided to grab drinks and we chose to sit at the bar.  The place was fairly empty (it was around 930ish on a Friday night).  I had finished my first glass of merlot and was trying for about 10 mins to get someones attention to order a second glass.  The bartender (one with the pony tail) and the hostess (short with a buzz cut) and one more waiter were all huddled up at the end of the bar giggling like school girls on their cell phones and appeared to be intoxicated.  That said, they were certainly not paying attention to any of the patrons.  I finally held my arm up like I was in a classroom raising my hand; felt a bit obnoxious doing that but it did get their attention...finally!  The host with the shaved head came over and in a very aggressive tone goes ""I'm the hostess but yeah I guess I'll serve you, what would you like?""  At this point, I could tell just from looking at his eyes he had been drinking.  It was very uncomfortable.  It was as though he wanted us to feel guilty for bothering him and ordering a second round of drinks.  When he came back he oddly stared at my friend with a cold expression on his face and then looked at me. I said, ""I'm sorry is there an issue?"" and he goes ""not at all"" (again with attitude) and walked away.  The bartender with the pony tail came over about 3-4 mins later and asked how everything was and my friend (who tends to be quiet and avoids drama at all costs) goes, ""yeah so the host was just very rude""; we explained what happened and this bartender goes ""Oh he just tends to be sassy!"" and I quickly responded saying, yeah well he shouldn't be sassy to customers.  We quickly closed out after this exchange and went outside.  THEN we called for an uber and were sitting down on a step outside of the restaurant but not in front of the restaurant....and a woman comes out and goes ""hey no loitering!""...I responded stating I just spent $90 dollars in your establishment and now I'm waiting for an uber..I clearly have a purpose right now.  That was the cherry on top for me!  Horrible service and then being called a loiterer by the staff!  I will never return to this venue.  This establishment needs a culture change of some sort to remind the staff that they are in the hospitality industry and therefore need to be hospitable!  I'm hoping  higher up mgmt reads this and takes action.  Doubtful but just wanted to throw that in there.Oh and before I forget, about 5 minutes after we walked out two women walked in and almost immediately walked out.  I overheard them say that guys is pretty rude.  I go, ""are you talking about the host with the buzz cut?"" and they laughed and said ""yeah hes a $%*&""",,,

198,Alan L.,"Wayne, NJ",1,7,0,2.0,6/13/2017,"First the good news:The concert - Raul Melo - was fabulous. Our waitress, Rachel, was a delight. And the air conditioning worked. End of good news.Now the bad news:I bought my 4 tickets on line. They clearly stated all sales are final. No problem. All Ticketmaster, etc., ticket sales are final. What they did not say until AFTER my credit card was charged is that there are no hard tickets. My name will be on a list at the door. At the time I did not realize what a problem that would be.Two days before the concert, the other couple had an emergency and could not attend. I called City Winery and was told all sales are final, we don't get involved, but we suggest, as the show is sold out, you get here before the concert and try to sell them, or you put your tickets up for sale on StubHub, etc.What tickets? There are no tickets. How can one sell a name on a list?So I posted my tickets on the City Winery Facebook page, on my Facebook page, on Raul Melo's page, on NextDoor, on Backpage, and on Craigslist. No bites.When I got there an hour before the show, I found out why: they were not sold out, but were selling tickets at the box office.When I finally gave up, I found that my so-called VIP tickets, for which I paid the top dollar, were against the back wall, as far away from the stage as possible!So a warning to the wise: If you think there is even the remotest chance you may not be able to a attend a concert, be prepared - if you buy tickets - to throw the tickets, and your money, into the garbage.Never again!",,,1
