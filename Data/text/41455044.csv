I ordered 3 drinks and a personal sized pizza and it was only $23! Talk about a STEALThe service was a little slow, but the staff was very nice and checked in on us enough. The food and drinks were delicious.We sat on the patio which was an awesome place to people watch.My boss and I sat on the patio for a solid 3 hours, it was a good time!Definitely recommend!",,,1
1,Dandria G.,"Miami, FL",162,3,0,1.0,7/31/2018,"I am saddened to say but i wish there was a way to give less than a star. Visiting from Miami with our students and the treatment that we received was less than what im sure a restaurant expects its customers to be given. Came in with a group of 11. Ordered our food. After receiving our food i asked the waitress to split the check individually as they need to have separate receipts for each students. She informed me that it couldnt be done. She came to me after a little while and threw her hand at me saying i had to wait for a manager to do it. She came to me and asked me me to go through the group and essentially take their orders over again. I let her know that it wasnt my job to do that. she became irritated and walked away from me I asked for a to go plate and she told me she didnt have one. Right after she gave another couple to go plates. We gave her the money for payment and have been waiting for 20 minites for the change. I went over to asl her for the change and she told me i could go wait for it. I go up to the bartender and she puts the change on the table and shales her head and says ""no"". After this she finally came to the table and gave them their change. We have now been waiting for a to go plate for 15 minutes. The to go plates have finally come. After she throws them at Me. This is the worst experience i have ever had in a restaurant especially with high school students. I hope that someone talks to her about customer service. Because what we received was not that.",1,,
2,Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",181,272,1415,3.0,4/1/2018,"A solid 3.75 option for all things after hours and late night. Drinks, Grub, Sports, Music, and extremely attentive Service. After a night of dancing we working a pretty sweat driven appetite and was approaching Hangry full force fast. Parked in front of Mr Biggs with the intention of going to another spot found on Yelp and just happen to look up and said... Why not!?A great fast pitch alternative, I may add. Seated immediately, with drinks ordered right away. A true sports bar with TV's, all high tops and a rotating wait staff that are extremely attentive so all your needs are always met. They offer $4 Drinks/Shots/Beers. Except for the Margarita those appear to be $6 with flavors, all great deals of course but please don't expect top shelf people. The Food was solid, yes we were craving carbs but it was really good. I would return for serval reasons... good service, late hours, great prices, and solid food. Food: 2-Turkey Burgers ($14) comes w French Fries(Wedges) & Greens.Drinks:Watermelon Margarita ($6)Mango Margarita ($6)Tequila and Pineapple ($4)Just A note:Would be unbearable for me when it's truly crowded, the potential to pack people in is there and it's already a little of a squeeze. As well as the bar stools with no back support don't work for an extended time especially for big booty girls.",3,,1

I've been to Mr. Biggs twice now. It's a sports bar of sorts without the typical sports bar vibes.  There are huge screens, an array of seating and during both visits, the crowd seemed pretty diverse with locals after work and some tourists peppered in. Both times I've had a few frozen margaritas and an order of the loaded fries to share. The loaded fries are the best! I mean, what can compare to a plate of seasoned curly fries topped with tasty fixings after a few drinks? I'll definitely be back for more after work drinks or when in the area with a hankering for reasonably prices drinks and eats.",,,

Mostly an issue for the servers trying to weave through. Good bar crowd, lots of TVz, nobody making a fuss, laughing at all the tables...SERVICE: 5*I give the servers credit...uzing a tag team approach they doubled up on tables, each taking a side to bring food and drinks. very responsive, I especially liked how the servers, 2 women, looked at you, put a hand on your shoulder, etc, made it personal, kind of said don't worry abt anything, I go you, helped me be patient during waits here and there.WHAT DID YOU HAVE: 4*Burger - very good, 4*- Angus beef w/Swiss, LTO, and they gave me half a onion (ate that bahstrd, 2)- best part was finally a enough swiss- wdge fries...very good (hotter than a p.p. on flag day!)- all made better by seeing a tremendous playoff gameHot Wings - good, usual, 3*- nothing special but different is bad in this categoryFish and Chips - very good, large portion, 4*- served super hot, steaming ,fries and tartarBLT Club - very good, 4*- More like a bacon club!SUMMARY:Good spot, if you want beer and a burger you'll likely be happy with it, other food is good too.

There was playoff basketball and hockey on the TVs so there was a bit of a crowd.I decided to order the juicy lucy burger. Not quite sure if it was made properly as I could not find the cheese inside at all. Also, because of that, I felt like it was a little overcooked, as it was definitely not medium. The fries were good and there was a good amount of them as well.Some of my friends got the chicken sandwich and that looked the best out of everyone's orders.Overall, this place seems like a bar first with some bar grub, but isn't somewhere I would go just to grab a bite to eat.",2,,
11,Midwestern Perspective S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",87,32,33,3.0,1/7/2018,"Midwestern Guy: Mr. Biggs is a great local bar in Hell's Kitchen. The food is your classic bar fare (with great nachos) and they offer a standard selection of draft beers (think bud light), cocktails, and wines. My favorite drink here is the frozen margarita which is available at all times. The best part about this place has to be the atmosphere though - it has everything your classic sports bar would have, but then pumps loud trendy music and dancing disco/strobe lights at night. I would stop in for a quick bite or drink if you are in the area, but avoid this place if you are looking for a nice meal or some conversation.Midwestern Gal: this is a fun spot to check out with a group of friends!  I recommend coming a little after 9:00pm if you're in the mood for some fun with the disco lights and music.  Be sure to check out the great drink deals.  Overall, fun place with decent bar food!",,,

13,Tee M.,"Bronx, NY",3,34,47,3.0,4/29/2017,I thought this place was going to be so much fun based on the reviews but it was just ok.We got there around 9:30pm and we were told we have to sit and eat outside because they were starting to turn the inside into a dance floor. No big deal. The servers were friendly and it was not long before we were served our drinks and food. The food is decent and the drinks were not at all strong. The good thing is the drinks were $4 all day until 10pm. So I guess you get what you pay for.When we went inside to check out the dance floor it was predominantly gay guys and the music was just ok. So if this is your kind of vibe then Mr. Biggs is for you! As for me I don't think I will be rushing back to come here anytime soon.,,,

Bathrooms appeared clean and well maintained. Service was attentive but hey, there on a Tuesday. It looks like a good place to hang out and experience NYC without the Times Square vibe. There are 6 big screen TVs and a marble counter for the bar. I wish the bar was wood but hey, it might be germ resistant this way, who knows.

16,Raymond M.,"Hollywood, FL",58,43,34,5.0,12/13/2016,"Mr Biggs of NYCThe music and the ambiance is what you come to expect for a NY watering hole.  The music is balanced so that you don't have to shout over it. Don't be afraid of coming in, while there are many Hipsters here and young professionals, they greeted us with a warm smile and we felt instantly welcomed.  The feeling you get is that of a wonderful place to reconnect with those that you care about or your co-workers.  Happy people with beautiful smiles.   The bowl of chili was a basic one.  While we ordered it without the Jalapeño,  it was going to be an after thought. We add some additional salt and pepper to pick up the chili, but alas it really needed more additional salt at the least in the preparation of it.  Then came the 12"" thin crust cheese pizza. It was wonderful from the crust to the cheese, but it was almost there it just needed to have a tad more marinara sauce to it and it would have been spot on.  Still a wonderful size and balance to the whole pie.   Goat cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce and a roasted tomato.  It is a rich dish and you can eat only so much of it. But this dish is but the exception.  You can't stop eating more of it.  The hero of the dish is the ravioli with its velvety smooth texture which is highlighted by the pesto cream sauce. We ordered it with chicken, while it is an after thought, it does add to the texture of the dish. Now where does the tomato come into play with the dish? It brings that rustic farm country shade of flavor that ties the whole dish together.  Order it with or without the chicken and you will be in for a gastronomic treat. The cheesecake on the menu is a must.  Before you take a bite of this morsel of Divine goodness take a quick whiff of it?  What you are going  smell if a sweet cream cheese, and you taste it, is just explodes with creamy sweetness that gently caresses your pallet like a lingering goodby kiss from your lover. Great fun, clean, secure, impecable service and wonderful food.  Plus they serve 48 draft beers.   Ask for Steven for your Mixologist and for Tasheena for your gracious hostess. With this combination, you are going to be in for a treat. How can you go wrong?",,,2

We told her yes but we did want to order food. So, I order the Cobb salad and my date ordered the turkey burger. My only complaint is that our food took FOREVER to come out. I the meantime, we were jamming to the playlist of old school music. Whilst in the background the movie ""Friday"" was playing. Welcome to New York, kids. Lol.

Mr. Biggs is bit on the perimeter of the gayborhood so there is a large gay customer base, but everyone is welcome. However, on Saturday nights, the tables are removed and the sports uniforms literally come off. This small bar turns into a happening and trendy DJ gay dance space, with hot gogo boys competing for tips with the equally friendly and cute bartenders. For the boys that don't want to be bothered with the huge Saturday night gay clubs or the cover charges, this incognito gayborhood gem is the place.

I came here on a Friday after work and the top 100s were blasting. I literally thought I was eating dinner at a club. I had no idea what the person across the table was saying, so I sat in silence with my BBQ Bacon Burger while watching all the interesting people at the bar.

44,Barbara M.,"Secaucus, NJ",116,418,397,4.0,8/29/2015,"Went for Sunday brunch and the prices are very reasonable. The brunch menu is fixed with several good choices and includes a complimentary cocktail. I had the steak and eggs with home fries and English muffin. The steak with grilled to perfection and the eggs were cooked just as I like them.  my friend had eggs Benedict with extra hollandaise sauce which she thoroughly enjoyed. She's is a Hells kitchen regular but I'm new to the place and I was impressed. The coffee was outstanding. The waiters and waitresses and the young women who opened up the restaurant as I had arrived early were friendly, welcoming, helpful and informative.  The waitresses and waitstaff were attentive but not intrusive. Which I appreciate it. We sat outside on a lovely Sunday morning and the chairs were not so comfortable but tolerable. There were a couple of customers with pets which was a turnoff to me. I can tell they were regulars because of the way they interact with the waitresses but as a person who has allergies to dogs and particular I was not so happy. And it's important to note that smoking does happen on one side of the outdoor seating area so one needs to be mindful of being upwind rather than downwind. I didn't like the fact that there were no low chairs in the interior of the restaurant. All the tables were high tables with stool chairs which is just a pet peeve of mine because it's an immediate barrier to people who are little unsteady on their feet.  Those high chairs are for more agile people. So I didn't feel like I had the choice about sitting inside the restaurant proper.  I hope that One day they would add at least one or two tables with regular chairs.Before I forget I want to underscore the fact that I love this place and the mimosa  and the Bloody Mary were very well-prepared, they were delicious and tasty.  If you're coming in with your car to this place parking is a bit of a challenge especially on a Sunday but fortunately there are many low-cost parking garages in the immediate area.

48,Paul L.,"New York, NY",7,17,17,3.0,7/29/2015,"Came here for dinner with friends that just moved in round the corner. Bar: Very ""divey"". They had a deal on margaritas and beer when I came here. Avoid the margs -  they are incredibly mediocre - and stick with the $4 Heinekens. Grill: Burger was....fine. Similar feedback from fellow diners on their dishes. Expect classic bar food, done in a very average way. Ambiance: Dive bar. Disco lights were flashing around at 6pm with loud music blasting. Environment is very open and friendly (large, open bay window doors onto 10th avenue).  Could be fun later at night. The experience was thoroughly average, but I don't really mind - that's because Mr Biggs Bar & Grill knows what kind of establishment it is and does not try to market itself as something else. Conclusion: would definitely return to grab drinks, will avoid for dinner.",1,,

Updated review","To be fair, gotta give props where they're due.  Still not a place I'll frequent, since I'm not down for inconsistencies in menu or service.  But I went again last night, as it was really the only option a friend and I to grab some sort of dinner and still make our early show.  We went with the margarita special.  Still a bit weak...but flavorful.  Nice, refreshing, and a chic little glass.  Not shabby for a $5 deal in the area.My friend did have to ask for better seating when she arrived ahead of me.  But she received it.The one hostess/server gave off the energy of really not wanting to be bothered, but she'll do the best job she could under the circumstances.  The other was actually decent and efficient.  The mac & cheese balls seem to be handmade, and are decent.  They needed salt and pepper, or the marina sauce.  But the marinara was good.The star, however, was the potato skins, which is basically one russet, sliced in half, hollowed out, stuffed with a pretty darned decent pulled pork (which isn't laden with unnecessary bbq sauce), and topped with mashed potatoes.  Crispy skin, nice textures.  Wanted more when I was done with my half.If I have to go again, I will without as much hesitation as I had before last night.",3,,

Our waitress was very nice and understanding and went to the kitchen to clarify the mistake. While we were waiting we ate a few mozzarella sticks and some chicken. Then we were reprimanded by the rude bartender that ""since we had now eaten some of the food, we could not get a refund"" A member of my party said we weren't expecting a refund we just wanted our order to be fixed for it came with calamari and it was supposed to come with fried zucchini, simple mistake. We were still continued to be shamed by the bartender so we just said forget it and said we would keep the calamari, even though no one ate it, just because we wanted the whole ordeal to be over with. The food was good and our waitress was nice though I would not go back again.",4,2,1

Besides the cleanliness it is in a very decent location in the Hell's Kitchen part of NYC which is pretty much in the center of the city not too far from the hustle and bustle of midtown/Times Square.Bartenders are very cool and they serve some really good $5 margaritas here that can sneak up on you if you have enough of them. They also have several TV's here, so this spot is also good if you wanna catch sporting events. Only thing keeping this spot from being a 5 is that they do not have happy hour but the drinks are not expensive at all to begin with so happy hour here may not even be needed.

Maybe they made it a sports bar because you now have to tackle the waitress to get her to take your order. *rimshot*.I love the beer selection here, but the beer always seems to be stale and/or a bit too much on the warm side for me. The best beers available during happy hour are landshark are Stella and/or Landshark, which is pretty bad. They used to have Yuengling as a happy hour option, but removed it.They also replaced the regular trivia host last week, who was a great host! The food is decent, nothing spectacular though.

It was close enough to Broadway that you had some really good singers come in after show hours and rock the karaoke (which use to be Thurs-Sun) but far enough away from tourist central that not many wandered through. It was also the perfect setting for both gays and straights. It was the perfect place for me and my best friend to go hang out and both of us have a good time (I being straight, him being gay). His friends went there, my friends went there, good times were had.Then came the renovations. The staff is all gone. Replaced by staff from the owners other bars (Mickey Spillane's and another bar around 50th and 10th) and former customers that are just all dudes. Gone is the dive-y atmosphere and replaced is faux marble countertops, giant TVs for sports (this was NEVER a sports bar) and a new staging area set up JUST for karaoke, but yet - the owner (a bandanna sporting, sleeve-less shirt wearing deuchbag reject from Sons of Anarchy) cancelled all karaoke from ever happening. He yells at his staff, sexually assaults the few females that have worked for him (hence why it is now all dudes).It's become your every day shitty sports bar.I will never, ever come back to this place again.

Updated review","Sadly, this was not the experience I tried out my time coming around and in fact it really steers me to not really come around to it much longer.I came in and say down, because no one was at the door to receive me, after a few minutes where I could still not identify who were the servers, I asked a guy that seemed to be taking check books if it was ok to sit where I say as the walls were open and I wanted to sit there. The server asked if I preferred to sit somewhere else because someone had just used the table and it was dirty. The place was not full and I would have thought the table would have been cleaned as I had been sitting on it already for about 5 minutes with no service or any attention. I politely replied that I had sat there for a while and would like to stay there if they wouldn't mind, I could wait for them to clean the table. Yeah, I should have known what was to come.I asked for the menu and said I would like to know if they had the frozen mimosa as their sign says in the front. frozen mimosa sounds pretty good! Sadly their sign which says: ""Frozen margaritas and mimosas"" actually should say: ""Frozen margaritas, and Mimosas"". So yes, they don't carry frozen mimosas. I have said before, frozen mimosas here are a bit of just fluff and lots of sugar... Not something you would really get money's worth even for $5. instead I asked for a  margarita on the rocks (as it should be). upon my request, I asked which tequilas they have, he only mentioned Patron, I asked what house, had no clue, I said, I see you have Avion Tequila, can I get that, the server said yes. after a while, he comes back with another server and they mention they don't carry Avion.... I point out to the three Avion bottles get have on their top shelf... A few minutes later they say they can't sell me a margarita with Avion because neither the server or the bartender know the price. Not very professional Mr. Biggs administration. The server mentioned that they had not placed the prices on the system for Avion and he didn't want to over charge or undercharge me. So I asked what other tequilas they carried, server goes to the machine and says Don Julio or Patron. I simply dislike Patron.. Don Julio is also not my favorite, but I asked for the price of it, the server said $14 and I agreed. I also asked for cheese sticks and chicken tenders. The tenders I like as they are not over battered (if at all). After another 10 min, I get my drink (which I saw had about one shots count of Don Julio and the rest was triple sec and juice from the bar) mostly juice and no tequila. my cheese sticks were not melting hot... More like too temperature ready for a baby to chew on, and the server by mistakes drops one of the chicken tenders on the chair on the table next to me. he jokingly picks it up, and says, guess I'll get you another one. His look was more like, sorry, I dropped this and was ready to put it back on my plate more than he would get me another one. And as he left, he shows me the piece of meat in his hand, which sadly looked a lot like the piece of meat he brought back from the kitchen in about 2 minutes times after he dropped the meat from my plate. yeah, I wasn't expecting the ""new"" piece of meat to come out of the kitchen that fast as the plate itself took a while to arrive to my table after I ordered it, yet the one piece came out in 2 minutes. Thankfully, frying heat definitely should kill germs.So I now get the pleasure eating room warm cheese sticks and when I ask for ranch, I get a packed Ranch sauce with a lid (not fresh, no surprise) thrown on my table as if I had asked for so much already.My drink, way too sweet with no tequila taste at all, my food, not impressed, it's bar food. my service ... Left more to wish for. I do referred the bartender at Mickey's Spillane's. Lastly, the bill... I was quite surprised to find out that my margarita was actually $16. apparently, the see or forgot to tell me they charge a $2 fee to turn my shot of Don Julio into a margarita. With that said, Mr. Biggs, sadly, I will not be coming back, I will be taking my business elsewhere and will be sharing my experience with others. For cheese sticks, a fried chicken breast cut in thins slices and one margarita I dropped nearly $40. With service that was not par for it. I seriously hope you guys get it right and congrats on the new decor.Best wishes, not coming back.",8,5,3

66,Gigi B.,"New York, NY",424,4,1,1.0,8/9/2015,"This place is a joke... I felt like I stepped into a time machine as the server walked back to my table to tell us that per management, they were refusing us service due to our complaint of my Jameo not really being Jameo. Now we, a group of five woman, are out to celebrate a graduation. We're in Manhattan and we're all over thirty : we came to spend money and party. (Well at least get lifted) so I would have no reason to not WANT the Jameson they brought me, the problem was it just WASNT Jameson that they brought me. Upon the second return, my bartender buddy sitting to my right asked that they just take it away.  Being that the two of us share nearly thirty years of bartending experience, we were pretty confident about the bases of my dissatisfaction. This clown of an establishment, instead of rectifying our compliant, refused us service. The manger put us out with the Jameson on the bill, which of course I didn't pay. (Needless to say, none of us were rude, unprofessional, ghetto or aggressive) Who the hell do they think they are? Oh a failing business. As I looked around and saw that the room was empty although they sell $5 drinks, I then understood why. They're just about bad business and you could tell by their lack of patrons. Patronize at your own risk.  But they will never get one of my dollars. And THEN... we went around the corner, got real Jameson and spent good money like we intended. The nerve of some people!!",4,2,
67,Dai F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,1,1,1.0,3/2/2017,"Hello Yelp Users;Mr. Biggs should really be renamed Mr. Riggs because I received an additional bogus charge on my debit card for an order I never made; never signed for, and definitely didn't consume. I have no idea what the amount was for as I didn't make it and therefore never had a receipt for it. I thought the charge was going to change it's amount to be the tip I left since it wasn't processed until Monday, but the amount didn't change and it was indeed a second charge. I called the establishment throughout the week to try to get a hold of a Manager up until today and was told by various Bartenders the Manager was either not present or was busy, but that my issue would reach them before the end of the day and that they would take care of it. Gave them the benefit of the doubt Monday & Tuesday, but Wednesday came and still heard nothing back. Fortunately I was able to take matters into my own hands, but it shouldn't have had to come to that. Just own up to your mistakes and fix them! Out of the multiple conversations with bartenders I never received an apology over the issue. I don't know whether or not you guys took me for a fool, but when it comes to money you messed with the wrong person, and the previous comment someone else (Terrance C.) left regarding getting double charged is proof this is not their first rodeo.Will not return to this place even if New York City was in the middle of a drought.

We walked in the door and waited at least 5 minutes for someone to seat us, hand us a menu or something. There was a table full of men right in front of us and eventually one of them turned around, noticed us standing there and said ""sit wherever you want"". So we chose a table by the window...the silverware and napkins on the table looked like someone already wiped their hands with it, very unappealing! After sitting at the table for nearly 20 minutes twiddling our thumbs, watching the guy who told us to take a seat help other men with their orders yet not even offer us a menu to look at or drink options, we walked out.

The experience should be the same. The establishment may take a small hit from you that day, but by giving you that same, great experience, you're more likely to return, even without any discount vouchers. Correct me if I'm wrong.We were told Groupon patrons could not sit outside, so we squeezed into their cramped quarters inside. It wasn't packed, the design of their tables are intentionally cramped. We kept it simple with beer and wings. Props: the beer was fizzy and cold. End of props! The wings took FOREVER to arrive and the servers didn't check on us that often. It wasn't packed. I had great company so I didn't trip too much, but still! When the wings arrived, they were way over-cooked! The meat had melted and burned down onto the bone.

My concern is the color of the fried chicken pieces is a few shades darker than the typical golden crispy color you normally see...In addition, sometimes the fried appetizers are drenched in oil and you can taste the difference. However, I would recommend the burgers and pasta.Overall, Mr. Biggs serves standard bar food. A beer cost $7 which is ridiculous especially in Midtown West.

I will definitely visit this place again and absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a cool, relaxed environment and a great time!",,,

Updated review","I went back this past saturday to have the potato skins I became in love with. They were just as good as the first time. My only complaints, hence the 4 star rating this time, is that the service is a little spotty. But hey, they seem pretty busy and understaffed so its not that big of a problem. I tried the margaritas (frozen) they are pretty good and not that weak. They are 5 dollars, but keep in mind if you add a flavor they will charge an extra dollar. Again good food, cheap prices, all in all pretty decent place to hangout with friends for some drinks and bar food.",1,2,1
93,John C.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,392,199,1.0,1/31/2012,"We went to this bar for the 49er and giants game.  The location is great.  Right in midtown manhattan!  The service is really slow,  we had to wait at least 35 minutes for our dishes.  Maybe its because of the game, but if the food is good, then the wait is ok.Summary of what we ordered:1) Buffalo Wings - hot on the outside, and cold and dry in the center.2) French fries - This is probably the best thing here.  Its hot and nicely fried.3) Burger - I ordered the burger medium, the burgers came well done, dry, and overcooked.  The patty could use more seasoning for some flavor.  I sent this back, and the second burger came back overcooked again.4) Draft beer - The cup is a bit warm, and the beer is just cool, and NOT COLD.  The glass should be chilled!5) Nachos - Can't believe they actually screwed this up!  The chips are stale!Normally I would not complain about food at a bar, but since they charge as if they are a real restaurant hence I rate this place like a restaurant.",,1,

98,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2672,3521,16559,4.0,5/10/2007,"There is a lot to be said about this place so its best left in one word:  Big.  They play big, eat big, and drink big.  All of that translates into tireless fun whether its singing bad karaoke on the weekends, awesome happy hour (with BIG double shots), and incredible portions for the food.  The place itself is not BIG but is suitable for the hip neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen.  The place can get packed in a hurry on the weekends and crowd maneuvering is not fun when you're at the bar enjoying a meal or drink as people inch by you and nudge you along the way.  I've come to near choking and drink spillage incidents on numerous occasions.My house special burger (Bigg's Burger) had to be similar to Jackson Hole but perhaps bigger with more toppings and excellent mini-jo jo potato wedges. The nachos are disgustingly big as well with an insane amount of sour cream, meat, and beans covered in an ice cream scoop's worth of guacamole.   Best part of all experiences is the prices are very reasonable, especially the drinks.",2,1,1

The portions here is huge! the chicken sandwich was not great, but the potato wedges were so good! very crispy on the outside and the inside was very potatoey and seasoned very well the party sampler was decent, mozzarella sticks were good.

I hit this place pretty often because I meet my friend at port authority and then we walk there together. It's perfect for a relaxed evening of gossiping. I personally would shy away from the margaritas, they are boozy enough, but not cold enough and after about 5 minutes, you have a regular margarita that isn't cold.... but the macaroni and cheese is fantastic. I recommend asking for it extra creamy.",,,

You can sit outdoors or indoors if you'd like. It's a bar so expect bar food, yummy yummy bar food. Come through for the insane happy hour special. Half off drinks and appetizers anyone? I've come here before and gotten the appetizers, thinking they would do their best to skimp on the food, man was I wrong! They brought out a huge basket of fries, a ridiculous amount of spinach dip, and some very delicious and satisfying chikken fingers (mmm, chikken fingers!). Food is yummy.I came here earlier today with my brother, to grab a beer. We each got a Blue Moon (which was his first one ever by the way!) and it came out to $6.50, for the 2 (I paid $6 for 1 at Crocodile's, just to give you a frame of reference). Can't beat hanging with your bro and slurping down delicous iced cold Blue Moon while discussing Lebrongate (Jesus, please let him come to the knix!!!!!!!), especially when it's that cheap. Couple that with different drink specials everyday (like $2 margaritas on wednesday) and you've got yourself a great bar, that doesn't try to do to much, but is really just right. It really deserves more than 3 stars, that's for sure.P.S. Where you clikk whether bars have a happy hour, there should be a ""Hell Yea"" option for this bar!",2,2,2

With big burgers, a decent draught selection, and perhaps the friendliest bar staff in HK, I can say I'll definitely be back. I had a big BBQ burger and the meat was high quality and I appreciated the availability of green salad as a side.Downside on the day that I went was that they were out/running out of several beers...at 3:30 in the afternoon. I don't know if that's typical, but at least it means that people were drinking there. Mr. Biggs was also remarkably clean.  In sum, Mr. Biggs is on my ""places to go again in HK"" list!",,,

Umm okay..-We ordered Spinach and Artichoke Dip. The strangest mix of ingredients in this spin dip; it had giant mushroom slices and this roasted tomato thing on top/inside. It almost tasted like mushroom soup. Wasn't bad, but pretty interesting.-The bathrooms are ATROCIOUS. I walked in and noticed there was no TP or paper towels. I asked a waitress for some and she came back with bar napkins.. BAR NAPKINS. Are you friggin kidding me??-During our stay, maybe 3 hours, we had 4 different waiters. They all seemed very confused the entire time and dead behind the eyes. The prices were pretty good. Our bill was probably $60 between the three of us drinking.

When I first started coming here, I was not a huge fan, but it has grown on me. The food is consistently good, the margaritas are tasty (and five dollars), and the staff is super friendly. They have recently remodeled this location so if you are interested in sports this is a great place to watch the game. It is also my understanding they are trying some dance parties out on the weekend. When it comes to the food, you are getting your typical bar food here. I recommend the fajitas or wings!

It turned out that there is only one lunch special menu with not much option, but it was a good portion, tasty enough, and it included a soda. Certainly a good deal, but I am not sure if I would be back.  The decor looked a little odd to me, and the location of restroom is right in the center.. like everyone in the restaurant can see me walking in/out of the restroom.

It's pretty nice inside compared to other bars I've been to in the area (e.g. Rudy's Bar and Grill- duct taped booths- ick!)  The brick wall on one side adds some character and prettiness to the place. There's plenty of tables, but it does get really cramped. They have different specials throughout the week:Mon. .25 cent wings with liquor purchaseTues.

We were only allowed to sit at the small tables in the middle of the floor. I didnt mind it as much. They accepted the groupon right away and we got to ordering. My friend and I wanted to use up the entire groupon so we ordered an appetizer sampler which consisted of chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks and zucchini fries. They were skimpy on the mozzarella sticks. The Chicken fingers were decent and the zucchini fries were great. For our entrees my friend ordered chicken parmesan over pasta. She was looking to satisfy a fried chicken and cheese craving. it was just that.. she wasnt crazy about the dish. but said for a pub it was not bad. I ordered the juicy lucy. A ground beef burger stuffed with cheese. I ordered it medium rare and it came out raw in the middle. I didnt say anything because I was full. I didnt want another burger. The potato wedges were okay... The bar service was decent just a little slow. Its a bit out of the way for me but I think if i were in the area, i would come back for happy hour.

It became a hilarious game of karaoke revenge, and we had a great time! The crowd was really supportive, mixed in age, and full of people just wanting to have fun. It was not a long wait to be called up to sing, either.I did not have any food (probably a bad decision), but there were plenty of drinks to go around! They make a really good Gin and Tonic.

139,Joe B.,"Jermyn, PA",0,1,0,3.0,1/31/2016,"Had an uncle who was a knock-around guy in Hell's Kitchen for years.   He was tight with the neighborhood crowd and did a lot of business there in the 80s when it was the 596.        When I got old enough in the 90s it was known as Tea Ball's and had a gay population.    As I got older they started doing business elsewhere.     But I kept going because I was dating a theater girl who went to FIT.   Things were almost back to normal,   but it was boring.    You'd have your old ""Westies"" hanging around playing the great juke and drinking Fleischmann's shots and bottles ' O Bud. Had a very small menu with wings,  Mozzarella sticks and anything fried that you might want. Depressing atmosphere.   Lot of small two-bit coke deals, etc.    It was neighborhood again. The owner was some scary Russian type dude who drove a Roll's and I'm positive was the one responsible for the coke.    Place was sorry.   Thought Stoli was fancy Vodka and had Bud, Coors Lite and Lager on tap, so it was a good deal for the theatrical union guys and the dock guys.  Wasn't scary in general,   but it could get scary quick!      Then I don't know what happened. I still see that Russian dude around,  but I see another brute who get's wasted and seem's to be giving orders. Then they ripped out the right wall and a good chunk of the dance floor and I think they put in a smoking garden, but not sure about that. Not the biggest fan of eating Al Fresco, especially at a corner like 10th and 43rd.    I was outside having a beer waiting my my friend ( Service was really good and one of the few places you can get a pitcher if you want one )   But I counted over 70 cabs driving by in about 15 minutes. I know it's New York, but that shit get's old.  I don't like eating out downtown , especially mid-town,  but if I'm at work, I don't mind a nabe like Arthur Ave.   You've got funny people and the tourists alone are a funny watch, bowing and scraping because they think every other person with a suit on is a wiseguy or that the waiter is connected. So that's alright.   Lot of shade trees, etc. So you go Mr. Bigg's which didn't ( the last time I was there ) and you're putting down a  pitcher of cold bud,   you have to assume that your meal is going to be a step up from a decent Hero joint.     But oh, surprise,  suddenly they do have a pretty big beer selection and the service is never hit and miss,  it's always fine.     The food is billed as Classic American Fare but it leans Italian, which makes me wonder who actually owns it.    The fried Calamad was as good as any I've had in the city.    Nicely breaded and that good sunshine fry to it and the medium hot sauce was fantastic.  Gonna bump it up to extra hot next time.    My friend had a Reuben Sandwich he claimed was a good as any in any of the deli's in New York.    The fries seemed freshly cut,  although I've thought that before about fries, so I'm not sure.   But they were good and salty and hot.   Perfect for dunking in the hot sauce.     Stuck with pitchers of cold domestic,   but you could tell the lines were very clean.    I've had very flat beer in there more than once.     The burgers, I remember from back in the day were their big dish and I saw a lot coming out of the kitchen.   Almost ordered one to take back to my hotel,   but knew I'd be eating at the Park Side in Queens that night,   so I knew I wouldn't be needing any left overs.     Some of the crew got Cheesecake,   but I had a bite and while it was very good,   it wasn't made on the premises.    Came in a box from some food import business.    But to me,  even a bad slice of cheesecake is a good slice of cheese cake.    Pizza; the same way.      The downside was that there were a ton of kids eating there which is shocking to me.    It's not that they were loud or obnoxious and they certainly helped the mood,   but just because I know the history of the joint so well.      I just realized I didn't use a paragraph.    Not one.   Sorry all.   I don't write Yelp reviews.   But I wanted to write one for this place because it went from Jimmy C's headquarters in the 70s where he might have sold slim jims ( before my time )  to doing with my uncle in the 90s when they tried to put some moderate food in  ( Along with the cocaine and numbers betting sales ) all the way to the  mid 2000's where you could get a good burger, laugh at the neighborhood trannies ( who were plentiful ) up until they really did a number on the place and still managed to keep the neighborhoods rep up by pumping out coke and blow and karaoke and being a fine place to meet a hot girl.      And now you're apt to find some stressed yuppie dad from Kansas changing his kids diaper in the men's room before they go see Wicked on Broadway.    It's pretty great to write about a place coming BACK then going away because everywhere you look in New York today,  everything is going away.  Go there, enjoy and don't mind the small criminal vibe.   Or enjoy it in a cool old school way.",,,1

180,Janifer C.,"Orlando, FL",66,75,5,3.0,9/1/2009,"A list of one of my old karaoke haunts have to include Biggs.  The food isn't bad.  I'd certainly suggest the burgers, if you want something relatively screw-up free.  The karaoke is really what this place is known for.  Friday and Saturday nights, prepare for a long list of singers.  There are some pluses and minuses to this place.  They don't play favorites, so everyone gets to sing at least one round before anyone gets to sing again, they have multiple screens for your lyrics, and on many occasions you get some really impressive singers who show up.  The down size is the wait and sometimes the place gets overly crowded, but a good time all in all.",,,

182,Tracy T.,"New York, NY",71,129,2,2.0,6/7/2009,"The only times I go here is when Lansdowne is too packed and I just want to chill with a beer and have a late night pub grub dinner. Drinks are normally priced and there's a decent bit of seating. I do like the nachos here. Chicken fingers are good, wings are okay, and the mac and cheese sucks. I always forget to keep tabs on when it's karaoke night, but it's usually not very pretty.",,,
183,Mike M.,"Fishkill, NY",36,174,1,2.0,4/29/2009,"I agree with Elliott W's comment about Mr. Biggs' identity crisis. It doesn't seem to have a distinct personality, and attracts an odd mix of patrons (or maybe it just attracts people who are hungry and/or thirsty and don't care where they're hanging out, I don't know). It usually seems a little dead, except LATE Friday and Saturday nights. Either way, it doesn't come across as a bar I'd want to hang out in too long (especially when the karaoke gets started). HOWEVER, I'm not much of a drinker, so this review is more about dining. I've been here a few times and to sum it up, the food is pretty good...a nice mix of bar standards (burgers, wings, fries, sandwiches) and some unexpected dishes (chicken pasta, crab cakes). The waiter/waitress service is usually decent and friendly, but the serving time is sloooowwwww. It shouldn't take almost 30 minutes to make a burger and fries when there's only a handful of other people in the place. Also, the interior suffers from a major lack of lighting......maybe they should've bought a few lights to put over the tables so you can actually see your food instead of the 8 or so big-ass TVs (which are usually showing everything BUT sports, and you have to ask them to change the channel. Weird.). Maybe this is why so many prefer to sit outside the joint, although be prepared for tons of tourist traffic.  All in all, if you're looking for a fairly quiet, dark place to hide in and grab a bite and a quick drink, Mr. Biggs is good for that.",,,
184,Sofia P.,"New York, NY",1,28,2,2.0,8/25/2008,"The blueberry pancakes I had were AMAZING but the All American breakfast was just so so, the scrambled eggs were not that great. I would go back for a burger or pancakes again, but what REALLY BOTHERED me is that when we asked for 2 glasses of water, the waitress brought us two bottles of Polan Spring water. She didn't even ask if we wanted tap or bottle. When the bill came, they charged $3 per bottle!!!! And it was the small bottle. That is ridiculous.This is just a local dive bar, how can even think of charging $3 for water? Plus, they don't even ask you.",1,,

What the hell?  And I'm wearing these orange sneakers, they're gonna think I'm one of them!""OK so maybe this isn't a gay bar, but there certainly were a lot of gay people that night who materialized out of nowhere during the course of our stay.  And I can never resist making a straight friend uncomfortable.  Especially in this case, when Seth seemed to be in love with this place.  I wonder what that means...",,,1
186,Jonathan K.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,1.0,10/7/2010,"Be VERY careful with your check. I visited Mr. Biggs Bar and Grill with a few friends. We started dining at happy hour where the appetizers were half price. We continued watching the baseball game through the end of happy hour ordering one more round at full price. When we received the bill, EVERYTHING was full price, with tip included. We mentioned something to the bartender who tried to tell us ""there was no way we could change the amount after it had been entered"". I explained that I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and know that is not true. They proceeded to change the total to the correct amount, tip (from the original full priced bill) included.Not a place I will go to again.",1,,

189,Lex A.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,139,59,3.0,8/22/2007,"Ahh Biggs. The owner is a regular at a bar where I used to be a regular. I will tell you this, he's charming, adorable and big and cuddly. His bar used to be that way, too. Now it's loud obnoxious with horrible karaoke that lasts too long and the waitstaff has appeared to have grown weary. Here are some of the amenities: 2 for one drinks after 2 am. Oh? And what else... Jeager Machine, frozen drink machine, bartenders who are hot and will deny you no matter what. And one of them is a relative of a celeb. The place has no cover and let's you add songs to the jukebox to your hearts desire. Just know that if you add something ""off"" like grunge after three top 40 hits or vice versa, you may get booed. Depending on how drunk you are, you'll fight back and then have the owner calm you down. Also, the kitchen is open late and the food is divine.Caveats, the place has become less diverse. It used to be all the people in the industry, actors, dancers, waitstaff. And now.. no. You've been warned.",,,
190,David N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/10/2013,"Terrible tasteless food--enough said.  On top of that, the manager was too dense to understand how a Groupon works and would not honor the complete value of mine.

I was part of the LivingSocial special today.  The ungroomed bouncer-looking male, clad in a regular T-shirt refused to sit us outside as that ""wasn't valid for LivingSocial"".  So this means I'm treated like a 2nd class citizen? This was the worst impression you could give!. I'll NEVER be back.  Most people in the restaurant left without getting their food.. waitresses and waiters wandering around like a headless chicken.  And the worst thing was the place was barely full! I think it would have been better if more chefs were working.. this was just ridiculous",,,

But I think people need to accept Mr. Biggs for what it is, a bar with BAR food, not a restaurant. I go here for their ridiculous happy hour special. Appetizers are half off and so are draft beers and most all the alcohol in the place. Artichoke dip is great, and they have a decent beer selection. The total for me and my friend came to under $20 with drinks and food! What more could you ask for? Beat that Lansdowne!",2,,2

197,Andre H.,"Bronx, NY",1,7,3,4.0,6/8/2008,"It's a nice place.  It isn't too large nor too small.  It wasn't packed the day I went so that was a plus.  The food isn't too expensive lying around the $10-$16 range for dinners and was less for the appetizers.  The service was great and the food arrived rather quickly.  As for the Karaoke, they had a wide selection of songs but could use a slight upgrade since some songs that came out last year are still missing.  My only gripe was that the microphone is low so you could barely hear anyone singing so I had to scream into the mic to hear myself.  I guess the low mic has it's purpose since some people just can't sing for the life of them.  So oh well.  It's a fun place to go.  A decent date spot and it won't hurt your wallet.",,,

199,Karl D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,3,0,2.0,3/22/2013,"Mr Biggs - what can I say - I used to really like this place - pretty decent food, good atmosphere, friendly barmen - and then last night happened...  I have often thought poorly of places but have never bothered writing a review on yelp to give out about it - this is my first as my experience really bothered me...  Anyway, two of our close friends were over visiting us - they landed at JFK pretty late and so my wife and I brought them Mr Biggs at around 11pm to order some food to bring it back to our apartment.  When we got there, we ordered some food at the bar as the barman was the only person who appeared to be working (i.e. no table staff around).  The barman told us it would be about a 15 minute wait - which was fine of course - and so we said we may as well order a drink while we waited.  Anyway, we got our drinks, and went to sit down at one of the high tables so we could chat face to face with our friends instead of being all lined up sitting at the bar trying to talk over each other with karaoke music blaring in the background - when we went to sit down at an empty table (beside a row of other empty tables), this fair haired American waiter/table service guy (who was nowhere to be seen until this very moment) rushes over and tells us we can't sit there as we didn't order from him.  If this was even a moderately busy night, then maybe I'd understand that but it was 11pm and there wasn't even a single person sitting at any of the tables in the entire bar and he still wouldn't let us sit there.  Despite me being very courteous and polite, he was just being a total d*** and was just pure rude to me and my wife be honest - what bothered me more than anything else was his response to us when we pleaded very nicely with him (and explained that we were just waiting on food for 10/15 mins etc) which went along the lines of ""These are MY TABLES and you are NOT sitting here - END OF!""  Anyway, as much as I used to love this place, I will definitely be taking my custom elsewhere if this particularly rude and arrogant member of table staff is working on my next visit...  I just don't get why decent/cool bars employ such rude idiots like this.  It lets the whole place down unfortunately.  Almost any other bar in the area will guarantee you better/friendlier service...  Rant over....",4,,
