0,Kath B.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,216,0.0,5.0,9/2/2018,"Great food, music, and atmosphere. You are under a lot of tent and umbrellas. Seating for families, friends, and couples are off to the side and if you want to grab a drink, you are in the middle of the music!Bathroom very clean, it does get packed up but not bad, as soon as you arrive, seating is available.Ordered the Chicken Sandwich with fries and sprite! Very very good.I did not like the bread offering before hand, it was tough and hard to eat, couldnt eat it. Please make the bread softer! Do love the service with olive oil.Servers were very nice and friendly, had a great time with my friends and fam! ;DAs a Native NYer always great to try new spots I have never been, this is one of them.",,,
1,Natalia M.,"Oviedo, FL",87,61,29,5.0,9/30/2018,We came here on August 4th for my 30th birthday and we had a blast. We sat at the bar and Dominic (I hope that's how his name is spelled) made my birthday a memorable one. He was friendly and his drinks were awesome. He even made me a special birthday drink. My whole family was impressed with him and how friendly everyone was. We will be back for sure!,1,1,2
2,Steph N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,9/5/2018,"I visited Rockefeller Center's Summer Garden this last Saturday with some out of town friends after touring the ""Top of the Rock"".  It was busy but we were sat pretty quickly. Our waitress Khali was the best, she stayed and talked to us a bit about the area and was probably one of the funniest people I've met. The Calamari was really good and my friends loved their Frose cocktails. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I would stop by again (and request Khali's section)",,,
3,Katie C.,"New York, NY",387,10,0,5.0,6/13/2018,Great outdoor bar and great place to rest during sightseeing. Steaks and drinks are amazing and the staff is even better. Thank you David M for pennies for our wishes and making our NY trip so memorable!!,,,
4,Angie C.,"New York, NY",205,167,1807,3.0,6/21/2016,"I have passed this outdoor bar many times but didn't manage a chance to visit it til this summer. The outdoor cafe wasn't packed on weekday afternoon; however, it took us about 20 mins to get our order and drinks. The outdoor seats are perfect, you could see Rockefeller center and the fountain from any angle. I just wish the staff could be more efficient.",3,1,1
5,John Q.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,2.0,9/16/2018,"The food is sub par at best, the chicken sandwich was the only good part. The manager Jake is a pompous jerk, hes very rude made the experience impossible to enjoy.",,,
6,Elaine C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",44,52,17,3.0,9/20/2017,"We stopped here for a quick drink to take a break and enjoy the center.  Great location, beautiful and feels like summer.  Staff was nice.  Drinks were ok, nothing special.  Nice place for a quick stop.",,,
7,Julia S.,"San Francisco, CA",554,75,17,3.0,6/29/2017,"Open at Rockefeller plaza during the summer!  My friend and I decided to stop by for a drink because it looked pretty.  Drinks are pretty good, and not too pricy (I expected them to be more expensive because it's a pretty touristy area) but the food is meeeh.  We got the chips and guac and it was pretty bad.  Service was fast and friendly though.",,,
8,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,144,0,2.0,7/7/2016,"After passing Rockefeller on a daily basis, my friends and I finally decided to check it out. They do have a Happy Hour, but it is only offered at the lounge or the bar. Thus if you're at a normal table, the HH is not available to you. We each ordered a glass of wine and entrees. I had falafel burger, with my friends ordering the watermelon salad and chicken wrap. The burger was incredibly spicy, so it was tough to enjoy the falafel and other flavors. It was also a high price tag considering what it was. Also, the wine was served in a plastic glass, which is pretty ridiculous considering I spent $15 for it. If i really wanted alcohol in a plastic cup, I'd just find the nearest college house party.The service is less than stellar. My friends were seated before I got there, and they still hadn't been served 15 mins after i arrived. Once i arrived, I had to flag down a waiter who seemed less than pleasant when I asked if we could order drinks. Our waiter was nice, but he didn't check on us very often. Ambience was great too, since it's down in the center. You have a great view of the fountain and can enjoy a nice Summer day. You will have to be aware of the birds and bugs though as they were everywhere.Overall, this place is really not worth it. The price tag is too high for the food, and the service leaves much to be desired.",,,
9,Lynda L.,"Medford, OR",35,47,27,3.0,8/8/2016,"I'm conflicted on how to rate this place. Do I rate the server - 5, or the loud obnoxious manager - 0?  I split the difference with a 3.I had an amazing meal and service here.  Our waitress had a perpetual smile, and checked on us often.  The food was good, but the awkward part of the meal was when a supervisor or 'manager' came out and belittled our waitress.  Not just slightly either - he was RUDE.  I was embarrassed for her, she was working so hard.  He was just an ASS.  I won't be back.  *Awesome waitress with the name that starts with ""A"" (sorry can't remember your name) you are way better than that Ahole.  Find a job where they respect you.",2,,
10,Aubree K.,"Napa, CA",17,70,12,1.0,8/11/2016,"Staff here get 5 stars hands down. The 0 stars is for GM Geoff Gljiva, who I personally witnessed degrading staff and exhibiting overall disgusting behavior, while I was sitting at the bar on August 6th.  I'm not sure how he justifies shaming staff and calling into question their aptitude when he himself behaves in a manner no professional person- especially one in a management role, ever should - yet does it openly in front of guests.I was so traumatized by my experience that I spoke personally with my connections at the Patina Restaurant Group. I told them in detail how staff were being treated. I would also be more than happy to back any employee who choses to bring discrimination and/or labor violations in the future. I was so uncomfortable with my experience as a guest witnessing this behavior that I contacted Daniel Kelley (Director of Human Resources), and filed a formal complaint. The staff here were all really wonderful and I enjoyed the food and drinks. I just wish my relaxing afternoon was not ruined by listening to staff being screamed at and told they were stupid and talked to like idiots. It's a real shame. I see other guests have had a similar experience with the GM.",2,,
11,Sandy M.,"Maplewood, NJ",131,21,0,3.0,6/29/2017,"Amazing place to have a drink.  Apps are OK, drinks are damn good.  Place gets filled up quickly.  Call to reserve a table for dinner after the sun goes down.",,,
12,Allyson M.,"Chicago, IL",51,98,55,5.0,9/10/2016,"Want a delicious brunch, a beautiful view of the Rockefeller Center Prometheus statue, and amazing server?? Ask for the beautiful, sweet, knowledgable, professional Equasia and order an American Breakfast!! THANK YOU, Equasia. We will be back because of you!",1,,
13,Alex P.,"Manhattan, NY",162,6,4,1.0,6/13/2016,"What are you expecting If you hire a kindergarten aged staff ? A lot of nonsense and bullshit ? No, really ? I'm sure they ain't got they passports yet and can't legally buy alcohol. ""Amazing"" overall experience.",,1,
14,Diane M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,4,5.0,9/12/2016,"My husband and I were spending our last night in Manhattan and stumbled across this wonderful venue. We sat at the bar and were fascinated by this amazing bartender named Vida.  She was talking to all the customers, making drinks for our side of the bar and the opposite side all while taking orders from the waiters and making their drinks too!She interacted with everyone with a smile and funny comments. She made our last day in New York so memorable. I asked her who her boss was so we can put in a good word for her. So his name is Shawn and I want him to know how lucky he is to have such an awesome employee! We will be back to New York to see her! The drinks were also amazing!",,,
15,Jeremy F.,"Del Mar, CA",0,2,0,2.0,5/30/2016,Ordinary food. Our waitress was very busy and after ordering everything on a wireless ordering system our starters came out and we had to ask for our drinks (@$12 a pint! ) a second time. Food took a long time to come out. Finally the cheese cake was not good at all. 4 of us took a small bite and left it (including kids who love deserts! It tasted like something you'd get from Costco. I let the waiting staff know about the cake after is completed my payment and tip.,2,,
16,Billy C.,"Meriden, CT",25,2,0,1.0,5/31/2016,"The food was disgusting, 15 dollars for 6 tiny asparagus stalks with an egg... which made me ill... the restaraunt was 1/4 full and yet they wouldnt let us sit where we wanted. Not a single person working there spoke a lick of english, our waitress didnt speak english, the retard with the stale bread reached over me and he stunk of BO, i repeatedly troed explainining to him that my grandmother didnt want end pieces of bread because of jer teeth, as he continually shoveled end pueces towards here, he literally did not speak a word.of english... this restaruant is the embdodiement of the fact that diversity is NOT a strength, it makes everything suck. Oh and it took the waitress nearly 50 minutes to take our drink order, she was busy on her cellphone most of the time. Couldnt find a translator to get a manager over... avoid! If my granny didnt have a bad leg we would have gone to Bills Burgers around the block. Instead i had to suffer this awful multicultural tower of babel experience at inflated price. Truly awful.",2,,
17,Brian G.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,0,5.0,9/24/2016,"My girlfriend and I had drinks after a long day of walking in New York at the Summer Garden located at Rockefeller Plaza. We had such a great time sitting at the bar and met 2 really awesome employees, Vida and Ivan. They were very gracious and Vida is so humble and real!  She cracked us up with her stories. Their service was sincere and welcoming. For first timers to New York, we were very happy to have found this place. If you're ever near Rockefeller Plaza, stop by the bar, sit back, relax and let Vida serve you up some drinks!",,,
18,Kaitlin M.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,2,0,1.0,8/9/2016,"This is the absolute WORST place for happy hour. To start the service was slow, but that was not even the problem. The issue was when given our bill we were overcharged by two beers (earlier we ordered two beers but they never came- that totaled 24 dollars because it's overpriced). You would think it would be a quick fix when we saw the problem, but in fact it was just the opposite. When we politely told the waitress we were charged wrong she said she had to get the manager...ok no problem. Then ten minutes later the manager appeared and approached us in a RUDE AND CONDESCENDING manner explaining they ""DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS."" My thoughts - they don't do what, normally correct incorrect charges ????"" In my head I thought ""is this real??"" I'll admit I let out a laugh because I couldn't believe what came out of her mouth and in her response she said I needed to be more respectful because she was doing us a favor. ABSOLUTE RUDEST MANAGER I HAVE EVER MET and completely ruined the experience. Thanks soooo much for taking the items off the bill that we did not receive. I hope the appropriate steps are taken to improve future customer experiences.",,,
