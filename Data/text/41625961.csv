0,1,9/30/2012,575,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Neil B.,1098,2.0,983,"The Dunkin' Donuts website lists this DD as being at 139 Centre Street. In any case I stopped in this morning for the 99 cent bagel with butter special that actually costs $1.08. When I arrived there was a customer in front of me being helped. There were two employees in the store. One was helping the person in front of me, the other was texting. After a few minutes, the employee who was working asked the one texting if he could take my order. He took my order, an everything bagel toasted well done with butter,  and my money, then went back to his phone. The other employee made my bagel and the other guy's stuff. When he handed me my bagel, I pointed out that the sign on the cash register said that if they failed to give you a receipt, your order was free. He and the texting (or game playing....I did not actually look) guy then began looking through all the receipts they had not given customers. When I pointed out that the sign said ""free"" he angrily reached in the cash register and pulled out a dollar (not $1.08). Figuring that the people who work there don't exactly make much money and the dollar might come out of his pay, I told him he could put the dollar in the tip bowl, but instead he gave me dirty look and put it back in the register. I then left and discovered that my bagel was not toasted well done...but I was not about to head back to this DD...for quite a while!",4

Make sure to demand they make your sandwich the way you want it like the regular that comes here at 6AM. WELL DONE BACON, GODDAMNIT. Remake it! Or the guy who demanded his iced latte be made with iced coffee?Anyways, if not you'll get a microwaved sandwich that tastes like rubber and a coldbrew with too much cream and sugar. They have the 2 for $5 bacon egg and cheese croissants. Better deal than bacon egg and cheese on a bagel for $4.09.Only savior is there are seats here unlike the Starbucks on Canal St, but I think the Starbucks a little farther on Lafayette is open at 5:30AM AND has seats too.",2
2,,7/12/2017,131,,"New York, NY",Alexis T.,147,1.0,69,Customer service is very rude. Every time I was in they're always talking about guests and my ice coffee is whatever they decide to make rather than what I ask for. Never coming back here again,

Updated review",69,,"Baldwin, NY",Sean L.,0,1.0,2,Not open on time. Not the first time and a bunch of other people showed up and left. Service sucks too.,
4,,10/22/2017,1,,"Manhattan, NY",Jenna C.,0,1.0,54,"Pretty sure this is the worse store I've been to for this chain. I used to get decent service but lately it's been going downhill.I ordered an iced vanilla chai here recently. The service was okay when I ordered it but when I drank it, it tasted like there was 50% coffee in there. I thought it was my imagination so I took another sip...and yep, it's definitely coffee. Dumped it. After I left the store, I saw a homeless guy down the block. Wish I coulda taken my money back and given it to him instead.The next --and last-- time I went there, there was a guy and his daughter in front of me. I was the only one in line so I waited for them to finish making their order while they were chatting. After the guy already paid the cashier, the cashier notices that I'm in line but keeps talking to this guy. I left after 2 minutes of this. Cashier coulda kept chatting with him while he took my order but oh well.",
5,,7/26/2017,40,,"Atlantic City, NJ",Dutch S.,435,5.0,338,I love this Dunkin'...great Iced Coffee and now available with Almond Milk. All of the Cops come here so it's also perhaps the safest DD south of Canal Street! Nice.,
6,,5/7/2017,3,,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",Jen L.,45,1.0,28,"Service is horrible here, zero respect for their customers. When you ask for a receipt, they're reluctant to give it to you, you literally have to argue with them for it. The guy who took my order took forever, gave me an attitude and at the end didn't even give me the donut I wanted because he was too lazy to reach up to the top shelves to get it!",1
7,,5/17/2014,550,3,"Brooklyn, NY",Jessica D.,2196,1.0,836,"I was hungry and so was my boyfriend,so went to this Dunkin Donuts to pick up a donut/snack for myself and my boyfriend.It's a small dunkin donuts, limited seats. I walked in and the two men were playing games on their iPhones or whatever. I told them the two donuts I wanted and it came out to $1.98. I gave two dollars and was waiting for my change back. I told the young man that I am waiting for my change just two pennies cause I gave two dollars. He seemed lazy and didn't bother opening the cash register to give me my change and told me to pick it up from the tip jar instead. Lazy much? I wasn't happy at all. I don't think I will be back at this dunkin donuts for a while. The men didn't seem very welcoming or friendly either. Why do they even let idiots like this work at a dunkin donuts?By far the most unpleasant experience at a DD.",2
8,,7/31/2017,0,,"Queens, NY",Matthew L.,0,1.0,4,"Worst dunkin donuts ever! Customer service is trash, staff is rude and if there's a small amount of change that needs to be given, they won't give it to you even if you ask.",
9,,1/18/2015,245,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Xiao S.,312,1.0,212,"Although I know most Dunkin donut don't bake their own bagels, this establishment have the stealest bagels ever. Its so chewy and plain inedible. The cash register service is fast but waiting for your food takes a while. I think the cart guy outside is an even better option.",2
10,,11/14/2016,0,,"New York, NY",Tae P.,0,1.0,1,Terrible service. Waited 10mins for a vanilla chai. They called people who ordered after me and not once asked me what i was waiting for. As soon as i said i wanted a refund they kept saying its coming. Never going back there again.,1
11,,7/28/2015,1,,"Manhattan, NY",Cecillia F.,6,1.0,15,"Horrible service, the customer behind me ordered the same drink as I did; however, he changed his from a hot to a cold, so the barista assume that my drink was the one. He put aside my drink and left me waiting for a long long period of time. Please visit the starbucks or the other DD location across the street.",3
12,,9/19/2015,63,,"New York, NY",John F.,1,4.0,60,"This is the Dunkin' I go to every morning, and I've actually felt it is the best out of the 3 on the West Side of Canal - the line moves (although the crowd waiting for breakfast sandwiches gets very in the way), and the team remembered my coffee order after only a few days. I actually go 1 block out of my way to go here - maybe this is a bit of a backhanded compliment, but there's definitely worse Dunkins in this part of town.",
13,1,9/6/2012,899,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Monique R.,538,2.0,909,"When this location first opened up, it quickly became part of my morning ritual. Getting off the train, stopping in as its on the way to the office for a quick breakfast and then heading for the office. What was a great start to the day has slowly become a nightmare. The location is right near the train station so naturally a lot of people stop in for breakfast and coffee on the way to the office. The staff can dole out steaming cups of joe at lightning speed but they fail miserably at expediting breakfast items. Lately, there has been a great deal of congestion next to the register and sugar station as people wait impatiently for their crossaints and english muffins. There are 3 people working the coffee and 1 person making breakfast. For the last 3 mornings, i have waited 10 minutes or more for my breakfast. Fail. I come in after lunch for a 3pm pick me up and if you are only getting coffee, its quick...but im only gettting coffee. For coffee, this place is quick but if you want something hot to eat, prepare to wait.",3
14,,12/29/2012,185,,"Raleigh, NC",Claudine D.,255,3.0,337,"This DD is quite busy as mentioned in another review. However, they get you through  the line fairly quickly to order. I did have to wait a bit for my sausage croissant, but it wasn't that long and I wasn't in a rush either.",
15,,3/23/2014,5,,"Littleton, CO",Kelsey T.,10,1.0,52,Donuts were stale. Worker was VERY rude. Didn't get any of the order correct. Not a good experience.,2
16,,6/9/2015,0,1,"New York, NY",Steph R.,0,1.0,14,This is the WORST DD ever known to man. I've gone to many DDs as I love the donuts and the coolattas. But this one is around the corner from my job and the worst I've ever visited. The staff is disgustingly rude and get visibly mad at you when THEY mess up your order and you tell them about it. I've reached out to corporate and no changes have happened. I stopped going there in the morning rush and have stayed away since the last time they messed up. I'd rather spend my time and money in Starbucks where I'm treated well and it's not a hassle for them to fix their own mistakes IF they make one,2
17,,4/2/2013,10,,"Staten Island, NY",Tillie K.,189,4.0,302,I came here this morning. 1 person in line and it was a fast and smooth transaction. Maybe I got lucky and went in at a good timing. Nothing was wrong with my order. Staff was friendly. I got a sesame bagel with cream cheese and it was well toasted.  The place is small and has a couple of seats and tables. It's right next to canal street subway station so it's a very good location to have a Dunkin' Donuts store around here.,
