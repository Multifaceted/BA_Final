0,Allison C.,"Temecula, CA",2,52,1,4.0,9/15/2018,"My boyfriend and I were visiting NYC for the first time, and my bestie from college drove down from Goshen to spend the weekend with me. We wanted a cute Sunday breakfast place, and since it was a very last minute trip, most of the fancy brunch spots were already booked for the times we were looking for. My boyfriend found this place on Yelp and we reserved a 9:30am time. They texted us when our table was ready, and our waitress was the sweetest. She was very funny too. My boyfriend and friend ordered the the Prix-Fixe (Biscuits and Gravy & Omelet) and I ordered the Eggs Any Style. All of us really enjoyed our meals. I thought my plate tasted like any other brunch spot though. Nothing really special, but I definitely would eat here again and try other options on the menu. Everything looked great. I only took away one star because it really is like any other breakfast restaurant I've been to before.",1,,
1,Anjali R.,"Downtown, Miami, FL",342,279,313,5.0,9/8/2018,"Amazing brunch spot! We called ahead and put ourselves on the wait list on a Saturday morning around 11am and the wait was about 40 minutes- not that bad considering how popular this place is.  The service was excellent. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and our waitress was very friendly. We ordered a variety of brunch items including the egg and bacon croissant, French toast and a BLT. Our waitress must've been able to sense how hungry we were because our dishes were brought out within 10 minutes of ordering. All meal portions were large, the food was fresh and delish! Absolutely no complaints. We will definitely be dining here again on our next trip to NY",1,,1

3,Lindsey F.,"Reno, NV",169,153,132,4.0,6/15/2018,"This place was absolutely darling! It was pretty packed when we went in in the middle of the day on a Friday. They serve breakfast until 11 and if you were going on a holiday or weekend I would plan ahead! My food was delicious. I did the breakfast sandwich on the croissant. I was a little disappointed it didn't come with any sides- not that the menu said it would but I just feel like it could've used some potatoes or fruit. I ended up getting their raspberry sour cream coffee cake (not pictured because I devoured it). The service was average, nothing to write home about. Our waiter checked on us and brought us what we needed but wasn't overly friendly or anything. The one thing I was pretty appalled with was the cleanliness of the bathroom. It's an older building but I really felt like it could have used some TLC.Overall I would recommend this place for a small intimate breakfast!",1,,
4,Aya N.,"Miami, FL",1,28,64,2.0,5/29/2018,"We came to NYC for the first time and stopped into Penelope after researching breakfast spots close to our Airbnb.  Everything online seemed legit.  Food looked good, menu looked good, reviews weren't bad at all. The space was very small and cozy.  But a little too small as we were elbow to elbow with the people to the left and right of us.  It was hard to get into my seat and squeeze in between tables.  During our meal we could hear everyone's conversations, as they did ours.  The people next to us were very close and they took extreme interest in watching us eat and staring at our plates the entire time. Talk about awkward, lol.  I'm not against cute and cozy places at all.  But, the lack of elbow room during breakfast was definitely a negative. The food was okay.  Nothing special.  Eggs were cold, the bacon was overcooked, the toast was hard.  The ketchup they offer has a weird taste to it so it ruined my potatoes.  The waffles were the best part of the meal.  Nothing stood out in terms of food.  It was definitely overpriced.  Eating average breakfast food for two squished next to people, all for $70. If the food had been out of this world, maybe we would've been ok with it.  Save yourself the money and spend $10 at Starbucks - you'll be happy you did.",,,
5,Ayesha A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,86,82,3.0,8/7/2018,"3.5  Nice cozy place. I came here because they had great reviews and I went through the pictures and loved the way the french toast look and wanted to try them so badly but unfortunately it wasn't on the menu that day so I settled for fish and chips and some brussels sprouts. I absolutely love brussels sprouts and I must say tthese were just OK. However the fish and chips was much better, the Mamosa was like seriously on point I ordered some cookies and a carrot cake for my husband that was really good. The utensils were ok, the food plating was basic the atmosphere was a cafeteria style seating. It's worth a try only if you're in the area.",1,1,
6,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",121,353,373,1.0,1/17/2018,Very disappointed. Came here for lunch and expected a good culinary experience. Let's just say never again.Food:-The truffle tater tots had a large grey piece of dirt inside one of them. The rest had very little potato in them with a thick deep fried layer around. They replaced the item but I felt ill just looking at it. The item was not removed from the bill.-The grilled chicken salad had pieces of undercooked meat. The kale was wilted. -The meatball salad did not taste great. The dressing it came with was sour and the meatballs mushy. I also found a piece of something crunchy in one of them.The experience:-The service was slow.-The bathroom was filthy. -They advertise a deck of cards for feedback but didn't deliverOh and I read hidden reviews- so many of them and all horrible. I should have known better not to come here.,3,2,
7,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,3.0,1/4/2018,"This place gets enormously busy during brunch. Personally, I don't see why, as the food isn't any better than your average brunch place. That being said, there's certainly nothing bad about it either. The wait was quite bearable when we arrived, partly because one of us had gotten here early and put her name down before the others arrived. We sat closest to the door. Not the most pleasant experience since we were getting a lot of the draft from the door, plus all of the people squeezing by, but when the waits average close to an hour for a table, you can't afford to be choosy.I ordered the poached eggs with salmon. It was quite good, especially the bread. My friend ordered a side of bacon which never arrived. She finally had to ask the server to remove it from the bill. My friend's egg sandwiches were good, although portions seemed a bit small. Prices are pretty reasonable though.",4,1,3
8,Reema P.,"Lexington, KY",65,33,69,4.0,7/14/2018,Good service but great food! Had a summer rose mimosa so pretty and avocado toast af and it was perfect ... the right proportion of each component. Busy at brunch but reasonable wait time. Would definitely come back to try other menu items!,,,
9,Danielle B.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",332,140,6,2.0,7/4/2018,"I've lived in the neighborhood for a while and finally got around to trying Penelope.  It has been recommended to me by people every once in a while, unprompted, when I say I life in the area.We had donut hole starter, bacon sandwich, nutella french toast and two eggs over easy.  Eggs over easy seemed to be the way to go.The service was very slow and seemed a little bit disorganized.  I will say that all the people employed the restaurant were very nice and friendly.  I just would have liked to see more of them.Couple issues with the food.  The donut hole starter was warm and probably made earlier that morning.  They are not sold as warm on the menu so perhaps this is unfair, but the setup is such that they are covered sugar and you dip them in glaze.  I had the bacon sandwich and the bacon on it was not hot.  Similar to the donuts, it seemed to have been cooked earlier in the morning.  The fried egg was warmer, but again, perhaps the sandwich sat in the kitchen for a while before it was brought out?  My biggest issue is that the lettuce on the sandwich was rotten.  At first I thought that the hot fried egg had wilted the mixed greens, but after more thorough inspection, I am fairly confident that slimy mixed greens were put on my sandwich.They've changed around the nutella french toast, but I was impressed at their ability to soak half of an entire baguette in egg.  They use good bread for the bacon sandwich and for the eggs over easy.",,,
10,Anna S.,"Columbus, OH",70,358,284,4.0,1/4/2018,"I've been here a couple of times and this is a solid brunch/breakfast spot. I know the wait times get a little ridiculous during the weekend, so I would definitely suggest only going here during the weekdays. Getting a table is super easy and I've never waited. Each time I've been here, I've regretted not getting a side of bacon. It's seriously the largest portion of crispy bacon I've ever seen (just get it!). On my last visit I had the lentil cakes with the pineapple salsa situation with scrambled eggs and sourdough toast. The cakes were very, very well seasoned and delightful. Totally recommend! As you can see in the photo, my friend got an omelet with home fries which she proclaimed delicious.",1,,1
11,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,204,100,3.0,6/28/2018,"3.5/5 starsnot sure what all the hype is about here. I came here with two friends for dinner and I was not really impressed, it was all just okay. The place is pretty cute and intimate and the waitress was really nice, but the food was very standard and nothing special. I ordered the nice chicken meatballs ($14). This was basically a meatball sandwich with cheese and pesto & came with fries. It was pretty good, but not amazing.My friend ordered the warm brie and green apple sandwich ($12). Again, she thought this was good, but not great. This especially was something you could make at home. I guess this is just a cute, neighborhood place to come with decent prices and decent food when you don't feel like cooking. Not sure what i'm missing here, maybe i'll come back for brunch!",,,
12,Jane H.,"New York, NY",447,192,63,5.0,9/8/2018,I came here with my roommate for dinner. We both had the burger and fries which is my go to and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is super cute and cozy and I am so happy it is in the neighborhood!,,,
13,Kathy C.,"Queens, NY",71,95,148,4.0,6/2/2018,"The avocado toast seemed really popular as the whole table of 4 next to us all got it, but we opted not to get this dish. Instead we got the berry pancakes, salmon wrapped eggs, monkey bread and tater tots. The two highlights for me was the monkey bread and iced coffee. Yay for monkey bread on a menu! It's small portion wise but tasty, sweet, and a little crunchy on the outside so it's not just a sticky soft mess. Three of us shared this which is good because it tastes like it's full of calories (i.e, yummy). Iced coffee is $+1 with the prix fixe vs hot coffee but was really good, not too bitter or acidic but still fragrant. Plus they offer oat milk. The berry pancakes were tender and slightly chewy, the perfect texture for pancakes for me as I am not a fan of overly fluffy/soft pancakes. The salmon wrapped eggs were okay but I would not get this again as it was not memorable. The salad that comes with the salmon dish reminds me of the lettuce that you get at kbbq to eat with the meat, so that was new for me and I don't know if I liked it. The tater tots were extra crunchy (yay!) but had a little bit of the reused oil taste but maybe it's just me because they were finished off by the rest of my table. We were quoted a 40 min wait for 3 people at 11:30 AM but waited only 20 mins. Our waiter, Joseph, was super nice and patient. I do have a gripe about the fact that they only have one gender neutral bathroom stall as it seemed like a really long wait to just wash my hands (syrup is sticky!). Overall, I think for the price it is a decent option for this area.",1,,

15,Cat V.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",304,236,85,2.0,4/3/2018,"I've been to Penelope a handful of times within the last year and it seems to be more disappointing each time. Penelope's appeal is it's a charming, country style cafe known as a brunch spot but does have a lunch and dinner menu options - which I've never tried. Its located on Lexington Avenue between 29 and 30 streets. The space is very tight with tables and chairs, some being old church pews and benches. When its busy its challenging to even get out of the bench areas or anywhere without being super careful knocking over your neighbors items on the table. For breakfast/brunch, I've had the raspberry sour cream coffee cake which was dry, the Chorizo Egg Sandwich, Sam I Am plate, Mhmm Biscuits and Gravy plate, B.B.E.L.T. sandwich and Farmer's Market Omelette. Biscuits are decent but the gravy is not so flavorful. The Chorizo sandwich was too greasy and when ordering over medium or over easy eggs, they came hardboiled. Coffee wasn't hot any time I went and the drinks such as the sangria was ok but a bit watered down.Staff are a bit rushed and hard to keep track of. There is a bar with stools to sit on and order take away pastries, cakes, etc. They do accept credit cards and splitting up the check. I would have to be convinced to return for lunch or dinner to try other items but the price isn't worth the quality of food I've already tried.",5,,
16,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,815,371,4.0,3/25/2018,"I would eat here once a week if I lived in Murray Hill. I might go once a month even if the food sucked because it's the cutest place, something you'd find upstate in Dutchess County or upper Westchester. Rustic perfection. But the food IS fabulous. The pea mac and cheese is huge and decadent. The cheap 9 buck a glass wine was more than decent and a generous pour. My friend had a club sandwich or something (grilled with cheese). Fries plentiful and fabulous. I live 2 blocks from the 6 at Bloomingdale's so it's not a big deal for me to take a 12 or 13 minute subway ride to 33rd and walk a couple blocks. I'm really enamored of the place and can't wait to return.",2,1,3
17,Joanne C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,45,4.0,4/22/2018,"Always a great classic American brunch place, high quality food and some creative twists on traditional dishes. The atmosphere is fun. Basically a more casual Sarabeths.  The prix fixe menu is $22 for a drink (alcoholic brunch beverage ;), coffee or juice) We had the omelette and gravy biscuits. GRAVY BISCUIT: really great, it's vegetarian and very light. The biscuit is on the denser side. Very large portioned so good bang for buck!! OMELETTE: good but not with the price in my opinion, the portion size of the plate is large, but you get mostly filled up with the potatoes and toast and the omelette itself is small. Wait staff was very nice, ambience is cheerful, bar seats were just as nice as the tables. All around solid place for brunch!",1,,

We planned ahead, phone ahead to make a rezo and it all just worked out for us. We had a great meal, great conversation.I need to just say, the crew working here was probably the best serving crew I've ever been served by! This place screams out ""efficiency""!!!!!! we were seated so fast, to a clean dry table. Our drinks order was taken right away, someone brought them out pretty fast.

There's a no wait thing via Yelp where you can start waiting beforehand. It's a nice cute place and their $20 entree plus cocktail price is pretty amazing.I ordered their farmers omlet with chorizo and tomorrow's and peppers. This came with sourdough, soft butter (I hate it when it comes hard as a rock) and home fries. Could the home fries be more flavorful? Yes, absolutely!! The omlet was very straightforward and nice. Value for money yess. Will I come here again? Maybe. We had a good time overall. But the wait time is a downfall. My Bellini was decent and my friends' burgers were good too. Actually I might be back to try their sangria (with mango and strawberries, yes you heard that right)!!

But the omelettes didn't disappoint. They came with home fries, which were great, and the omelettes were hearty without being just straight up blocks of egg. I got mine with broccoli rabe, bacon, and avocado - perfection.The atmosphere is cute and airy and perfect for brunch; they also had interesting sounding drinks and great coffee.",,,

We used the app recommended on their website to reserve a table; we were a group of three, which added like an extra 45 minutes on to the wait time we thought we'd have.They're cranking people in and out of there like a well oiled machine.Except it's not.As stated by others, service was basically non-existent .. after waiting forever for our table, we waited forever for drinks. Our server was friendly enough, but the place is packed, you're shoulder to shoulder with the people next to you, and hoping like hell you don't step in the breakfast the toddler who sat at the table before you threw on the floor .. but wasn't cleaned up because again, with barely a swipe of the table with a cleaning cloth, they're cranking you through.But back to waiting .. waiting for our order to be taken .. waiting for brunch to arrive .. waiting for coffee refill .. .. and waiting for that insane check for a mediocre brunch.",2,3,

When a friend came into town to visit, we decided to give the reasonably priced dinner menu a try. Despite most of the tables being occupied, our party of two was sat right away when we arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night. Despite the disappointing beet and burrata salad that we split to start, my meal was great. The warm chicken meatballs and arugula were delicious and more filling than I anticipated. We split a side of crispy brussels and fries as well, both of which were really good. It looked like most other tables ordered burgers so that must be the thing to get here, but when I come back I'll probably order the same thing!",3,2,3

26,Stella C.,Hong Kong,293,665,322,3.0,6/6/2017,"In a city like NYC that is an oasis of delicious eats, you can expect that many places will require a wait. Penelope is one of those places, but unfortunately, not worth the ridiculously long wait. We came by for brunch and yes, I totally get that this is when it will hit ""peak busy"" --- but 1 hr 45 min+ busy?! We put our name & phone number down, then decided to go for a walk since there was nowhere to sit and wait. During our wait, we had time to: walk a few blocks to a coffee shop, sit and have coffee, walk a few blocks back to my friends apartment where we hung out for a bit, watched a bit of tv, then walked back to Penelope's where we checked in and our table STILL wasn't ready. We sat and browsed the menu while we waited until we were finally seated nearly two hours later. Unreal.After obsessively checking Foursquare/yelp for what to eat (needless to say, I had a lot of time to research while waiting), I settle on two items and ask the server for his advice on which to choose or if he had any suggestions on what we must eat while here. When I inquired about the blueberry waffles, his feedback was that he personally did not like blueberries. After two hours of waiting and then this, I can't even.At this point, we are starving and so now my standards are understandably low. Any edible form of sustenance will probably taste close to amazing at this point. Between my friend and I, we had a sandwich, waffles, side of bacon, juice and coffee. The orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious! As was the bacon. The waffle was nothing special, just a basic waffle with a side of fruit you could literally get anywhere. I really wanted to like this place because it seems like a great neighborhood place, not pretentious and the staff is friendly. Who doesn't love a brunch place in their neighborhood? The food is not bad, it's just that if you do great American fare, I expect that it should be great and done well. If the best part of the meal was bacon and juice, I can't justify waiting nearly 2 hrs for that.",4,4,1

Went in once around 12 and sat for twelve seconds after realizing we were too late for breakfast. (Only served until 11:45am on weekdays) Anyway, the food was good. The french toast was the most impressive. Nutella in the center and the banana maple glaze for it was so sweet and wonderful. My sausage and feta omelette with home fries was good, the bread-basic. I know I would have enjoyed my meal a bit more had i been in the restaurant.. pretty cutesy in there. Excuse my depressing photos for the meals. I blame the lighting.

30,Katie S.,"East Hampton, NY",6,22,3,2.0,6/11/2018,We were excited to try this restaurant as my daughter just moved to the neighborhood. The ambience is adorable and we were looking for a good Sunday night meal. I knew something wasn't right when I was waiting for the bathroom which was directly next to the kitchen. The kitchen was filthy. Floor was so gross. I didn't see a stove anywhere and while I was waiting he took meatballs out of the microwave and placed them to be served. I was glad to have seen that and didn't order those. I did order the 3 grilled cheese which came luke warm and no sign of being grilled (microwaved?). It was really disappointing. Fries were luke warm also. My kids had Mac and cheese which was decent and the hilly cheesesteak which was lackluster. Definitely will not go back. Especially now that my daughter is sick today from work.,,,1

The service was absolutely wonderful with complimentary coffee and ice cold water. Once seated, we were promptly asked for our orders and the food came in a timely manner. As for food, I ordered the chorizo egg sandwich on an english muffin, which came with sundried tomato pesto. To be honest, I thought the sauce was a bit overpowering. I couldn't taste the pesto at all and the tomatoes made it super tart. For the price, the  sandwich was a bit too modest. Overall, I enjoyed my dinning experience at Penelope, but it didn't really leave a lasting impression. With all the dining options along the same street, I'm not sure if I'll go out of my way to return here for brunch in the near future.",1,,

The woman at the table next to me returned hers too, so I didn't feel as bad.The server remediated the situation by bringing the other half of steak sandwich which was also salty and bready, and the bread was really crusty, not in a good way and there wasn't too much steak in it.

The food is pretty solid - some of my favorites are the artichoke dip, old school mac and cheese, juicy beef burger, and CJ fish and chips. The part where they fall short is the service. It's happened quite a few times where some items just never showed up and the server never realized it until we pointed it out. If they could improve the service some more, I'd definitely move it up to 4 stars.",1,,
39,Byron W.,"Manhattan, NY",377,55,108,4.0,6/20/2018,4.4/5Came here about 4 times in the past when I was living at Murray Hill area. This place is simply adorable! I definitely make me feel like I'm in Brooklyn rather than NYC when I'm here. Cozy and loud with people chatting. Brunch and breakfast are always super packed here so be sure to come here early! Dinner is usually pretty packed too but there wouldn't be a line. I love the fact that I could get bottomless coffee here. And my favorite item is probably the Penny Egg sandwich! I wish this place is not that popular so that I could go there more often!,,,

Updated review","I'm from Florida and was looking for a simple place to have breakfast. I actually found this place walking by it. Small place but welcoming and a delightful place tFood was pretty decent. I only gave this place a 4 because it has a limited menu and not very traditional... it's a bit modern to me. However, I did eat here two days back to back. Maybe a few more traditional selections and this could easily be a top 10 for me.",,,
41,Ameya B.,"New York, NY",393,270,445,2.0,9/4/2017,"Tried Penelope on a Sunday morning for brunch and at around 2 pm, there was a wait of 15 minutes for a table for 2. Once seated, it took the waitress a good 15 minutes to show up to take our order and this place isn't that big either. We got the Bloody Mary and Bellini for drinks and Biscuit with Gravy and Croissant with Scrambled eggs and Chicken sausage for food. The drinks and food arrived on time, but both were just mediocre. Our drinks had no punch to it, and our food was a bit cold. It did not taste that great either. Overall, it was a disappointing experience.",5,,
42,Zarah Z.,"Queens, NY",3,15,14,2.0,10/21/2017,"I came here with my friend for her birthday. I figured that since it was noted online for its brunch, it should be good. To my unhappy surprise, Penelope didn't live up to its fame. The wait time was well over an hour, so I thought it was because it was so popular that people were just clamoring to get a seat. When my friend and I were finally given a seat, I realized that the unacceptably long wait time was because the service was just plain slow and lazy. It took our waitress too long to come and even ask us for our order, and that wasn't because she was busy taking other people's orders. She was just taking her sweet time and in no rush to serve her customers. After finally ordering, it took a while for the food to arrive. I tried justifying it in my mind as the food being freshly made. I had ordered the brunch special burger and my friend got salmon and eggs with coffee. The food was below mediocre. Incredibly disappointed. My burger wasn't tasty and my friend hated her food. She even didn't drink the rest of her coffee because even that wasn't good. I hate having bad foodie experiences, especially when it's not cheap food. And this was a case of a really disappointing foodie experience. I felt worse because this was my birthday treat to my friend. So, word to the wise, don't buy into all the online hype surrounding this restaurant.",1,,
43,Maura M.,"New York, NY",18,28,4,4.0,4/10/2018,"I think that their brunch is a very solid four star. I went on a Saturday and used the yelp waitlist feature, and we were seated within five to eight minutes max after we checked in. I noticed that their two tops seemed to be more plentiful than other options (this is not a restaurant with booths). Not good for large groups (mainly smaller tables, only one bathroom). We both ordered the $22 brunch entrees which include either a free drink ($11 value) or tea/coffee plus fresh OJ. I went for tea and OJ and i thought that the OJ was at least 50% fresh squeezed and had a pleasant flavor. My ""Sam I Am"" (feta and asparagus scramble) was fantastic. I noticed that the $6 ""press start"" options on other tables (monkey bread or donut bites to start) were substantially sized. The only downside, which was not my personal problem, was that i noticed several people order the ala carte egg sandwich who were very disappointed by how small and uncheesy it was. So maybe don't get that. Otherwise, definitely worth it, but I didn't have to wait so I can't comment on it being ""worth the wait"" or not. My boyfriend thought service was slow but I thought it was relaxed. A nice choice all around.",1,,
44,Nithya M.,"Herndon, VA",4,13,5,4.0,12/26/2017,"Was the closest good brunch spot from our hotel with enough vegetarian options and it was alright. I ordered the Penny Egg Sandwich on a croissant with fakin' bacon. The sandwich had a ton of pesto (it says it does but didn't expect so much) plus they give you more on the side. I really should've gone for the soysage because the fake bacon was too sweet! I also got their house blend coffee - it was a very dark roast, not a fan. My sister ordered the Sam I Am which was a LOT of food for one person but she said it was good. Too expensive for the overall taste but I'll still recommend it to try once.",,,

46,Ashley F.,"Brookfield, WI",13,105,32,4.0,8/3/2017,"I really enjoyed this place. The selection was slim but it made eating healthy fun! The vibe is causal with a mix of Rustic/ and modern metal and wood. There are tables and small bar if you'd prefer not to have a table. I actually did not use the restroom so I can't tell you how clean it was. The service was good. The waitress was attentive and the food was good. I ate a nice sized beef burger with bun and fries. My friend had a fun salad which now I cannot think of the name, but it seems popular. Oh and there are chicken meatballs! Yum! They have some cakes for dessert but we did not try them. It is not huge so you can bring 20 or so people for a dinner but it's a nice meet up spot or quick dinner after the gym.  Last but not least... it was reasonably priced for NY. I should add we went to dinner on a Monday night. Sunday brunch is a completely different ball game.",3,,1

Came into the city ready to celebrate with some very good friends and had to fuel ourselves up to start off the eventful night of course.  We let Massachusetts newest CPA choose where to eat and she chose this spot and let me tell you...Solid choice.  Came into the restaurant on A Saturday night at primetime and were seated immediately.  The place was quaint and I admired the ambiance on the inside.  Our waitress was more than pleasant, our food was reasonably priced, and my taste buds would say the same.  We ordered two pitchers of Sangria around the table, truffle fries for an appetizer, and sandwiches or burgers around the table as then entree. The bread was fresh and the sandwich was loaded with bacon.  Smiles and happy faces all around the table.  I would like to emphasize how good the fries were at this place.  Arguably the most flavorful and well-cooked fries I have ever had.  Even one of my friends (we will call her NAHGEM) kept begging around the table for more!  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us.  The food came out fast and we were all very pleased with our choice.  If you are looking for a quick not so heavy meal, before going out in the city, this is a great spot to come too.  Also, shoutout to my friend's girlfriend TORI as it was her first experience with one of my YELP experiences.

54,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,12/15/2016,"I came here with a friend for brunch. When I first arrived I was told that the wait would be an hour and a half but if we were okay with sitting at the bar, it would be a much shorter wait. We decided to eat at the bar and were seated immediately. It was a little bit tight space wise, but besides that it was a lovely spot to be and we could still converse easily. I would suggest going for the bar seating if there are only 2 people in your party- There will be little to no wait time and you can still order anything you want off the menu. I decided to order from the Prix-Fixe menu which includes an entree, specialty cocktail or for those who don't drink, coffee or tea and juice. I was able to get my choice of hot beverage and it was wonderful! For my meal, I chose the Nutella French Toast, consisting of 3 HUGE pieces of baguette bread and plenty of warm gooey Nutella inside, along with caramelized bananas and a sprinkling of powdered sugar. It was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! The bread was nice and fluffy with crispy crust and the hazelnut filling was delectably sweet, rich and amazing. The portion size was sizable and each bite was delightfully tasty. The bananas were a lovely addition that went will with everything else.My friend had the chorizo sandwich with scrambled eggs, tomato pesto and cheese on an English muffin. I was able to try a bite and it was pretty good. Definitely a solid choice! The chorizo was juicy and flavorful and the pesto and cheese was yummy. The eggs were just okay though. The bartender who served us was very accommodating and friendly, as was the host! I would definitely come back to try other menu offerings- For example, the omelette sounds really good!",16,10,13

We each ordered the biscuits & gravy and shared the nutella french toast. The biscuits and gravy was delicious, savory but not too salty, and the gooey eggs on top brought the whole meal together. The nutella french toast, while also tasty without being overly sweet, was undercooked; the egg/milk mix oozed out of the bread when we pressed it with a fork. Still, the choice of baguette as the bread was creative and if cooked properly would be amazing. Overall we enjoyed our meals and our cocktails; the food was good but probably not worth waiting an hour for, esp when there are so many equally good or better brunch places in the city. The only sour note was that every entree is $22 as part of the prix fixe regardless if you want a drink or not. This made our bill come out to be over $77 (before tip) which is too pricey for my taste just for a brunch for 2.",1,,

The beet hummus is so good and the combination is never one I would have thought of but works so well. This past week I decided to give Penelope a try for dinner. I found out from my waiter that they recently changed the dinner menu up and so my friend and I came to try it after work. The new dishes are creative spins on classic good food, with lots of healthy and wholesome options. It is just the type of meal you want after a long day that is simple, easy, and delicious.

The diners looked ""pleeeeezzzed"" :)  However we were there after 11:45am, and NO OPTION for ANY Breakfast is offered... it's ""strictly"" lunchtime...  Okay, I'll play...We ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese to share...  It was just ""decent""...

He said that as long as there was a wait he was going to seat any open table as soon as it was open and that we would have to sit as two separate groups. We live in the neighborhood and used to love this place, but after that experience we feel very unwelcome.

Ehh nothing exciting but one of my friends shared her caramelized French toast which I could not stop eating ! It was so on point and delicious! I also ordered a Bloody Mary which was good, nice and thick with horseradish just how I like it. One thing I realized was it came out of a bucket which did not look appetizing and the girl behind the counter was stirring it with a regular spoon and no gloves which kinda skeeved me and my friends out.

I was completely grossed out but didn't make a big deal. The waitress agreed to comp that dish and gave me a dessert. Ok fine, that was unfortunate but things happen. But then we get the check and on our other dish there is a $6 upcharge. When ordering she asked to sub chicken meatballs for the veggie patty included. The waitress said sure no problem. No mention of an upcharge. When we questioned it she just said the menu says there are charges for additions. We said 'we asked if we could sub one thing for another thing... why didn't you mention that would have a $6 charge?

76,Joy W.,"San Jose, CA",216,495,3697,3.0,7/11/2016,"Penelope is mostly brunch, with a small bar and some baked goods. Brunch + bar + bakery sums up NYC pretty nicely. The simplicity of the menu and the storybook logo of the storefront are very charming, but beyond those traits, Penelope loses its appeal for me. We encountered a slight wait for brunch, but the complimentary coffee station helped stretch out our patience. Since space is somewhat limited, the typical brunch crowd can easily create long wait times. I'm not sure how Penelope became so popular, because while the food is good, it's not so great that it warrants a crowd waiting outside. Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs - 2 eggs on toasted black bread, with side salad:The salmon & eggs sit on top of a single slice of black bread, possibly rye (?), with a little Greek dressing drizzled on top. The side salad included a few raisins, which I like, since I like to add sweet components into my salads sometimes. It was good, but not difficult to replicate. For something that is called 'salmon wrapped,' I was expecting more salmon, but the poached eggs were simply tucked into a few pieces of lox.Farmer's Market Omelette w/ tomatoes, bacon, brie, with toast:Omelette was not bad, a little on the small side and could have been a little fluffier. On the plus side, they did not skimp on the brie. Mr. Joy cut into a very gooey, cheesy, steaming hot omelette. It also came with a side potato hash and bell peppers.We all ordered our dishes with a drink for $20. Bellinis and mimosa, typical brunch cocktails. In my opinion, the dishes and the cocktails weren't quite worth $20. It's not that I don't appreciate simple food, but it would be nice if simple dishes were priced more modestly. I probably just didn't choose their standout dishes.",5,2,2

Keep you in mind all while waiting with 4 kids and while they were seating other parties that just came in with no reservation in seats could have accommodated us. Also, after two hours of waiting and my 1 year old finally loosing it my husband walked her outside and in their way out the hostess saying thank god and when my husband and crying baby walked out!

I'd definitely recommend putting your name in on NoWait beforehand because my friends and I forgot and we ended up waiting for a table for over an hour once we put our name in when we came at 11 on a Saturday and just walked around the neighborhood killing time until the table was ready. Once inside, we saw it had a quaint, compact, and cozy restaurant feel with only about 25-30 seats in the entire restaurant. We sat very close to the table next to us so we were almost touching and I proceeded to order the sweet potato biscuit with vegetarian gravy and eggs on top. The sweet potato biscuit was not your ordinary biscuit and you could taste the sweet potato flavor come through. The gravy on top was creamy and still tasted just like a meat gravy.

We figured, how bad could it be for dinner? Quite bad actually....The server very quickly gave us our menus. We ordered:- Artichoke dip - we were expecting cheesy artichoke goodness. We got hot, creamy artichoke chunks. Completely turned our stomachs.- Risotto - so heavy and rich that my friend couldn't eat it.- Turkey Burger - tastless.We couldn't wait to leave. I had to take a cab home because throwing up on the train is not recommended.",13,1,3
80,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",180,220,726,3.0,9/10/2016,"We had waited months to come to Penelope cause every time we would plan, the waiting time would throw us off and we would end up going elsewhere for brunch. Thankfully today it wasn't so bad and we had decided to stick around for as long as it takes to get a table.Waiting for a table wasn't so bad as we got a good look at the food being served around the restaurant. The portions looked big and the everything looked really good! We were four of us and decided to do four different dishes from the pre fixe brunch menu ($20 for one cocktail or coffee/tea or juice with one item from the brunch menu). Here's what we got-Nutella french toast with fresh berries- huge portion of 3 big baguette slices with Nutella sandwiched in between. To be honest-when I order something with Nutella, i expect the chocolate jam to smack hard on my taste buds and give me the kind of pleasure Nutella is supposed to give. However, that wasn't the case with the french toast, which tasted mostly of eggy milky chewy bread with a hint of Nutella in between. I had to smear maple syrup on the french toast to make it sweet. Too much bread, too little love(aka Nutella)I am sam- loved the flavor of fresh feta with scrambled eggs with chopped asparagus. The home fries were good, but I have had better.Biscuits with gravy- the biscuits were crumbly and melt in the mouth topped with two fried eggs(sunny side up) and had a really good gravy flavor. the side salad it came with of greens and cranberries was an interesting flavor combination with the rest of he dish.Waffles with blueberries- i didn't taste them but my friend told me he really enjoyed them. I got coffee which was really good, my friend got orange juice which they were very generous with, giving her two glasses of fresh squeezed juice (don't know why though,maybe they over-squeezed it?). Two of my other friends got mimosas which were nice and strong but very small in quantity. Overall, with all the hype that was created around Penelope left us feeling underwhelmed. There are definitely better brunches out there.",1,,

Updated review","I love brunch, but this place was pretty overrated.First of all, we got on the waitlist before we headed down, which I would highly recommend. The wait on a Saturday at 11:15AM was 37-50 minutes for a Yelp waitlist sign-up, and we arrived right at our seating time at noon and were seated promptly - I think it was quite a bit longer for an in-person wait around that time, and there were a number of parties waiting in front of the restaurant.We sat in one of the booths against the wall and for the layout of the restaurant, I appreciated that there was a good amount of room between tables (a lot of restaurants with the pull-out table seating can be pretty cramped or cozy with the tables next to you!). There's also a ton of light in the space, which made it a nice spot for brunch! Service was pretty prompt and efficient throughout.We started with the blueberry donuts, which came in a paper bag of ~15 and were accompanied by a cinnamon-y glaze (not sure if it was actually cinnamon!). The glaze was amazing, the donuts were okay - they came cold, were pretty dense, and didn't have much blueberry flavor (or any flavor) aside from one or two small blueberries in some of the donuts. The glaze made the dish, and using the donuts as a vehicle for the glaze really made them worth it. We ended up taking most of the donuts and the remaining glaze to go, as they were a pretty heavy starter.I wasn't as interested in getting a drink with brunch, but ordering off the front page menu is the same prix fixe price whether you get a drink or not (which is fine!), so I went with a tea. We split the vegetarian biscuits & gravy, and the pancakes. The biscuits & gravy were okay. The biscuits weren't as buttery or savory as the traditional southern biscuits that I'm used to, but it was completely doused in the gravy, which may have taken away some of the lightness of texture. The gravy wasn't very flavorful, though the creaminess did hide some of the blandness of the biscuit.The pancakes were really thick and very visually-appealing, and we had seen tons of Instagrams of these! In reality, they were really, really heavy and dense - even splitting the dish, we weren't able to make it through more than half of the stack of three. They also weren't individually flavorful at all, and we had to douse them in butter and maple syrup (they initially forgot the syrup, so we had to ask for it separately, which I would definitely recommend if you choose this dish). I like when pancakes have some flavor of their own, even if they're not specifically blueberry/banana/etc. pancakes, and these ones had no flavor or sweetness to them. Visually, really appealing, but in practicality, underwhelming.Penelope was pretty disappointing, and for the price of the dishes, I didn't think it was worth it. Maybe it's a better deal if you go for a brunch drink along with your dish, but the food wasn't very flavorful. Glad I went and tried it out, but wouldn't come here again.",3,,
82,Warren D.,"Milwaukee, WI",83,127,13,4.0,3/30/2017,"The only restaurant we returned to a second time during our 5-day jaunt to the Big Apple. The first time was better than the second, though that was service-based, not food-based.We only went for breakfast, so keep scrolling if you need reviews relating to some other time of the day.All of the food is good: Punkin waffles, French toast, Penny Egg Samich (on croissant of course), and the pancakes. Prices are what you would expect in NYC and the portions are healthy so there is definite value there. When we ate here for breakfast, we didn't need to eat again for many hours of being cutesy touristy--which I appreciate. The length between meals, I mean, not being cute and tourist-like.Service can be a tad spotty, but I think that's because the servers are so bloody busy they feel like they can't take the time to stop and sing along to the amazing Beyonce soundtrack that played on our first visit. When I told the server on the second day that we were already ready to order because we had been there yesterday, I expected something along the lines of ""Aww, thanks for coming back!"" but instead got, ""Okay.""Bottom line: Excellent breakfast at the price you would expect in Midtown, with cute waiters and charming decor.",1,,1
83,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,2/27/2017,"Whenever my boyfriend and I used to take our weekend walks down to Chinatown for dim sum (trust me, hunger is the best spice to several rounds of carbs), we would always pass a jury line of people queuing up for Penelope's, in part, I suppose, because of the dearth of other brunch options around that area. I finally got to try it for dinner. (First, can I point out how ""gosh darn cute"" the website is? Whoever designed it, give yourself a hand. You definitely make me want to eat here all the time.)We tried a bunch of dishes: the chicken with meatballs, the artichoke and spinach dip, the fish and chips, the lobster roll special, and the kale salad. Although nothing stuck out to me as especially mind-blowing, that is probably what Penelope's is going for: simple, tasty, American comfort food. And most likely because I failed to order what appears to be the better salads on the menu: the Penny Cobb, the veggie burger one, and the one with curried chicken. (Also, the name of each dish is fantastic. Someone put some serious work into coming up with these.) I will say, though, that the space is extremely tight and that it's one of those spots where you have to be at least a little comfortable with eating and talking in close proximity to someone else. I'd love to come back for brunch but dinner was good and had a much shorter quoted wait time.",4,3,2

One day I applied as a waiter, then applied as the baker, then the manager and somehow I became a co-owner. I am really fortunate and it's been a bit of the American dream coming true for me. I didn't really know what I was doing, but somehow it worked out. Penelope has always given me the feeling of stepping away from the city, a home away from home. The restaurant has a little bit of nostalgia, one of the rare things that ""don't change over time"". Of course, we do change our menu from time to time but we want to offer consistency. Some of our dishes have been on the menu for nearly 15 years!.The NYC restaurant industry is pretty challenging, particularly right now and it feels like it's never been harder. There is labor shortage, the costs are going up pretty fast and tipping is starting to disappear. But no one wants to be the first one to eliminate tips, because there is a big back push from customers. One other challenging aspect is that restaurants always have been operating in silos and as competitors.  A lot of restaurants don't talk to each other and everyone just seems to do their own thing. Each restaurant operates slightly differently, but we all have similar problems we have to deal with. Sometimes it would be nice to be able to share experiences and not just to tap alone in the dark. It might give you the feeling of 'Oh, I am not crazy and this does not only happen to me.'.At the end of the day meditation is my golden source for keeping my balance. Everyone has stress and struggles they have to deal with. Meditation helps me to remove the stress, to understand it and to have a relationship with it. No matter what happens, I have this passion for Penelope and every morning I am excited to get up and come in - it's worth it every day."" Lukus (Co-Owner @PenelopeCafe)",,,1

I waited over 2 hours to be seated. Luckily they have an app where you can keep track of your table but it was crazy to wait to long just for brunch.

The only tough thing was we had to get back to work so we asked them to rush out order. And by rush, we asked within an hour which I think is still pretty reasonable. We each ordered salads with a protein and that was it. The waiter gave us a nice passive ""sure... I'll see what I can do..."" and walked off. I've worked in the food service industry before and have had to ask... totally get it. But if I found out the kitchen was backed up, I would let the patrons know. This guy didn't... we waited 50 minutes for a salad... then before even getting the salad, we actually had flag him down to request our orders be to go because we couldn't stay. He just said yea sure whatever and walked off. It may have been the service that put a bad taste in my mouth but the salad wasn't even great. Totally disappointed and not going back.",2,2,

Had to assemble my toast and add lots of salt because it was lacking in flavor. The French fries, just pass on those they were hard and salty. Their cappuccino didn't disappoint though!

Avocado on top was ripe and plentiful but that was the only positive thing about it. The Kale was not cut properly, all of the hard stems were left on and it was obvious that it was not massaged or dressed to allow the tough leaves to soften. I hardly ate it and when the server asked if I wanted a box, I said ""no, sorry, I didn't care for it"" and he just took it away. No apologies or anything.

Warning - the line gets long so get ready to wait unless you get there when it opens. Even then, there might be a line that's already started. That being said, I have been there a couple times. The decor is very cute! It is intimate (close) seating but cute tables, chairs, and decorations. It is very bright and homey. The menu is very straight forward - breakfast/brunch options and drinks. It is not overwhelming,so easy to pick from. I am a huge fan of salmon bennies so I usually go with the Salmon Wrapped Poach Eggs. It's pretty well made and the right temperature.

Our server KAITLIN seemed to have an attitude problem, she didn't say hi when she came to the table I honestly didn't even know she was our server because she just stood there. She took our order and then we waited another 30 minutes for our food which would have been totally fine if the table next to us hadn't gotten their food before us even though we were there first. My boyfriend asked her why that table got their food first and she said it was because it was 3 plates vs 5 plates and everything had to come out together. He asked if there's only one chef for every two plates and she started to explain the way the kitchen structured and some other bullshit excuses. Our food finally came out and it was okay, not worth the two hours we waited plus the shitty service. She never came to check on our table until after we were finished. I asked her for a box and she said yes and then proceeded to stand by the ordering computer talking with other servers and then moved to the coffee bar and talked with more servers. Another waiter came to clean our plates and that's who we got the box from after asking again. When we got our checks she circled the gratuity section 4 times as if she deserved over 18%. To put the cherry on top, my friend who had a backpack was holding it in his lap during the beginning of the meal and was holding it as she took our order until I told him I could put behind me since I was sitting in a bench style seat while his was a chair. Then a couple came in and sat down at the table right next to us with a backpack who was also holding it in their lap and she kindly offered to have the bag held at the front.

What I don't like about this place is how damn long the wait can be. I've lived in the area for 9 years and seen many places come and go. Murray hill is so weird. Penelope has been uncompromising about their menu + their aesthetic, a refreshing departure from an obsession with cool that other fleeting establishments in the area have had. I don't come here a lot but when I do I love me an omelet + coffee for brunch and one of their cute lil matchbooks.",,,
120,Jaclyn D.,"Maplewood, NJ",0,3,0,2.0,8/4/2018,"I came here for brunch with my sister and waited over an hour to sit partially due to the fact that the restaurant has a very limited amount of two tops (so we watched larger parties be seated quickly). We ordered an iced coffee and tea and were given plastic cups because they had run out of glasses. My sister ordered a hamburger and I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which were dropped off with out napkins and utensils after an almost hour wait. When we opened the bottle of ketchup it was bad (aka fermenting in the bottle) so when the bottle was opened it sprayed ketchup all over me and a nearby customer. Unfortunately we put some on the fries before we realIzed exactly what was going on and when we told the waiter he replaced the ketchup but didn't offer to replace the fries. My sisters burger came out well done despite being ordered medium.  They took off the cheapest item we ordered to apologize for the wait for the food but overall this was a horrible experience.",,,

Decor only?We were greeted well. Had a few seats to wait for our table. We waited about half hour for a table of two. Our server was great. Food was not given as fast but still good service. They serve breakfast,  lunch and dinner. We just made it for breakfast as they serve only till 11:45a. I was still on west coast time! =}We ordered the BBELT which was double the bacon. It's like a BLT but more and we added avocado as suggested by our server. It was a huge portion and still served with fries for $15. I had the Chorizo egg sandwich. I ate it with hot sauce and it was then perfect. I did wish it had more chorizo though. ;-) We also ordered Latte and Mocha, both tasted great to me! I would come back here again!

What's worse, is that the food, was either tasteless (grain bowl) or saltier than the Dead Sea (chicken). The chicken was so tiny and felt like I was eating skin and bones. The spinach dip was really good. Overall though, I would avoid this place at this point as it has really gone downhill.

We put our names down, they told us 45 minutes, so we went outside and walked around the area in the meantime. By the time we came back at ~40 minutes, they told us we'd already been called but they'd seat us when the next 2-seater opened up. We were seated less than 5 minutes later, at the bar in the back. I wasn't feeling super hungry and neither was he - I got a breakfast croissandwich while he got a BBELT sandwich, double bacon/egg/lettuce/tomato with a side of fries. Food came out not too slowly - my croissandwich was good but a little bit underwhelming. I liked the sundried tomato paste that came with the sandwich, it paired well with the egg/ham/peppers that was in my sandwich. His sandwich was really pretty - I'd definitely order that next time I'm in for brunch! Bacon was crispy and not too oily, sourdough bread was a good touch. Our actual meal was quick, and the atmosphere very quintessential NYC brunch. I liked the way the restaurant was decorated, and the way most of the food was plated!

I've only had the Mhmm Biscuits and Gravy with a mimosa. The sweet potato biscuits were sweet, not super fluffy but at least with the gravy it wasn't dry. If you're expecting some hearty sausage gravy, than this isn't really the dish to get. The vegetarian gravy had some kind of meat substitute but it wasn't exactly the same.

The food here is good, but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes to get seated here.I have not experienced any issues with the food or the service at Penelope. I like to order from the ""prix-fixe"" menu because you get a delicious, filling brunch dish and a cocktail for only $19. The attentive and friendly servers will make sure that you get your food in a timely manner and that your water glass is always full.The blueberry waffles with orange butter was my favorite item from the brunch menu. The waffles were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and contained just the right amount of blueberries. I need the recipe for the orange butter because I want to have it every single day.

The sandwich was pretty good because it had a lot of pesto, but the croissant itself was soaked in oil and was not as toasted as I would have liked it to be. I also tried some of the waffle and was kind of disappointed that it wasn't very crispy. Overall, it's an okay place to grab breakfast.

Number of ingredients is 3: meatballs, arugula, and Parmesan cheese. That should not be over $10. There isn't a single other vegetable or ingredient..... $14? Why? Then add tax?

It's slightly off putting up see such a big crowd milling about in front and inside, but that's to be expected for a small restaurant that does not take reservations. We were given an estimated wait time of 1-1.5 hours, which appeared to be a standard time if you were bigger than a party of two. Luckily there are two benches each inside and outside of the restaurant for you to sit while you wait. The weather wasn't too bad either , so we didn't mind. On to the food: there's one side of the menu that has mostly breakfast sandwiches and another side that has a pre fixe option. All options were reasonably priced. The pre fixe was $19 and the sandwich options ranged from $10-15. The pre fixe gives you the choice of one beverage: cocktail, tea/coffee or juice and an entree. I went for the pumpkin waffles and a blackberry bellini. The bellini fell flat for me, but the waffles were spot on. It came with walnuts, cinnamon apple slices, cranberries and a side of apple butter. I will definitely return to try some of their baked goods. I wish they had some sort of bread/ pastry basket option that gives you a sampling of the breads, cakes and muffins they have. To sum up, it's a cute brunch spot with a reasonably priced menu.

Updated review","This place is adorably cute. I stopped in for lunch on a weekday and was seated immediately despite the lunch crowd. The decor is sweet and distracting enough that I forgot about work entirely and actually enjoyed a well paced meal. I had the chicken meatball salad and shared the ricotta toast. You could taste the freshness in the salad. It wasn't overdone at all with clean ingredients. I could imagine them making each meatball fresh as can be in the kitchen in the back, at least I hope so. The ricotta toast was also incredible. Both portion sizes were huge! I ended up taking half my salad home for a later day snackService was great. Our waiter was very attentive. It didn't feel overcrowded although they were busy. I also love that they serve as a coffee bar where you can pop in for a cup of joe. Nice touch and good way to entice lunch crowds who don't have time to grab a seat.",1,,2
144,Sarah V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",3,12,0,4.0,3/5/2018,"I love coming here with friends. It's such a chill/low key brunch spot. I'm a big fan of their nutella french toast, brunch burger, and farmers market omelette. I don't usually order boozy bevs from here, only because I like pairing their comfort foods with tea. The food may not look like a lot, but it's perfectly portioned, at least for me it is.",,,

Two of us ordered the Penny Egg Sandwich with chicken apple sausage (one on a croissant and the other on an English muffin). My other friend who's vegetarian ordered the BLT with fakin' bacon. We loved the Penny Egg Sandwiches and thought that the pesto on the side was a great touch. My friend also enjoyed her BLT and said that the fakin' bacon has been one of the best ""fake bacons"" she's tried in the city. We left feeling extremely satisfied but all agreed that the place was not worth the 1+ hour wait (hence the 4-star review). The server had mentioned that the wait is typically shorter right at opening and at closing, so I'd recommend visiting Penelope at those times instead.

We ordered our food, which was 22 dollars for a prix fix that nonetheless was very average food that was not even instagram worthy for pictures.

157,Pam R.,"McKinney, TX",63,14,17,3.0,8/2/2017,"Breakfast on a Wednesday around 10 a.m.  Wait was 15 minutes for four people. Could have split-up into groups of two or sat at the bar immediately but decided to wait so we could eat together. It was a good 20 minutes AFTER we were seated before anyone approached our table. When waiting for coffee, 20 minutes can seem like an hour. My review of this place is simple - The food was delicious, (especially the bacon) but the service was below average and made the meal less pleasant, which is a shame. It should not have taken 20 minutes to have our waiter greet us and take a simple drink order. We also waited quite a while for our food. We had to find and then stop our waiter twice for coffee refills and the pancakes were served without syrup, which had to be requested twice. Another family of four was seated 15-20 minutes after us. They were waited on, served, and enjoyed their meal while we had just received our food. Our waiter wasn't running around, busy doing his job, he was chatting and laughing very loudly with the hostess. He seemed to not really care if he took our order or not and someone else delivered the food while he stood at the hostess stand talking. The girl who brought our food looked annoyed with him as well. Maybe he won't be there very long. Onto the food. Like I said it was delicious. BBTL was incredible. I'm pretty sure half a large pig died in the making of it. My husband thought the bread was way too hard and it was quite hard but I think it needed to be to hold-up to the ingredients on it. My son loved his 3 egg omelette but didn't like the home fries. My daughter loved her pancakes and we all enjoyed the coffee (when we finally got it).  Lemonade was not good though. In conclusion, I would go back, get the BBLT again and pray for a different waiter. If the service wasn't better, I'd look elsewhere at that point. Food was good but for the price, good service should be a given as well.",,,

While other restaurants will charge $2 for a biscuit, Penelope charges $6 for one biscuit. And while we did not get that we tried their monkey bread to share. The topping was delicious was the rest of it was pretty standard. Brunch here will include two drinks (a cocktail and a coffee) plus an entree for $20 if you get the pre fixe meal (not a la cart). For the brunch entree I got the vegetarian burger which cost extra! Shouldn't vegetarian burgers be cheaper than meat because vegetables are in general cheaper than meat? It was a good burger but not worth the extra dollar (I had another vegetarian burger from a different restaurant that same day and for $7 less it was sooooo much better! This place gets 3 stars because of their biscuits and vegetarian gravy! That is by far the best item on their brunch menu! The soysage actually fooled a meat eater!

The waitress took off our 2 drinks (sodas) and never apologized or acknowledged the wait for our food. If the wait is usual, at least let people know when they walk in.

You wait an hour and a half to be crammed into a table inches from other people to eat subpar food that your local deli can make better. I had the most bland omelet and home fries that not even adding tons of salt could help. The only thing decent was their mimosa but it'll cost you $11. Once you're done eating they'll rush you out because you know there's a million people waiting by the hostess and outside. Do yourself a favor and go brunch elsewhere. There's hundreds of better brunch spots in NY,1,,
166,Ash M.,"Evanston, IL",0,9,1,3.0,1/23/2018,Was expecting better food after the 46 minute wait. Mind you- this place is absolutely packed on the weekends which is why I probably expected above average food. Got the brunch burger- was pretty average. my friend got the pancakes which were pretty good but would we come here again? Nope,,,
167,Sarah B.,"Long Beach Township, NJ",291,3,6,5.0,1/7/2018,They were great! Food was unbelievable. We sat at the bar for quicker seating but overall very reasonably priced! Only downside is the lack of room but that's every nyc joint,,,
168,Cristina V.,"New York, NY",247,87,43,3.0,7/12/2016,"Recently had brunch at this establishment and it was alright! Since we were coming on a late Saturday morning (peak brunch time), I got in line on NoWait to maximize time. We were seated within 15 minutes of arriving, and had a couple of cups of the complimentary ""thanks for your wait"" coffee. I ordered the BBELT, double bacon, egg, lettuce and tomato sandwich with the home fries. The bacon was just TOO much. Trust me, I love bacon. But this giant heap made it difficult for me to even get a bite of the sandwich. It also didn't help that the bacon was dry and difficult to chew. I had hoped to find some refuge in the home fries. The sandwich usually comes with French fries, but I was trying not too eat so much oil. But, the home fries disappointed me. They were just plopped on my plate like a huge glob that seemed more like mashed potatoes. I don't know what they're thinking, but home fries aren't supposed to be mashed. Edible brunch, but probs would not return. Service was good though, contrary to most reviews here.",1,,
169,Shayna F.,"Las Vegas, NV",219,164,129,5.0,5/3/2016,"We came here during a vacation to New York earlier this year.  I found this spot by reaching breakfast stops near me, and Penelope popped up.  Seeing as it had great reviews, and is the name of our daughter due in august it was a no brainer.  This place is small, like most spots in NYC.  I read wait times up to two hours on weekends... luckily this was during the week... We were told 15 min but it was more like 5.  We both ordered the pumpkin waffles... they were yummy, although a but more fall than spring, but I guess its on the menu year round.  Wonderful warm spiced and served with cooked apple sliced that are just as spiced and not too sweet.  I forget our waitresses name, but she was wonderful and even brought me a cupcake on account of they were out of the iced tea I ordered.",2,2,2
170,Edward B.,"New York, NY",1,14,3,2.0,8/22/2017,"I will preface this review by saying it was 3:15 pm - the latter part of brunch service. Nonetheless, while my expectations are slightly lowered at this time, the experience I had was bad! We were sat quickly, and met by a female server after about 5 minutes. We were asked if we were ready to order, no drinks were offered prior to this visit. We ordered. The woman brought the coffee drink and she never came to our table again. I saw her sitting at the bar eating her lunch. Clearly, she was leaving for the day, but did not bother to check on us. We waited for nearly 35 minutes for our food. Finally, we waived down another server. Turns out he was our server. The woman never said she was leaving or introduced him. The food finally arrived. Pancakes - cold. French fries - cold. Burger medium - served well done. Sent the fries back, and then they came out hot. Throughout the experience, I saw the manager walking around several times. She sat us so she knew how long we had been there. She undoubtedly knew we had been waiting for longer than we should have, but she never came over to check on us. This place used to be good. Service was never great, but now it is certainly below average. Don't bother.",2,,
171,MInJung J.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,11,59,1.0,12/11/2017,So over rated. I waited over an hour but food was not great at all. We had a Sam I am and pancake but potatoes  and omelet were so cold....Not worth to go back.,,,

173,Drew V.,"Austin, TX",92,2,1,5.0,5/13/2016,I have been coming to Penelope for the last 6 years every trip to The City and the place is always amazing. The Penny Egg Sandwich is great. The pesto is great and the egg is perfectly cooked everyone. I suggest adding bacon. Levi is the best waiter in the place and nice and funny as they come.,1,1,2
174,Johnson L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,116,2,4.0,4/5/2017,"Made a random visit here waiting for a tow truck and was pleasantly surprised.  Had a nice cozy vibe and wasn't overly crowded on a Monday night.  Ordered the burger and it was a decent size and cooked exactly as I ordered.  Happy hour until 7 with draft beers and a few house wines.  Had a tough time choosing between all the sweets but choose the peanut butter brownie and it was AMAZING, would return alone for the desert menu as everything sounded tasty.",,,
175,Anna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,2,1.0,1/3/2018,"I really do not understand how people think this food is any good. This review is for Lunch - BBLT, fish and chips, mocha, and hot chocolate. The good is oily and tasteless, the French fries completely limp. After waiting forever, I had the worst meal of my lifetime. I wanted to treat my dad to a nice lunch and I was greatly disappointed.... I would never come back. I don't understand the good reviews. Maybe breakfast food is better? I'm not going back to find out.",,,
176,Molly S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,1.0,12/29/2017,"It was my first time here and quite a bad experience. We were told 30 Min wait so we went a few blocks down to run an errand, got the text to come back, sprinted, got to the hostess stand with no hostess there for at least a minute. Then was told we were a minute late and they gave our table away, even though we weren't and we could prove with time stamps. Out of the two times we interacted the hostess was rude both times. Then we ordered food and the mains were not put in and our appetizer was wrong. When we sent it back and asked about it the bartender stopped his conversation to give us a huge rude attitude for THEIR faux pas. Totally makes sense. Only giving one star because our server was very nice and apologetic even though our whole order was wrong. Also the meatballs were completely dry and very hard to swallow. All in all not worth the hype.",,,
177,Todd D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4,5,0,4.0,7/11/2017,Went to Penelope on Father's Day! We were a party of 6 and we waited a bit but it was worth it! Food was fabulous! The penny egg sandwich is just amazing! The salmon wrapped eggs were delicious too! Wish we could have tried more lol.Drinks were great as well and the rainbow cake was the perfect finish to a delicious meal! Will DEFINITELY be back! Only thing I wished for was more drink options!,,,
178,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,3.0,4/8/2016,"Came to pick up order via MealPass (arugula salad and chicken meatballs). Mustard dressing is on point, but the portion size of arugula was sparse. Chicken meatballs were flavorful but mushy and too sweet.

179,Nadia T.,"Manhattan, NY",29,127,10,2.0,5/18/2016,"So incredibly mediocre. Have only been for dinner but I can't imagine brunch is good enough to warrant the insane wait times I have heard about. Extremely overpriced for the meh-est food I've had in the long time. I partly chose this place because I had a very strong craving for spinach and artichoke dip -- and this was the worst I've had in recent memory. Soggy, very little cheese, just not good to eat. I then got the apple and brie sandwich with a side salad, which was again so mediocre. The salad was lettuce drenched in an unappetizing dressing with a couple rando cranberries thrown on top. My friend's tomato chickpea soup was also wildly average. To top it all off, our waitress had a nasty attitude and was constantly looking pissed off. So unsatisfied -- Never again!",1,,
180,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",284,130,874,3.0,3/14/2016,"Penelope is a cute brunch spot in Murray Hill.  I went on at Saturday afternoon with two friends from out of town.  The spot is pretty small and they don't take reservations, so if you're headed there in a weekend, especially with a large group, be prepared to wait. Fortunately, we were quoted at an hour but only ended up waiting 15-20 minutes.Penelope has brunch combinations for $19 whereby you can order a brunch menu item and a cocktail, which I thought was a good deal.  Two of us ordered the burger whereas my other friend opted for the waffles.  We all somehow ended up with the apple cider mimosa.The food was served promptly.  The burger was good but somewhat forgettable.  Don't get me wrong - it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't run back here for it.  The fries were OK as well.  The portion size was large.  The drinks were nice.  The waffles looked amazing but I regrettably didn't try them.  My friends liked their meals and didn't seem to have any complaints.  In summary, I liked Penelope.  Was it everything I dreamed for and more?  Not really.  Would I wait 2+ hours in line to eat here on a Sunday?  I'd pass.  But it was a solid place that I would certainly return to.  Positive experience overall.",2,1,2

There is always a really long wait, though I've been lucky the times I've been because I have a full party and once we were willing to sit at the bar. To help with wait time, add yourself to the list via NoWait app (need to be within 3 mile radius to be able put yourself on this list). Cute and quaint spot!",,,
183,Diana G.,"Palmetto Bay, FL",52,71,100,4.0,2/13/2017,"My sister has raved about this restaurant for years and we were able to finally check it out. First, the decor is very quaint. I loved the table, linens, mix matched coffee mugs and the rose in small vase. We went for breakfast and had the Blueberry muffin, the Penny Breakfast Sandwich and the French Toast. We had mixed feelings on the food. The muffin while very tasty was also too cold. It would have tasted better if it was room temperature. The French toast also was very tasty but a bit to tough. We struggled even with the sharp knife they gave us. Lastly, the Penny sandwich was the best item. We had it on a croissant with ham. The pesto sauce was a real surprise in this sandwich. If we were to return, I would definitely have the sandwich again.",1,,
184,Kristen V.,"New York, NY",3,30,24,4.0,11/12/2017,"I put my name on the waitlist 90 minutes ahead of time but It was well worth It! The $20 price fixe is an excellent deal for the amount and quality of food you get. I ordered the soju Bloody Mary which was perfectly seasoned, and the farmers omelette with mushrooms, sausage and spinach. I highly recommend this place but you need to put your name in well ahead of time and then head over!",,,
185,Rebeca V.,"Miami, FL",581,101,1057,4.0,2/27/2016,You can say my diet went down the drain here.... We waited an hour to eat here but it was so worth it!! I ordered the Penny Egg Sandwich and my bf ordered the omelette. I didn't try it because I was too busy loving mine and eating the Nutella French toast. The monkey bread was also ordered for the table. That was very good as well. Very good atmosphere and the service was excellent. Continuously asking us if everything was ok and refilling up our waters. Perfect Saturday brunch :),2,1,2

188,Annie B.,"Montreal, Canada",51,22,11,3.0,5/12/2016,"Went here for breakfast around 10 am on a Monday and didn't have to wait for a table. People who showed up 10 minutes after us weren't so lucky. Pretty full in there but they serve you quickly and don't make you feel pressured to leave. Now the food wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had but it was pretty good. I want to give it a 3 and a half star. I had the breakfast sandwich with the mountain of bacon. Maybe I'm spoiled with Canadian bacon but I didn't find this to be anything special. My husband had the buttermilk pancakes which were a generous portion, but again, standard. My sister in law opted for the omelette and she said she enjoyed her breakfast. So there's that. I think I like the vibe of the restaurant more than the actual food. It's a cute little neighborhood joint that wasn't a tourist trap.",1,,

Obviously we had a rough night, so we were in need of some bloody Mary's. Luckily, this spot has breakfast and drinks!!! I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs. When getting my order, I was surprised of how big it was. Couldn't finish the whole thing, and no one wanted to share. The pancakes was not bad....I must say, it was a tad tooo dry. I honestly wouldn't recommend it, unless you're craving for something sweet. But I would opt for the other sweet options on the menu. Reason why I gave this spot more stars than I should is because of their drinks and exceptional service. Bloody Mary was probably one of the best tasting bloody Mary's I've had. Just the right amount of alcohol with a hint of tomato juice. I will def come back here to give their breakfast entree another chance.",1,,2

Note that the place is small, so you have to wait a little or more. Picnic Type table like the one you see at a park, but cute! It was a rainy day. I met 2 of my girlfriends for lunch but one showed up early so she got to order from the breakfast menu. While another friend and I ordered from a regular menu. I had a soup and half of grilled chicken with artichoke sandwich and a small salad all in one plate. My plate was super delicious, 2 thumps up plus 2 toes up! High five! Hawaii-Five-O! That's what I feel like when I eat my lunch. Try yours and see what happens. My pea soup was amazing, very smooth and very fresh. My sandwich was outstanding. The grilled chicken cooked to perfection and the artichoke really didn't mess up the taste. It was perfect and I declare a chicken-artichoke rainy day! Awesome! I also had a nice cappuccino! Loved it! My friend had a good breakfast with some eggs. Another friend ordered another great plate, arugula salad with chicken meatballs and some cheese on top of the 2 meatballs. Amazingly over the top. I would definitely get that one next time, when I can find a table without waiting for hours. Thank God this day was a good day because it was raining. The rain saved the day. Our waiter was good and attentive. Men servers at Penelope, didn't see any women or maybe they work at night. Penelope has a nice bar at the back wall. Don't worry you drinkers because you got what you need here, food and drink and caffeine. You can get too relaxed here so pay attention when you finish to try and give up your table to the next customer. However, they really are nice because they don't rush anyone to leave, which I like!",,,

I was blown away by how good my food was, I was also trying not to take some bites from my boyfriends plate. I got this breakfast egg and cheese dish with pesto and my boyfriend got the BBLT. After our meals we had to try to banana and Nutella. Really did not disappoint. The service was very friendly and fast but the wait for seating is long. The entrance is a stairway, which can be crowded depending on the time and weather. We waited about 45 mins so we decided to take a walk to the flatiron building and back.",,,
