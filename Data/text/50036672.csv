Well, duh, Andrew, there's a bar in the back with a Happy Hours. I wasn't feeling an actual meal. I was in the crave for some tater tots but Bareburger does not serve such. I know they serve some great onions rings, so this review will simply for the establishment and onion rings.Service was great and fast. The host came to me quick and instructed me to order by the bar since my order was to go. He took my order nicely. I sat less than ten minutes watching some television and my six large, quite crisp with an onion flavor I can taste was ready. I added a little bit of ketchup but not needed.These onion rings are the size of doughnuts, almost. Over three inches in diameter and the rings one inch wide. And crisp.",18,7,12

My friend and I went from getting our meals to go and then to deciding to stay. The meals were delicious but my friends got mixed up and ended up with two orders of fries. Jason provided us complimentary shakes for the mixup and long wait we had while the order was being corrected. Also, the food is great and has amazing options for vegans.",,,

3,Angela L.,"New York, NY",289,220,185,5.0,10/8/2018,"There's many bareburger locations but I really like the set up of this one. There's a bar to sit at but it's not an alcoholic bar, it's just a bar to have your food at. And of course, there's your normal booths and tables.My server was very kind. I wanted to try the vegan cheese before I committed to putting it on my food and he bought out samples for me and my friend to try. I ended up getting a collard green wrap with the sweet potato and quinoa patty with vegan cheese and baby spinach. The patty was really delicious and so was the cheese. My slight complain would be that the collard green were really overpowering. Collard greens have a very strong taste so if you put too much, it kind of takes over the whole thing and that's kind of what happened to my food. I wouldn't say don't get it, but next time I go I'm probably going to try a different wrap/bun.",,,2
4,Quincy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",353,361,681,4.0,9/11/2018,"I've enjoyed takeout from here but never dined in, we'll fix that soon enough.When it comes to burgers I tend to try them multiple times, gotta be sure the cook is consistent and the flavor wasn't a fluke. Guess what? They got it right!On my first order I had the turkey, well done, with baby spinach, egg over easy, and a smile from the young lady handling my order. It was all on point. Turkey can be a fickle meat when cooked incorrectly... trust me, you'll know when it's under cooked lol. The bun wasn't dry, the egg added so much more flavor to the already juicy patty, and the spinach was the texture king of this meal.Second order was the deliciously healthy Guadalupe. I knew I'd taste the difference between turkey and black bean but it was more a texture difference than flavor quality, which I appreciated. Third order had me back at the turkey...yea I liked it a lot. Mind you, this was all in the same week but who's judging right. This one measured up to its predecessor and then some, on account of me adding the aged cheddar and eating slower than usual lol.From the take out side, the staff is prompt and attentive to your needs... wish they put a few more ketchup packets in the bag though. Either way, it was a good experience and I plan to dine here again soon.Cash and credit accepted.",,,
5,Dennis W.,"San Francisco, CA",766,357,1072,5.0,8/2/2018,"Organic, Sustainable, Free Range, Local. Words that often do not apply to burger joints but one that applies to the Bareburger franchise and the results have produced a conscionable and mighty tasty product. We stopped here recently on our first evening upon starting our vacation in New York City. It was an early Friday evening and although the restaurant wasn't at capacity yet, we were able to secure the last table before the 20 minute wait began(or so we heard the waitress tell every group that walked through the front door).Our waitress greeted us with a nice smile and asked if we had been to a Bareburger before, which was a nice touch. I decided to build my own burger and after taking my first bite, it was apparent it was cooked and assembled to perfection. Buttery warm bun with a fresh beef patty and equally fresh and crisp veggies. We shared an order of fries and they were golden crispy on the outside and warm pillowy soft on the inside. Of note also, their menu is over one-third vegetarian and plant-based. Creating a healthy, sustainable marketing message behind your burger franchise is inconsequential if your products are not devoured with a passion by its customers. Bareburger, in my opinion, has succeeded beautifully on both fronts.",16,7,13
6,Katie L.,"New York, NY",251,230,514,4.0,7/15/2018,"Not all Bareburgers are created equally. I prefer this location over many others, as service is a lot friendlier. Even though it was packed during lunchtime, the expeditor (a surfer-like dude) was still very friendly and chatty.The Supreme Burger was delicious, topped with onion rings that took it over the edge. I scoffed it down in less than 10 minutes, and there goes 1200 calories gone in a blink of an eye. I'd forgotten I asked for sauce on the side and they forgot to give me, so I didn't add it on until close to the end, which obviously heightened the entire burger. Don't be like me and forget your sauce.I also didn't feel the need to eat dinner that evening, that's how satiating it was.",8,5,8
7,Carol L.,"New York, NY",729,392,1367,4.0,8/28/2018,"Met a couple of friends here for dinner. I've been to many Bareburgers around the city and in Queens, and this one equally didn't disappoint. We got a side of Rings and Fries to share among the four of us, and honestly that was enough for all of us. A couple of them got the $4 Lionshead Pilsner, which I think they enjoyed. Everyone was happy with their burger, except the one who got the Sweet Chicken chicken sandwich (she thought it wasn't saucy enough, and the chicken was a little dry). I got the pre set burger with the onion ring inside, which is my go to (forget the name). Medium rare, it was delicious as usual. Such fair prices, quality burgers. One of the best places in the city for sure!",1,,

11,Kemi A.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,498,295,3.0,8/8/2018,"I have been craving their coconut iced cream milkshake for some time. Now I have not been to BB in a year; since I stopped eating meat. But the coconut ice cream with Bananas milkshake was la bomba the last time I had it. So I trekked here after a local class, and found that they now have this Cococado thing. It's vegan, so I figured why not? Yolo. Boy was I wrong, worst milkshake ever. My taste buds are in shock.  Who decided to add the lime? Ugh. Whoever made this intended for me to never live again. #yolofailIt was immediately gross. I honestly went into the 5 phases of grief. Shock- wth is this? Why is it to ""limey"".. Not lemony but limely? Did I order the right thing? It was like Lime + milk. Who drinks lime and milk? I was expecting a ""hint"" of lime. Denial- but yet I kept taking sips thinking I could handle it or maybe even vomit it back up?Anger-  why the bloody hell is this nastiness in the menu? Did they put all the limes in Mexico into my cup? Bargaining- maybe I can take it home and blend more coconut milk with it? Anger, Anger, shock.. Yes I spent more time revisiting anger and shockDepression -  And I blamed myself for ordering it to start with. Why was I trying to be adventurous? Why? Why?  Why didn't I question these ingredients that don't make sense? Bargaining and acceptance - My order was to go and quite frankly I threw the rest out because I was just torturing myself at this point. I was taking small sips because taking in any larger volume will induce vomiting. Maybe whoever made it added too much lime?The drink leaving a very ""sour taste"" in my mouth is an understatement. I spent 3 days thinking of this milkshake experience, you get me? The 3 stars is for1) the nice staff who took my order, but was he really nice if he neglected to give me the proper advice that this drink was yucky tasting? 2)  I also got the black bean burger which was good. In my meat eating days I did enjoy their bison burgers.But that Cococado thing, I am trying to recover from that experience.",2,3,1
12,Demi H.,"New York, NY",6,69,52,5.0,8/16/2018,"YUM! One of my favorite burger places. I've actually been to a few BareBurgers around the city - but the burger I had here over shadows the rest! I ordered take out from the app. Just a regular burger, medium rare. Onion, tomato, cheese - all that fun stuff. The app said a 30 min wait but I got there in 10 and it was ready! So fast and prompt. The gentlemen who helped me was very nice and made sure I had everything I needed to eat outside. My burger was HUGE and cooked perfectly. Sooooo good!!

After a long day and skipped lunch, I stepped in here late afternoon to order a burger for takeout. I quickly looked at the menu options and landed on the buckaroo burger - how could I resist meat on more meat? The buckaroo is a beef burger with aged cheddar, smoked brisket, wild mushrooms and smoke sauce on a brioche bun.It seemed like a long wait for the order (probably because I was starving), but the bartender was kind and offered me water while I waited. When my order was ready, let's just say I didn't make it home before I inhaled it along with some fries. Yup, it was beyond good and totally hit the spot. Will be back for my next burger craving.",2,3,2

Yes.I went and tried the Buckaroo Burger which had beef, aged cheddar, smoked brisket, wild mushrooms and a ""smoke sauce"" on a brioche bun. The burger itself was incredibly juicy but I feel that the other ingredients were almost non existent. Didn't taste much of any cheese and the smoke sauce didn't have much of a taste. The bun held up well with all the meat juices.Fries weren't included which was kind of a bummer.My server was perfect but beware a burger here with no sides and a drink cost me nearly $25!!",7,3,5

I ordered the Supreme which came with a delicious onion ring on top.Adam ordered the Flamin' Bacon.We also got fries and onion rings to share. The fries weren't that great but the onion rings were very good.I really recommend the Supreme for people who like onion rings and greasy type burgers.

17,Angela L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2065,394,640,4.0,7/13/2018,"During our most recent trip to New York City, we stumbled upon Bare Burger as it was a short walk from our hotel, also on W 57th street. We arrived right before the Friday night dinner rush so we did not have to wait for a table. After we were seated, a stream of people came in only to hear the hostess say it'll be a 20 minute wait to each of them.What stood out for me right away is their marketing around fresh, organic, free-range, locally sourced ingredients. Since I have been on a special diet for some time now and into the future, building a chicken burger with a gluten-free bun was amazing and tasted great considering it's gluten-free. Not too grainy and with more chewiness than other gluten-free buns I have sampled.The fries were above average as well, crispy on the outside and soft and meaty on the inside.Our waitress was very cheery and friendly, and asked right away if we had ever been here before(which we had not). During the meal, she was very attentive and checked in on us several times even though the restaurant was filled to capacity. I most certainly would come back when I'm back in NYC.",17,9,18

I felt much better feeding my baby cousins burgers that are made using local, organic, all natural and sustainable ingredients. They have endless options and make it easy to be adventurous, but I always love a good Impossible Burger. I tried one if their vegan shakes this time and their Velvis shake was so good, my mom snuck half of it when I wasn't looking! It was super creamy and tasted like a peanut butter cup cookie with the perfect amount of chocolate sauce and peanut butter. My cousin absolutely loved the strawberry milkshake, which is strawberry jam blended into a vanilla milkshake.The service was also great, and she kept checking on us to see if we wanted refills of our drinks. She patiently answered our questions about the menu because my family was blown away by all the interesting options. I also liked that she warned my cousin that the strawberry milkshake isn't strawberry ice cream, but jam in a vanilla milkshake.",,,

I really like their sprouted bun as well; my only complaint is that sometimes the bun is not as fresh as it should be and the same sandwich does not consistently taste the same; if you are trying to come back for the same flavor you remember from your previous visit, you may not get that satisfaction!",,,

The hostess and wait staff were cool and pretty attentive until they had a full house. I had tried their vegan burger with the fries and strawberry lemonade...I was not a fan of it at all. The vegan burger was bald and so was the French fries. The strawberry lemonade needed sugar badly.

Sure I may throw some harder elbows to squeeze to the front of a packed bar, or get into a hand fight to grab the last slice of pizza, but never would it resort to blows. When it comes to Bareburger, I almost ended up breaking this rule. Having ordered an Impossible Burger after my friend recommended it ahead of me, I was unaware it was a vegan option. After finishing about half of my burger, in ignorant bliss, I was alerted that there was no meat at all in my meal. Tricking a guy into ordering a burger with no meat almost lead me to start to beat up my friend for his deception.

For context, I'm not vegan but I ordered the beyond burger (that has a vegan patty, vegan cheese, and vegan mayo) and absolutely loved it. I would recommend getting a shareable plate (such as the crispy brussel sprouts) and splitting it with somebody else though, as the burger is filling but you'll want a little something extra on the side. The lemonade isn't your typical sweet ""minute maid"" tasting lemonade. It has a tart, fresh taste. I personally prefer the more sugary, fake stuff but that's just me. The milkshakes are amazing. The ice cream tastes like they freshly churned it in the back! I'd return",3,,1

I really enjoy the burgers here because they are not greasy. The burger is still incredibly juicy and falls a part in your mouth. There are so many options for every burger lover.They also have an option to create your own, which allows you to mix and match different flavors. The sides were also delicious. The onion rings were huge and came with a chipotle dipping sauce. The French fries were also extremely crispy and we al kept going back for more. My only negative was the staff. I felt like it wasn't really that crowded, and they rushed us around and it was almost a bother to ask them for something. Food was an A and service was a B.",,,

Luckily Bareburger has got tons of options for vegetarians. Not only do they have A ton of veggie patties they also have ""fake burger"" which is plant based and tastes I would say as close to the real thing as possible. I believe it is called the impossible burger or beyond burger. It was annoying it kept breaking apart into little pieces but then again its not a real burger. I highly suggest it though if you are vegetarian. For desert they have a smores sundae its really good and was my favorite thing there~The macho fries are okay, they can get a little soggy with all the toppings but the potion is huge(definitely something to share).

34,D. P. M.,"New York, NY",754,6,1,2.0,7/19/2018,"My first visit (7/15/18) to Bareburger on W. 57th Street in NYC left much to be desired and left a bad impression. In my 34 years as a New York resident, it was one of the topmost dishonest experiences I've had, even though, despite the misinformation the food was fairly good.The server's name was Layse, and she appeared cheery, courteous and attentive, and even recommended what I, eventually, ordered. I was surprised by the incorrect answer I got to a question about the ingredients in the Buckaroo burger. I've been trying to cut down on eating beef (even organic) because it takes so long to digest and makes me sluggish, so I asked about getting chicken instead of the beef. No problem, the server said. When the sandwich came I noticed slices of what looked like beef on it. Didn't realize the sandwich included brisket, which I've always known to be beef, but when I asked the server she said it was pork. Hmmm! Never heard this before and thought it a new twist and unique. Afterward, once home I looked up Bareburger's menu online. Clearly, it states that it was organic beef brisket, not pork as identified by the server. So, this was really deceptive. The server blatantly lied possibly to keep from having to return the sandwich to the kitchen. I am glad I wasn't allergic to beef, and that I had been simply cutting down on the amount I ate. If I had gotten sick, it would have been grounds to file a lawsuit.Nevertheless, I found an untrustworthy server at Bareburger's restaurant. It really sucks to know that there is someone who would stoop to such a low by saying and/or doing whatever just to get money. Far too common.This experience makes it easy to eliminate Bareburger from my go-to list of restaurants. I'm sharing my experience in hopes that you won't patronize this restaurant.

I haven't been to a Bareburger in YEARS but really wanted to try the Impossible Burger. I'm not vegan/not on a plant-based diet but I'm always looking to try new food especially if it's sustainable SO it was right up my alley.I ended up ordering a Guapo Chop salad with an Impossible Burger as the protein. Dressing on the side and !!! This salad is so good it doesn't even need dressing (and the guacamole kinda acts as the dressing anyway). 12/10 would recommend this salad. I came around noon on a weekday and it was pretty empty. I assume they get most of their lunch orders to go but they were fast enough that you can have lunch with co-workers within an hour (that is, if it's not packed). Service was fast and friendly too. As it was noon on a weekday I didn't have a beer or anything but this location had a pretty good selection! Taking off a star because it wasn't life changing (though I may start adding guac to my own salads at home), and it is a pricier lunch than other places. On the other hand, it'd also be a cheaper dinner. Bareburger also has an amazing amount of options for vegans and other dietary restrictions.

47,Ilze G.,"New York, NY",2,5,5,2.0,7/27/2018,"I used to love this place, when I became a vegan it was a great burger option. Yesterday was a different experience. I came in after two, sat at the bar and was not passed a menu or given water for about 10min. After that, a white lady came to sit right next to me. Instantly got a menu and one for her friend who had not arrived plus water. At this point I had still not been served, I'm a person of colour and then looked around the room and noticed I was the only person of colour in this place, in midtown, NYC, 2018! A few minutes later, a seemingly annoyed guy asked if I was ready to order, without noticing that I'd not had a menu and was there before the lady next to me.  Because I knew what I wanted, I ordered an impossible burger. 10 min later, I noticed the waiters other bar colleague say, ""hey, did you mean to put this order through?"" Called my order and I knew at this point it wasn't going to go well from here. 30min later, I still did not have my order. The restaurant cleared out half way by this time and I politely asked the server if he could check on my order. He went to the kitchen and a few minutes later came out. I then noticed by the look of the Burger, that I was never asked how I wanted the burger cooked, or what kind of bun ! The burger was cooked well done and partially burnt (I always order medium rare). I usually get the sprout bun and I got some weird egg coated bun that seemed over toasted. I don't know what kinda cheese was on there.. bottom line, this guy made me feel uncomfortable buy the way he treated me differently to the lady next to me who had a lighter skin tone. I politely asked my check and got the hell out of there. People of colour.. be cautioned.. or maybe it was just me who offended this guy",1,,

Updated review","So I heard about the Impossible Burger which is completely vegan but looks, tastes, and even bleeds like a real 100% beef Burger cooked to medium. I was highly skeptical. I suspected this was a gimmick and would be disappointed. Glad to admit I was wrong. The burger tastes like a beef Burger that's well seasoned with what I suspect is sea salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. The texture is comparable to an extremely tender beef pattie. I had this with vegan American cheese which also melted and tasted like real cheese. The Sriracha mayo added a slight bite to the burger. What's nice is you can customize your burger with toppings like bacon, different cheeses (real and imitation), condiments, and other fixings. The price was shocking for just the burger with no added sides. The base price is $9.95 plus whatever you want. Each burger type, topping, and what not was extra. Price aside, I'm incredibly impressed with the convincing approach to a vegan burger than mimicks a real beef pattie. I hope more vegetarian and vegan options follow suit as this could easily replace meat for me. Yes, it was that good.",1,,

This is the future of food.Actually, you can only buy and try an Impossible Burger in select restaurants, like this one. You cannot buy them in stores or online yet. You can find a list of restaurants on the impossible Foods website.There's a ton of science behind this, it's made from a plant-based protein (I recommend viewing some of the info online) - but it's simply the best alternative to meat I've ever had. NOTHING like the bean or veggie alternatives you usually see. Taste, texture and smell of an awesome real meat hamburger patty. What a great find, unfortunately their availability is still limited around the country.Super convenient location here in midtown, around the corner from Radio City Music Hall. Also, good selection of beers on tap, and many other entrees as well. They get crowded, so use the Yelp app. to join the waitlist.",,,

I loved that they only served organic foods and that they had multiple vegan options (my son is vegan). We had the chicken bites appetizer and the crispy Brussels sprouts. I was surprised how tasty the chicken was! I ordered a ""Paul Bunyan"" burger - a bison burger with blue cheese, bacon, and a fig jam. My first time trying bison- it was good, very lean.

55,Deanna S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",154,138,1143,2.0,3/20/2017,"Bareburger has really expanded since the last time I've eaten at one. There are many more options on the menu now but I think I'd still stick with the burgers that classically define what bareburger is about. That being said, I recall the experience at my neighborhood bareburger to be really quaint, the service nice and friendly and food really satisfying - not to say that this location doesn't offer these things - but I think there's definitely room for improvement. The service was really really slow. Our group of four ordered the sweet fries and onion rings to start and they served it with out food...that we waited probably 40 minutes for...in a space that was not crowded at all. On a Friday night, it was almost empty. I'm was surprised. There was also a space on the table to place our water jug for refills - like it literally says ""place here for refill"". The servers passed us multiple times, they definitely saw the jug but no one made the effort to refill it. When our food came, my cousin and I had issues looking for the pineapple in our burgers, which eventually ended up being in there, but was really thin and grilled brown, resembling more of like a mushroom than pineapple. The burger (I got the wiki wiki with chicken instead of wild boar) overall was decent, but again nothing to to rant and rave about. Personally, I feel like the quality has gone down a bit. Bareburger isn't as great as I recall, but hopefully that turns around!",,,1

I'm relatively new to grubhub (don't judge) and found it easy to order and specify the food allergies (dairy, nuts) that I hoped they could accommodate for in their food prep.When I arrived to pick up my order, I was greeted by a friendly staff member. I asked if he could check if there were any questions about my special instructions. (Really, I wanted to be sure they read my notes!)The kitchen staff had already reviewed the instructions and replaced a bun and omitted sauce that contained dairy. I was glad they caught this as it was not clear on the online description of the Beyond Burger that there are non-vegan components (brioche bun, special sauce) to it. Great attention to details and knowledge of food allergies.The burgers were delicious - I especially loved the charbroiled taste of the Impossible Burger although my husband, who hasn't eaten red meat in 25+ years, was a little weirded out that it was so much like beef in its taste and texture.

I got the falafel wrap minus the feta and was blown away.  The falafel was not the standard, dry, fried chunk of crumbles that I usually have eaten at other Mediterranean chains, but instead, almost a smash of creamy, nutty hummus.  The cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts, and the lemon-tahini dressing was a wonderful flavor combination.  It just all worked so well and the dish was a great choice post-workout.

Finally with the help of yelp we decided to give this place a try. Man was it a great choice! Small, fun little resturant with happy hunger vibes. They were pretty busy but sat us down quick. They have a great menu, with so many choices it was hard to decide what to try. We ended up ordering the Buckaroo Burger and Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. These were jam packed with flavor and freshness! We were not dissapointed and thought we definately need to come back here again! The freshness of the ingredients were apparent.

The menu is big with burgers (made or build your own), sandwiches, salads, etc. They also have about five beers on tap and a full bar. The non-alcoholic choices I was disappointed with. I just wanted a regular soda but they only have ""natural flavored"" and flavored tea and lemonade. I did order a strawberry lemonade that was too tart. All food comes ""a la carte.""

Updated review","Disheartened to lower my rating for one of my absolute favorite nearby restaurants.Service the last few times has been beyond abysmal. As in: waiting 5-10 minutes for waiter just to show up with water, waiting another 10 min to order, waiting far too long (once again) to actually receive food, FINALLY receive drinks we ordered while already half way done with food, waiter never coming back again and having to hunt waiter down to pay. Again, this exact same thing has happened multiple times. Each time I've had bad service I've been brought a standard paper check, not the iPad. Not sure if it's because there's a star rating when paying (but obviously could be for a completely different reason). Looks like I'm not the only regular who has noticed the drop is quality. :(Minor note: is the music now significantly louder than it used to be? My friends have also commented that it's almost as loud as a bar in there lately.",,1,

I got the impossible burger and subbed the vegan American cheese for queso fundido and added special sauce. I waited a little over 20 minutes for my one burger with no sides. When I got home I opened the burger and found about 3 diced caramelized onions and one wilted piece of lettuce that was an aged green color on the end. The queso fundido was scarce. I could tell the burger had been thrown together sloppily so to fulfill the order, but waiting 20 minutes for this was just ridiculous.

It's about $20-23 a person with hamburger, side, soda with tax/tip. The shared sides section is not meant for (2-4 people) as advertised. Perhaps 1.5 people is a better metric.

Upon arrival at the bar the guy taking orders was rude and offputting and harshly told me I couldn't get the lunch special as takeout I replied that the hostess told me I could which resulted in an awakard mini-arguement among the two. After all this mellow drama this dude barks at me ""so do you still wanna order??"" I didn't but I was hungry and in a rush so my order came up to $3 more than the special, which is not the issue at hand- the service however is.Bareburger, train your employees to all be on the same page and to be knowledgeable of policies.

Shockingly, I didn't not like the meat in my burger at all but that may have been because it was pretty well done, when I had actually ordered it to be medium (my coworker had the same problem). We didn't say anything though because we were in a rush to get back to work. Once the check came and we paid, the iPad asked us to give a rating. I ended up giving a 3 star rating. I gave 3 stars because I didn't like that a burger that was ordered to be cooked medium, was in fact cooked pretty well done. When I told the waitress why, she got pretty aggressive right away, which I did not appreciate her attitude at all. Maybe next time I'll try beef, not bison. We'll see...",1,,

106,Jennifer K.,"New York, NY",147,40,25,4.0,6/10/2016,"I'm a vegetarian, and I love Bareburger. The carnivorous men I go with seem to enjoy their flesh sandwiches, and so I can vicariously attest to the quality of their meat products. I live a block away and come here when I need a casual place to share a meal with a visiting friend. Service is fast and friendly. The ambience imparts a rustic, Yellowstone Wyoming feel with a modern, artsy twist. I'm not sure what to make of the animal portraits on the walls. Are they funny? Are they deranged? You decide... Out of the two vegetarian options I tried, I found the Guadelupe burger to be tastier. The black bean paired with the guacamole and sprout bun really hit the spot; all the ingredients meshed together in a truly orgasmic, veggie burger experience. Despite taking second place, the Farmstead wrap offered its own impressive merits. The sweet potato, hummus and flavorful dressing worked well in the collard warp, delivering a satisfying bite; however, if you have a problem with *chewiness* (or if you're on a date with someone you want to impress) I would not recommend this option because that collard leaf is difficult to get down. I spat out a piece of particularly fibrous material. I wanted to dig their fries, but their fries let me down. I would rather eat McDonalds' fries. I can't pinpoint what was wrong with them specifically. They just struck me as plain, forgettable, the diametric antithesis of addictive. To end on a positive note: I enjoyed the Banana Milkshake, which came with a caramel topping. It was thick and cold and had chunks of real banana.

When it comes to food I don't get sick easily and I eat almost everything but after forcing myself halfway thru I had to just throw the burger in the garbage. The onion rings were fine but wow. Im in shock because the Bareburger in the financial district has always been good to me. $17 on a lunch to go is a lot to blow to begin with but for it to taste that terrible?!

Bareburger is a chain dishing out organic options on the classic American combo of burgers and fries. Their farmstead burger is my go to - sweet potato & wild rice patty with hummus, tomatoes, and baby kale all wrapped in collard greens. Vegans and vegetarians you are welcome here! Their ""BYOB"" option (build your own burger) let's you get creative with meats that you would not even think of nomming on - ex. elk, wild boar, duck, and elk! Plus for anyone who wants a beer with their burger - Bareburger offers a great happy hour special and has multiple beers on tap! I order from this location at least once a week and my 3 star rating comes from the need for me to triple check my order - first over the phone when placing the order, then when paying at the register, and then when the bag comes from the kitchen. Unfortunately at least once a month a part of the order is missing/been replaced with an alternate item/or unmarked - when working in a corporate office and ordering for many people at once this is an error that cannot occur, period.

I'm referring to two incidents that occurred at this location back to back. The first being I placed an order through Delivery.com the other night for a burger, a side, and dessert. After waiting for an hour I received a call from delivery.com saying this location wanted to make sure I was aware that some side to my dessert would cost another two bucks. I said okay. They said great. I waited another twenty minutes and then my food finally arrived with no dessert. I called this location to find out the dessert just wasn't placed in the bag and that an employee would be hand delivering it themselves. The dessert then came after waiting another twenty minutes.Then today, I placed an order through Delivery.com for a chicken sandwich and a side of onion rings. I immediately called this location to make sure they got the order. Matt told me they had. After waiting about a half an hour, I decided maybe I should just pick up the food myself rather than waiting for delivery. I called this location and asked Matt if it would be faster if I picked it up myself. He said the food was right there waiting for me if I wanted to just come get it. So I asked him to remind me where the restaurant was and he said ""We're on 57th between 8th and 7th."". It wasn't until I ran to 57th between 8th and 7th only to see that the restaurant is actually between 8th and 9th. Matt doesn't seem to know where his own restaurant is. Finally getting there, I'm told the food isn't ready yet and that I could wait at the bar. I said are you sure because I ordered forty minutes ago and Matt told me it was here waiting for me. They said, no it's not ready. I wait another ten minutes and am then brought the wrong order. Some chicken bites and fries. I tell them that's not what I ordered, they said let me go check, then came back and said that's what you ordered. I showed them my receipt from delivery.com and sure enough that was not what I had ordered. At this point I was running far too late to wait another twenty minutes for the correct order to be made so I left with the wrong order; an order that cost a third less than what I had paid for.I can guarantee that I will never return to this location and I expect Bareburger to send me something to rectify the incompetence of Matt and the staff at this specific branch.

However, you may notice that this Bareburger is slightly smaller than some of the others. The menu is identical and replicates the standard for this food chain. We ordered our regular customized burgers. Again there was something off with my cheese, just like at another Bareburger. The lesson here is that their ordering system is deeply flawed and yields itself to error. There has to be a better system which can provide greater accuracy for customers when ordering the custom burgers. Maybe have the servers repeat your order back?

There were nine of us and they crammed us all into a corner booth where it seemed air conditioning was nothing but a myth. It took forever for the food to get to us, and it wasn't worth the wait or the fact that our waitress seemed to have completely forgotten about us. I had the habanero ostrich burger, which had sautéed spinach and (supposedly) habanero sauce on it. It was not spicy in the least, but the actual patty was very dry and bland while the bun itself was soggy to the point of falling apart. My wife ordered the Morning Commute Wich, which consisted of a sunny egg and a piece of cheese on a sad little bun (that looked as if it had been sat on) thrown haphazardly onto a plate that was much too large for it, with a side of COLD sweet potato fries. When she complained that her sandwich was sad and the fries were cold, our waitress told her that that's just how the sandwich looks and didn't come back with the fries for over half an hour. Would not recommend for people with taste buds and any expectation for good service.Update:Was personally contacted by Matthew, one of the business owners who apologized very sincerely for our bad experience and offered to make it right.

I would eat elk every day of my life if it was always this great!The fries are awesome here as well as the shakes! They gave us two different dipping sauces that were friggin splendid and the banana shake I ordered was fantastic with a nice banana chunk to be found every so often which I just happen to enjoy. It lets me know there is real fruit in it. The burger itself was not a monster of a burger and did not come with any sides or garnishes of any sort, so it was a bit on the pricier side. What was cool was how flexible they are in letting you customize your burger. In terms of value, you could get a satisfying burger and sides at Steak 'n Shake for cheaper but the main draw for me were the ""exotic"" meat alternatives.",,,

Any of the beef burgers are fantastic. I've had a ""make your own"" which is great because they have so many options. Tonight we were both in the mood for chicken. I order the Hot Honey Chicken burger ($10.50). It surprisingly didn't have that much flavor. I was expecting a lot more honey taste. And I do not like the pineapple taste on it. It wasn't very sweet and it was warm so it just didn't taste right on the sandwich. If I were to get it again I would ask for no pineapples and lots of extra honey sauce. I love friend chicken but this style was a little bland for my liking. My boyfriend likes his choice. He ordered the buttermilk buffalo chicken ($9.95). It was definitely more packed with flavor. The fries are good here. But make sure to skip the bland onion rings. The pricey burgers don't come with any sides, which is a bummer.

Used Yelp to find bareburger as we were at Central Park in Columbus Circle. The servers were friendly and fun-Luke was great. The fried brussel sprouts were delicious. My friend and I split a standard burger and the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. Simple and well executed. Our onion rings were crisp and huge and we loved the sauces they came with. Our kids had the grilled cheese and a burger. They were content and quietly munched away as we reviewed our day. The only negative was the wasabi carrot slaw-the flavor was good but my friend and I both agreed that we wanted it to be creamier. Overall, I'd recommend bareburger!",,,

The décor was trendy with lots of funky animal art and bright colors.I like how this place is overall healthy and fairly priced. They have fancy salads for both vegetarians and  meat lovers, they have awesome chicken sandwiches, great finger foods with four awesome dipping sauces, they have really good fries and onion rings to buffalo chicken bites and sliders for 10 bucks. They of course dominate the burger industry since you can either have sesame beef, ground beef, turkey, elk, bison, wild ostrich , duck or vegetarian options like sweet potato and rice or beans in the patty. I liked how you can either try their special burgers or you can make one your own,[you can get super creative with options like guac or spicy chipotle mayo ]. I tried the El Matador with  bison, queso fresco, jalapenos, guacamole, green leaf, spicy pico de gallo, brioche bun. All the burgers are done medium unless you ask for well done , so I don't know if that's because its best for the quality of their meat?.  Anyway the burger was lean, juicy, not too spicy, very creative and flavorful , and super filling. It was a bit messy but to be honest that means that's a hefty yummy burger. I wish their burgers had deluxe options but you have the option of getting rings and fries on the side for 6 bucks if you don't want the sharing size.The server was also a sweetheart, he was really adamant about making sure the customer was happy and he explained how the menu worked. He also checked up on us frequently to make sure we were satisfied.Overall for two burgers , one appetizer and iced tea, it came out to only 42 dollars, and to be honest every single thing was delicious, I really do want to try the entire menu!and PS the bathroom was spotless!",9,3,5

Bareburger serves high quality and tasty burgers. You basically build you own burger off the menu. You choose your meat (beef, elk, or bison, etc), type of bun, and then cheese and accompaniments. It all adds up to great tasting high quality burgers, beers, shakes and fries.However, why-why-why do great burger joints lack consistent service? One burger medium and one burger medium-well gets punched in as two burgers well done. Ugh! If you ask, ""How do you want your burgers done?"" Then please pay attention to the answer! And, when there is no rush to clear the table, don't swipe my beer when I still have a inch worth in the glass! Also, if you advertise $4 happy hour beers in the window and talk them up at the table, don't charge me $5 and tell me the bill is correct.Bareburger looses big two stars for these faults.

We were seated and 10 minutes later the bartender took our drink and food order saying the server would be back with us shortly. Tables seated after us got water and we waited 15 minutes before I finally was able to flag down the hostess for water.  Our food came out the same time our water arrived. Like I said, the food was outstanding. Our drink were empty and we waited 10 minutes to finally get them refilled. Entire lunch was 90 minutes from start to end and only about 20 of that was actually with our food and we were only a party of three.",,,

Server took forever to greet us but the food was great! Good seasonal beer selection, the appetizers were great! Staff was friendly but seemed elsewhere when paying attention to guests. Four stars for customer server being mediocre.",,,

The options are endless.. their service is pretty quick and the good quality is evident. Overall the much needed organic burger place in hells kitchen.",,,
