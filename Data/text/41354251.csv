Updated review","Just got back yesterday from my third stay and enjoyed it as much as ever.  One little ""hiccup"" was I wasn't thrilled with my first room -- I made it thru Hotel.com maybe that's why.  There was nothing wrong with the room -- top floor (I don't mind the stairs) but I prefer the street view and this was the back.  A lot of people don't want ""street noise"" but I love it -- that's NY to me,  The next day we were moved across the floor to the Leslie Caron room -- on the front, larger -- very gracious of them.  Staff, as always, professional.  Location - perfect.  Can't wait to return.  Thank you Chelsea Pines Inn.",,,

Updated review","An update to my 4/26/2014 review of Chelsea Pines Inn.   I have stayed there three more times and the rooms, the service, the breakfast and the helpful staff have been excellent.  I will stay there again when I have business in that area.",1,,
2,Andrea D.,"New Haven, CT",874,130,90,4.0,12/18/2017,Chelsea Pines is such a sweet little spot. We had a nice space last night but we ended up leaving early because the bed in our room was a little bit smaller then expected. The gentleman who greeted us and checked us in was wonderful.,,,
3,Alanna V.,"Milford, NJ",0,8,0,5.0,8/10/2018,"I love this place! Just recently stayed for a couple of nights. The location is great, the A, C, E, and L trains are located just at the end of the block as well as a big CVS. Breakfast everyday was perfect and sitting out on the back patio with coffee made it even better. The rooms are cute and clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a reasonably priced, charming hotel in a fantastic location this is your place!",1,,
4,R N.,"Downtown, Portland, OR",0,13,6,4.0,5/19/2018,"We recently stayed here for three nights. This hotel is very conveniently located to the subway, walk to the Highline and Chelsea market. GREAT location. Our room facing the back rather than the street was surprisingly very quiet. They must have thick walls because we didn't hear other guests either. All the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. I love that they recycle and use real dishes for breakfast!  Breakfast was good with lots of options. Overall they are offering a great place to stay in NY! The place is older and a little rustic but it's clean and comfortable. The WiFi was pretty much useless in our room. I would definitely stay here again.",,,
5,Jake P.,"PA, PA",31,376,4,2.0,7/28/2017,"Yes, it's a lovely property and in my experiences, priced well.However, upon my latest stay, the hotel insisted on charging me a full night's stay after I canceled a booking five days in advance. I travel often, and that has never happened to me anywhere. I would not have even asked if it was last minute. However, clearly they value taking in money by any means over reason, professionalism, or courtesy.",4,,
6,James R.,"Bay City, MI",43,22,2,1.0,6/11/2018,"We reserved a room in January for a trip in June. Definitely early enough. Less than 2 days before we arrive we were informed that our reservation was cancelled due to a leak. They involuntarily moved us to another hotel (the Gem on 22nd). The Gem will not answer their phone or respond to emails. We have no idea if they know we exist. This may or may not be the Pines responsibility, but they transferred me so they are vouching for The Gem. I called Chelsea Pines and the gentleman on the phone was very indifferent and could not have cared less about my concerns. I was very much looking forward to staying at Chelsea Pines, which is why I thought to book so early. I got very lucky and found an Airbnb in the same neighborhood. Beware of both of these establishments.",2,,
7,Amara M.,"Romeoville, IL",103,7,0,5.0,1/25/2018,"We stayed only one night at Chelsea Pines, but it was really enjoyable! The staff was very friendly and the room was simple, but did its job well. The location is also really great! The only thing I can say negatively is that the pillows weren't nice at all, so if you can bring your own pillows, do it. Other than that, it was a great room to stay in and I would book here again!",1,,
8,Chris G.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,35,0,3.0,6/13/2017,Very friendly front desk.  The room/door keys demagnitized easily and had to be replaced often.Lovely little backyard seating area.Clean room but shower clogged.Excellent location and price,1,1,
9,Adriane S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,2,1.0,4/11/2018,"I reserved a room for a one night stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn. The day before my reservation, I went online to search the address of the hotel and when I typed in the name into Google, the search term ""Chelsea Pines Inn Bed Bugs"" auto populated into the search box. I clicked on the search and found numerous past reports on multiple websites documenting a bed bug problem at this hotel. Naturally, I called the hotel to cancel my reservation and spoke with Mark. With his apathetic tone, he could not care less about my legitimate concerns. I have never been exposed to such poor customer service. I was willing to pay some portion of the price as a cancellation fee, but that was not good enough. Even if I cancelled, they would still charge me nearly the full price of my stay. Mark insisted that I should have called 1 week in advance to cancel, which is a ridiculous cancellation policy. I will never book with them again.",3,,
10,Oxana K.,"Springfield, VA",14,12,0,5.0,12/28/2017,"This is the best place I stayed ever in NYC. First of all great location, close to metro and other activities to do. Second the hotel itself is very cozy, clean with very friendly employees. Third, great breakfast with quite a choice. Very nice place to eat outside a bit small but in general more than nice. Very quiet and wonderful to relax. Definitely recommend for short or long stay. A bit pricey but worth every penny we paid! Thanks a lot! Had a great experience!!!",,,
11,L. K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,46,16,2.0,10/8/2017,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights paying over $225 per night. They gave me room 506. Turned out the exhaust is right next to the door. Not sure if anyone can sleep with this type of noise. 3 miserable nights. On my 3rd day I spoke to the lady in the morning about my disappointing with the noise yet nothing was done about it.after tossing and turning at 12:00 midnight I called the front desk and talked to them again. The gentleman who answered came up and turned the exhaust off.It is not fair up threw someone in this worthless room. Pillows are like rocks and kind of smelly.Cleanliness is average, condition of the room is below average but staff is Nice. I am ok with no elevator carrying my luggage 5 stories up but I am not ok with a smelly and noisy room.Based on my experience I don't recommend this hotel.",1,,
12,Tracy R.,"Stanford, CA",66,15,3,5.0,8/2/2017,"Great little place in an excellent location!  Close to shopping, markets, great restaurants, local pubs.  Nice breakfast items, cookies throughout the day, cute patio area, and really helpful, kind staff! Will def stay here again!",,,
13,Travel L.,"Delmar, NY",0,19,0,4.0,2/22/2018,"Stayed here for the second time and like the first I really appreciated the hotel comfort, staff, and location.  Interesting older place with high ceilings and each room dedicated to a particular actress from long ago.  The front desk staff were fantastic and welcoming and the morning breakfast was adequate.  Location is a big plus as this is just off the a and l subway station at 8th and 14th and near the Chelsea market.  Only downside was no elevator but luckily I was on 2nd floor.",,,
14,Gloribel R.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",0,18,0,4.0,8/20/2017,"I booked a room here through Hotels.com because the place had excellent reviews. The location was great and convenient. The receptionist (don't remember her name) was fantastic - very friendly and funny. But the bathrooms in front our room reeked of urine and the smell leaked into the hallway and the entrance of our room. The bed was very comfortable and perfect for sleeping but the room was very dim and dark, much like the lighting in the rest of the inn. Overall, it was worth the price but with a few minor adjustments it could be the kind of place worth raving about.",,,
15,Nikki G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,5,0,5.0,12/20/2015,"To add to the other reviews here, Chelsea Pines deserves all the recognition it can get. This was our first time to New York for the weekend, and we had no idea what we were getting into. The hotel is located a few steps away from the Subway (on a line that connects all the way up to Midtown). Here are some highlights from our stay here:We arrived late on Friday (around 1:00 A.M) and were welcomed by Sean at the front desk. He was very receptive to all of our questions and pointed us right back out the door to a 24 hour Cuban restaurant a couple blocks away - exactly what we needed!The next morning we headed downstairs at 11:00 for the complimentary breakfast (which included, bagels croissants, donuts, you name it). There was cheese cut off the block, yogurt, jam, olives, OJ, apple juice, mint/lime water - everything was delicious. The owner, Jay, came over to say hello and make sure we were alright as we sat in their beautiful, cozy dining area (with a nice courtyard to walk out to). We met Jason - who was super friendly and made us feel extra welcome - his Spiced Pear cider is great, and we were able to find a familiar face and chat when we felt overwhelmed around town!Later during our stay we met Edwin who pointed us to a Holiday Market at Union Square - we didn't even know but it was exactly what we wanted to take a break from sightseeing.I could go on and on, but this is the place to stay in New York for ease of transportation, location, and the best people around to help you experience the City.Don't stay anywhere else!!",6,,1
16,Storm G.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,40,9,5.0,7/17/2014,"Chelsea Pines Inn got it right!  A surprise birthday stay-cation with a wonderful twist!  An ode to old Hollywood, we laid our heads in the Lee Remick room.  Nicely decorated with movie posters and updated amenities. Jay the owner and staff should hold hospitality classes twice a week.  Then there was the outdoor garden!  We missed breakfast because I love to sleep in but Jay invited us to have some of his homemade (banana nut) bread!  If you're looking for a place to stay that has it all, look no further than Chelsea Pines Inn. P.S. Charlie Chaplin paid us a visit right before we left the garden. He too understands hospitality.  If you were wondering why they named the cat ""Charlie Chaplin"". Wait until you see him",6,1,2
17,Joanna Y.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,5,0,5.0,9/18/2017,"I really love this place. I've stayed here twice over the past four weeks and would definitely come back again. The location is great. The pricing is reasonable. The rooms are small but very clean and very comfortable. They have a nice little kitchen lounge on the main floor with great coffee and homemade ice tea. The staff is very friendly and helpful. As a Long Islander, sometimes it's just more convenient to stay over night than take the train home. This has become my go to spot. The setting is very intimate. It feels like going home at the end of the night. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to New York or for locals just looking for a place to crash for the night. If you're looking for small, homey, friendly, quite, relaxing, personal, clean and convenience, the Chelsea Pines Inn is the spot for you!",,,
18,Montyoja J.,"Alexandria, VA",0,26,12,5.0,9/4/2014,"I can't say enough good things about the Chelsea Pines Inn. I have traveled the world and stayed in everything from a bare-bones hostel to 5-star hotels, and these guys could teach every single one of those places how to do hospitality right.This place is incredible value and worth every penny. I've stayed here twice on business, and was delighted both times. My travel companions booked elsewhere (either uptown or at other hotels in the neighborhood) and got tiny rooms at 3x the price.The location is perfect: it's within sight of the A-C-E line on 8th Ave and 14th- about 100 steps. It's surrounded by plenty of food options from quick diner and grab and go options, all the way to sit down, multi-course meals. Chelsea Market is close, which if you want some fabulously fresh food, that's a great place to stop for lunch. The tech and industry offices are within walking distance, which makes meeting colleagues incredibly easy.The rooms are flawless, spacious (none of this converted closet shenanigans), and very clean. Towels, concierge items you may have forgotten, etc are all readily available. The AC in the summer is a welcome respite, and the street noise doesn't seem to make it into the rooms. A big plus for me is the daily breakfast spread. This isn't some anemic continental breakfast like chain hotels, but a full spread. Sliced meat, fresh fruit, bagels and pastries, tea and coffee, and homemade bread are offered and it's nice to eat quietly on the patio before running to sightsee or work. The staff is nothing but helpful and make check in/out a breeze and are always ready to help with arrangements.  As stated, the only drawback is there is no elevator. Staff will grab your bags for you, but if you have a 5th floor room, I'm pretty sure after a week's stay you are allowed to moan and complain about "" d@%# New York City walkups"" like a local. This hotel is one of the best I've stayed at worldwide and not only do I plan on staying here every time i travel to the city, I recommend it to friends and coworkers.",3,,1
19,Shelby R.,"Lodi, CA",97,24,37,5.0,3/28/2015,"Haven't seen our room yet... But if the service is any indication we are in for a treat. The staff have been amazingly helpful and friendly. We just finished complimentary breakfast on the patio, got suggestions for site seeing, and have someone helping us book theater tickets!!!My review is a bit delayed but I wanted to make sure to do one.  This was a great place.  The location was absolutely the best- kudos to my bestie for finding it.  Close to the subway, safe for us 2 girls to go out alone.  The staff was very helpful.  They offered suggestions, gave us directions, reserved tickets for us, and when our flight home got cancelled due to snow, they offered us another night at a discounted rate!  The rooms are cozy and very accommodating.  We will definitely be back...hopefully soon :)",4,,1
20,Kristin D.,"Clearwater, FL",11,6,2,5.0,1/26/2015,"Best hotel in NYC. Decor, location and amenities make it great,  the staff put it over the top. Best hidden gem. It was easy to check in eventhough delayed by 12 hours, and we have been treated perfectly. And Charlie Chaplin is a love.",4,1,2
21,Lauren T.,"Arvada, CO",0,3,6,5.0,5/15/2015,"If you are ever wanting to stay in the Chelsea area, this Inn is the perfect place to stay. Its only walking distance from the Chelsea Market, right near the Highline, and a block away from the Subway which can take you all over town. When My husband and I went to New York two years ago, it was my very first time in the city. Jay, the owner of the Inn, gave us so many recommendation of things to do in the neighborhood and every one of them was wonderful. The breakfast that is provided in the morning is such a healthy European style spread, and the afternoon guests are delighted with home made apple cider and baked goodies. When we were staying here for a week, we explored the city by foot. The location of Chelsea Pines Inn being so central to the subway made it effortless to stop back in each afternoon and relax on the patio before heading out again to explore. The room we stayed in was tiny but so New York. I wouldn't have wanted it bigger- and even in its small space, the details of the decor, the towels, the soaps, and the bedding made it feel elevated and luxurious. Our room's window overlooked the beautiful patio and Charlie, the Inn's cat, would stop by to say hello on occasion. We were actually snowed in and could not leave on the day we were expected to, and Jay was able to accommodate us and let us stay an additional night. The service was beyond excellent and I truly felt like we had that local new York experience, much to thanks to the staff at Chelsea Pines. Now when back home in Colorado, when we hear of friends going to visit NY, we always encourage them to book at The Chelsea Pines Inn. If we return to NY again, we will 100% be staying here!",2,,1
22,Sim L.,"Washington, DC",12,72,38,5.0,3/7/2015,"Wow. God is in the details. The rooms are not crazy luxurious but every detail such as towels, soap cleanliness and breakfast are at the highest standards. You also can't beat the location! You will love it!",3,,1
23,Lauren M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,0,1.0,7/26/2016,"Chelsea Pines Inn has lost its heart and soul. If you were lucky enough to stay here with the former owner and his amazing, friendly, helpful crew, you'll most likely want to find someplace new. Jay and staff are what made Chelsea Pines feel like a home away from home.",4,,
24,Mari N.,"Novato, CA",4,40,8,5.0,4/13/2013,"I adore this B&B - we stayed 4 nights. The property is beautiful, the staff is welcoming and friendly, the decor is divine.The breakfast is fabulous; SOOOOOO much better than the crappy pre-made stuff the Marriott or Hilton hotels try to pawn off as breakfast. The food was even Paelo-friendly!.  Also, there is fruit, water, ice tea, and cookies available all day, for free, so if you are feeling peckish you can just grab something from the kitchen. LOVE!  I loved the neighborhood and all that it offers, The property is located half a block from the 14th Street MTA station.Every morning they publish a  little flyer that has suggestions for things to do a nd see, where to eat, etc. Even though I grew up in New York and visit there frequently, this was very helpful, with hyper-current info.Let me go back to the staff - they were friendly, helpful, polite, sincere, understanding, and just plain lovely. They were so nice to me, my husband, and my son. They really made a difference, and cheered me up when I was feeling a little blue. Thank you, Chelsea Pines Inn! Than you Charlie the Cat for letting me pet you when I missed my critters.My $$ rating is based on NYC rates - it is a different world out there. Really.",5,,2
25,Andy P.,"Louisville, KY",0,3,0,1.0,7/18/2016,"New owners, not the same. We have stayed here many times in the past and always enjoyed our stay but now it's not as personal and lacks any warmth. So sorry. We will be looking at other places to stay when in NYC. And the breakfast coffee is terrible!",1,,
26,Stacy H.,"San Francisco, CA",6,33,5,5.0,11/29/2012,"Welcome Home!This is exactly what the cheerful gent at the front desk said to me when I rolled in to the charming Chelsea Pines Inn after a very long travel day from San Francisco.  Then he said, ""You must be Stacy, we've been expecting you,"" and a diminutive black and white cat wove between my ankles purring - Charlie Chaplin as I was soon to learn.From my first moment in the door all the way through my three night stay, Chelsea Pines Inn exceeded my expectations at every turn.  The building itself is a wonderful walk-up that is well-located in Chelsea - just off the Subway (A,C,E,L), a short walk from the trendy Meatpacking District and beautiful Highline Park, and about a 15 minute walk to the East Village.  There are plenty of restaurants, coffee spots, bars and locally owned shops to satisfy every desire.  In fact, when you check in, you not only get a handy list of restaurants (any of which the enthusiastic staff is happy to call and make reservations for you) but also a subway map and a local shopping guide.But don't make the mistake of going out for breakfast as the Pines offers the best free breakfast spread I have experienced outside of Europe.  From bagels and butterscotch bread (homemade by one of the owners) to cereal and charcuterie, you are certain to get your fill before a busy day of exploring the Big Apple.  The best part is that it seems the people who stay at the Pines are equally cool as the staff is, so you enjoy your breakfast with lots of very nice and interesting folks from all over the world, not a gaggle of 50-something business men from Kansas and the like who still smell like last night's bender while they piggishly feed their ample bellies.Each room is dedicated to a different movie star from back in the day - my room was the Kim Novak room, adorned with fantastic old movie posters, some of them from her more obscure films.  Delightful!  All of the important stuff is in place - clean, nicely appointed, comfortable with recently remodeled bathroom.  (Small, but no smaller than any other typical NYC hotel room)  And my personal favorite?  Well, when you have your DND on the door the staff actually DOES NOT DISTURB you.  No tentative knock on the door from housekeeping just to make sure the DND isn't a mistake or to check if you want towels or something.  I don't know that I've EVER stayed at an American hotel where the staff actually understands the meaning of do not disturb.  Again, delightful!As for the staff - they are simply fabulous.  The inn has been run by the same two gentlemen for 26 years and they treat is as their home and you as a guest in their home.  Accommodating is a gross understatement when describing the team at the Pines - every person we met went out of their way to help us make the most of our trip to NYC.Oh, and last but certainly not least, Charlie Chaplin, the Inn Cat.  He is a warm, loving ball of fluff who will come right into your room with you to hang out (or sleep over) if you allow him to.I cannot recommend the Chelsea Pines Inn vigorously enough.  Simply put - stay here!",8,2,2
27,Jay M.,"New York, NY",25,142,1,5.0,3/21/2013,"New York's best kept secret! The staff is tremendous in terms of service and cleanliness and they are quite affordable. Be sure to ask for Restaurant recommendations, they know there stuff!Not a cat person but that charlie Chaplin is some character. I make sure my friends stay here when they visit.",3,,
28,Oscar M.,"New York, NY",27,5,0,4.0,3/3/2014,"The Chelsea Pines Inn was definitely a fantastic inn to stay in, the room was very comfortable and a reasonable size and was at a very nice location. My wife and I decided to choose this hotel based off its excellent reviews and I'm definitely glad that we did listen to those reviews because they were completely true. It really was a shining location in New York in which to stay at. As soon as we got to the hotel the staff were incredible. They were really helpful and exceptional at their jobs we were up to our room really soon and it was really easy to relax at the hotel. I love staying in New York and hotels like this one are definitely a huge part of why I do. New York is an awesome place to be and staying at a hotel that is easy to relax at is great.",,,
29,Horatio C.,"Glen Allen, VA",2,82,37,5.0,8/18/2010,"This place gets 5-stars.  No question.  We had the Sheree North room--I'm not sure what that was since my wife booked the room.   I think it was the middle level room.  The room was more spacious that I expected. The bathroom (sink&toilet) was separate from the shower which opened into the suite.  Not sure why it was built that way, but I suspect that the bathroom was so small that there would be no room for a shower door to open.   It actually works out well.The bathroom was small--when using the toilet, my toes touched the door. And I had to open the door before standing up or sitting down or else I would've hit my head.  Expect small bathrooms.  I can't remember the size of the bathroom in my last hotel, but I don't expect big anything in large cities where space is at a premium.  They had  a nice breakfast spread (bagels, doughnuts, coffee, sweet bread, cereal, juice).  It is very convenient to Subway.  Chelsea Pines' recommendation for restaurants were excellent--not a bad meal was had.Instead of flying to NYC, we took the train and this place is a couple of subway stops from penn station (or $6 or $7 cab if you have luggage).  We took a cab to chelsea pines inn, but subway when we left.  Very convenient for us.Another reason we selected this place is that my wife doesn't like being in tall buildings and doesn't like elevators.  So this place was perfect!",4,,
30,Lucy R.,Australia,0,1,0,5.0,7/26/2012,"My husband and I spend 5 days at the Chelsea Pines Inn in July for our ""2nd honeymoon"" and we have booked other hotels in varies areas in NYC , like lower east side and Brooklyn to experience the different ""boroughs"" of the Big Apple. But Chelsea Pines is definitely our favourite, we already decided have to stay there again when we are back next time visiting NYC! I did lots of research before booking the hotels, so read lots of good reviews about the hotel, and let me tell'ya , it didn't disappoint! The manager Jay and his staff : Troy, Jubel among others were just so friendly and helpful, they always went above and all to help us: finding restaurants, live performance, daily updates on what to do..we have visited 3 restaurants on their recommendations( they even provided you with a list and their reviews, which was really handy) , they are all superb - owner Jay is a serious foodie, so you are in good hands in finding the neighbourhood best eateries! The room is fun and funky, love the Hollywood stars deco throughout , very modern and clean , with lovely homey feel. It is like our home away from home, the kitchen is always with refreshments for you to refuel which is super handy. Breakfast is free and you can eat it in the lovely backyard, very relaxed way to start your day.Excellent location in Chelsea and Village area, convient to go everywhere , shopping , eating out, going out at night...It is our first time in NYC, we feel very safe in going out at night , even past midnight, obviously common sense is still needed as when you are overseas, but the whole city is very safe . Love everything about the hotel and the people , and Charlie the cat, oh how i got attached to the cat! Can't say enough about the hotel , you have to try it! We will definitely be back! xoxo",3,,

A great location to get to know New York, and the friendliest staff. Highly recommended! The continental breakfast buffet is perfect, including fresh berries and New York bagels. Plus there are free fruit and cookies 24/7. But what really makes this place a gem is the way the staff give inside tips about the city, and simply the way they treat you.The only drawback is that there is no elevator, and staying on the fifth floor (as I did) can be a bit hard on your legs.",2,,1
33,Dana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,41,6,4.0,5/20/2014,"My daughter and I stayed here in April when we were looking at colleges.  I love this place-the building itself, the staff, the breakfast, the location.  I loved it so much we just booked it for 4 nights in August.  The first time we stayed, we were on the 4th floor, with a window that actually opened-which is something you don't often find in hotels.  The bed was comfy, the bathroom larger than expected, and the breakfast was so much better than usual complimentary breakfasts.  There is always a pitcher of water and ice tea out as well.  This is the place to stay when you want to be near Greenwich Village and the Chelsea Market, not to mention Highline Park.",3,,

35,Dayna H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/31/2012,"I usually don't write Yelp reviews, but when a business is as lovely as this one, you have to. I stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn for a ""mental wellness"" vacation, and I had the time of my life. It's absolutely adorable, and it feels more like you're going home than into a hotel. It's right in the middle of everything...and even in the freezing winter wind, I was able to make it all around to all my favorite spots (NARS, marc jacobs, Chelsea Market, Diane Von Furstenburg, Sephora) within a few minutes. I even walked down Broadway and got my nails done. The staff is very friendly and you can tell it's genuine and not just because you're paying them to stay. They let me leave my bags at the hotel before check-in, and even after I checked OUT, so that I could easily navigate the city. I felt very safe and cozy here, and they offered free breakfast and the kitchen was full of cookies, milk, yogurt, fruit, tea, and coffee. I just booked another stay with them, and I'm bringing my friend from Sacramento. She has to experience this environment too. If you love kind and cozy...stay here. You'll leave feeling like a better person. xoxo",4,,2

37,James E.,"Seattle, WA",66,341,4,5.0,6/29/2011,"My partner and I wanted a vacation in New York for years, so I would research hotels in bedbugregistry.com because I have a deathly fear of bedbugs. By the time I researched a hotel that was deemed safe, the cost of our trip made me say ""eff this, let's go to Europe for the same price."" We decided to stop skipping New York and book a hotel. Exhausted searches led me to gay travel sites and tripadvisor.com where we found Chelsea Pines Inn. At the time of our reservation booking, this gay owned and operated bed & breakfast is ranked #6 in the city. We read nothing but rave reviews and bedbugregistry.com had nary a complaint about the building. ""Honey, we're going to New York."" I booked online and received a confirmation within 24 hours. We had no idea just how loved and adored this hotel is. A fellow hotel guest told us that this was his third stay, and it took him multiple tries to successfully reserve a room. A hotel staff member told us that a woman was unable to reserve room with the times she requested, so she re-arranged her entire vacation so she could book a room. After staying in the city for a week, in the Tab Hunter room of all things, we will never stay anywhere but Chelsea Pines Inn.The location is fantastic. The staff are wonderful. The room is incredibly comfortable, clean, and quiet. The hotel cat Charlie is adorable. The wine & cheese party was icing on the cake.",14,4,4
38,Diana M.,"Oneonta, NY",28,9,0,5.0,7/26/2012,"Great place to stay. As mentioned in other posts, the location, staff, and hotel itself are all amazing.We stayed in NYC for 2 days in celebration of my wife's birthday. When the staff found out that that was why we were there they sent up a dozen yellow roses and a birthday card...now that's service.Also, the Chelsea Pines is a great value. We went budget and stayed in their least expensive room ($200/night) and although small (which we don't mind) it was clean and well-planned. Also, the continental breakfast is the best I have ever had and in addition there is coffee, espresso, tea, and little snacks available all day. There is also free WiFi and a business room with several computers. This is a hell of a deal for Manhattan (or Brooklyn, for that matter).  Loved it! Will definitely stay there again!",1,,
39,Sarah Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,144,10,3.0,3/21/2013,"I felt a bit misled by all of the 5 star reviews on yelp, so wanted to give this an honest 3 star review. Pros - the staff is super friendly, the hotel is clean, the theme (old hollywood) is cute, location is great. Cons - I paid ~$300/night for a place that feels more like a youth hostel than a hotel. My room was on the 5th floor so I had to walk up 4 flights of stairs - not the end of the world, but would have been nice if they had mentioned this during the reservation. The bed was a double bed with a huge warp in it - you can't sleep in the middle or you'll roll off to one side. There is old carpeting, a tiny bathroom, and overall felt like a dorm room or hostel. The walls are thin so you can hear the TV in the next room.  Another pet peeve is the cleaning staff rearranged my stuff - they put notes / books/ etc that were on the bed stand into the top drawer, clothes that were on the floor into the closet, pushed together my things on the desk to fold up the desk. The only reason I noticed this was I remembered a piece of paper that was missing and started looking for it, then noticed the things in the drawer. It's disconcerting both to feel like someone is going through your stuff, and also to wonder if there are hidden things you're accidentally leaving behind when you check out. Again, really really nice owners and overall a fine experience (clean, safe, etc), but I was expecting something much nicer from the 4-5 star reviews on yelp.",9,1,1
40,Pauline L.,"San Jose, CA",369,299,67,5.0,12/19/2008,"Best hotel experience while traveling ever!  Al, one of the managers, accommodated the bf and I with a standard room immediately upon check-in.  Usually, check-in is at 3pm, but our reserved room wasn't ready.  He saw our exhausted faces (after a 6 hour red-eye flight) and upgraded us at no extra cost as soon as a spot was available.  GREAT SERVICE.The building decor is fun and reminiscent of old Hollywood glamor.  Every room is assigned an actress and decorated with posters in honor of the starlet.  Jay, one of the hotel owners, collected these posters since his father used to own a theater.  We had the Yvonne de Carlo ""dressing room"" (Lily from ""The Munsters""), which had its own shower and bathroom.  (Typically, most of the rooms share a communal bathroom on each floor).  The space was neat, charming with all of Yvonne's vintage movie posters, and had cable.  I got to watch Food Network and MTV each night!Free continental breakfast each morning in their kitchen with tables and a patio area, wonderful location right next to the A, C, E, and L subway lines, friendly front desk staff (they'll hold your luggage for you either prior to check-in or after check-out), and a cute Chelsea Morning newsletter each day detailing the weather and fun events in the neighborhood.  Reasonably-priced in the charming Chelsea neighborhood.  This was my first time visiting New York City and staying here only enhanced my wonderful experience.  Thanks Jay and Al!",4,1,3
41,jack s.,"Oakland, CA",2,37,0,4.0,6/1/2016,"i'm not quite sure why the chelsea pines inn is so highly rated (currently #2 on tripadvisor). it's nice enough- well located, decent continental breakfast, friendly staff, amusing movie theme decor, outdoor courtyard- but hardly the 2nd best hotel in nyc. our room was very small- to get to the other side of the bed i had to shimmy between the bed and the wall (avoiding a collision with the tv). the bathroom/shower setup is less than ideal due to limited space. there's no elevator and the stairs are pitched steeply- that grew tiresome quickly. all things considered, i thought the room was a bit overpriced. i rate the chelsea pines at 3.5 stars, but because the staff was so helpful i'll round up to 4.",,,1
42,Pat M.,"Boston, MA",9,6,0,5.0,9/3/2015,"Chelsea Pines Inn is the perfect place to stay in New York. Jay and his staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are nicely done and very well maintained. We stayed in the Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward room, which is really the Paul Newman room - no complaints from us! The location couldn't be better - we walked to the Whitney Museum, the High Line, Chelsea Market and the West Village, and every place else we wanted to go was easily accessible from the subway station at the end of the block. They serve a wonderful breakfast offering lots of choices and eating in the private, lush garden was delightful.",,,

44,damian a.,"Rochester, MI",100,74,0,4.0,1/8/2010,"I was scrambling a week before christmas to find a place to stay from 12/26 to 1/2.  After passing over countless places wanting as much as 1000.00 per night, I stumbled across this place.  239.00 per night.  That right there is worth three stars.The location is perfect.  It is right on the corner of 14th and 8, which is about 50 steps away from the ACE and the L lines.  Great for getting just about anywhere.The staff was awesome and helpful.  From the moment we walked in from the rain after a delayed flight and i was greeted by name until the minute we left, they were accomodating.  They were always eager to provide suggestions, look stuff up, make reservations, call cars, offer umbrellas, etc.  When we decided to try to see if they had availability on the 31st and the 1st (I sprung this on them at around 1 am on the night of the 30th, which was to be our last night), they said they promised to see what they can do.  they called early the next morning to offer us the same room for two more nights at the same rate of 239.00.  That was pretty cool.They have a cat named charlie chaplin that my wife made the mistake of letting in our room one night.  She (the cat) seemed really appreciative.  Around 4am i woke up to it mounting my leg and biting the comforter.  We had to kick her out.  She meowed a bit outside our door and then someone else took her in.The room was small, of course, but clean and comfortable.The inn can be a little loud at times.  There are no elevators and the steps are loud.  The rooms are tight and the radiators make sounds that i don't understand.  It's tolerable though.  The next time we're in new york i probably won't even bother looking for another place.  We'll just stay here again for sure.",5,2,3

We were exhausted but were rejuvenated from the moment we arrived because the staff was so warm and attentive. It felt like we were staying with our best friends! We travel a lot and my very picky husband said this this Inn was definitely memorable and whenever we go to NY again, this will be home for us. The place is so charming and clean! The breakfast that was included was exceptional for such a small place but EVERYONE who works there was unforgettable. Not to mention the location was great, subways nearby, Chelsea market and many cutes store and retaurants. If you're not looking for an enormous fancy hotel, trust me, don't even bother looking anywhere else. Just book this place immediately!",2,,

I was greeted warmly by their staff, and shown promptly to my room. The place itself is very cozy, not a five star hotel by any means but what they lack in amenities, they make up for with there exceptional staff and breakfast. ( especvially that espresso machine) It was like having a personal barista. The place is well staffed with knowledgeable folks who cater to every need especially Rumel. who helped make my stay extremely comfortable. Now that i live in New York, this place is my go to recommendation for friends coming from out of town",,,
47,Pamela K.,"Salem, MA",8,32,3,5.0,7/27/2010,"Just go.  We were there for a steamy city weekend, and could not have been happier.  Really.  Where to begin?  The room was wonderful -- more spacious than I had expected, immaculate, and very comfy bed.  We had the Albert Finney room on the first floor, which meant I could pad out for coffee undetected in my jammies.  Lovely.  They have a sweet garden out the back, shady and beautiful, The location was great, we'd never stayed in Chelsea before and loved loved it.  Fun shopping and noshing in Chelsea Market, great restaurants and bars for the young and gorgeous see and be seen crowd (we were not worthy but had lots of fun) and there was a street fair the day we were there, steps away.  Clearly, somebody knew we were coming.The staff.  So lovely, so welcoming, so attentive, so helpful.  Forgive me for not remembering everybody's names.  But Troy, I'm pining for you, darling.  Sending BCN photos for you soonest.  See you in August....  XOSo go.  JUST GO!",1,,

Most of the time I'm in NYC, I stay with friends, but my last visit was the first time at a hotel. Both the wonderful facilities and friendly staff made me feel like I was staying with friends. Full size room and bathroom with a/c, cable, business center, friendly cat, nearby MTA stop and continental breakfast. I had a room facing the backyard, so other than when it was recess at the preschool on the other side of the fence, it was blissfully quiet.  The one caveat is that if you don't like climbing stairs, this may not be a good fit and there's no elevator. But between climbing up and down to my room on the 4th floor and walking all over the city, I was able to burn off all the calories from the great meals I had on this visit.  Highly recommended and a great value in terms of both cost and service. If I don't stay with friends/relatives on my next visit back to NYC, this is definitely where I'll be staying.",4,,2
