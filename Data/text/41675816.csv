Updated review","OMG, new love...Macaron Ice Cream Sandwiches!! Popped in with a friend after lunch to browse. Came across the mini fridge filled with ice cream sandwiches and mini ice cream macarons. Had to try. The Pistachio and Chocolate ones rock! Dare I say more than the regular macarons. Hey, it's summer and 89 degrees, this hits the spot! Dragged two more friends to here an hour after (two visits in one day)! We all loved the texture. The macarons didn't break or crack after one bite. And the ice cream was delicious. The Pistachio had pistachio ice cream inside and the chocolate had chocolate ice cream. So there was no guessing what flavors were each. They also sell Strawberry and Espresso... Maybe I'll return next week to try those. Don't be shocked by the price... It's more than the cost of an ice cream cone but like the cost of an average milkshake. FYI. But totally worth it. As of now, my favorite was the pistachio.",11,6,10
1,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,1.0,7/17/2018,"One star is the best they could do. I really wasn't expecting myself to regret eating macarons. They were $2.75 each and $7.50 for 3. I picked mixed berry, creme brulee and nutella. They made me feel nauseous. Mixed berry - AVOID!!! The filling was so BITTER!!! I don't know if the macaron went bad?? Is that even possible? Creme brulee - Really should be called BUTTERED POPCORN. The shell was hard, stale, chewy and the filling tasted like a tablespoon of straight butter. It left a nasty filmy after taste. Yuck. Nutella - Now how on Earth do you go wrong with this. It completely lacked the hazelnut kick you get with Nutella. I would not recommend at all.",1,,
2,Ceylan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",183,174,1433,1.0,7/5/2018,"I'm basing this review on the customer service only and my croissant.  For starters, the customer service was abominable.  I place a simple order of a croissant w/ cheese and egg.  Not only does it take an infinity amount of years to prepare a simple order, but they forget the cheese.  No apology and it comes back burnt and shriveled.  The cashier not only does not apologize, but when I just wait around for my food she rudely stated, ""You have to wait ok."" Uh yeah wtf does it look like I've been doing? I never open my mouth to complained.  Not once did she acknowledge that I was waiting and kept talking and talking with another customer.  Multitasking is non-existent.Ok and the croissant was super tiny.  I've had similar food in France, but at least the service was impeccable to match the prices.  Here I feel like I was lured with pretty bait in the window.  No french cafe music, the service is similar to what you would pay for at a cheap taco stand or barrio.  Come on guys this is midtown.  I just fucking saw a cockroach or some bug.  Disgusting.  Never going back.",4,3,3
3,Sunny C.,"Lynbrook, NY",1364,368,1524,4.0,10/3/2018,"This is the prettiest Macaron Cafe location i've been to! So spacious!There's a giant tree in the center of the cafe. There are couches and tables enough to fit a ton of people. $15 for a box of 6 macarons. They're very sweet. I really enjoyed the espresso and rose-lychee ones. The espresso one is very flavorful and the rose-lychee one is such a great texture. I could eat those endlessly. I agree with some of the reviews, the customer service here isn't great, but oh well. The decorations and food definitely make up for it!",26,11,21

I love that it's conveniently located near Midtown East so I don't have to go all the way to Laduree (near Hunter College).I got a box of 12 for $29 to gift for my visiting coworker. I love that they have so many flavors. I've tried them before and don't think it's too sweet and they're always fresh. PS. After 5:30pm, leftover sandwiches or salads are 50% off.

7,Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",70,499,547,4.0,6/4/2018,"Breakfast, Lunch, Juice.  That's what you can get here in addition (of course) to some exceptional macarons!A colleague and I were looking for a place to eat lunch after a Saturday morning conference.  We had been staying at the Vanderbilt YMCA, and decide to walk down 3rd avenue and up towards Grand Central in search of a place to eat.We didn't have to go very far!Macaron Cafe has a location right on 3rd avenue near 47th.  It was close, open, and not too many people were crowding inside.  We took a look at the menu outside, and decided this would suit our needs.Inside, we looked at a number of salads and such in the display case.  I immediately decided on a Nicoise Salad, and my co-worker (who typically makes it a point of not eating what her companion eats) settled on the same. She ordered a mix of lemonade/iced tea, and I had an iced latte.  Both of which were pleasantly satisfying.  But the Nicoise salad... we ate in and it was brought out on a large place looking divine.  Plenty of tuna a few sardines thrown on for good measure. olives. cherry tomatoes. a perfectly blended vinaigrette. AH! So good.  Just thinking about it now, makes me want to go back and have more.We sat by the window to be able to take in the whole NYC experience. Complete with walkers-by awkwardly making eye-contact with you.  Admittedly, the counter by the window was warm, and I was sweating just a little bit.  I imagine the seating in the back was probably more comfortable.  I really enjoyed my time just sitting here chatting.  There weren't a lot of customers, so we probably overstayed our welcome. After a while, I decided to order a small box of macarons.  My friend didn't really want something sweet, but I twisted her arm a bit and made her try one.  She went with the coconut, and was pleasantly surprised.  I started with the pistachio which the girl at the counter suggested.  And it was fantastic.  Honestly, the best macaron I've probably had ever.  Not that I'm a connoisseur or anything...but I liked the thickness, the subtle chewiness and soft creme in the middle. YUM.  I also tasted the honey lavender which was also quite heavenly.  The other three (matcha tea - thumbs down, salted caramel - yum, and espresso - good but too sweet) I saved for later as a midnight snack.This is the kind of place I would come to and grab a snack and study if I lived in the city or worked nearby.  It's cute.  The Nicoise salad... so so good.  The macarons. All-around positive experience.",,,

She had just said something nasty to a customer ahead of me and I thought ""Well, he probably was rude to her"". WRONG.I ordered a large mocha, which she prepared right then and there while I was waiting to be charged for it. She handed me a small MOCHA, that TASTED LIKE a LATTE. Since I noticed that her main language is Spanish and mine is too, I tried to avoid the embarrassment for the other people waiting behind me and told her (In Spanish) that I ordered a large mocha, not a small latte... She didn't take that well... She replied (In English) saying that I had asked for a small mocha and that it tasted like a mocha, that I needed to add sugar myself if I wanted it sweeter... And that there was ""PLENTY OF SUGAR ON THE TABLES""I offered her to pay the extra difference for the large mocha, it was really not a problem for me. She then went back for about 5 seconds and gave me a bigger cup with extra milk... Still tasting like a latte.I'm no expert making mochas, I just know how they taste and I think I WAS RIPPED OFF.DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK.",,,
10,JJ G.,"New York, NY",60,78,190,4.0,10/9/2018,I love the chocolate ice cream macaron sandwich! It's creamy and not overly sweet. Perfectly made texture for both macaron and the ice cream. I took one star only because O think $6 for the size is a little pricey.,,,
11,Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",233,534,1855,5.0,4/29/2018,"Macaron is located right next to my office building, making it the most convenient coffee stop ever. I'd probably go just for this reason, even if it wasn't great food and coffee.. but it is! They do really nice espresso and espresso-based drinks. Their other coffee products aren't quite as good, but you can't be great at everything :) They have tons of macaron flavors. I definitely like some more than others, but I think that's too be expected with that many options. I find the basics--pistachio, caramel, vanilla, espresso--to be fantastic. They also have gluten free chocolate chip cookies and other greats. Their salads are fantastic. The kale salad, the chicken salad.. so good. Just try them. It's so nice that they often have little samples of macarons available. It's a good way to try one of their bazillion flavors. I like that they have loyalty punch cards for both food and drink. I've had a couple of tiny service issues, where they're a bit disorganized or confused, but everyone is friendly and helpful and NICE, and that matters so much. I'll keep coming back :)",,,

14,Tayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",162,107,435,4.0,3/27/2018,"I was gifted macaroons from the Macaron Cafe twice now and can actually review! The macaroons here definitely are better consumed fresh. If not, and they are to be refrigerated, then thawing is 100% necessary for the best flavor. These aren't the best I've had but the variety is nice. I'm currently chewing on Strawberry but see my photo for the others. They are a bit more ""stuffed"" than I'd like however they can still satisfy a macaroon craving. I'll surely keep accepting them if my bf keeps bringing them home but again - macaroon experts can pass on this spot and macaroon newbies this is juuust a midpoint to the trueeee experience. Enjoy!",,,

They also have a punch card that gives you a free drink of any size after a certain amount of purchases. The space is also really cute and good for meetings. I've never had their food, so don't feel like I can give 5 stars until I try.",,,
17,Kristin A.,"Hoboken, NJ",158,24,4,4.0,8/17/2018,"I frequent Macaron for lunch since it's nearby my office.  In the last 5 years, their atmosphere and menu hasn't changed much although they did add some new avocado toast dishes.  It's a cute, cozy cafe that's good for a lunch bite or coffee.  While the service can be extremely slow, their food is tasty. My go to dishes are the Spinach & Chicken salad with goat cheese and the Deviled Egg Kale salad.   I've also tried their Avocado Toast with Ricotta cheese - the only suggestion with that is that the bread is very thick and crispy, sometimes difficult to eat but it is still delicious and filling. The portions feel bigger when you dine in vs. take away but if you need to get back to work, it's easy to grab and go. They have a different weekly special each day  - Friday's vegetable lasagna is yummy.  Definitely would recommend if you need a casual lunch spot in the midtown east area.",,,

A lot of folks just come here for the macarons but I would like to give a shout out to their food options because they are absolutely delicious. I tried the shrimp salad today and it was SO GOOD. I had no idea why my boss raved so much about this place until today. Their salads are on the pricey slide (e.g. $11.25) but at least it comes with protein!,2,1,1

It tiny and crammed but the sparkly festive decorations definitely lifted our spirits, although I am not sure if the vibe is as jolly when it s not christmas-time.The Pistachio macaron was mind blowing and so was the flourless chocolate chip cookie. The coffee tasted great and overall we had a great time.Its one of those boutique coffee places near my place and is a definite respite from the usual chain- Starbucks where I end up going to as a force of habit! I hope they open at more locations.",1,,1

For $12.50, you get a nice salad with dijonaise dressing, a slab of nicely browned whipped potato, and 3 teaspoons of shredded duck meat hidden UNDER the whipped potato. It's bullshit. Duck confit my ass. They hide the duck under the whipped potato so you won't immediately see how little duck you're getting for your $12.50.Doubtful, and hoping my negative experience with their ""duck confit"" was just a one-time occurrence, I ordered it a second time a week later, and a third time two weeks later. Both were the same as the first - a mere 3 teaspoons of shredded duck meat hidden under a slab browned whipped potato, and a salad with dijonaise dressing on the side. Three teaspoons of shredded duck meat. Yeesh.",,,

Loved the layout of all their macarons and was really interested by their food options as well. Once I finally made up my mind, I was quickly served. I ordered a box of 6 macarons for $15. It seems pricey but (1) you're in NYC and (2) these macarons are HUGE! The flavors are bought were earl grey, matcha tea, Nutella, peanut butter cup, rose lychee, and espresso. Also appreciated that you could pick out what color ribbon you wanted the box wrapped in since I bought them as a gift.",,,

29,June S.,"New York, NY",189,552,4070,3.0,3/1/2016,"I have been to a few of their locations. At this location, the interior is designed without much consideration to their entrance door. The space between the door to the counter where the macarons are displayed is really small. There is just enough space to go inside, making it difficult to walk around the counter when people are coming and going.We were there for macarons and macarons only. so we walked around the counter and chose some flavors. While we were doing that, a couple with a baby stroller came in, with some difficulty. They wanted to get to the tables and chairs on the side, and while they move from the door to the table, no one else could be around there...A male staff at the counter got our macaron order wrong, so we had to get a female staff to swap them out with correct ones. The guy did NOT admit that he got the order wrong, but instead, made it sounds like we ordered them wrong. Seriously???  I really like the fact that they are larger than normal macarons out there, and they are made in NYC, gluten free, kosher certified. I will be going back to one of their locations again in the near future, maybe when they get some Spring flavors out.",3,1,1

Much better than Laduree in my opinion. Their food, coffee and drinks are also great. I miss the adorable French maid frilly uniforms ( apron and pink hats) they had back in 2010. Their staff could be more friendly and enthusiastic about the place. Miss when they hired French workers. Was great to converse with them. Overall best macarons in NYC!",,,
31,Christel M.,"West Bronx, NY",136,84,75,3.0,3/28/2017,"Went here for client breakfast on a Tuesday morning. We grabbed a table in the back- the place was not packed so there was enough space for the three of us without having to feel cramped. The environment is very trendy. They play soft & low music and have some great pictures throughout the restaurant. The breakfast menu is very limited but the quality was great! I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant in addition to some tea. The tea options are very extensive and tasted amazing. The service was somewhat slow we waited about 10 minutes to get our order taken; once taken it came out immediately-- we had to ask for the check three times before it was brought to us. In addition we were charged for the wrong items which caused a little confusion Overall this is a decent breakfast/lunch place when you're not in a rush.

I'm partial to their french onion soup (cheesy, onion-y, and served with perfectly crisped-up croutons) as a pick-me-up on days when I'm feeling a little under the weather. With that said, the last time I was in, I got a croque monsieur in addition to my french onion soup, and was thoroughly unimpressed -- the ham was dry, the bread soggy, and the overall meal was lackluster.In future, I'll probably stick to my french onion soup.",1,1,1

36,Dana R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,6,2.0,2/14/2018,"Macarons are very hit or miss. Sometimes the macarons are hard, as though they are stale or were cooked improperly. Other times they are light and airy. Unfortunately they have been leaning towards chewy and stale recently. I just got a sampler of 6 and all but one were chewy. I'm used to the inconsistency but thought they would be fresher and more reliable given the demand on Valentine's Day. I was wrong. Very disappointed. Sandwich bread is also hit or miss. Yes, baguettes should be chewy but sometimes you get a sandwich that could chip your tooth.

Five hours later we wentt back because their salad menu had looked interesting. I had the farm salad - best salad I have ever had, and my granddaughter had the chicken sandwich. Scrumptuous.

Updated review","Stopped in for a visit, and confirmed them to be my favorite macaron place in the city.  Nice and attractive staff, everything nicely displayed, quiet, though a semi cramped feel to the quaint space.I've now, to date, made my way through 12 of the flavors.  Can't give five stars, as I only truly enjoyed (as in would order over and over again) about 1/2 of their flavor executions.  But I can say that the quality was equal across the board, regardless of how each flavor hits your palate.  I am actually quite excited to enjoy a sit down here in the near future.Got yo' macaron on here, y'all!",,,
43,Richard K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,163,0,5.0,9/5/2017,Good lunch spot with a selection of French salads (e.g. nicoise) and sandwiches - reasonably priced and relatively quiet at lunch. Can't speak for the macarons but they look good too.,1,,

45,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,4.0,5/23/2016,"Macaron Cafe serves delicious French cookies in a rainbow of colors. It also is home to an adorable, cozy, pink bistro with a ridiculously affordable lunch menu and sit down service. I picked Macaron Cafe for a lunch with a coworker - it had to be sit down waiter service, relatively quiet, and also affordable. Luckily, we were both ladies - the place is so outrageously pink, it's a turn off for most men. If you want table service, go ahead and sit at any available table. Waitstaff will come to you with a menu. I definitely recommend showing up before 12:30 pm though, as tables are first come first served. If you want to go order, line up at the counter, straight ahead after you enter the door. Service is okay - at lunch rush it was difficult to flag down a person to ask for a check or add something to your order. However, our water glasses were always full and they clear tables quickly, so the bussing service is tops. The cafe layout is also pretty tight - if you're a larger person, coming in a wheelchair or stroller, or claustrophobic, this may not be a good fit for you. Seating probably fits 30, but a third of the seats are at high top bar seats or the window counter. The slow service and the layout are the major reasons why I can't give 5 stars. The menu is small but full of healthy items like salads, sandwiches, and soups. I really enjoyed my chicken and spinach salad, which was big enough to sate my appetite and has thoughtful ingredients and plating. Quality was excellent. My coworker had a sandwich that looked delish and was a good size. We also ordered a couple of cookies, which are so very tasty and sugary. I had the earl grey and I think she had chocolate. All together, the bill was under $30 without tip, which I consider super cheap for a healthy and filling Midtown lunch.",,,
46,Sarah D.,"Wauwatosa, Milwaukee, WI",271,98,69,4.0,7/7/2017,We dropped in for a drink and saw the selection of macaroons also.

It was quick, but I'm pretty sure the woman assisting me didn't even look at me and seemed like she would rather be any where else. May have just been an off day, but there was no one else in the cafe at the time so I felt like service could have been a little more attentive. We tried the pb&j, peanut butter cup, and chai macarons. The pb&j wasn't anything special. The chai was very nice though and had great flavor. The cookies were tender and light and just as a macaron should be, I just wasn't impressed with the fillings (with the exception of the chai)",,,

I was hoping this would be a made-to-order type of juice. Nonetheless, it was still good. My brother ordered tea and it had a wonderful aroma, it was equally delicious and he really enjoyed it.Prices are fair. I think it was $2.50 per macaroon and they have a big selection.",3,1,

It would have been really good if it hadn't been for the bread! The bread was stale or something. It was falling apart in my hands, crumbling to pieces!! My crab sandwich was no longer a sandwich. It was a heaping pile amid large slices of mango that made the whole experience disappointing. Then I went to go take a sip of iced coffee and the lid didn't fit correctly so it leaked out all over my new shirt. If this had happened before the interview I would have been SO UPSET!

I'm just gonna have to return to this place to try them all over again since I screwed it up the first time.  Plus, as much as I wanted to buy more (with somewhere over 20 flavors to choose from), I had already purchased macarons from 2 other places in NYC and was feeling a bit gluttonous.  I will just have to go back, that's all.",1,1,1

Their sandwiches and salads options are plentiful and rival the creativity of Wichcraft. Some of the highlights include a vegetarian sandwich loaded with avocado, cherry tomatoes, egg, and french mayo.  Featured specials include a vermicelli pasta lunch accompanied with chicken and pine nuts for just under $10.  It is definitely worth a try. The store space is a bit cramped even if you are lucky to score one of two tables for a sit-down lunch.  Comfort is definitely not the word to use.  That being said, options are always welcomed to an abysmal area as far as lunch options go.

I could stop here almost every morning"" That quickly changed. I hopped in line and there was one person ahead of me. The girl taking the orders was more interested in her phone than interacting with her customer and keeping the line moving. It's finally my turn and I can clearly see she's on WhatsApp chatting with friends because she's laughing to herself and then finally she looks up to take my order. I order one ice coffee. Mind you there's only one other person in front of me. I'm waiting, waiting. I look over at the girl who's supposed to just be pouring the coffee and she's standing there drinking a coffee herself and eating! How disgusting. I can understand the drinking part who cares about that but she's eating over my open cup of coffee. Gross. When she decides to finish eating and actually adds the milk and put the lid on my coffee I was like ""ugh- gotta get out of here"" Lady at the counter has a customer staring at her waiting to order (now the line is long) and she's just scrolling thru her phone. I wouldn't say something if it wasn't true or wasn't a big deal. If I owned this cafe I would be furious at my employees for acting this way, especially during a morning rush.

The check station in the middle, you order to-go's on one side and the rest of the 3 sides surrounding the check station (& macaron displays) are seatings for eating in.  Aside from the sweets they have salads and sandwiches for lunch, and I go with the Norwegian sandwich, which is a salmon sandwich ($9.75).  I also see 3 flavors of macarons that sound good - chocolate marshmellow, coconut, and caramel butter - so I order them also.  It starts pouring rain, so I decide instead to eat in.  The girls quickly prepare a table for me and bring the sandwich over.  The Norwegian is fantastic - ample amount of fresh raw salmon fillets, veggies, and cheese - and the baguette surrounding it is soooo good!  In retrospect I should have checked to see if they sold this baguette separately...  I got back to the office and tried the caramel butter macarons, and it... is... divine...  I'm not a huge macaron fan because they tend to taste pretty similar and are too sweet.  But this has a very distinct caramel and butter flavor and it just melts in your mouth.  And it's not too sweet, which is a winner.  I haven't tried the other two but will soon.I may have to take some of these back to the west coast, I'm so over Bottega Louis' mediocre macarons.Table-for-1 Factor:  They have a counter on one side that's pretty much designed for single patrons.  I sat at a table by myself and felt no stranger for it.  But, you really want to come here with your girlfriends for an afternoon tea or light lunch.",2,1,2

It had way too much shell, not just a single bite faux pas...but an entire half of the sandwich. Needless to say, I was turned off from the restaurant for quite sometime...Recently I purchased a few macarons to give as a small gift, followed by buying the in-store freezer package they sell at Fairway Markets--both exceeded expectations. Of their flavors my favorite was dark chocolate, macha green tea, and creme brulee.

Not only do they carry different flavors of macarons that tasted pretty good, they also have hot drinks, sandwiches and salad, champagne and wine, and also breakfast items. Oh, and it has a lot of seats for those that want to give their legs a rest and enjoy some sweets. My favorite here so far is the Pumpkin Cinnamon; they have a lot of different exotic flavors but having it all in one sitting would be pushing it. Therefore I plan to revisit and give their hot beverages a go. It's a cute little pink shop to grab something and sit for hours just talking. The staff are extremely polite which is always a plus.

I typically love macarons but honestly these were inedible except for the chocolate one and the peanut butter and jelly one. The lavender one and the rose lychee were seriously disgusting I threw them out. Pistachio didn't taste at all like real pistachio. They were all oddly shiny, which I've never seen in any of the amazing macarons I've had before. They were so heavily perfumed it took me hours to get the taste out of my mouth.

I usually selected new flavors every time, but pistachio, wedding almond, nutella, and chocolate were among our favorites. They also offer seasonal flavors, which I highly recommend.

Updated review","It was a cold, snowy day in Midtown Manhattan and I was in serious need of some sustenance to get me through another brutal work day. On my lunch hour I strolled down to Pret A Manger with the intention of picking up a diet-friendly soup when I made a great game-time decision to keep walking the extra block down to Macaron Cafe. I've loved MC ever since I had my first Nicoise Salad there last summer, but today they gave me another reason: the Croque Monsieur (see photo). This was the most amazing sandwich I've had in a while, with crispy/melty gruyere cheese on top, delicious ham and savory bechamel sauce on  Pullmans toast. Both texture and flavor were out of this world--worth every calorie! It took every ounce of self control to resist  getting a macaroon for dessert while I sipped my coffee, but if you're in the mood to indulge I highly recommend the PB&J macaroon!",2,1,1

They have delicious coffee (although slightly overpriced), free unlimited wifi, and the space is super cute (and girly).The champagne is not a regular occurrence - it was one of the girls' birthdays - but it does speak to how wonderful the staff is there. Super friendly, attentive, etc. Loved it.The only reason why I can't give five stars is that their macarons are good but not the best. Some of the flavors are a little too intense to the point where some of them seem a bit unnatural (especially the lavender, green tea, and rose lychee).",2,,2

Updated review","Came back here twice after my first try to get both their lunches and to try other macaron flavor.  Creme brulee, dark chocolate and honey lavender all really good.  And somehow both times they are not stale and tasted really soft and creamy, maybe the owner read the yelp review and finally worked on improving the quality?Today I gotthe salmon quiche friday special and it is so good!! The portion size is just right for me.  I also got 8 pc macarons with their gift box and I must say the box is so cute I will prob keep it :)",,,

I popped into the Macaron cafe today while out running errands for my job (I guess that's what I get for trying to sneak in some 'me' time whilst on the clock.) I've been on a macaron kick so i figured I'd turn it into a mission to find the best macarons in the city rather than me just shoving a bunch of three dollar cookies down my throat. Anyway I came here and was insanely excited by a display full of beautiful macarons with more flavor choices than I could handle. I got the box of 12 for $27 which was a rather good price to me seeing as though I paid around $25 for 9 over at Dominique Ansel (the bakery that is, so far, #1 on the list.) None of them blew my mind or were worth mentioning, some were actually quite gross (Lavender Honey, Rose Lychee, and Vanilla all tasted like Victoria's Secret Moisturizer) and the best part is that they were ROCK HARD! I'm literally getting angry as I form this review. I waited all day to indulge in what was supposed to be an amazing treat but all I got instead was disappointment and a toothache! How dare you have the audacity to have the word 'macaron' in your name and can't deliver a, not even exceptional, but decent, edible cookie?! I've been duped! If I closed my eyes I would swear I was chewing on a plastic of some sort. I'm highly disappointed. So disappointed, in fact, that I will be calling first thing tomorrow morning to express to the management how hurt I was that they sold me leather dipped in food coloring.I hope I'm able to spare some of you the same heartache that I've ha to endure.

The last salad I tried was the spinach/chicken- I don't know how they made this salad so dry! And the dressing was greasy and unpleasant.

Good food will only get you so far, with service like this and an unwillingness to accommodate customers who arrived at 5:47pm, and had to call from outside to get your attention while you tried to ignore them through the window - I would rather go without.

The coffee was supurb as well - excellent flavor!They also have sandwiches and stuff, but we stopped in during the mid afternoon and had already eaten so we didn't try those. The service was - ok.  They need to have a better system of how to assist people.  If more than 2 people were trying to buy macarons or coffee they quickly got overwhelmed.  It's not clear where you need to stand to order, or if you can sit down and order lunch from a table, or if you order at the counter and sit down.  Signs needed!!!!  (it would save the poor staff a lot of frustration)Will definitely be back for my macaron fix.",,,

A little cool to the touch but sweet, not too sweet with a fudge like quality. The outside if soft cake... never had a macaron before but I could get used to these. My issues with this place? The macarons are just expensive. I got 12 for $27. According to my rudimentary math skills that's $2.25 each. These things are delicious and tasty but $2.25 each? Really on the pricey side.

I have never had one before, and I just HAD to get one when I was in New York for vacation.My sister and I got a box of 8 for $20. I got a variety of macarons to try and was eager because of all the colorfulness. The first one I tried was vanilla and I absolutely loved it. Earl grey was my next one. But then when it came down to rose lychee, honey & lavender, etc., it was not my cup of tea. It was too much of the scent and not enough of the taste. It's like I sprayed perfume into my mouth. I'm sticking to the flavors I know next time.",,,
116,Joanna H.,"New York, NY",195,225,268,4.0,3/25/2013,I'm not the biggest macaroon fan and therefore can get picky with the level of the sweetness. This place was so tiny but so adorable. The different colors from the variety of macaroon flavors is beautiful. Haven't seen so many flavors in one display case! 3girls got 6different flavors and killed it all.I wasn't a fan of the Rose. but I loved the nutella and Pistachio. My friend who got the earl grey tea? said it was very unique-more fresh and a different scent to it. She loved the tea. The Americano I got was dark and rich. I loved their americano. I would even come back here just for this. I think Macaron Cafe is a great place to bring your friends whether or not they love macaroons. Noobies will love it. Lovers will love it (hopefully). I can't wait to visit NY again and try more new flavors! and the americano again :),,,

I've tried quite a few flavors... the cassis, green tea, the rose flavored ones, the citrus-tart/tropical ones. Sometimes you can't taste anything beyond sugar and almond flour. Sometimes they're fresh. Sometimes they're soggy.... and once after a really stressful week a work, I bought a whole box and ate 4 in a row..and bounced off the walls before falling into a naseous self loathing funk) For midtown east lunchers and procrastinators in need of a last minute gift, this is a decent addition.My favorite is Bisou Ciao (to seriously eat) & Laduree (to impress as a gift to those impressed by labels).",,1,

Nothing special and nothing really worth talking about. Now as for the hot chocolate..............TERRIBLE! It was so bitter and left a horrible aftertaste. I didn't want to waste it so I tried adding two packets of sugar but it did nothing for the taste. On a positive note the interior is adorable. They also serve food which I haven't tried yet.

Recently the cafe has been getting very busy at lunch, but it's always pretty empty in the evenings.The macarons are refrigerated, so it is a good idea to wait a while before eating them so they can soften up a bit. As far as texture goes, this is exactly how I like my macarons -- a shiny, crispy layer on the outside, chewy goodness on the inside. Many seem too sugary, but it depends on the flavor; some are definitely better than others.As far as flavors go, some are definitely better than others. Here's what I've tried so far, in order from best to worst (expect updates):White Chocolate Peppermint -- Delicious! If you like peppermint and this flavor is available, definitely try it. You can really taste the white chocolate in the creamy filling.Chestnut -- Good. Not too sweet. Adequate chestnut flavor.Pistachio -- Good, creamy... but somehow reminds me of Fruit Loops.Earl Grey -- Also reminds me of Fruit Loops, but with a hint of Earl Grey in the filling.Raspberry -- Very flavorful, probably partially because the filling is preserves instead of cream-based, which is also the reason it's not one of my top favorites.Creme brulee -- Very sweet. At first I didn't really like it, but the filling is so creamy and decadent, it won me over in the end. Pumpkin -- Meh. Again, too sweet -- the sweetness overpowered the pumpkin flavor, which was too light.There is a pretty good food menu as well--mostly sandwiches and salads:Quiche au saumon -- This is a Friday special. So delicious! it's going to be my regular order whenever I'm here for lunch on a Friday. It comes with a small portion of salad on the side, which is also very good. Nutella crepe -- Eew. Don't get this! Both the crepe itself and the filling were hard, and it smelled disgustingly buttery. Blech! Never again!As far as drinks go, I've heard good things about the espresso and coffee, but I've only tried the hot chocolate. It was milky and smooth--dark chocolate, not sweetened.

Sad part: I received the valentine's day 20 pieces of macaroons.  I have always been a big supporter of Macaroon Café and even go out of my way to order through you vs. Laduree. I like to buck trends.Unfortunately the macaroons were stale and flavorless. This is my second experience like this and I am so saddened by it because I have fond memories, my fiance and I. To receive such bad quality on valentine's day which was meant to bring happiness now only brings frustration and irritation.Happy part:After I submit my issue via the customer information general e-mail box, I was delightfully surprised by how fast a response I got. Cecile attempted to trouble shot my macaroons and I suggested perhaps an exchange for new macaroons from their local location she was more than willing to oblige free of charge. I went to the store and was greeted with a warm smile by a lovely worker there who knew I was coming.  We went macaroon row by row to find just the right ones as we ideally chatted about my day like we were long lost friends. She was gracious, informative and kind. But the best part was when I took a bight and the flavors of the fresh macaroons burst into my mouth like a rainbow of colors and simple delights. Ah, the heaven that comes with a perfectly done macaroon can not be described, it is art and beauty wrapped into one.I have been to all of the stores but I will keep coming back to this one as i it is not only conveniently close to my work ( only 7 blocks away) but also the customer service was impeccable!Thanks MC for saving my Valentines day!",,,

However when I went to taste one it was hard as a rock. I thought perhaps they may have been frozen because they had been refrigerated so I placed them In my refrigerator hoping that they would maybe become softer.

139,Edna C.,"New York, NY",129,372,137,5.0,8/20/2012,"This place is still sorta new...not many people know about this location nor venture here outside of work hours...so its my little secret. I can walk here to grab a few macarons, then bubble tea the next block over, and that would make for a wonderful Friday. Its larger than the other locations, and its beautifully decorated. Seemed to have less macaron options though, but they all tasted amazing nonetheless. None of mine were stale or hard. I definetly want to try their sandwiches....they sound so amazing. Im so excited for this location, because I live so close to it. Bummer is $14 for 6 macarons...good taste does not come cheap.",1,,1

Updated review","Still some delays in service, but the place has gotten much better. Most of the staff is friendly and that brings a smile to a customer's face. Presentations are lovely and the hot chocolate is delicious. Of course, they're known for their Macarons which are delicious. So many flavors! Be sure to try the cassis.",,,
141,Vanessa M.,"Long Island City, NY",8,84,20,4.0,3/21/2013,went for macaron day and the line wasnt too bad and they kept everything moving smoothly. ended up getting the dark chocolate macaron which was delicious! i wasnt aware until after i got it that there are all these funky flavors. wish the girl wouldve told me!,,,
142,Max R.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",2,41,0,4.0,7/26/2013,"Yes the macaroons are great, but so is their coffee, tea (exotic), as well as lunch (wine and stuffed peppers on Wednesdays). Yum! Not to mention the cute French girls who told me about the French history behind the Macaron Cofe.",,,
143,Aeg S.,"New York, NY",0,104,1,2.0,7/5/2012,"Bad and expensive macarons.  They keep them refrigerated in a display case, so the filling is a bit hard when you get them.  You don't get that great, ethereal experience you usually get when you bite into a macaron.  And at $2.50 per, that's not OK.Might be better after a few hours at room temperature.  Who knows.",,1,
144,Anna L.,"NY, NY",21,449,17,4.0,3/20/2013,"Try their Normandy sandwich. The bread is delicious though hard (okay, so I hurt the roof of my mouth once).. but overall the sandwich is plain addictive... I also love their macarons. They are a block from my office... and a favorite stop for us all .Check it out!",,,
145,Jessica H.,"Manhattan, NY",162,178,125,4.0,9/25/2012,"i've never been to laduree, but i've found macaron cafe to be delicious. i took home a sampling and enjoyed (as did the fam).  some standouts are:  green tea, passion fruit and chocolate. would definitely go back for more.  they package the macarons  beautifully too if you're looking to bring them to someone's home.",,,
146,Rachel W.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,102,4,5.0,10/18/2012,"I've only gone here to pick up cookies, but the staff were super attentive and friendly and patient as I took forever to pick which six of the pretty macaroons I wanted to buy. I can't speak to the lunch, except I bought a sandwich there once to eat back at the office that was fine, but I do prefer this location to the Madison Ave location, as it's bigger and less crowded.",,,
147,Eleven Y.,"Bloomington, IN",1,19,24,1.0,5/30/2013,Green tea macaron color inside is soooo scary....,,,
148,Chris C.,"New York, NY",36,147,61,3.0,10/19/2012,Not the best macrons I have had but they were not horrible. My favorite is the Wedding Almond and Pistachio. The Honey Lavendar was awful. It smelled so strong and tasted really minty. The Lemon macaron was not that great either. The decor is cute and it is a nice cafe to be able to sit and chat with a friend but not the best place for macarons.,,,
149,Char Y.,"Chicago, IL",2743,1554,892,2.0,5/20/2013,i tried the l lychee macaron and it was too artificially flavored and sweet. also mushy in texture.,2,1,1
150,Lori F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,10/27/2014,"This place has delicious macarons.  I have always experienced them to be fresh and they have some fun flavors.  Their PB&J is great, as well as the Honey Lavendar (so good!).  They are a good size and well made.  The staff is also friendly and the dècor is whimsical.  I also enjoy their tea selection.",,,
151,Xavier C.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,4.0,10/14/2012,"Finally a touch of excellence for this otherwise boring stretch of midtown-east side lunch spots. The very high quality of the ingredients and subtle combination of traditional flavors in the sandwiches and salads sets this place apart from others, warranting the slightly higher prices. While the macaroons initially suffered from the pressure of opening a new place, this has now been largely resolved, and are in my view amongst the best in New York. If you're interested in something more sophisticated and refined, definitely the place to go. The recently introduced ""after work drinks"" is also gaining momentum....",,,
152,Jim B.,"Saratoga, CA",39,2,0,1.0,8/1/2012,"I got an ice coffee and two macarons, passion fruit and salted caramel.  The ice coffee was awful.  It was weak and tasted sour.  The beans in my opinion weren't roasted as dark as I'd have liked. The salted caramel macaron was horribly stale and chewy.  While the passion fruit was simply acceptable.",,,
153,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,113,0,4.0,1/5/2014,"More variety of macarons than most places I've tried.  I had the passionfruit and the dark chocolate and both were delicious.  Looked like a cute place for lunch too, with a varied menu that sounded delicious.  Macarons are $2.50 each, which is pricey for what they are but seems like the standard price around town.",,,
154,Giancarlo D.,"Queens, NY",36,127,108,3.0,8/7/2013,just a decent cafe in the city. nothing special,,,
155,jill w.,"New York, NY",0,346,0,1.0,12/4/2012,"I really wanted to like this place, because it's cute and I love their business cards. I can only comment on the macarons (I got the green tea and the salted caramel). They were both stale, hard and pretty bad. Looking through the other reviews of this place, I see that people seem to like the macarons better at room temperature vs how they are served (cold). The fact that they are even sold refrigerated suggest to me that they don't move a whole lot of product daily (some of the better macaron places do serve these gems at room temp). Anyway, it would have been nice if the cashier suggested I wait a bit before eating them. While the price at $2.50 is high, that does seem pretty standard in NYC, so that didn't bother me much. At the end of the day however I would def not go back here.",,1,
156,Ames L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,29,1,4.0,8/16/2013,"I'm really not a macaron connoisseur but I thought it tasted pretty good. I tried the vanilla, pistachio, passion fruit, and strawberry with rhubarb. They taste better when I ate it right away, slightly cold. They're chewy and the filling tasted buttery. I liked the vanilla one. The others were good too.",,,
157,Jacqui S.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",1,20,1,2.0,12/20/2012,"Not that great. I ordered a box of twelve assorted flavors (Rose Lychee, Jasmine, a green tea one, apricot... just to name a few) and when my I bit into mine I noticed they lacked that crisp macarons tend to have. The frosting, cream filling tasted like pure gelatin or like it had a gelatin base added to it. The cookies seemed like it was under cooked due to its over gummy-ness. Overpriced for the lack of quality. Hope they improve overtime.",,,
158,BB B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,3.0,7/29/2012,"It is new so I'll give it some slack. The other reviewers are correct though, the macarons are harder than usual. One of mine's seemed to have only partially defrosted :( I've been to the other Macaron Cafe locations and haven't had that issue so maybe it's temporary. I will say the service is better here than the other 2 locations.",,,
