We stumbled across this place and so glad we did!  The bartenders were very friendly and attentive. The interior was beautiful, comfortable, and not too crowded. The music playlist was also fantastic. At the time they were playing rock as opposed to the top 40 that is typically played at local bars. Towards the end of our stay the owner of the bar bought rounds of drinks for those sitting at the bar before he headed out for the night.  Very nice touch!  If you are looking for a chill place for 30 to 40 somethings, this is a great spot!",,,

The had Sweet Tea Vodka which on a spring day that was channeling summer was the perfect cocktail. The bartender gave generous pours, didn't pressure us, but was attentive. The thin crowd that grew maintained an intimate level. I didn't try the bar menu, but it offered predictable fare. Maybe next time? And there will be a next time",,,

Updated review","I guess that last time, it didn't quite sink in that The Archive is as good as it gets! Nearly a year had passed since our last visit, so it took my old review to refresh my memory about the name of the delicious drink I had ordered on that sunny spring day. Carlos Danger. I supposed I would order it again.However, it quickly became apparent that it was no longer a part of the cocktail list- and that nothing else appealed to me. Just as I was about to go to the bar to inquire about it Kara, the most pleasant server I have ever encountered, appeared to take our orders. Not only did she know what the Carlos Danger was, but she also said that they would be happy to make one for me! And as I took my first sip, I discovered that it was just as delicious as before.Early into our second round, we realized that we needed to order food. The beautifully blended drinks in fact contain quite a bit of alcohol and if not careful, can sneak up on you! We decided upon the nachos, which simply prepared, were delectable. The avocado and lime made them.Furthermore, with a couple of quick check-ins on Yelp, we also saved a couple of dollars on a round of drinks.""Another memory filed away...""",1,,2
9,Anna G.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",153,75,141,4.0,10/17/2015,"My number one favorite thing about this establishment is their music selection. I dabble in the art of playlist creation and the selection at The Archive is top notch. I was also thrilled when I went out to the Website and saw that they actually provide their current playlists on it. I wish EVERY bar did this! To the owners - please KEEP doing this. It really adds to your cool factor!As far as atmosphere - it's dark with a gastropub feel. I went on a rainy day and it felt quite cozy inside with a decent amount of seating. The staff was very nice and attentive. We took advantage of the $6 Malbec ALL NIGHT (wow!) special which is awesome. Even when they ran out of the Malbec they honored the special with a Merlot option. We had a cheese plate which was pretty basic, so I would probably stick to drinks here but definitely a nice (and cheap) cozy evening option!",1,1,1
10,Brick W.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",60,646,1334,3.0,1/4/2016,Classic NYC bar.  Had drinks here while bouncing around NYC for an evening.  Glad they had peanuts for us when we asked.  The place was quite and low key which is exactly what I was looking for.  Can see this place being a repeat watering hole.,,,
11,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,4.0,10/8/2015,"I counted nine seats at the bar plus several tables.  Selection of five draft beers including Brooklyn Lager and Lagunitas.  Not a sports bar - one flat-screen showing iTunes album covers from the owner's playlist.  They will charge your phone - they have adapters in back of the bar.Bartender was engaging and made a decent cocktail - cheap at $11.00. Only bar I have ever seen that reserves some of the bar stools for regulars - or maybe the sign ""Reserved for Greg"" was an inside joke?  I will go back.",,,
12,Tony L.,"New York, NY",2,8,0,1.0,3/15/2016,"Years ago, I worked with a guy who frequented a local strip club. On almost a daily basis. He used to call it ""seeing his ladies"" every day at lunch time. He told me one thing about ordering drinks at strip clubs: always get the bottled beer. Why? They never wash their glasses!I never thought I would be imparting strip club related advice to a ""classy"" midtown bar with a nice comfy and cozy space, great streaming music, and a nice pour of scotch and whisky. But, there it is: don't order something that would require the utensil, glass, cup, serving plate to be washed.I was here last week on a Tuesday night. Lots of business and quite busy after 6:30P. I had glasses of scotch. All the glasses I got were stained with something: something was crusted on the lip and something was sticky or crusted on the sides. These are GLASSES. Even if you did not feel the sides when you picked it up, you (as the bartender) should have seen it.I had been here before, last year and the year before. Always pretty good experience. HOWEVER, the thing is: on a Tuesday night, they allowed multiple drinks to be served with dirty glasses. It makes me wonder what else isn't washed. That was the last time I'm coming here.",1,2,1
13,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1076,1948,46,5.0,12/8/2014,"I am not going to lie, but I was a bit hesitant to come here when a friend organized a birthday event here. Being in Midtown East, you usually find a bar that is so jam packed with people and overpriced drinks, that I usually avoid this part of town at all cost. So what a pleasant surprise when we walked in on a rainy Saturday night to find the place not too packed, with beautiful decor (including an elegant big clock) and very decent drinks and reasonably priced. My friend must have done her homework and reserved the back area for her and all her friends to mingle. It was an absolute success. Drinks were well made here and I especially liked the Carlos Danger, which was a spicy drink made with jalapeno-infused vodka, muddles blackberries and limi. And the caption was, ""guaranteed to improve your sexting."" Why how appropriate?And if you check-in on your Yelp app, you get $1 off the drink, perfect. We stayed here for many hours and as the night wore on, we had more shots than we could handle and well, headed into the night drunk, hungry and oh so happy. Thanks for making my friend's birthday a success and thanks for giving me renewed faith in bars in Midtown East. I will def be back!",7,3,4
14,Eric K.,"Washington, DC",124,44,33,4.0,8/7/2016,"Cool space, solid drinks. At a disadvantage because of the location. We went in at 730 on a Saturday and were the only ones there. The funny sign out front drew us in, and we enjoyed the cocktails we ordered.",,,
15,AnneC S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,4.0,1/19/2017,"Drinks are good and reasonable (for New York that is); food is good but a bit expensive.  Two sliders for $9-10 seems excessive.  But the best thing about The Archive is its staff.  Have yet to meet an unfriendly bartender here.  They make you feel at home and that's exactly what a good bar does.  I'd give it five stars if it had a wider menu or if the menu items were less expensive.  Oh, and I like the decor--nice atmosphere.  All-in-all my favorite bar in midtown Manhattan.The single one star review here suggests that the person is holding a grudge about something personal.  I live on 36th St. and have patronized every pub on the street.  They all have their good and bad points:  Ginger Man is mainly for beer, not for cocktails or wine, and this is true of almost all the other pubs on the street. The Archive is the only pub that serves decent cocktails.  Bartenders are quite good in this department.  Try it, you'll like it.",1,,

26,Trish F.,"Manhattan, NY",147,20,41,5.0,2/22/2015,"After a long arduous task of figuring out a good venue for my husband's birthday,I came across ""The Archive"" on Yelp. The reviews were so helpful for EXACTLY what we had in mind. We wanted a place that wasn't jam packed, where the music wasn't too loud, and a centrally located spot (since people were coming from all over the city). I called a few days before the event and luckily they had the space. The woman I spoke with was so nice, and she reserved the back section of the bar/restaurant for 40 of our guests. We couldn't have been happier. The bartender Matt and bar back were so nice, helpful, and patient (especially when some of our guests had a few too many). Our party ended up taking over the whole bar and it almost felt like it was our own private place. Everyone LOVED the venue and we will definitely be going back again. I cannot recommend this place enough for a birthday party or drinks in general. The lighting, the decor, music and space is perfect. The music they played was almost as if they took it straight from my iTunes account - such a bonus. Thank you!!!",,,
27,Sara W.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",101,187,14,4.0,3/31/2014,"Friday night my boyfriend and I were looking for a pre-dinner drink and since we were going to dinner in Ktown, we thought Ginger Man would be a nice spot.  Wrong!  It was packed-full of the after work business crowd and there wasn't even room to squeeze in by the bar to place an order (not to mention how loud it was).  We found The Archive by doing a Yelp search of nearby bars and it popped up right across the street.If you are in this area and looking for a seat (bar or table) and a quieter/nicer environment where you can hear your date talk--this is it!  They had a pretty extensive cocktail list, but I opted for beer.  The bartender was attentive and friendly and we weren't squished next to people at the bar.  I think it's rare to find a nice, non packed/loud bar in this area, which makes The Archive a treat!",2,,
28,Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",518,755,2383,4.0,4/1/2014,"Great bar in the busy section of Midtown. We came pretty early, around 3:30 on a Friday, and stayed until 6. We sat at the bar and ordered cocktails (I'm pretty sure I ordered a Bee's Knees or something akin to that name). Our bartender, who looked like a doppelganger of Cobie Smulders/Robin Scherbatsky, was friendly and engaged in some conversation with us. But she didn't forcefully insert herself into the conversation at all times, very low-key and mellow which was refreshing. She also had invented a drink on the cocktail menu which was really good. This place is unpretentious but serves up some decent cocktails too. By the time happy hour rolled around, the place was becoming quickly packed with folks. However, we never felt cramped sitting at the bar. Wish we had the chance to go back while we were visiting but now we know a good bar spot in Midtown.",1,,1

We were letting Yelp guide us! There was a pretty significant constraint though.....it was pre-5 so many nearby places were not open yet. In any event, we were heading east and the Archive was close by and had the highest rating if any place open.When we walked in it had a very local feel, which was kind of cool, and the cocktail list was also not bad.  Right away my buddy noticed the Carlos Danger that I have since seen other reviewers give a shout out to and he seemed pleased with his choice. I on the other hand prefer to stick to more of the classics, so I grabbed the Bee's Knees.  It was ok. I'm not a fan of adding volume to drinks via bubbly the way that this one was, but it was not excessive so the underlying unique taste of the cocktail was still there.We jumped back on Yelp to find our next spot, and we landed on the Peacock....but discovered something else.",,,

I came on a Friday night after work, and wandered into each of the neighboring bars before deciding on Archive. Though Archive was the only one without a happy hour special, we thought it would be worth it since there were less people & we may be able to sit...I say this place has potential, because my friends and I could only stay for a drink before Dinner, we had wasted so much time choosing where, that by the time we sat we were rushed.  And this place did not make out well for being rushed. We sat all the way in the back, and after 5 minutes, no waiter came around, so we quickly went to the bar to place our order.  This place is classy, upscale, has dim lighting, but is also elegant.  It would have been nice to be waited on, especially for those prices....What we ordered: $33 pre tipMexican Spiced ApplesPumpkin Pie Spiced Martini--OMG, this was delicious.

After we did get our drinks, she failed to ever come back until almost 1.5 hours later, when we decided we waited too long to order another drink and the window had passed. It was almost impossible for us to get our bill, and I finally had to go up to the counter to pay in the end. Being ignored on purpose by a server is one of the biggest insults.

We tried some of the small plates (slides, skewers). While they tasted fine, the portions were too small for the price. I'd snack somewhere else but I'll definitely be coming back.",1,,
36,Jillian O.,"Chicago, IL",272,194,137,3.0,2/13/2013,"This used to be my go-to after work spot for drinks. The Archive really is a nice bar for those looking for a place in between ""dive"" and ""upscale"". The decor is really home-y, dimly-lit and the bartenders are pretty friendly with lots of suggestions if you want to try something new. Great place for meeting up with friends if you want to impress with nice ambiance and good drinks.My only problem with The Archive is that it's such a small bar that it fills up really quickly. Unless you're one of the lucky ones and can grab a table up front, you'll end up relegated to the tiny, crowded bar area with everyone else. Standing room behind the bar stools is really narrow and they have more stools set up along the opposite wall (where no one sits because there's no room), so this space can easily get awkardly uncomfortable. Granted, most bars in NYC are crowded, I just wish that this bar utilized the small space a bit better.I will say that the drinks here are great. They like to put an interesting twist on classic drinks, like their Basil Gimlet which is strong and delicious. I just can't deal with the tiny, cramped space.",3,1,1
37,Erin F.,"New York, NY",0,35,2,3.0,11/2/2015,"First time here and the place had a pretty chill vibe. Fun and interesting cocktail list and the drinks came tasted good. This is probably dependent on the evening, but the bartender was definitely more interested in hanging out and taking a shot with the guys at the end of the bar than serving those waiting a long time for drinks. If the service improved, my rating probably would as well. Food menu looked good, but didn't get a chance to try it out.",,,
38,S. J.,"Manhattan, NY",30,47,1,4.0,1/26/2013,"If you like bars with dark, cozy, chic ambiance and an adequate amount of good crowd, The Archive may appeal to you. Their *tastefully-chosen* music is not too loud which makes it easy to converse over drinks. The crowd you will find at The Archive is a good mix between young and mature (mid 20s-40s). The Archive has quick and friendly bartenders. You also have an option of reserving the back space for a larger gathering (it usually is reserved, anyway). You can get their signature cocktails for $10 or a glass of wine ($8-12). The only setback seems to be the lack of space since it becomes hard to find seats on popular nights. Oh, and their drinks tend to be strong (I guess this could be good or bad.)Let me point out the convenient location of this place--it is right across the street from other bars that have dancing, louder music, a bit of sports-watching, and decent greasy bar food. Good to know in case you plan on switching the night up a little. Bottoms up, fellow Manhattanites!p.s. I'm a big fan of their Manhattans and signature Basil Gimlets.",2,,1

But if you're human and you have to wait a couple hours for a guy*, The Archive isn't a bad place to do it. The Archive is across the street from the Ginger Man, which apparently is a favorite with the Midtown finance guys. Unlike Ginger Man, which was packed to the gills and overwhelmingly loud, The Archive was quieter and had far fewer people. The Archive is a pretty slick place without the pretentious crowd -- plush bench seating, lots of black/dark wood, and floral arrangements up until then I had only seen in architectural magazines and very large chi chi department stores. It never got crowded on the weekday night I was there. You could always find a good seat. Despite the far fewer people, it was still on the loud side because of the high ceilings, hardwood floors, and music, but it wasn't too bad for having a conversation.The Archive has a full bar, but a rather boring and very limited selection of beer (Sierra Nevada, Stella Artois, Pabst Blue Ribbon -- the PBR I find very surprising considering that Archive is more upscale than that). I enjoyed the Archived Tee Time (variation of a lemonade vodka) and the Dark & Stormy. They also have a good selection of upscale bar food (pigs in a blanket, empanadas, quesadillas, pulled pork sliders, chips and a hot cheese dip mixed with salsa). While this isn't a place that I say you have to come to, it's a good place to go to when you need to meet someone Midtown.I love their selection of music, which kept me entertained, along with my drinks and food.

I like the drink selection and the bartender is usually pretty good at making the drinks you want. They're typically pretty strong which is nice.However, what really turned me off was the food. It wasn't bad, but the portions were ridiculously small for a bar. For $8, I got like 4 or 5 very small wings. That's just absurd. No bar should give that small portions.",,2,
45,Amriel K.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,124,0,3.0,3/22/2013,"Good after work spot. The ""happy hour"" isn't really a deal per se, but the prices are standard. It's also kind of lame that one of the happy hour beers was the same exact price as the one on the menu....May knock a dollar off to show that you're trying a little bit?Service was really good. I was there with a group of 6 and they accommodated us with two small tables by the front windows. Lucky we got there when we did because the place fills up.Music was good too, and not overly loud. You can speak to the person next to you without a problem.They also have smaller plates of bar food type things like nachos and quesadillas. One thing that surprised me is that the first plate of nachos was like 10 chips and seriously lacking toppings, but the waitress overheard us complaining, and the next plate was much more respectable. So good job on the improvement.",1,,

52,Ben K.,"New York, NY",29,306,2,4.0,8/20/2011,"I felt this was a really decent choice and I'm glad I paid a vist - even if the motivation was sudden rain and Gingerman across the street looked to busy to get wet for.On this block, Gingerman is the place, and Galway Hooker the backup for most people. The Archive provides a nice alternative and quickly became my first choice on the block.Where the Gingerman excels in an array of fine beers, The Archive offers good beer choices with a great selection of cocktails. Where the Galway Hooker excels in douchebaggery and being noisy, The Archive maintains some class and a rather mellow atmosphere.The bartenders, while working themselves, empathize with the customers coming off a 10 - 12 hour day at the office. Kind, friendly and humorous, they can turn the day around.Well done, look forward to being back.",2,,

57,Christopher P.,"Killingworth, CT",5,18,4,2.0,4/15/2015,"This used to be a great place when it was Under the Volcano.  The new bar replaced one of the best tequila and mescal selections in the city and a respectable beer selection with three bad beers and one mediocre beer on tap, an unremarkable liquor bar, a lousy and tiny wine selection, and bar food you could get anywhere.  It's still fairly low key and quiet, which is why it gets two stars.",1,,

60,Stephanie V.,"Baldwin, NY",11,39,29,3.0,3/1/2014,"A pretty chill bar. With a great ambiance. The drinks were okay, not the best cocktails I've had in NYC but not the worse. Seemed like the kitchen was out of everything that night though. Ordered the cheese dip & Buffalo Chicken Bites & was told there was no more cheese dip & no more chicken....A bar that runs out of chicken by 9pm on a Fri....that wasn't even the least bit crowded? Nice to experience something a bit different than your usual midtown bars but quickly forgettable.",,,
61,Jennifer C.,"Westbury, NY",1,65,108,4.0,3/2/2014,"Love the small intimate tables.  Excellent bartender, very attentive.  It's self seating so walk in and seat yourself at a table.  If you choose to order the hummus plate request more pita slices as not enough are given for the amount of hummus provided.",,,
62,L M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,4.0,12/12/2012,"I really liked the ambiance of this place.  It had white lights above the bar, and some sort of wall covering made out of string too look like trees (really, it was a lot prettier than it sounds written down), and I'm a sucker for white lights and trees.  So I was sold.  Plus it was an ideal level of busy-ness.  I bet this place gets pretty crowded as an after-work/happy hour place, but I went at an off-time, on a Saturday night, and found it the perfect level of busy.  We easily got seats at the bar, but it was by no means deserted either. They have a small bar menu, which is good for snacking.  I can only speak for the cheese plate, but we enjoyed it.",1,,1
63,Abigail M.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,231,8,3.0,3/10/2010,"Normally when my coworkers and I go for Happy Hour we head over to the GingerMan. However the constant problem is that there is never anywhere to sit, it's always loud, and always crowded. (Actually I went there once around 4pm and it was okay, but, well... 4pm.) So instead of standing around waiting I ducked across the street as I noticed Under the Volcano had closed and reopened as the Archive. (Since my coworkers and I work for the library this seemed to be an amusing alternative.) Sure enough there were tables/space available for our large party -- mostly in the back.The drinks menu is pretty standard. There are a few taps of beer of mid-range beers like Guinness, Blue Moon, etc., and a small wine list (I had the pinot noir which was tasty) as well as the fully stocked bar. The listed cocktails aren't particularly inspired, just made with higher-end spirits. Instead of trying to be a tequila joint, it's been refashioned as a slightly more generic bar.The bar menu seems to have carried over a bit of its former self, though, with quesdillas, nachos, empanadas, and queso, but adds sliders and pigs n' blanket for a slightly less Latin-flare. That is not to say that the food is particularly ethnic, since most of that food is pretty standard bar fare.I liked the atmosphere, too. Lower-lighting, gray walls, dark wood, alt-rock soundtrack, slightly-rockabilly bartender... But, unlike many library/archive named bars, this one lacked anything that nodded to that theme. No books on the walls, not even in the artwork, and no hot librarians (except for myself, of course :P ). Regardless, I'd definitely come on back for an after-work drink.",4,1,4
64,Paul B.,"West Bronx, NY",1,27,0,2.0,6/6/2014,Definitely quieter than the other bars on the block during the after work rush.  No cocktails on happy hour was a bit of a bummer and a limited beer menu to boot.  $11 Cocktails and apps looked pretty good.  The bar stools had some strange cleaner or other substance that led to me and my buddy's pants being visibly wet when we got up.  Overall not my type of place but may be a fit if you are looking for a quiet option for conversation and a drink in the neighborhood.,2,1,
65,Bruce C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",5,45,0,5.0,3/9/2010,"Cozy, quiet, great service, and friendly staff [wow can the Ginger Man take some notes].  Library type feel, small dark, tables to sit.  Woody.  Books on the wall.  I would say a date place - there are always plenty of couples here gazing in each others eyes.    murray hill perfectfor a moment of reposeor a beer and talk    Here's where the 5 stars comes - 'Mar's music is the BEST.   Second to none.  I mean Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah isn't something you find at most bars...[I hope he finds Lucy Show at some point and adds it.]  You'll come in for the wine stay for the music.  Beer selection - it's not a 100 beer place but do you really need 100 beers every night.  they usually have Harpoon and Brooklyn to get your hop on.  Peroni for the light italian nights.  Not a lot of food but little apps that people seem to like - I'd say eat before you go. It is what it is, if they put a big kitchen in it will be less cozy.  It's a small place, but good for a group of say six to eight.  PS: That's a good one Midtown, yeah, i will honestly say i have not seen the Situation, or his abs, in this bar.    No 'Gym Tanning Laundry' in this bar.  [Though it is a nice post-gym spot..] The people that go to this bar are people that matter.",3,1,2

She was so sweet and so many bartenders in the city can be so rude. It was very refreshing. She had just finished making the jalapeño vodka for the drinks we had. Forgot their name, but they were excellent. Had the nachos, beef skewers, and the cheese plate. All were really good! Surprisingly delicious for how simple they looked.

68,Allison K.,"Brooklyn, NY",469,167,29,4.0,4/8/2013,"Love this bar! It's definitely not the same scene as what you'd see at Ginger Man or Galway Pub across the street. Instead, it's a bit more of an intimate setting while being fairly low key, and you can actually hear the person you're talking to. I've been here a few times for happy hour and I guess I've lucked out because I've never felt like it was super crowded. Great music + good drinks + cool atmosphere = winning bar!",,,

There isn't a lot of room for a person to maneuver through the tables and great to the bar, because the tables are right on top of each other.  We ordered Pigs in a blanket which taste like any average pig in blanket. I would definitely go back as a after work Friday. A  good meet up and/or hang out spot for a group of friends, jut be prepared to be up close and personal.",1,,

The place is upscale with a laid back vibe - but sophisticated enough to scare away the drunken post college crowd and tragically hip. It's urban vibe is welcoming to all, but the after-work crowd and post hipster generation seem to be the crowd majority. If you are having a big crowd come with you, call ahead and they'll reserve a space for you. My group of 20 friends and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will definitely be back!",1,,

There's something about all of the dark wood,blue walls and white lights that just really soothed me. There were two female bartenders working and I couldn't help but feel a little girl power when I stepped up. There's a really good cocktail list, it's not too long, and each drink features some really unique twists. i opted for the Rosemary martini, that came with real, fresh sprigs of rosemary. The combination was really a blast for my taste buds. I tasted a few other drinks and I found that they all had the perfect cocktail essence. You know, where you really want to sip and linger over each sip, opposed to slamming them down. If it weren't for dinner, I would have never left!",,,

Absolutely loved the ambiance; it's classier than a sports bar, but not super fancy either. The hot toddy with a dash of rum went down so well on a cold December evening. Liked it so much that we picked this place for a joint birthday gathering last Saturday night. We wanted a location where we could have a bit of space and be able to chat with friends. I called about 10 days ahead of time to get the back area reserved for about 30 people. Amar was very professional and happy to help. Lots of our friends commented on how much they liked the bar too.
