0,Amber D.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,80,84,4.0,9/25/2018,"I love oysters as much as I love yell-reading the fantastically long names of clothing items on Amazon. Probably more. I needed to come to this establishment immediately after seeing their post with a picture of a large-tentacled Woman on their main bar wall. Why? Maybe because I had just watched the Handmaiden on Amazon after yell-reading some clothing items I was considering purchasing, (""Women Overalls Casual Ripped Pencil Pants Jumpsuit Rompers Playsuit!"") .. and there is a very memorable scene with a similarly large octopus and I figured it was a sign from above. On the other hand I could have just been ready for ::$1 OYSTERS during their happy hour ::Which, for the record, is only from 5-6 pm.If you go on Sunday or Monday, $1 oysters all niiiight. Other notables from the Happy your menu are the $8 cocktails, that go up to 15 after 6 pm. Their beer selection is $9 for draft, regardless of time. Smattering of cans and bottles too for a few bucks less. It seems there are random events held here as well, such as various themed comedy (this week was baby shower?), and even a Drunk Yoga night with free wine. The latter sounds like a downwards-facing disaster, if you ask me.. more so if dairy was involved. Definitely go visit this Nautical Mistress of Neptune's Deep and plunge yourself into some oysters and relatively cheap cocktails (for LES).",1,1,
1,Andrew D.,"East Bronx, NY",2,56,88,4.0,9/3/2018,"Passed by this place a few times in the past and figured now was a good time to check it out. We arrived early and were seated right away by a very pleasant hostess. She handed us our menus right away. The menu selection is not huge but there are definitely a nice variety of things to choose from.The waitress took our drink orders, my wife had the watermelon margarita and I had the pain killer. Both were very good.  We shared two apps which were the scallops wrapped in bacon and the crab cakes which were more like balls than cakes but yummy nonetheless.For the main course my wife had the burger with fried egg and avocado it came with a side of fries and I had the lobster roll hot(it also comes in a cold version with mayo)with melted butter and fries. Excellent!! The waitress and barmaid were full full of smiles and quite adorable too boot!",1,,1
2,Linda D.,"East Bronx, NY",75,264,1433,5.0,9/1/2018,"Passed this place a million times, and only caught my eye last week! Glad it did! We started out w some cocktails. Painkiller and the spicy watermelon margarita! Then we ordered the crab cakes, that came with some home made chips, with a tartar sauce. And we had the scallops with bacon. I ordered something I never ever order! But I saw it at the table next to me. It was the cheseburger! I had requested it with out the bun, but added the avocado and the fried egg! It was out of this world. It came with French fried. My husband had the lobster roll, which also came w French fries! Service was excellent!",1,,
3,K G.,"Tuxedo Park, NY",9,167,85,3.0,6/24/2018,Was in the area and was looking for an afternoon happy hour and bonus $1 oysters. They have a nice assortment of drinks for the happy hour.  Only issue is that it took forever for the oysters to be served. We actually almost cancelled our order because we had an appointment after. But would say it's good for drinks.  Nothing special but not a horrible experience either.,,,1
4,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",399,484,1233,3.0,3/2/2018,"3.5 stars overall which includes the sultry, cozy ambiance. But $30 for a lobster roll?!?! Oh my word (nope, didn t order the roll but it's on the menu).My friend and I stumbled here since the gusty wind left us not much choice to scope the 'hood. Although we weren't looking to have dinner, something along the lines of an appetizer and glass of wine came to mind. Grey Lady looked at us smack in the face as we walked down Delancey Street after leaving an art gallery exhibit. We welcomed shelter and decided to give it a try.The atmosphere was adorable--alone, it would merit 5 stars. I couldn't tell you if on a given night this place 1) gets overly crowded  2) is a scene 3) if the service for dinner is an pointe 4) serves great food.Here's what I can outline:We sat at the bar, perused the mostly seafood menu (after all, the awning boldly states Oyster Bar) as well as the drink selections.There's a fully stocked bar and cocktails run in the $15 ballpark while wine averages around $12.We chose a Pinot Grigio and Rose.As far as food, we settled on the fried calamari. It was very good but the portion was pathetic. Their menu prices seem a bit steep and portions skimpy. Since we sat at the bar, our water glasses were constantly re-filled. On this particular blustery cold night, it wasn't crowded.Music was good with familiar tunes being played but not so loud therefore, having a conversation was possible.Grey Lady can be a good experience if atmosphere is your thing. Make sure to review the check. Their computer overcharged us by a few bucks (whatever that means) and it was a bit of a headache to resolve.",11,7,9
5,Adrianne L.,"Orlando, FL",176,114,151,4.0,4/30/2018,My friend had his birthday here in the private room and I can honestly say the food we had was great! The scallops and the fried oysters were so so so good! I do feel like the drinks were a little meh but the monster mule was great and the most bang for your buck ... plus a party starter! The customer service was ok ... we spent plenty of money and weren't treated too great ... they took our chairs from the room to seat others leaving us standing and things weren't really well communicated with us which was disappointing and kept me fromGiving this place 5 stars,,,1
6,Julia K.,"New York, NY",299,318,838,5.0,1/6/2018,"You'd be lucky for this Lady to be your local watering-hole!Not quite sure why the reviews are so harsh of this establishment. It is extremely sexy and side and definitely a place I would want to be taken on a romantic drinks type of date, maybe with a little nosh as well.We were seated at the bar, and both the bartenders could not have been more attentive, helpful, and pleasant! My friend and I both were not consuming alcohol but we got nothing but a pleasant and upbeat attitude from both young ladies who served us delicious bitters and soda! They even gave us a topper have a bit of ginger beer, non-alcoholic, with the complements of the house. Pretty nice!This is a tasty dollar oyster place during happy hour! Although the oysters were small, they were extremely fresh, delightfully presented with both traditional vinegar and red sauce, and an adorable little stopper bottle of Tabasco. Woo-wee that was hot!I was not quite as enthused about the $19 lobster macaroni and cheese. It just wasn't my cup of tea, or cup of creamy pasta with seafood ;) However, my friend thought it was delicious and ate every bit. It comes with a small side salad, which we mixed with an order of the roasted beets. Those were quite tasty and not terribly expensive. It made a nice light meal, or if one were just to have the oysters, a tasty beginning to the evening!The restroom was clean, albeit it unfortunately had some graffiti from some previous, rude clientele; above the loo on a shelf was a sweet little bouquet of flowers. Everything felt very clean and well attended to.  It's nice that the sink is just outside of the restroom so that there's not such a long wait.In addition to the barstools and the traditional table/chair and table/bench seating there are two low, long sofa areas that have small tables in front for a beverage or snack placement.  Ideal for cuddling!This is just about as perfect of a HH or drinks/lite bites establishment as one could hope for in one's own neighborhood. Although it is not near me, if I lived nearby I would come here all the time!",3,2,4
7,Elda P.,"Central Islip, NY",11,69,135,5.0,4/20/2018,"Love love love! Such a great time! Shout out to the dj tonight on 4/20. (Not celebrating any high moments) genuinely a fun bar! We passed by on accident after a suckish time at DL. We saw  ""oyster bar"" and were surprised to see a very ""lit"" spot,  but the music sounded good, the crowd looked good so we just gave it a shot and were not disappointed! The dj started off with a tribute to Avicii and the music was just great from there, to tbts to today's top hits , just simply a great time! I had their draft beer , honestly not too sure what the bartender chose for me but I asked for a light beer , no IPA and his recommendation was delish! Too bad I have class tomorrow and had to leave early. WOMP. Can't wait to come back again! :) Happy yelping and come party your cute butt off at the Grey Lady!",1,,1
8,James W.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,1,5.0,8/1/2018,I grew up on the East Coast and always appreciate a perfect lobster roll. Grey Lady has one of the best in Manhattan. Love that they have Cisco beer too - a rare find not in Nantucket.,,,
9,Wanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",310,284,810,4.0,6/27/2017,"Happy Hour MUSTAs anyone who reads my reviews know I love oysters. I stopped by with a dear friend after an art show at the gallery next door ( Feat Jane Dickson, look her up!)What I loved about this location aside from $1 happy hour oysters was the service as well as the ambiance.  The music is great, very mellow and the bar isn't loud and ridiculous with tales of sorrow about how people hate their jobs, or how Linda in accounting is the always annoying.My nest favorite feature would be the french fries, I don't give this award away lightly but I would have to say that these are the best fries that I have EVER eaten. The are nice and crisp, but not too crisp, they are season, but not overly so, and they come in the perfect quantity, not too much not too little.As for pricing, you are not really saving any money unless you just come for the oysters. It's not overly expensive but definitely standard Manhattan prices.",,,
10,Helen C.,"Queens, NY",54,4,0,2.0,4/25/2018,"I came here for happy hour because my best friend had came here before and she loved it. The place was empty and when we first walked in, we weren't sure to seat ourselves or not because no one greeted us. When we got our seats and ordered oysters and drinks, the waitress and another woman there refused us drinks. They claimed that we looked young and all our ID cards are from out of town, and she was young before .... Uh, 1. We ARE from out of town2. Whatever she was insinuating was kinda of insultingSo after a few more exchanges, we agreed to just have the oysters because we didn't want to make it a big deal and we understood where the waitress was coming from. They do have a right to refuse service.Oysters did take a while to come out and as we paid to leave, I caught the waitress smirking at the other woman as if our table is some kind of inside joke.I usually do not post reviews but I never had an experience like this and it was just ridiculous . Everyone we told this experience after said we should have just called the cops to prove our IDs were real or walk out. How humiliating.",2,,
11,Krysten L.,"Orlando, FL",130,84,122,5.0,4/29/2018,"It was my first time at the Grey Lady for my friends birthday. He rented out the back room which came with multiple plates of delicious food and a full bar. There were crab cakes, scallops wrapped in bacon (biggest and juiciest scallops I've ever had by the way), crackers and cheese, delicious meatballs and oysters. Every thing was better than the next. Would definitely host a party there myself (if I could afford it)!",1,1,
12,Mews C.,"Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/9/2018,"Gross! Had the ""Fry Basket"" fried seafood mix. The calamari were fine but the sauce was over herbed and unpleasant. The crab balls were average but generally ok. The cod was not even close to fresh and very salty but the worst was the bacon wrapped scallops which were super funky and definitely turned. Definitely do not eat here and probably best to give it a miss for drinks as well since the malbec was also poor.",,,
13,Braxton M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",147,9,1,5.0,2/14/2018,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Came to the Grey Lady for Valentine's Day and had an AMAZING experience! Ambiance was nice for a cozy date night, and the pre-fix 3 course meal was delicious! Not to mention the lovely and very attentive staff, including Cate, the GM for the Grey Lady, who was hustling right along side the rest of the fabulous staff members! We had the 6 oyster sampler (an assortment that were all excellent) with a bottle of Pinot Grigio. The fist course consisted of a green salad and crab cakes, both of which were a great start to the 3 courses. The New York steak was savory in all of the best ways, and don't get me started on how lobster that my taste buds did not even want to end! The richly delicious desert of chocolate cake and an apple tart cake just topped the evening off in a spectacular fashion! I am very excited to see this restaurant grow and anxious for our next visit and the tasty treats to come!",2,,1

Every item they brought out for us was plentiful and delicious! We really had a great deal--Family style brunch with bottomless drinks for $64/person inclusive of tax and tip. With all different people and pallets, it was quite a treat to have a meal that everyone enjoyed! Will definitely be back and so grateful for such a wonderful birthday!Thank you!",,,1

I went the other night with a friend, and it was so nice to be able to get a seat outside on the sidewalk without waiting 2+ hours.

I can't say the service was great, but I guess seeing that no one was really there, it was really relaxed. I ordered six different types of oysters that seemed fresh and tasted good. I ordered the crispy bacon which was good too, nothing special. Overall, they have good tasting food, just nothing memorable.",1,,
24,Nafis B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/9/2018,"It's very disappointing for me to be writing this negative review but I think it's important for me to express this....Since moving to NYC, Grey Lady has been one of my favorite places in the Lower East Side. Great beer and great oysters. Today, I waited about 25 minutes at the bar to get served. I didn't find that to be a too much of a big deal at first because there was 1 bartender and it was oddly busy for a Monday night. I will mention however it was not busy at the bar itself. The bartender apologized for the wait and took my order. All good. What made this experience extremely disappointing was that a couple who walked in 30 mins after I did, ordered oysters (exactly like I did) got served before I did. At first, I didn't realize they got served first. I looked up and they looked at me. I thought it must've been a mix up. When I looked over at the bartender, she shook her head as if she didn't know what was going on. After realizing how long I've waited and seeing the same exact order I made being delivered to someone who walked in 30 minutes after I did, I was furious. I asked for my checked and cancelled my oyster order. The bartender was gracious enough to comp my beer and the oysters but at this point it didn't matter. This will be my last time going to this place again. Extremely disappointed in the manager who walked around pretty steadily during my time without any explanation.",,,
25,Flora L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",206,366,545,1.0,7/6/2016,"Spend your money elsewhere.First off, I came here for lunch (5 pm). It seemed like a really cute nice place on the corner. I was hungry and wanted a sit down place so I came in. Plus there was no one there. They only had a happy hour menu of a few food choices and of course a whole menu for drinks. I looked at the menu outside and was disappointed when I knew that I could only order a few food items.My boyfriend and I ordered 6 oysters ($1 each at happy hour), a Caesar salad and a burger.40 minutes have passed and I see a family who came in half an hour after us get all their food... Including burgers PLURAL! Where was my burger? I got there first...The oysters took 40 minutes to come! 40! That's ridiculous considering all you have to do is prep it. Then the Ceasar salad came out 5 minutes later... (45 minutes from when I ordered) The Caesar salad was literally the dressing some croutons a lot of cheese and some romaine lettuce. It wasn't even chopped. Why does it take 45 min for you to get this out?? Finally the burger came out. 50 minutes later.... It was a good burger. I was very happy with it.. TILL I FOUND A HAIR IN MY BURGER. NASTY!!! Of course I get a little sick and tell the waitress. They took it off our tab but still that's disgusting. Overall a horrible experience. Pretty unfair how the family got all their food and I'm still waiting even though they came half an hour after us and got their food within 10 minutes.Then I find a hair in my food...",6,1,1

27,Sunny T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",335,128,27,4.0,4/3/2017,"This is a review for the NIGHT SCENE only. Yes, this isn't just a restaurant serving up oyster deals.My roommate and I have literally lived across Grey Lady for a year now, and every single night (Wed-Sat) after the clock hit midnight, we'd hear the bumpin' bass pumping out the latest rap and hip hop, or throwback songs coming from Grey Lady, always accompanied by a line out the door. For the longest time, we were confused as to if Grey Lady was some secret club, since it seemed connected to the ""Oyster Bar"" which appeared to only be a restaurant. Yet upon further investigation there was nothing about a ""club"" per se... spooky. After several G&Ts and finding myself in buzzed state, I decided to clarify it once and for all one night: made friends with the bouncers, Q and Sebastian, and found out Oyster Bar and Grey Lady were one and the same. How anticlimactic. With that being said, when my roommate and I finally made it out here on Friday night, we decided that this would be our new place to go whenever we felt the need to dance our night away with little judgment. Live DJ playing all the Drake tunes for ""More Life""--what more do you need? Was kinda weird when he started to play cowboy throwback rock jams... Only thing we found odd were the people there; seemed like everyone was in their late to mid 30s or even 40s, coming for a post-work drink (at 12AM?) with their buds and friends, but didn't get the memo that the ""chill bar"" was actually a lowkey club. Also, a G&T was a whopping $12 and watered down... An additional star for my fav bouncer though: Q-- ""like the letter after P.""",1,2,1

29,Georgina G.,"San Francisco, CA",93,300,412,5.0,5/2/2017,"This deal is based solely on their happy hour, which they offer on Monday to Friday (4-7 PM). Their happy hour includes $1 oysters, $5 Beer, $8 wine and $9 wells.One of my friends made a reservation for the 4 of us at 6:30 on a Friday. I was the first to arrive and there were still a handful of tables open, but I'd still make resis just in case because it started to get crowded after awhile. We came only for their hh menu and since there was only 30 mins left, we tried to squeeze in as many dozen oysters we could until hh was over. They wouldn't allow us to order 3 dozen at once and instead can only put one dozen order at a time and bring out the next after the previous round is done.Aside from oysters, we took advantage of the $8 wine and ordered some fries as a side. The oysters were fresh and the ambiance feels like a rustic, open warehouse. It was a nice spot to enjoy a warm sunny evening in LES. Our server was also nice and made sure we got the most out of the hh. I would come again next time for hh oysters again!",,,

37,Miguel R.,"Newark, NJ",65,7,1,4.0,7/6/2017,"Came here during their happy hour which offers $1 oysters, $5 beers and $8 select wines. First, I must say I came here exclusively for the oysters and they didn't disappoint at all. Coming from a Caribbean country where I frequently had fresh oysters at the beach I was impressed with how fresh and tasteful these oysters were. Me and my girlfriend also ordered the clam chowder, fried calamaris, lobster roll and the Broiled Maine Lobster. The food was absolutely delicious. The only negative I could say is that the Broiled lobster did not come with any side dishes.Overall, the ambiance is really nice, there's a very large bar in case you just want to sit with a friend or date and have some drinks. Prices are very good compared to other seafood places. I will definitely come back in the future and will recommend this place to friends.",1,,

If you're looking for a lobster roll this is the spot. They also have great oyster deals during happy hour. Usually pretty good service but I had a different experience recently. I wanted to bring a friend from out of town to an outside spot in the LES. She has a gluten and dairy allergy. Tried to make a substitution, eyes were rolled at trying to alter the order, a simple coffee and tea order was screwed up, the waitress (with orange hair) was insanely rude and never returned back to the table. We had to grab the bus boy to have anything after that point. There wasn't even anyone there! If you can't be bothered to be a waitress when your job consists of being nice to customers and making sure they are taken care of, you probably shouldn't be a waitress. She ruined our brunch and I will not be returning if she's there.",1,,

41,Vanessa G.,"New York, NY",80,60,43,4.0,7/6/2017,I came here during their happy hour for oysters and seafood. I am not a fan of oysters but my boyfriend liked them very much and said they were fresh so I will take his word for it. We had calamari and clam chowder as appetizers. The calamari had a spicy kick to it and it was delicious! The clam chowder was good as well. For the main course I had the lobster roll (hot) and he had the Maine lobster. The lobster roll looked a bit small but I was very full at the end. It was this buttery goodness which I thoroughly enjoyed. The main lobster was delicious as well. It didn't come with any sides though so be aware of that. You will probably not be full if you just Order that without any appetizers. Another note is that they have outdoor seating. It was very nice to eat outside on a nice summer day. We will definitely be returning.,,,

It was just damn near impossible to get a seat and get someone's attention. Now, once I was able to, the bartender was friendly and nice. And I really liked the decor. It's small spot, but is all hipster with a fancy feel. It's definitely a cute spot. But the crowd was most definitely not my scene. Pretty uppity and arrogant. But, all that said, during a non-peak time, this could be a great spot. The drink and food menus are definitely innovative and tasty sounding.",5,3,4

They have a fantastic happy hour with $1 oysters, which were delicious. The clams casino were a good size and tasted perfect. The gem was the lobster pot pie which had huge chunks of lobster meat.

It has a rustic and nautical vibe with high ceilings and even live music in the summer! Their clam chowder, endive and rock shrimp, fish and chips and lobster roll are worth coming back for again and again. This is my favorite lobster roll in the city so far! Oh yeah...and the brussels are also quite delicious. As for drinks, the Moscow Mule is great! It even comes in a tin cup!

Our waitress was very kind to serve 3 dozens for a party of three. One right after the other and made sure all happy hour orders placed was before 7pm. The food was delicious esp the clam chowder. The only downside to my experience was only seeing one waitress throughout the night. We waited awhile for the check and to place orders for takeout. It was an overall good experience.",,,

56,Berlin K.,"Portland, OR",95,75,74,5.0,3/10/2017,"This is my favorite spot in NYC. The big windows always let in tons of sunlight, the food is satisfying yet somehow feels healthy, their Happy Hour is crazy! (1/2 off the raw bar), and the staff is always so fun and pleasant. For this California girl, it's like a little getaway from the chaos of NYC. But I hear it does get crazy after midnight. They bring in a DJ, move the tables and dance. So fun, if only I stayed up late! Just had their ahi tuna burger. So delicious. Love their kale salad too.",,,
57,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,3.0,1/19/2015,"Grey Lady is odd. I never really want to go, and then when I find myself there I think it's better than I remembered. The cocktails aren't my favorite, but the food is solid. I liked their clam chowda and lobster rolls. They don't have Stella, but offer something similar called Kronenbourg which is nice. Service can be a little weird, and once they stop serving food they can make you feel rushed by snatching every single item that you appear to be finished with off your table one at a time, right down to the ketchup bowl. They play live music. I think I saw a rock band once, or the members leaving. I'm sure there were guitars. One Sunday I definitely saw a nice jazz band. Their background music is usually nice, I think I may have heard some oldies on a Saturday night. What I love most about it is that it doesn't usually get crazy, it's a decent place to go even on a weekend in the LES where you can have conversations and hear something other than the usual.",1,2,1
58,Andrew C.,"Chicago, IL",462,111,105,5.0,4/17/2016,"Epic. Like literally mind blowing how a place known for seafood can master having delicious and fresh oysters and also give me what I would call the perfect medium rare burger. Lucia was awesome, because she never felt like a hovering person, but rather a helpful friend as I smashed through 12 oysters, lobster soup (shwing!), and a prime rib burger fit only for the gods. Even the decorations were nice and well thought out in a space that feels big enough to inspire freedom but never feeling cavernous even as the night ran on. The only low point was the drink, and that I attribute to my severely particular palette when it comes to mixed drinks. I always try them but I rarely feel MOVED by them. The bar had a high variety of spirits more on the frafrafra end of the drinking scale. I'll just get a macallan 18 next time :)Highly recommended and fawned over, this place is. I can't wait to get back",,,1
59,Vincent Y.,"New York, NY",32,53,139,4.0,11/11/2015,"After reading through a few of Grey Lady's reviews, there seems to be a pretty stark contrast of opinions between people coming here during the day for food and those coming here at night for drinks. My friend and I came here during the day for lunch, and so this review goes...I'll start off by saying that after our meal we were both honestly surprised at how good the food is here!I essentially dragged my friend here for lunch so that I could try the raw bay scallops, and as it turned out, they were not my favorite part of the meal. There was a little too much sunchoke and radish compared to the size of the scallops, and it was a little too tart for my tastes. They sure were pretty though.Bucatini with lobster - wow. I was not expecting this - perfectly cooked pasta and lobster, incredibly flavorful, great texture, and absolutely satisfying.Fish and chips - the beauty... the moist tender fish, the super crispy potatoes, the spicy sauce...yum!Service - I feel like I need to say something here. On the one hand, the staff was super nice and inviting; on the other, it took 45 minutes for our entrees to come out after we ordered, and there were only 2 other 2-person tables seated.Regardless, I'd come back for the food.",2,,1

62,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,195,459,3.0,3/15/2015,"Ran into this place during a long hour wait for a table elsewhere.Initially, the front of the house was fully reserved and showing up on a saturday night with no reservation, It can be expected. My party was still received immediately as there was an entire back area, seperate from the bar, that was far more quiet and intimate.My party had tried the grey petite oysters, a little creamier than expected but very fresh tasting with a very nice garlic sauce we were familiar with.Entrees; the steak frites were asked to be medium well, they were just a bit above but very very tough to bite into. The seasoning itself was very nice and the caramel onion a nice touch but could not get away from the toughness. Now I had asked for the same thing but the surf n'turf. My medium well was cooked to the proper temperature, the lobster very well made (warning: whole half lobster, not just tail) but both proteins buried under what seemed like red wine vinegar soaked parsley. What was also consistent in both meals is the steak is pre-cut (similar to medallions) and serving size was a let down.Btw, came with fries, made perfectly, but begging for a sauce.What brings this from a 2 to 3 is very attentive, helpful staff.",,,

64,Eva L.,"San Jose, CA",125,172,437,4.0,8/24/2014,"I accidentally stumbled upon this place but im really glad I did! This place is amazing!!! I got the oysters (chefs choice) , a painkiller , and fish n chips. The total was about 42$. A bit pricier than I wouldve hope but the food was delish. The oysters here are really fresh and it has none of the weird seafood smell-the ones that u can tell have been sitting there for a while. Oysters are $2.50 each unless you go during happy hour which is 5pm to 7pm, in which case, they are $1. mon to fri? They were really freakin delicious!Painkiller $13 (way more expensive than I woulda hoped). I dont remember what was inside it exactly but I know it has pineapple and orange juice inside. Drink was a bit bland.Fish and chips was I believe $18? It tasted delicious! I loved it because the batter was very light and crisp, as opposed to some other places which give you a heavy crunchy batter. The batter compliments the fish on the inside, which btw was tender and thankfully not dry. I really like how the batter doesnt overshadow the taste of the fish. The fish is a bit bland on its own but with the tarter sauce,  it tastes yummy. I dont use vinegar or lemon with my fish and chips like some people do, so I cant tell you how it is. The tarter sauce isnt too heavy and doesnt taste particularly sour from vinegar and relish. I feel it is a good combination with the dish. The frys werent my fav (personal food preference haha I just really wanted fish), but they werent bad either.Overall the food is really good and the service is amazing too. The staff is really friendly and attentive to your needs. They will subtly check to see if you need refills or if youd like another drink, clean up your dishes, etc. The ambiance is also very calming :)",2,,

It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table to give us water or take a drink order and then another ~20 to get our drinks. I asked the lady where our drinks were and noted that it had been about 20 minutes, and she corrected me and said it had only been 10 (which was rude and factually inaccurate). When we were done, we were waiting for an Uber by the door because it was snowing, and we were told we had to stand outside. All around bad service.",,,
66,SuperFly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,36,9,1.0,9/19/2016,"THEIR LOBSTER ROLL DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THAT PICTURE AT ALL!!! Buyer beware. Very disappointed. When I saw the person next to me had ordered a lobster roll I waited until it arrived to make the call- to spend the  $30 for it would be a big deal for me. It looked good. it's wasn't nearly worth $30, as there was probably about 1/3 of a lb of lobster in the hot dog roll- but there was a nice size full  claw sticking out of her roll & a nice size portion of lobster continuing down the roll from what I could see.... but moments later after I ordered I heard her remarking to her friend that 1/2 of her lobster roll was empty.... I suppose I only saw it from one side.... Oh well too late. I ordered it. Big mistake. Waste of $30. When my $30 lobster roll arrived it was 70% bread. Almost no lobster really- and NO full claw in mine at all. Actually just some finely chopped lobster stuffed in the middle of the roll leaving about 2/3 of the hot dog roll empty. My first bite was all bread. That's when I realized the lobster inside was seriously lacking... Then there was a bite & 1/2 with some lobster. I shouldn't have to use the word some- for $30 there should have been ""some"" but it was really sad there was way less than some.  The last bite or 2 was all bread again. Just not pleased with these jokers. It's just a plain old fashioned rip off. Not sure what goes on in that kitchen but I can say that it's not nice. It's despicable  When you're serving people at least be fair. Be consistent. Don't rip them of. I could have went to the Palm Tribecca and gotten a 5 pound Nova Scotia lobster for $70. By the way- Grey Lady  is more than kinda dirty. It's gross. Not so much the kind you see,unless you know what you're looking for-  but sticky tables- omg. The floors. The bar. The bathrooms. The employees- even their clothes were dirty. & the place just plain smells of rotten funk you can smell. The  place that just emits rotten bar fumes.. Ever heard of bleach and elbow grease? Clean your darn bar! Also to add- my bucket of fries that came with the roll was filled with the ends of the bottom of the frier. Not one fry was longer than 1 inch. The other customers bucket was over flowing with nice looking long fries.. Mine was garbage served to me like I'm a piece of crap that deserves the garbage fries at the end of the last of the fries in the bottom of the frier and a chincy lobster roll.  I guess they don't think I deserve anything decent   for lunch for $30.  I guess my $30 wasn't worth their time. Not nice. Will definitely continue to make the trek downtown to visit the lower east side but will never go to Grey Lady again. & everyone I know & everyone they know and so on and so on will know that they are below the line. Shame on you. I hope the health department pays you a visit. Who know- perhaps I'll call the New York City dept. of weights & measures, the better business bureau and for sure the NYC department of Health & Mental Hygiene..",,5,

The table we sat at was wobbly which neither of us really noticed till someone from the restaurant came out and offered to level it out. Poor guy spent 10 minutes trying to fix it and kept going after we said that it didn't bother us. Very nice staff and amazing food. Only critique I had was that the food pretty much came out back to back appetizers/dinner.  We could've used a minute to breathe :)Would definitely recommend and will go back in the near future,1,1,1

We went after a festival at Broome and Allen street and couldn't find anything open to seat three people until we got back to Delancy. While choosing between tacos, Chinese and this place, we saw the seat open and took it for a Sunday brunch. The menu is extremely misleading due to its simple tone/decription considering how absolutely spectacular the food was both presented and tasted. This says a lot from a native new yorker! I got the poached eggs which came with ample salmon and sat on a hashbrown patty... it was unbelievable. We also ordered the hummus (which was ok - very lemony) a BLT and Fish and Chips.

So I showed him their webpage where it states this. He then sends over the manager who blatantly told me that they were NOT going honor their ""as advertised"" special of the night. Wait. What? Really?! I was so surprised and taken back with this. I told the manager guy that I thought that was a terrible business practice and that was disappointing.

Nothing special.Service:-Waiter was extremely attentive and friendly. He made sure we got everything we needed and checked up on us frequently.Interior:-Modern feel with touch of a fisherman's wharf.

I think I would have liked the tuna, but couldn't get past the burnt taste and had to pick it apart to eat it.  The fries were amazing, but for 23 bucks I expected more food.  Like, a lot more.  I guess that's what trendy New York places are like though?  The service was HORRIBLE.  So rude and in attentive.  There are not very many tables in the restaurant to begin with, so you would expect more attention.  Our waitress walked past our table 6 times, never asked how we were doing or if we needed anything, and it took forever to get the bill.Also, one last complaint.  The music was way too loud.  We sat 2 feet from each other, but I left with a scratchy throat from yelling over the music.  Won't be returning.",12,6,

I've been more than once (joke's on me), but most recently arrived late on a Saturday as the only male in a group with 4 girls. They were playing the usual doorman game despite the fact that there was nobody in line and the place was not packed. The bouncer ""got us in "" for a $150 minimum bar tab and then resumed yelling at a prospective male patron who had one too many penisis to enter alone.After listening to the coat check guy hit on a drunk girl 20 years his junior, I watched the bouncer basically corner her in the staircase and tell her she was beautiful.

But I think we hit it just the right time after brunch crowd before dinner. Our bartender Scott was super nice, patient, and down for a chat.

Brussel sprouts were excellent--the saving grace of the meal.The worst part though, as others indicate below, was the staff. We had to beg for water, beg to order, beg to pay--and it was empty.

The music was loud (mainly top 40 dance stuff), people were dancing and the booze was flowing.  Getting to the bar was a bit of a challenge, but the bar staff was attentive and cranked out drinks quickly.  Grey Lady is not the cutting edge of nightlife, but it is a good time and a reliable LES spot for you and your friends to grab some drinks.",1,1,

(Mr Hyde). I experienced both Jekyll and Hyde and would forewarn anyone to plan accordingly. My girlfriend was visiting from out of town and actually told us NYers about the spot. We were entertained by a photo exhibit and slidesshow that sadly was interrupted because of technical issues. Where else would we eat after the presentation but upstairs?! We were seated fairly quickly and ordered the crabcakes, 2 lobster rolls, Cesar salad (they ran out of biscuits by that point - thumbs down) and a platter of oysters. Oh not to mention wine and some beer. Let me just say that as a patron and one who was treated to dinner by my dear friend who spent a pretty penny on the meal (hello, the lobster roll was $28 for crying out loud!!!) we felt like cattle being herded. Once the clock struck Dr. Hyde time we were given the ""finish your drinks and get the _______ out treatment. The bill altogether was well over $200 and that was our farewell. (Please leave , we need to entertain pretentious 20's that require 3 bouncers and velvet rope outside. You finished your meal. Get out.)Embarrassingly a couple joined us before the fiasco unfolded to say hello as it was their Anniversary. They too got the, ""finish your drinks and get the _______ out."" Very sad. The lights were dimmed, tables were being carried out the front door, the music became an impediment to our intimate mini reunion and droves of college, 20 somethings stormed the place. By this point most of the tables were pushed to the side but ours. A hefty man came up to us, screaming over the loud music and proceeded to give us the ""get the _______ out"" gestures, grabbing our drinks that he fumbled with. Clearly he was not a bus boy but continued to juggle the glasses which were eventually removed BY THE BUS BOYS! Duuuuuuuuh!Sadly, if you have read this far you will find that other than the overpriced meal and maltreatment; the food was the essence of New England/ Nantucket; where apparently the owners hail. The Lobster rolls were divine and the fries were finger licking, the crab cakes a bit on the tiny side but devoured it quickly.

Our waiter was rude to us and never brought the tarter sauce we asked for. I had the blueberry lemonade through the Hooch app but it wasn't anything special.

Also its a peeve of mine when bartenders in higher end places (like this place is trying to be) don't dress up or even wear appropriate clothes. (T-shirt, and a baseball cap for this joint? No it doesn't work)Bathrooms were clean but wasn't clearly marked men's or women's. I only knew where to go because a guy came out of one of the bathrooms and I saw the urinal.

My friend had an egg and potato dish that was just meh. The mimosa's gave me a headache which usually means they use cheap sparkling wine to make them and use OJ to mask the cheapness.

121,Jerrica J.,"New York, NY",963,1360,221,5.0,7/17/2012,"One of my girlfriend's from out of town took me here last night for a nice dinner. Their food menu was small, but the minute I saw JONAH CRAB CLAWS I jumped at the opportunity to let the server know thats what I wanted before drinks. Sadly they were sold out. Maybe because its rare to find such in a restaurant. Especially Lower East Side! They really know what they are doing. It is an odd corner for a restaurant. The last restaurant that was there before was a Swedish restaurant that didn't do so well. With commercial rental on the rise in LES, not many make it unless its a Starbucks or some other corporate BS. I'm glad to see Gray Lady taking a risk and I know they will, if they keep putting massive amounts of lobster on their lobster roll. We started off with two trays of fresh oysters. These tasted like they were freshly caught Blue Points. Nice way to take my attention away from my sold out Jonah Crab claws.Simply BLOWN away by their GIGANTIC lobster roll. I think I seriously had a lobster claw in my potato roll that came off a 2lb lobster. OKAY... to compare this lobster roll. I just had Red Hook Lobster Pound and Lukes Lobster (both $16 each without fries or chips) in East Village recently. It's DOUBLE the size here at Gray Lady ($26 with celery salad and bowl of chips). More meat, and less butter and mayo. I actually tasted the whole claw and meat tucked under before anything such as the buttered toasted potato roll. The meat was literally spilling out. :)Fries that we ordered on the side were also delicious. Hand cut and made fresh to order. Who could say no? My boyfriend had Shishito peppers for appetizer. Those were damn good too. I don't think anyone disliked their food, because we finished everything in a matter of minutes.Drinks were good, and what is this CRAZY girl COLLEEN M on YELP talking about? The glasses of wine are REGULAR SIZED wine glasses. I was informed by the manager that Colleen happens to be an ex-employee of their bar and she's upset that she was FIRED so she goes and tries to damage the reputation of a newly opened spot. Please try this place and don't let some person who has one review and one friend on YELP ruin your taste buds. The prices on the menu is standard for NYC. For the amount of food you get, you deserve to pay that to keep an establishment afloat.",8,3,5
122,Eri T.,"Mineola, NY",2,26,7,5.0,5/22/2016,"First, let me begin by explaining that I don't like to experience the same place twice because I like to try new things. BUT I have been here on several occasions and let.me.tell.you. it is one of my favorite places!!First of all, the staff is simply delightful. They are funny, sweet, and best of all HONEST. My friends and I come here to eat and the staff has (on many occasions) told us that ""this meal is better than this meal"" or ""you are ordering too much let's start with less and you can always order more later."" As a restaurant visitor, there is nothing more honorable than when a waiter tells you the truth instead of trying to squeeze ever dollar out of you. I don't think that I've met one worker that I didn't absolutely LOVE. Secondly, THE FOOD. Best oysters and bacon-wrapped scallops EVER. EVER. EVER. Don't get me wrong, the rest of their food is amazing too! Additionally (and this also goes back to the amazing service) the food is easy to alter. For example, the last time i visited in mid-March, I had a religious fast (no meat) in addition to my lactose-intolerance (no dairy) and I was still able to have appetizers and a main course and leave fully satisfied.Third, the drinks. Awesome. Need i say more? I don't know what's better: the bartenders or the drinks. Fourth, the ambiance and decor. The place is not the biggest but definitely comfortable. They often have live bands which are fun, and some even take requests! Everything from the bathrooms, bar, wall decor, to the dj booth fit so perfectly together and welcome you. Needless to say, I'm a huge fan and will definitely be coming back again!",,,

Delicious nonetheless. The awesome part- they had thrown away my leftover wings by accident...it happens, I work in the industry as well...I was approached by the manager, I believe, he apologized profusely and offered new wings to go and a beer on the house....my bartender also came back and apologized.

They didn't have most of the ingredients so the drink options were very limited. To eat we order a chowder but were served a soup (meaning it was the consistency of soup not chowder) being disappointed I couldn't enjoy the soup. My sister liked it but again not enough to eat it all. Then we had the lobster roll. This is where the three stars truly come in. I never like these as they're far too mayonnaisey and skimp out on the lobster. This had mayo on the side, lots of lobster and it actually tasted delicious. Also ate a salad I forget which it taste good, better than the soup. Over all I'd say if you are around this isn't a terrible option and if you like lobster rolls it's a great option.",,1,

The clam chowder was really well seasoned and, unlike a lot of other chowder I've had, actually had texture. It wasn't just soft potato, soft clams, soft overcooked veggies. There was good crunch from the veggies, only heightened by the oyster crackers. The oysters themselves are priced as fairly as any other oyster, and were tasty and really well cleaned. I wasn't a fan of the peppercorns in the mignonette sauce, but that's just personal preference. The service was good but not intrusive!Four stars!",3,,

The wait staff were very attentive, often asking if we would like another drink before we were 3/4 of the way done with our previous ones. We got an array of oysters and they were great, at $3/oyster. We placed an order for bread and butter about 5 minutes after we ordered the oysters, hoping that it would come before our entrees, but it did not. The entrees were very generous portions, my bf got the roasted chicken which looked and tasted great. Unfortunately, I made the wrong choice and got fish and chips. It wasn't the wrong choice in that the food tasted bad, it was just that my meal was absent of any veggies and was all fried. I was not in the mood for it, which brings into question my ordering, not the taste. The chef also sent out free beignets for dessert, which was very nice. Overall, not a great food experience for me, but I cannot give less stars just because I made poor ordering choices.",,,

The service was OK; they forgot our cutlery twice, and while our original waiter was super nice and attentive, the others seemed a bit disorganized and disinterested.  I think I would come back here again for brunch, and maybe to try some of their other items, not a bad find.",,,

My cousin had to flag down someone else and ask them to cook it. Only when i took my phone out to start writing this review did someone come over and apologize. Though to his credit he apologized. But it was raw ground beef, not some nice cut of steak that tastes great rare and bloody. The crappy service to correct the error did it in for me. I rarely give reviews for bad food. But if the service blows, im calling you out.",1,1,

Yes, they did flub my first Manhattan a year ago, but I know now that actually mix a killer one--possibly my favorite ever. And they're big and strong. One is enough to make you sufficiently tipsy.",3,,2
138,Toni-Marie L.,New England,0,20,39,1.0,7/30/2016,"I ordered the lobster soup.  The soup base tasted nothing of lobster and had a very aggressive flavor of carmelized onions.  In any lobster dish, the lobster should be the star of the show and should not be drowned out by stronger flavors.  We also ordered the Eggs Benedict, which is not served on an English muffin here, but instead is served on a giant tater tot of some sort.   While we enjoy oozing yolks, the eggs were undercooked.  We couldn't finish our meals.  Both my husband and I have stomach aches from this $80 lunch.  We normally have cast iron stomachs and can eat just about anything.  Unfortunately, this place does not execute classics well.  Definitely not our cup of tea.",2,,

140,Emily G.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,4,0,2.0,7/1/2014,"Oysters were yummy.  Nice variety.  Went there wanting steamers.  They were out.  Replaced steamers with little necks.  They were small and there were about 12 in the pot.  Steamed by themselves and broth served separately which did not help the flavor as clam juice should have blended with broth while cooking. Also served with brown butter which was overpowering and unnecessary.  Simple drawn butter would have been fine.   Ordered the blue fish pate.  They were out.  Service was friendly but needed some amp-up in the professionalism department.  Sat for a while without menus.  Then she came to take our order, but we had no menus.  Hmmm.  Brought is wine with no glasses.  Then when brought glasses, didn't open the wine and pour it for us.  Though it was a screw top bottle, pouring wine is simply a part of service I'd expect (not that I can't do it myself, but still...)  Tough location for sitting outside on Delancey.  Smelly and noisy.  Want so much more for this place, but this is the second time it's just fallen short.  If you JUST want oysters, then hit it up.  Otherwise, many other seafood places in the neighborhood that are far better.",1,,

We had 3 different types of east coast oysters and tasted exactly as they were described.  I wasn't overly impressed with the bread but loved the Brussel sprouts. As a main I had the bucatini which was delicious. The lobster was sweet and the bread crumb topping was a nice crunch. The sauce wasn't too heavy. My friend had the ragu which isn't on the online menu but is on there restaurant menu. Service was okay.

142,Nina P.,"Manhattan, NY",47,278,4,4.0,9/6/2013,"Pretty sizable place located just a couple blocks away from Hotel Chantelle and the DL.  Drinks are $12. Not cheap by LES standards but I live on the west side and this is standard, so I didn't have an issue with the drink prices. Also, the cocktails looked good and well-made.Service - Pretty prompt. A little too prompt, if anything, because this one waiter guy kept trying to take away people's dishes when they weren't anywhere near done. The main waitress seemed a little on the cranky side, but then again our party was unorganized and taking a while to decide what we wanted.Food - Pretty good, actually. The fries in particular are amazing. A + for the manager of this place. A friend and I ordered a dish to split (fish and chips) and realized it wasn't really enough for the two of us. So maybe a few minutes later we ordered another dish, which took 30+ minutes to come out. At this point we were on our way out to meet up with friends elsewhere and the two of us barely ate a few bites before wanting to leave. He was kind enough to come over and ask if there was a problem with the dish. Long story short, he ended up taking it off the bill even though we didn't ask him to. It was very nice of him and not necessary by any means. That itself may convince me to return if I'm ever in the area again.",3,1,1

Our waitress was really nice and hardworking (she had long blonde hair) but it looked like she was the only one working. The other staff just stood by the bar talking to each other. So, it took a minute for her to take so many tables' orders.Drinks were prompt and tasty. I ordered my tuna burger rare and it was very good. The sauce was delicious and the fries were great. My boyfriend's egg dish came in a skillet and had about equal parts oil to egg. At first I teased him about his picky eating habits but when I tried it, it really was drowned in grease. Really heavy. At one point, he turned the skillet to the side and poured some of it out. Portions are small but I don't mind that as much.It was a super windy day so we asked to close the door but were told that the owners considered it a pet peeve. The staff was nice enough to blast the heat but the owners need to get it together cuz the entire restaurant just sat there WITH THEIR COATS ON! No wonder the whole staff was in one corner of the restaurant, huddled. They were freezing.The decor is really nice though. It just wasn't comfortable.",1,,

It's a little dark for a Baby Shower and decor doesn't really fit but for just a  regular birthday party it would work very well.  And it still was fine for our needs. Food was great.  We had a first course of appetizers and cheese plates.  It was a lot of food that was quickly devoured by our party.  Our main food was a ton of French toast with fresh fruit and bacon.  The French toast was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and had a hint of orange to it. And the bacon was SUPER crispy, just the way we like it.  The drinks are about $12 a pop  but that did not stop us from drinking.  They were not weak drinks and they had a good variety. By the end of the shower there was more then one person who was feeling a little tipsy.  And John was SO helpful! The guests kept ordering drinks from him and I had to remind them that he was not our waiter but the events coordinator but he took it in stride and would get us our drinks anyway.Everything worked out very well and everyone had a great time.  I would come back for just food and drinks.  And will be adding it to my list of possible locations for birthday parties in the future!",3,1,1

They made some good recommendations for the kind I like, so we were all good on that front.Cocktails were tasty as was the food, and the crowd was fashionable and appealing. I'd go back for sure.

I got there sort of late and expected to wait in line for a little while, but to my surprise the line was pretty short and I got to stand on it for the full length of eternity! The bouncers were amazing at walking back and forth between inside and out, they almost made it look easy--I was genuinely impressed. One of them informed us all that no one would be getting in any time soon multiple times and we didn't even have to ask! Inside, the actual bar looked crowded and squishy like the inside of a very fun sardine can. The service could have been great or horrible, but I have no idea because I never went inside. I also don't know what to tell you about the drinks, bartenders, crowd, bathrooms, ambience, or food, but boy are those bouncers good at letting you know they let too many people in!After thirty minutes of shivering through the polar vortex and what I can only describe as actual frost bite on all ten of my toes, I hailed a cab. I HAVE TO SAY, I had a tremendously wonderful experience finding a cab. There were so many, it was an absolute delight. And five big fat stars to the driver who delivered me seamlessly to my next destination. What a guy!Sigh, perhaps one day I'll be able to toss another star onto this place's review. Perhaps I'll even be able to judge a cocktail...but for now, my lengthy experience of freezing my nipples off outside gets one lonely star.",6,2,
155,Lorenzo C.,"London, United Kingdom",0,1,0,1.0,1/26/2017,"The night of the 18th, I had a terrible experience with coworkers at Grey Lady. It was not particularly busy when we arrived and after ordering our first round of drinks (1 cocktail and 3 beers), the bartender asked if we would like to keep our tab open or close it. My friend handed the bartender his card replying that he would like to close out HIS tab. When the bartender dropped off the check, it had been run for the ENTIRE tab. After asking if we could get a refund for the drinks that's my friend shouldn't have paid for, the bartender claimed that it would be pointless because a refund would take a few days to process and that there was a two drink minimum on card transactions. After asking if we could get a refund for the second time, the bartender got argumentative, removed our drinks and told us that we could get out after claiming the Grey Lady was his bar. We said we would leave as soon as our drinks were refunded, which the bartender reluctantly processed and furiously threw the receipt on the bar in front of us. After that he start pointing the fact that I was European and I only wanted arguing with him when I was just asking for a simple refund for my friend card and have the transaction on mine. I don't know what was up the Grey Lady bartender's ass, but we have never been served or would serve anyone in the way that he did. He should have confirmed the payment situation with us and notified us of the two drink minimum earlier than he did. Once the payment mistake was made, he should have worked to find an amicable solution without getting defensive or argumentative. What a beginner bartender.",1,1,1

157,Katie A.,"Queens, NY",143,121,0,3.0,4/15/2013,"My review might be a bit skewed because I went here for a birthday party. Our table was in the back room and there were about 20 people. Because there were so many of us, the service was horrible. The waitress was guaranteed a huge tip, but she really struggled to get everyone's order. It also became problematic fo her to bring out everyone's food out at the same time. So half of our party finished before the other half was even served....The food however was great. The bacon wrapped scallops were cooked perfectly and the tobacco gravy was awesome. The shisito peppers were delicious and they have oysters on a half shell for a decent price. I had the lobster pot pie, which is more like a condensed lobster bisque with huge chunks of lobster and veggies and a large puff pastry round on the side to dunk into the broth. It was flavorful with just the right amount of vermouth. I would definitely come back for that. The lobster roll is huge and stuffed with lobster too. The fish and chips were decent. Flakey white fish with a crispy batter, but they were bland. One kind of annoying part was that the drinks here are very watered down. We had a few round of shots and the Jameson was almost clear. Total rip off. They also don't have a very inspired cocktail menu. All in all- great food. However the rest was very lacking. It also becomes somewhat of a hipster bar after 9. It was packed and the decour was lackluster.",2,1,1

Wouldn't let anyone in. Manager was useless and actually had no control over the bouncers, who were the most disrespectful, rudest people I've ever encountered. The crap the manager pulled was it was too crowded so ppl would be let in slowly. Waited 30 mins and no one from my party, but tons of people from other parties were let in. I let the manager know over and over I was upset and irate and he didn't give a shit. Bouncers said we ""had too many dudes"" which was crap bc no one told them we would have only girls with us. So glad we left that dump and went to Gallery Bar, where they were happy to accommodate all my friends and we had a total blast dancing the night away.

159,Diego R.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,100,0,3.0,1/19/2013,"I'm livid right now. Joined a gay friend for an evening of catching up and telling him to get his fucking hands off me. He ordered beer, I ordered Jameson's on the rocks, then Bushmills on the rocks. Then we got the bill. He spent about $6.50 for each craft beer, and I spent almost $12 for each of my drinks. But here's the rub: I was charged an extra $2 per drink because I had ""top shelf"" (!) on the rocks. That's $14 each in total! After rubbing my eyes and asking the bartender for an explanation, realizing that it didn't make sense, I asked the hostess on my way out, and she gave me a more articulate yet still-the-same explanation. Her non-verbals confirmed it's a bullshit charge.I don't like bullshit charges - and I reckon neither do you. But it's also deceitful for the bartender to not indicate that just because I fancy some frozen water in my booze, he's gonna ask for $2 more. It's like when a waiter asks if you want their special sauce on your burger but fails to indicate that it's an extra-cost item - poor customer service, I tells ya!Otherwise, the crowd was prettier than me, and the food looked good, but like fuck am I coming back. The people who are running this place should be ashamed of the sham they're perpetrating. (And, then, to add insult to injury, sales tax too? Fuck you, Bloomberg!)ADDENDUM:Received a note from a proprietor of this establishment:""The charge is for a drink that is served up or on the rocks and is not a charge for ice but merely because those drinks are a larger serving of alcohol.  A drink in a a martini or rocks glass that is exclusively or primarily alcohol will usually be about double the amount, so it is an easier way to charge for it than charging double price.  The charge is not for ice.  It is pretty common in New York city bars, though not always included in the bill.  Sorry for any confusion.""I responded:1. I'll certainly adjust my rating because I believe in customer service and handling it with grace, as you've exhibited. I also hate fellow Yelpers who give negatives for dumb reasons - I've even seen one where the person didn't sample the food! - and I assure you I won't be that guy.2. Shouldn't the bartender ask me if I want a larger serving? Or is that just par for the course for a Sat night? Believe it or not, sometimes I'm on a budget. While due diligence falls upon me to ask about the prices, I certainly wouldn't have expected $14 for a drink on the rocks when a beer is $6 - a much more reasonable price, all things being equal.3. Perception is important!----In the end, I appreciate the reply and have adjusted my rating accordingly . . . and next time, I'll just get a $6 beer.",7,2,2

I ordered some well drink (cranberry and vodka I think?) for my first drink. Then moved on to their speciality cocktails. I ordered the ""Life is Good"" drink which came in a large drinking glass. It was sprite, red bull, vodka and cranberry.  My second drink was the rum pig which is some kind of specialty punch that packed so much of a punch I can't remember what was in it! whoops...The ambience is nice, decor is sophisticated.

I said hello and hastily left, since my night was now ruined. When leaving I said to the bouncers who had been so rude ""I hope you have a great night"" in a kind and sincere tone. They then stared at me and repeated the words back to me in a very offensive and childish way. I will never be returning to this venue and neither will any of my family or friends.

170,Diane L.,"New York, NY",101,55,16,3.0,4/22/2013,"Went here on a Friday night because the outside looked rather classy, but we soon found out it was not as fahncy as it had appeared.The crowd all seemed to have drunkenly stumbled in from another place because everyone was seriously loud and belligerent which is fine because it was a Friday night, but if you're looking for a place where you don't have to scream (literally) across the table then I wouldn't come here.My burger was decent. I've had better but it was alright, nothing special really.The main pickle (speaking of pickle, my burger came with one which I appreciate!) I had with this place was the music. This is only based on one night, but the DJ was spinning pretty cheesy glam metal, and he/she would also occasionally throw in a random turntable scratch. And it was weird...Really good location, but don't think I'll be back.",1,1,1
171,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",243,553,33,4.0,9/26/2013,"This place is nuts on a weekday night.  It seemed like everyone came from work and stayed until, well, after we left.  Finally a great dance party where you do not have to be judged in order to enter.  The music is a little wacky though.  They have a decent selection of boos, and with the amount of people the bartenders are pretty on point.  If it was not for Lissa's review I would have been completely unaware of the subtle nautical theme.  We snuck into the backroom where there is another bar for parties.  It is a nice option so you do not have to deal with the alarming amount of yuppies in the front room.  After writing this review, I changed my 3 star to a 4 star, because I really did have a lot of fun.",,2,
172,Eve L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",325,307,84,4.0,6/5/2013,"Loved this place - solid cocktails, excellent waitstaff, and good music! The ambience is nice too...I especially liked the white lights all around the bar. Most of all, I have to give a shout out for the food. The lobster roll was loaded w/ huge chunks of fresh lobster and the apps were impressive; house smoked fish pate (perfectly seasoned), a special roasted hot pepper I've never heard of (in all my years of eating and growing unique peppers), huge bacon wrapped scallops, and a perfect tri-colored beet salad. I would gladly visit Grey Lady again and most certainly recommend it to other NYC diners!",1,,
173,Caesar R.,"Somerville, MA",917,946,20,4.0,2/17/2013,"The 3.5 gets rounded up to the honorable 4 because of the food, but service was mediocre at best.  (The busboys work hard though clearing the tables, so that's a plus).  Friday night at around 7:15, this place is packed and the bar is hopping.  The place is on an easy accessible corner of Delancy and Allen streets.  You enter the place on Allen Street, just an FYI.  Greeted by the hostess with a smile and an offer to be seated right away before the rest of my party arrived was nice.  I opted for the bar.  Everyone in the party showed up minutes later.  We were then seated after closing out the tap at the bar at a window table.  Great for people watching.  It took a long time before anyone came over to greet the table and ask if we wanted another round of drinks or offer the fourth in our party who didn't have a drink yet.  So, we figured we better order....oysters, lobster roll, lobster pot pie, smoked bluefish dip, bacon wrapped scallops, the special crab dip and rounded it out with a burger for dessert.  Everyone loved the two lobster dishes.  The lobster roll had unbelievably large chunks of lobster on a delicious buttered roll.  The lobster pot pie was devoured in minutes.  The oysters tasted really fresh, we tried 1/2 dozen from Maine and 1/2 dozen from Rhode Island.  All were consumed instantaneously.  The crap dip was decent, but the saltines proved to be a tab remedial for the dish.  The smoked bluefish was the surprise of the evening.  Everyone seemed to really like this dish.  No one complained about the scallops wrapped in bacon with a mayo type of sauce on the plate.  All in all, forgo the hiccups with the service cause the food is definitely worth it.  Definitely get oysters and at least the lobster roll.",2,,
174,Lissa V.,"New York, NY",567,242,4,5.0,8/13/2012,"For my 200th review: Grey Lady - Nantucket comes to the Lower East Side.With a prominently seafood inspired menu, The Grey Lady hits a home run. For those of you who don't know, the Grey Lady is the nickname of Nantucket because of the amount of fog around the island. However, there's nothing foggy about this new LES restaurant, as they've hit the New England nautical theme on the head. Fresh daily oyster selections and an excellent lobster roll are the headliners, but this place has a lot going for it. Excellent service, a great bar space, and killer drinks just to name a few. The atmosphere is laid back yet very welcoming. The ladies and I headed over here for a Sunday Funday brunch*. We had an Urban Daddy deal that scored us each a lobster roll and unlimited drinks... Sunday Funday for sure! The space has a big open feel to it with lots of light streaming in, perfect for a Sunday Funday boozy brunch.Our waitress (now our homegirl) Mary was the only server on brunch duty and still managed to do an excellent job keeping up with everyone's requests and making sure we constantly had full cocktails. In short, she was amazing (I promised her a shout out!) The oysters were excellent as was the fresh watermelon and feta salad that we split. The lobster roll was unreal. Granted it is $25 but there was so much lobster falling out of the fresh brioche roll that I had to eat some with a fork before I could dive into my first bite. It also had minimal mayo - a prerequisite for an excellent L-roll** Another friend had the grilled cheese and was impressed. They also have traditional egg and french toast selections for brunch as well. I'd also love to come back for dinner sometime and check out the fresh fish selections. All in all we had a lovely afternoon here, leaving full and happy. Also pretty drunk... thank you unlimited drink deal & very cute bartender!!*Side Note: One of these lovely ladies absolutely HATES the LES and trekked all the way over there from the UWS for the first time in about 3 years due to the prospect of this lobster roll and Nantucketish scene. **The anti-LES friend is also very anti-mayo. She even owns a No Mayo tee shirt (don't worry she didn't wear that to Grey Lady).",17,15,15
175,Aadi S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/21/2015,"I went for brunch yesterday afternoon with my girlfriend expecting a nice meal.  The menu looked good and it wasn't too busy.  The restaurant had maybe 6-8 tables occupied, not packed by any means.The waitress taking our order was nice and brought our drinks quickly.  The major problem with our experience was the time it took to get our food.  I ordered the Spanish Frittata with the side of country toast and avocado.  My girlfriend ordered scrambled eggs and a side of home fries.Normally an order like that would take 15 mins, 20 minutes max.  We waited and waited a good 45 minutes before asking our waitress how long it would be.  Direct quote from her was ""I have absolutely no idea.""  End of statement...so naturally we asked well could you check??  10 mins later she came over and said it would be 5 more minutes.We waited a good 7 minutes for good measure, still no food.  We got up and left.  The worst part is, they were acting like it was no big deal and that this was a common occurrence.I signed up on yelp just to post this because I've lived in New York for more than 5 years and I've never experienced this.  They definitely need to get their act together whether its getting more resources in the kitchen or more proactive service staff.",,,

We didn't need the reservation since the place had open tables when we got there.Partner loved his whiskey diablo and we enjoyed the clam chowder, lobster roll, and lobster pot pie. My lobster roll was stuffed with meat and really delicious. Our food was also really well timed with warm entries coming out very quickly after we finished the chowder. Our waitress was really nice and the host (owner?) came to check on us during the meal. We'll definitely be back. On top of the great food and good portions, It was a really beautiful place to be and had a very stylish crowd.",,,

179,Christopher K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,4,5.0,12/30/2013,"I hosted a holiday party in their private dining room and had a great experience. The chefs made some great appetizers including a flight of Oysters, seafood tower and a really well prepared gourmet cheese platter to kick things off.  Meanwhile we had our own private bar with great service, a fantastic selection of beer and wine. I had the lobster pot pie for dinner and was blown away. Everyone else's dishes looked delicious but I was beyond happy with my order. Separately I have been for dinner and split the lobster roll and Skate with my wife. It was all amazing.Overall Grey Lady is a nice find for something out of the ordinary in NYC with a cozy dinner atmosphere that progresses into a nice bar scene.",,,

First red flag!Oysters tasted AWFUL and smelled fishy and briny - I ate one and knew it wasn't for me.The menu lacks any selection there are literally like 10 things on it. The apps were tiny, poorly prepared and overpriced.The dark & Stormy was cheap and nasty.Lobster roll tasted waaaaaaay too buttery and the dinner special of sea bass was disgusting.Here's the best part after this review - someone named Glen M. emailed me this - I wonder if he emailed to everyone else who rated this dump a one star.How can a lobster roll be too buttery? How can a simple piece of crispy fish be disgusting? I dont get it. Why are $8-$10 small plates too expensive?The oysters are wild oysters from Malpeque bay in Maine. Cooks Cocktail. To the unrefined they may seem to briny.jpshellfish.c...The reason the restaurant was ""empty"" was because the space was rented out for a private event at 10:00pm for a post movie premier event and we declined reservations after 8.Get your facts straight.",2,1,

The bar is particularly swanky and trendy and seemed like a great place to hang out before dinner.The food on the other hand was just okay for me. We tried all the entrees on the menu: the oysters, the special fish & chips, the burger, and the swordfish. All of which met standards but were not outstanding.  The oysters were fresh and full of flavor, so no complaints there. The burger however, was very dry and not very good. The swordfish was a bit too charred for my taste and left an unsavory bitter taste in my mouth, and the fish and chips were good, but not great.Over all, a great place for hanging out, oysters, and wine--but the food is just okay.",1,,

One of them being it was just down right way too crowded. I had to walk through the poorly separated restaurant in order to just find a place to stand until my friend arrived. Honestly someone eating is going to get their drinks or food knocked onto the floor at some point. Why not actually split the bar and restaurant area in half. Besides that they had no options for cider, just this one that I really did not like. Finally when I did have an area to stand this girl kept knocking into me nonstop, so I moved down a little ... and she still keeps knocking into me, and I had a hard time getting the bartender's attention. The bathroom area was an interesting place... they had this random paddle just chilling outside of all the bathrooms. Overall I'm not a big fan of this place and I probably will not be back.",,,

(They were awesome BTW--super fresh with all their briny liquor in tact, and the mignonette was bomb.) Grey Lady is warm and inviting, and the decor is super cozy without being the slightest bit schlubby. Service was great--Chris was entertaining and on-point. I'm excited to have a place to glom  bivalves so close to work. I'm probably going to be a regular sooner than later. Nice spot.",,,

I have however ended up here many a nights to dance and imbibe. It's always a very preppy buttoned up crowd for the most part- think LES hipster/prep/creative some random suits. The only downside for me is that on most occasions I've gone it's so packed you can hardly move let alone dance. My nights at Grey Lady have been primarily spent wedging through a crowd only to have to relocate moments later because there is no room to breathe. There's also a second room that while the main room is jam PACKED this room has been almost empty and pumping out intense dance beats. Mixed feelings about the whole thing really, but I'll be back.",,,
