0,Roberto A.,"New York, NY",55,283,1,4.0,8/4/2010,"Conveniently located for us, Highline Deli is open 24hrs and offers some deli staples like soda, milk, juice, cookies, and also pizza and sandwiches.My girlfriend and I were moving on a Friday night as the hot Chelsea club spewed throngs of people. We were starving and this place was open. The pizza is surprisingly tasty, a slice with pepperoni is $3... (surprisingly, not bad for Manhattan).The staff is incredibly friendly, helping us make sure that our U-haul wasn't ticketed since we were parked at a taxi depot area. We returned a few hours later to refuel, and we even got like 50 cents off our order. Yes, not much, but it is nice to know that an establishment appreciates your business. A few days later, my girlfriend asked them for a bit of mayo since we forgot to get some at the supermarket, and like pros, they came through with one of those little plastic serving cups.They have only been open for a few months, but they have a huge hd tv. The space has a really large backyard area that is supposed to be fixed up for outdoor seating, according to the owner.The only bad things I can think about are the lack of variety of deli products (only some cookies, no ice cream, chips, etc). Also, they do not carry ham.",,,
1,Nichole W.,"New York, NY",11,38,46,5.0,1/14/2018,Here almost once a day. Strange to read bad reviews. The guys crush it behind the bar. Best breakfast sandwiches whipped up in seconds. Consistent and quick.,,,
2,Mike C.,"Caldwell, NJ",46,7,1,1.0,2/25/2016,Don't order from here.  It's a joke.   All i ordered was an egg sandwich with bacon and asked extra crispy.    The sandwich came and bacon was RAW.    Nasty.,,,
3,Sonia A.,"Long Beach, CA",29,3,0,1.0,1/16/2014,"Worst customer service. Placed a delivery order while staying at a hotel nearby.  They never asked for my number. After waiting an hour, I called them back to ask what happened to my order and they replied that the delivery guy left 15 mins. earlier. After waiting another 30 mins. I called again and they said they didn't know where the delivery guy was and then said he had gotten into an accident. I call B.S. Will never order food from them again. Worst dining experience and customer service.",1,1,1
