1,Lisa Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",108,393,2034,4.0,11/9/2018,"*reads 3.5 stars*Best biscuits ever? Naw, they're just alright. I was craving biscuits and gravy and came across POST for Saturday brunch. If you're seeking a bit of southern lovin', complimented by white-picket-and-by-the-beach-type decor, then this spot is for you. The menu is selective but there's something for everyone--salad lovers, vegetarians who love biscuits, even pancake lovers. Coffee, tea, soda, Bloody Mary's? Check check to those too.What we ordered:BISCUITS AND GRAVY - literally a biscuit submerged and doused with white gravy and house made chicken sausage bits. The gravy was a bit bland for my taste but lots and lots of hot sauce helped alleviate the situation. Side of egg over easy? Definitely yes. Side note: I still think Jane's on Houston has the best biscuits & gravy in NYC.PORK BISCUIT - the pulled duroc pork was very flavorful and moist. Unfortunately, as a whole, this biscuit may have been on the drier end if crumbly biscuits isn't your thing. THE WHITE WOLF - It's mint tea, but softer, more elegant,  and all-around just lovelier. Great stuff that compliments & doesn't overpower the biscuits.",2,,1
2,Cree P.,"Jamaica, NY",152,127,351,4.0,9/30/2018,"I came here the other day with a couple girlfriends, because I've been wanting to check this place out for quite some time. When we get there it was a full house, however it's not a large restaurant to begin with. The seating is set up like a bar and you end up sitting next to your friends and/or a random stranger. The food here is phenomenal! I ordered the biscuits and gravy sandwich, my friend ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, and my other friend ordered the granola bowl and a biscuit. Now I will say these are some of the best biscuits that I've had in the city! They are so well baked, the perfect combination of soft in the middle and a little crunchy on the outside. And they are super battery, you could probably eat them by themselves if you wanted to. My friends and I ate everything and we were so full because the food was so hearty.The one thing I don't really care for is that when you arrive and there's a wait, they don't take names down, at least this is what the lady told me when I originally called. So they'll give you an estimated waiting time and you just have to wait outside the restaurant since it's a first come first serve basis. However, aside from that their food is so good, which makes the wait so worth it! I'll so be bringing more friends back here!",,,
3,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",75,143,82,5.0,11/10/2018,"This was a yelp find after the place my friend and I were going to go to ended up having an hour and a half plus wait. So we ended up at POST, a tiny but amazing brunch place where you cannot go wrong choosing anything on the menu. I was also surprised by the care they put into their coffee. Being super sleep deprived I went for both and espresso and americano and I have to say - both were elevated far above my expectations. Then came the food - a complex tasty rosemary biscuit with bacon tomato, perfectly cooked egg, and added avocado. So delicious and filling. If you are planning a Saturday brunch catchup with an old friend, I highly recommend this place. No more than two however as it's quite cozy in there! ;)",,,

6,Carrie L.,"New York, NY",379,37,47,5.0,7/23/2018,"Stumbled upon this cute little brunch spot on Sunday and I can definitely attest to all the high reviews. The menu is quite small but there is a biscuit (or something) for everyone. I got the sausage biscuit which I personally thought of as an upgrade from your classic sausage, egg, and cheese. The biscuit was so buttery and soft and the house made sausage tasted wonderful. The side salad was also a nice healthy addition!I would highly recommend this place!! It is a bit hard to find amongst the busy bar/brunch scene, but make sure to come early since it is a fairly small place.",1,,

9,Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",110,160,330,5.0,6/14/2018,"What a hidden gem! This is a tiny home-y restaurant in the east village that makes incredible comfort food. The menu is limited but caters to many tastes, with most brunch entrees under $12.My boyfriend and I came on a gorgeous Saturday around noon and sat at the only remaining seats by the window. Though the other seats were all at the bar, we were still given attentive service which I appreciated. I got the sausage biscuit and he got the biscuits and gravy. Sausage biscuit was heavenly. The biscuit was perfectly flaky and buttery, more on the fluffy than dense side when it comes to biscuits. The sausage was moist and flavorful, and was sandwiched between the biscuits along with the melty cheese and runny egg. UGH so simple, so good! The side salad added a healthy touch ;)Biscuits and gravy were great as well, and perfect for the very hungry bruncher. The gravy was rich and creamy, perfect to soak the biscuits in. This was the only place that came close to my all-time favorite comfort brunch in the city Jacob's Pickles. I highly recommend this place to all. Extra praise for the reasonable prices. Not the best for large parties though; I think the whole restaurant can only hold maybe 12 people.",,,
10,Anne R.,"New York, NY",839,445,5141,5.0,3/29/2018,"You had me at ""we'd never use anything other than real maple syrup.""  The mainstay here is biscuit egg sandwich combos, but on weekends they change it up with a pancake stack- which was just what I needed for that sweet & savory combo to get me through the day.  My husband couldn't stop eating my pancakes, damnit.  Carmelized tops with cake-like insides.  Just another reason to come back again.The place is small, but just when we thought we'd need to be on a wait, they pulled a magic trick and put us behind the bar with extra place settings.  Get in before 10am in the weekend if you don't have enough patience- but if you do- it will be worth the wait. Free refills on hot coffee too!",4,2,2
11,Jon W.,"New York, NY",3012,290,1008,5.0,3/20/2018,"POSTING UP!The post is your perfect brunch spot for two! maybe that night after brunch.When you walk in you see they have a 2 seats by the window a long bar and a 4 seat table in the back. This place you can say has got that cozy vibe which is awesome if you're looking to relax with some delicious comfort food with strong coffee and fun delicious cocktails.I have been here twice now, first time getting the sausage biscuit and the second time getting the pancake stack with sausage and they both impressed. The lady got the avocado biscuit which is packed with avocado they do not skimp. The biscuits have a perfectly crisp outside with a soft crumbly inside you can not get it made any better. In addition the food is not greasy which is what you would expect it to be. For the cocktails the lady loved them while I was chugging down the coffee which was not bitter and had a nutty flavor which was really strong.In short:- Awesome brunch- Friendly Staff- biscuit spot- strong coffee- great cocktails- only 1 table it is all bar style seating",17,6,12
12,Deki T.,"San Francisco, CA",100,28,39,5.0,2/16/2018,"A little late with my review but I came here for brunch when I was bison New York last winter. This place is esthetically pleasing and a little hard to find. It's family owned business and the staff is really sweet and friendly. I loved the food here! The coffee was also really good. It was weird because when we were looking for this Resturant we couldn't find it and thought it was closed because the doors were shut however, I am guessing the owner doesn't want people to find it out about it( if you don't know about it then the service they provide becomes more authentic and it will have a small targeted customer base. The ambiance inside is really chill and you feel like your somewhere in Europe. Would definitely come back here!",2,2,2
13,Diana F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,22,8,5.0,10/21/2018,"Cute place. The biscuits are genuinely delicious. I also give major points for having Irving Farm coffee in house - the best in NYC. Cozy, if a little crowded. Would return.",,,

15,Hana S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",396,584,191,4.0,6/18/2018,"The biscuit sandwiches here are great! I'm not sure why you'd order anything else for brunch when they have both meat and veggie (avocado) options. They sadly didn't have AC so we felt like we were suffocating :( I think the bacon biscuit is the best because the biscuit has rosemary bits in it, so it adds a layer of flavor rather than just being a plain biscuit. Plus it has a GOOD amount of bacon in it. My friends ordered the other kinds (chicken sausage & avo) so I compared a little bit and was happy with my choice.",4,,1
16,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",104,186,772,4.0,7/27/2018,"Came here on a Sunday morning earlyish, around 10am. There were only two other diners in here at this time, but the place filled up quickly. Post features a varied lunch menu, with options for both carnivores and herbivores alike, and has some salads, but what they are most well-known for, is their biscuits. We ordered the sausage biscuit and the avocado biscuit, and both were served at the same time. Both biscuits had a nice, firm texture, accentuated perfectly by the egg that was cooked just right. Though the sausage biscuit was slightly tastier than the avocado biscuit, both were excellent. The avocado also had a generously giant serving, enough to make any millennial salivate.Decor is all white, minimal and charming. They played music reminiscent of a Caribbean nation that morning. Service was friendly and warm. Can't say anything more, except that this should be your next brunch spot.",,,
17,Baramee C.,"Chicago, IL",752,628,621,5.0,1/6/2018,"After finding Clinton Baking Co had a 45 min wait and the hungry constantly growing, we looked for a nearby place to grab some food. Wafels & Dinges was near, but wasn't quite what we were looking for though it smelled absolutely delicious.While Yelping around...I saw POST. The reviews said reservations were a good idea, but there was a review that said the person just popped in for breakfast. I figured it was at least worth a shot...and if that didn't work...Root & Candy and Wafels & Dinges were down the road.By the way, BEST IDEA EVER. We got there just in time. There were two seats just opening up at the bar (there really is only bar seating). The place was small cozy, but in the best way possible. The service was great; you didn't feel rushed. There were lines of people, which was nice...but we did get there before more people started to stream in.The menu is small, but from my experience I'd say anything you got would be a safe bet. I don't think you can go wrong. The cappuccino my boyfriend got was a bit on the small side. The food...was oh so good and with hot sauce options. Yes!!!The food:Sausage, Egg & Cheese Biscuit - so, so, so good. Great biscuit. Delicious breakfast sausage, slice of cheese, delicious egg. Perfectly dressed and flavored side saladPancakes - 2 pieces (thick and a little dense) with bacon between...topped with 2 fried eggs. Very good and fillingTLDR: soooo worth checking out. super delicious",2,1,1
18,VyVy V.,"Centreville, VA",161,339,444,4.0,3/14/2018,Not too big of a restaurant but it definitely had an intimate feel to it since everyone sits together at the bar top. We wandered into here due to all the other places around the area were either packed and had a long wait or needed reservations. We shared an avocado egg biscuit which came with a side salad. It was delicious and I'm glad we discovered POST on a whim!,,,

20,Julia F.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,186,45,5.0,9/15/2018,"Post is what brunch was meant to be. Not a VIP ""event"" or extension of the previous night's revelry. Not a 45 minute wait for the usual fare served with anything but a smile. White washed exposed brick walls and a long counter seated an intimate amount of people enjoying their food serenely and with the kind of pleasure that only an Avocado Biscuit can bring to a human being. I was one of those human beings and that Avocado Biscuit with it's runny fried egg, shaved Parmesan, avocado, and tomato was dripping down my face. I didn't care and neither did my companion. Our server Mikey complemented the food as he served it. You could tell he was just as in love with the stuff on my plate as I was. How is all of the East Village not lining up for this place????",,,1
21,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,5.0,6/2/2018,"BISCUIT HEAVEN. I had tried to come by this place on a previous Saturday for brunch, but it was super crowded and the place is pretty small - mostly bar seating. However, today my boyfriend and I came in around 2pm also a Saturday, and we were able to be seated immediately. The menu is fairly basic but so so delicious. Basically a couple salads and a ton of different biscuit options: biscuits and gravy, sausage, bacon, pork, avocado, you name it. My boyfriend got the biscuits and chicken sausage gravy that comes with a fried egg on top, and I chose the biscuit with egg, cheese, chicken sausage, and added avocado. Mine also came with a side salad. The biscuits were SO GOOD. First of all huge, but also just so simply good. Prices are also really great between $11-13 per biscuit. Avocado was $3 to add, but I swear I actually got the full avocado with about 7 slices of it. A very indulgent and filling brunch, and my cold brew with almond milk was a perfect top off. They also have a bunch of different tea options. Staff was very friendly, and food came out very quickly. The place like I mentioned before is pretty small but very simple chic. Main critic was that it was an unusually hot and humid day, and the restaurant somehow felt even hotter than outside... the door was open the whole time but wish they could've turned up the AC a bit. Otherwise fantastic experience and definitely want to come back for my biscuit cravings!",2,2,2
22,Naomi Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,293,331,5.0,12/12/2017,"Such a cute spot with delicious food!! I was feeling ultra healthy and ordered the quinoa & arugula salad which was more flavorful than I'd thought. It came with walnuts, dates and a sesame vinaigrette. I also ordered a side of chicken sausage since I was exceptionally hungry. Glad I did since the salad wasn't huge, but I definitely felt full from it. Also, my friend kindly gave me half of her AMAZING biscuit which helped! I also ordered a Golden Milk (hot almond milk, turmeric & cinnamon) which was perfect for the chilly Sunday we came.If I'm being honest, the decor in this place is the whole reason we came. The white bar and stools work nicely with the artwork on the walls & the linen drapes on the windows. The bathroom is especially adorable with an oriental themed wallpaper and a dragon shaped faucet (really)! Honestly the bathroom is something to behold. I might model mine like it.Can't wait to come back and try an egg sandwich!",3,,1

Lucky for us, we were the only ones there at 10am on a Thursday and were able to sit at the lone table in the back.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the chicken sausage biscuit with avocado. Everything about this sandwich was amazing. The biscuit was so dense and flavorful, the chicken sausage was delicious and the avocado added a nice freshness. Though it wasn't super large, this was definitely a filling dish.My parents also enjoyed their sandwiches and thought that the coffee was some of the best they've had.Overall, the food here is definitely top-notch and at a great price for the area. It's unfortunate that it is such a small space, as it definitely has quite a crowd on the weekends. In addition, the service here was great and the waiter/barista was as friendly as could be.

I ordered the biscuit and gravy and my friends had the pork and biscuit and sausage and biscuit. This is the first restaurant in the city to make biscuits like the south does. Every bite was an orgasm. I can't recall when was the last time I fell in love with a breakfast dish in the city. We all loved our dishes and the service. The biscuit was fluffly and not dry, the gravy was perfectly flavored and creamy and the meat was not dry.",,,

Especially if they're biscuits from POST.It's tiny sliver of a restaurant in Alphabet City that serves up fantastic comfort food ripe for letting your hair down and rewarding yourself for clean eating during the week. Their biscuits are decadent, and the complete opposite of pressed juice and kale salads (though they do have grains on the menu as well, but where's the fun in that?). If you're anything like me, you'll have a hard time deciding what to order...I went with the very basic sausage biscuit, but boy was it anything but basic. One fluffy biscuit, eggs, chicken sausage, and some side sauce...not reinventing the wheel, but that biscuit is baked to perfection and makes the meal. Perhaps one of the best parts of the whole experience is the staff. I have no idea what the ownership dynamic is, but the two people that seem to be there most often genuinely seem to love what they do. Their spirits are always high--laughing and cracking jokes with customers--and the energy is infectious. It's small, so head in during slower times if you don't want to wait for a seat.",19,7,13

I've had my eye on Post for awhile so it was time to explore with the lady. As it turns out, we had a great experience!The restaurant is a small venue featuring bar seating and a casual atmosphere. It's popular and does not take reservations so our wait was roughly 20 minutes. That was expected and just remember: patience is a virtue. We appreciated the manager's attentiveness to those waiting to be seated.Pleasant service and banging food - that's a recipe for success. The brunch menu consists of an array of biscuit options, pancakes, and salads. I'm still thinking about the biscuits and gravy. It was delicious! My lady enjoyed the sausage biscuit with avocado. Solid selection of teas as well - I liked the pic du midi. Other groups were seen smiling while indulging in alcoholic concoctions.Highly recommend for brunch and looking forward to trying the burger sometime soon. Check it out!",9,2,5

When you walk in, its got the clean fresh just came into modern kitchen look. Long seated bar, extends towards the back - we sat at a four seated table in a enclosed area. Mostly we opt for bar area because we like to talk to locals and get the vibe, this time we chose the quieter of the area close to the kitchen but barely had any interruption. Staff extremely friendly,  we chose teas, that were original to the spot, I chose the White Wolf. and was not dissapionted. I am only a coffee drinker but wanted to try something new and even the tea made the experience enriching.We ordered the regular sausage (turkey) and egg buiscuit, as well as the biscuit and gravy and it was melt in your mouth. Such a huge portion the biscuit was freshly made, melt in your mouth and the sausage tasty.Definitely showing some Southern  Comfort, and you will need stretchy pants and feel like you need to back in your pjs and robe.

Wish they closed their main door and window so the AC can get cold. It was pretty hot especially when there's no open windows in the back. Food took almost 45 minutes which was kind of annoying. I started off with their $7 mimosa. It was ok although I think they used cheap champagne as I had a headache later on. I had the biscuits and gravy. It had great flavor. Savory and not sweet. Big chunks of sausage with a great consistency of gravy. Not too thick, not too watery. Biscuit was soaked in gravy although I would imagine it to be too dense without it. Definitely want to come back and give it another a chance.",1,,1

I ordered the sausage biscuit sandwich which was very tasty. The biscuit was especially delicious. It came with a small side salad (would be awesome if you could order a side of hash browns or something more substantial / brunch-y).My friend had the avocado biscuit which she enjoyed equally as much.

36,Rosario R.,"Wallington, NJ",98,38,61,4.0,6/10/2018,After visiting the south & experiencing the amazing biscuits with gravy coming back home it was hard to find a place that made it like the south does until I discovered Post. The only downside to this place is I've noticed they always run out of something by the time I get there (after 1pm usually). One day they ran out of biscuits so my boyfriend ordered the pancake stack instead to our luck we fell in love. The pancakes here are super fluffy and the combination of the salty from the bacon and the sweetness from the maple syrup go great together. Overall my experience here each time is pretty great and we will continue to drive and commute through NY traffic from Jersey to eat here.,1,,

I came here on a cold friday morning with my friend and the place was pretty empty which was a score for us, we chose the only table in the back. The service here was spectacular, food was delicious as well. We both ordered the chicken sausage biscuit w/ fried egg. The egg was perfectly runny and the chicken sausage was delightful. I even enjoyed the Asian inspired salad next to my sandwich. The biscuit was fluffy and buttery, what else could you ask for? We left happily satisfied and I'll definitely return to try their other biscuit sandwiches. Oh, can we also talk about how aesthetically pleasing the decoration is? Definitely a solid place for brunch in NYC.",,,

42,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,4.0,4/2/2017,"One of the few new places that lived up to the hype for me.  They have a simple, classic menu that's done well.  We went for brunch and tried the avocado biscuit sandwich and the biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits themselves were slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside; not dry at all.  The biscuits and gravy looked messy, but tasted great.  The avocado biscuit was good as well, but perhaps  next time I would try it with the sausage for a bit more flavor. Small shop, but fast turnover, so don't be discouraged if you do have to wait (the wait probably won't be long).",3,,2

We popped here for a late brunch on Saturday and really enjoyed ourselves.By the name, it's hard to tell what Post specializes in. Well, it's homemade biscuits. Post makes amazing homemade biscuits in dishes to suit them. Everything from a proper sausage egg and cheese biscuit (with a nice side of lightly dressed greens) to an amazing biscuits and gravy. I found the gravy to be light and tasty and not too salty. Food came fast, everything tasted fresh and presentation was super clutch.What else to say? The inside and cute and comfortable, though they don't seat many and can get crowded for brunch. The service was great and they have a nice selection of wines and cocktails to accompany your biscuit meal. Overall we were extremely satisfied with our meal and look forward to another visit. If you wake up on a Saturday or Sunday and looking for a great brunch in an area you might not usually go to, make the trip and enjoy your brunch at Post!",4,,1

I didn't have any cocktails or coffee, but heard everyone else complimenting their drinks. Ate a sausage biscuit and it was huge and definitely enough for two. Amazing presentation, not too heavy but definitely comfort food and accompanied with a great salad. Seems like a great brunch spot and if there were any places I was impressed by in NY, this was the most memorable because of the cute little view of the street, sun shining in, great service and excellent food.",1,,

I found it on yelp and their biscuit sandwich photos just look bomb but DON'T let your eyes deceive you...the biscuit is cold and dense and has absolute no flavor. Nothing inside the sandwich had any taste either. Do they not have salt back there?? My boyfriend and I both ordered the breakfast sandwich with avocados, but he added bacon to his. You would think bacon could save this damn thing but nope, they couldn't cook that either. It was soggy! We ended up just eating the inside and avoiding the biscuit all together. It was so expensive- two sandwiches came out to $25.04. Yelp homies...PLEASE JUST GIVE RESTAURANTS THE STARS THEY DESERVE!!!UPDATE: 3 hrs after I post this review I received a nasty message from an owner or perhaps a relative. Although they pretend to not own POST, this is the only negative review I wrote in the last few months. Take a look at how this owner responds to negative feedback with the photos attached. However, if this person is unaffiliated with the owner of POST, I will gladly delete these screenshots.ANOTHER UPDATE: boyfriend googled to find out the owner is Bobby Stackleather. (gothamist.com/2016/11/30… ) Same name of the fellow that messaged me. I'm not going to apologize for this review. This is truly how I felt about my meal.

Seriously, guys, this place has without a doubt one of the best damn biscuits I've ever eaten in my entire life and let me tell ya, my carb-loving ass has eaten a lotttt of biscuits over the years. It's moist (giggity), thick (giggity giggity), ridiculously flavorful and I want at least a half dozen of them delivered to me right now. The chicken sausage I added on was also such a great idea because it was also so flavorful and it just made my biscuit *that* much better and meatier. This little gem just opened up a few weeks ago, so there is currently only bar seating, but don't let that deter you. In fact, I would actually highly recommend high-tailing your asses there ASAP so you can get one or two or ten of those biscuits before this place really blows up and the lines become insane. Or, actually, wait, maybe don't, so I can have all of that biscuit goodness to myself. Yeah, let's go with that. Find your own dang biscuit place, guys :)",28,18,23

I checked out the menu and the simplicity won me over. We called ahead since we have a party of 6 and they gladly accommodated by setting up a round table in the back. You would be a fool not to order the biscuits and sausage gravy dish because it is such a southern classic. The biscuits nicely toasted and drenched in thick white gravy and lumps of delicious chicken sausage. The runny fried egg was the cherry on top. Because if you like it, you should always put an egg on it. #putaneggonitOther highlights include my friends fluffy Pancake Stack and the shared Green Salad.

54,Jingqiao H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",157,172,2583,4.0,2/26/2017,"Food was delicious, servers were friendly, ambience was lovely, yet seating is cramped. The biggest problem is slow service since only 2 people were helping that day.I got here Saturday morning around 10:50 am and this place was nearly full, with people waiting. Upon my friend's arrival around 11:10 am, the restaurant was fully occupied. We waited for 15 mins or so and sat at the counter (all counter seats). This place is really tiny. In the back by the restroom was a table for a group of maybe 4, maximum. But honestly that was not where I want my brunch to be because of bad lighting. We ordered the mimosa, which is not on the menu but on the board outside. It was just a small glass. I think you can skip it, because it wasn't that extraordinary and cost us more than 10 mins' wait.I had the Biscuits and Gravy and my friend got Sausage Biscuits. We both loved our food, since we haven't had any biscuits for years. My gravy was very flavorful with sausages, too, and the edge of the biscuits was a bit burnt, making it crunchy and particularly tasty. The fried egg on top was simply a plus, as it always is, although the yolk wasn't running much. The gravy was not flowing, either, but thick and stiff. It took our server almost 20 minutes to check us out, because only he has the machine and he needed to take care of other stuffs too. While waiting, more people came. When we left around 12:30 pm, there was a line of 2-3 pairs waiting. I'm not sure if it is like this busy every weekend, but I suggest you come before 11:30 am if you don't want to wait for 30 mins. And, do not come in big groups.P.S. They also have coffee served in the back where you can just order to-go. No desserts, I believe.",2,1,1

It took me a while to give the order and when it was time to leave i was waiting for her attention for like 20 minutes good thing i didn't have any place to be. I asked the other waiter for the check but he forgot as well and got lost in her conversation too. It took me a total of three tries before I got the check. The place is pretty small and intimate. The brunch is phenomenal. I never had biscuits and gravy that was so scrumptious I couldn't stop eating even when I was full.

There is only a long bar with about 12-16 bar stools and there is no A/C either so get ready to sweat in the summer heat, but I have to say the breakfast sandwich was worth it. I got an Iced Golden Milk which is milk with turmeric and cinnamon. It was quite tasty, but has lots of flecks of spices that get in the teeth and makes for a rough texture.

For a heavier, more decadent selection, I'd go for the Biscuits and Gravy. The description alone is almost enough for me to feel fuller.

The hubby does the research, so I give him credit when credit is due. We walked over and the first impression was a good one. We figured it was the business with the small white doors and no over head sign. As we got closer, we noticed a small chalkboard sign with the name ""Post"" across the top. We walk in and it is so cute! All white (which I always love) and a few bar stools along the bar. We quickly decide to sit at the end of the bar. We are approached by the waiter/bar tender.

The hubby and I quickly go toward the same item, but I persuade him to get something else so that we can share. (Hubby prefers not to share, I always want to share). I ordered the avocado egg biscuit and the hubby orders the biscuit and gravy. They were both AMAZING! I'm so glad we opted for the 2 different dishes rather than the same.

I never saw the bill but he placed cash in an empty glass along with the check and handed it over.  As we were leaving the dude behind the bar asked out loud ""was the service not good?"". Oh, and not once but he repeated himself loud enough so that other patrons in the bar could educate my British friend and his wife that ""it's 20% for the service industry in States.""So, now feeling utterly embarrassed my buddy dropped an additional $10 on the table.  We left and and I asked him how much he left the guy and he said ""the bill was $61; I left him $70. In London that would have been a good tip."" Well, to the idiot behind the bar who poured us a couple glasses of ice coffee and didn't drop the biscuits on the ground that your cook prepared us - not you - I hope your weak, low-class, and utterly embassing act of complaining for that extra $10 which you did absolutely nothing to deserve helped you sleep Friday night because there's zero chance I'm ever stepping foot into The Post again.

Updated review","Just had the burger on the dinner menu. It was perfect at medium rare, with some mustard on the side.Now why don't they offer the burger on their brunch menu? Throw in a side salad option and I'm there most weekends!",,,

85,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",829,475,125,4.0,1/25/2017,"Brunch. Biscuits. Gravy. Meat. Yum. The gravy spills everywhere. My stomach grumbles as I write this. Post, was delicious. My gf had the delicious avocado biscuit, but it sure made me miss California and the plentiful slightly mushier and riper avocado. This one looked so hard and not so good with the runny egg yolk on top. Complete with two cups of coffee and continuos refills with beans from La Colombe I was quite filled to the brim to say the least. The place is quaint and discreet, I would have hardly noticed it had I walked by, but you enter to an oasis of white and a feeling that you've transported somewhere else as the smell of breakfast fills your nostrils. Come check it out, but I figure the lines here will start making the wait unbearable. That being said, I think they're so new they're still working out the kinks and the biscuit machine will be up and humming soon.",1,,
86,Mackenzie D.,"Batesville, AR",0,5,0,5.0,8/1/2018,From a Southerner: best biscuits and gravy I've ever had!! Great atmosphere and friendly service. We will definitely be going back before our trip is over!,,,
87,Brian S.,"New York, NY",2,68,12,5.0,3/25/2018,"The staff here were a lot of fun. I came with my girlfriend and another friend so we were three. We were told a 20-25 minute wait. However, the folks at the table the staff were waiting on for us paid, and then sat at the table chatting for 15 more minutes - which I feel is very rude at places like this. If you're reading this, please be courteous and leave after you pay your bill! There are people waiting. Anyway, the staff could not really do much so we ended up waiting 45 minutes. I understood the situation but nonetheless the waiter immediately offered us 3 mimosas on the house for the extra wait - the perfect response. We then ordered the food, I got the pancakes, which were delicious. I feel even better than Clinton Street Bakery which is hard to beat. The biscuit is also good as I tried my friends'.",,,
88,Ashley S.,"Chicago, IL",743,149,10,5.0,7/26/2017,"10/10 RECOMMEND. MUST TRY. This is one of my favvvvvvorite brunch places in New York so far. I got the Avocado biscuit and oh my god I died and was revived by their perfectly sliced and fermented parmesan cheese. The biscuit was diiiiivine and it was everything I needed to cure my swollen eye from the day before. The cafe has a really nice vibe and has a clean setup and decor, with an open window facing the street. They run out of the pork and gravy biscuits like it's water. Definitely come early!!There's only a line of counter seats so definitely come early on the weekends, and even on the weekdays if you're a tourist. The waiter is super chill, the perfect amount of chatty and very accommodating. Water was good too.",,2,1

Fluffy pancakes had the savory & saltiness from the bacon that was in-between was fantastic & of course i saved the splitting of the egg for last! fucking FIREWORKS in my mouth!! the syrup they gave me was the perfect maple-bacon sweetness & not too heavy & FUCKING DELICIOUSHOLY SHIT THAT WAS AMAZINGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",,1,
90,Swati S.,"Boston, MA",3,53,2,2.0,3/11/2018,"Don't believe the hype, there is nothing special about this place. Standard breakfast place that uses the same ingredients in all their dishes and the cold brew doesn't taste good either.",,,
91,Jessica F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,14,5,5.0,5/30/2017,"BEST sausage breakfast sandwich.Delicious selection of teas and a delightful golden milk that's good for your body. Always hard to decide if you're in the mood for a coffee or tea since both are rich in quality and taste.Owned by two brothers who run the entire show. Mikey holds down the front and makes every customer feel like a guest in his home. Bobby who runs the show back of house, cooks everything to perfection and his biscuits will make you keep coming back for more! Great for a date or spot to catch up with a girlfriend. Also very comfortable if dining alone!",4,1,
92,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",488,193,9,5.0,6/9/2017,"So glad this place is right down the street from me. Counter seating so don't expect to come in with a group and all sit together, but amazing place to come if you're just trying to get a nice breakfast/brunch and get your day going. I'm a savory breakfast guy, so I had to go with the breakfast sandwich with home made chicken sausage. I like myself a gourmet ass breakfast sandwich just as much as a McMuffin and I must say the one from post is one of the best out there!The biscuit really did it for me. I would eat those biscuits just by itself. Then you add on the sausage, which is really tasty. I threw on some avocado as well and boom, had myself an amazing breakfast for one. Will probably be back next weekend. Enjoy!",2,,1

Vintage magazines, crochet owls, white brick walls, lots of plants and records? Yes. Yes please. Second, the food was AMAZING and holy balls can they nail an egg. All three of us ordered meals with eggs and they were perfectly cooked, set whites and creamy yolks. I had the biscuits and gravy and it was a thumbs up from me!

100,Hannah P.,"Bolivar, MO",0,6,4,5.0,5/12/2017,"OUR FAV BRUNCH/LUNCH SPOT ON OUR TRIP. We split the chicken sausage biscuit with avocado and the broccoli/pea/mixed greens and it was all made to perfection. The biscuit was large, fluffy, didn't crumble to pieces, almost a whole avocado in the sandwich, and a perfect sunny egg. The salad was made with some sort of house Caesar-type dressing, nothing fancy. If you're looking for mind blowing culinary combinations, this place is not for you. But if you're looking for a simply delicious brunch or lunch, this is your spot. The ambience is super chill with great staff. With minimalist white decor it was comfortably relaxing. I would recommend!",2,,

I'll admit I was skeptical that a biscuit in New York City could impress me. I tried the biscuits and gravy anyway, and I was very wrong. It was perhaps the best meal I had on our trip. My wife ordered the pancake stack, which was also excellent. The service was fantastic as well. I'm glad we found this place.",,,

The place is very tiny, there is only 1 table seating 4/5 people, the rest seat at the bar. The staff was nice, especially our waiter. Beverages were good and the food was excellent (delicious biscuits). Only regret: not enough sugary treats. The menu is small, but of high quality. I definitely recommend this spot!",,,

It was so good I had to finish it even thou I was full midway through the dish. It was hard to walk or breath after, but definatly worth it. If you are a girl with a small stomach like me, share your food or get a salad. My girlfriend had one, she enjoyed it. The chef brings food for you himself from the kitchen adds a special touch.

109,Monica O.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",259,6,1,2.0,2/27/2017,"We were quoted 5-10 minutes wait and went to wait outside so we wouldn't be hovering over the people eating their food (it's a small restaurant). After 30 minutes we wondering if we'd been forgotten about, so we went back inside where we waited another 15 minutes, noticing people who came in after us had been seated.We ordered two sandwiches and a coffee and cappuccino. The coffee and cappuccino never came, and then when we went to pay, instead of giving us an itemized receipt, they took our card and swiped it without us seeing that we were being charged for the coffee and cappuccino we never received. When we pointed this out, they became very flustered, voided the transaction, and reswiped our card. Once again we were not shown the bill and after the fact we saw that we were still charged for the coffee that never came.What should have been an easy brunch of biscuit sandwiches turned into an extremely unpleasant hour-and-a-half experience.

STOP THE CLOCKS PEOPLE!!!  I just ate the most ridiculously delicious sausage biscuit everrrrrr!!!  How can something so simple be soooo awesome?! A kickass biscuit, some savory homemade chicken sausage, perfectly fried locally sourced egg and you're in business. Sweet Baby Jesus that sandwich is goooood!  Kick-ass coffee too. The brunch biscuits and gravy special... OMG! CRACK! CRACKITY CRACK!!  The burger Is killer too..   nom nom nomz to tha nom!... The real star of POST are those wonderful biscuits. I dare say they are the finest buttermilk biscuits I've had in NYC. Now, lets talk about the space... it's cozy, intimate, and well... tiny. Counter seating only and sits about maybe 10 people maybe 2 small tables in the back. This is not a spot to dine in big groups (like a party of 4 is too big.. seriously bring A friend or just bring yourself)...  On weekends know that you will wait a long time unless you arrive early (or get takeout, which I frequently do). The owners exude such a pleasant cool vibe and I really enjoy dining at Post. I always dine in at off times tho cause I can't stand crowds and this tiny joint is fast becoming popular ;-).",5,4,4

115,Priscilla C.,"Davis, CA",193,348,1736,5.0,1/21/2017,"Bravo! Well done! I am super impressed with this little cozy Lower East Side cafe. First off, I love breakfast food. Secondly, it's very difficult to be impressive serving breakfast foods because come on, who can get cooking eggs wrong or how many different ways can you make a breakfast sandwich unique? Thirdly, this place really impressed me and they sure do it different here...Wowzers. 0 regrets on coming here. I came on a Saturday 10am (opening time) not expecting much. The pictures on Yelp were great, but I also had biscuits and gravy about 2 wks ago at Pies n Thighs and they set the bar quite high for us. The menu was simple which I love, a couple of things to choose from and we already knew what we came here to try. So we ordered the sausage, egg & cheese plus avocado (additional +$3), biscuit & gravy and an iced latte. The sausage, egg and cheese was SO good! Their sausage is a chicken sausage patty and it was so tender! Had a slight sweetness to it that made this sandwich different and amazing. The yolk was perfectly runny. I bit into it and everything gushed out. Adding avocado to it was a good decision. Can get a bit messy, but when it starts to drip, just flip the sandwich upside down to eat. Helps to slow down the drip and mess :) the biscuit and gravy was also really good. I loved how it comes with an egg on top. It wasn't overly salty like pies n thigh and I think this one actually won in comparison for that reason. Had chunks of their chicken sausage and both the biscuits were pretty good, fluffy and flaky (not dry). This is a really solid brunch spot. Might be one of the better ones in LES and might be one of my new favs. I am definitely coming back to try the other stuff. Cute chill interior with counter seatings. Also, enjoyed my iced latte. Overall, these brothers are doing brunch the right way. Amazing food for a small little place. Well done, well done! Two thumbs up.",2,1,1

This new, super cute whitewashed counter-only find is not to be missed for the best biscuits I've ever tasted. The menu is small, but that's okay because every choice is delicious. Every bite of my egg, cheese and housemade chicken sausage on a cloud-like southern biscuit was heavenly. My daughter highly recommends the avocado version. Yup, that's her photo. The piece de resistance was the grand finale of fresh strawberry jelly with the last bites of biscuit! Why oh why didn't we take a dozen of those babies back to Seattle?!

I went in and placed my to go order at the register and the server was very friendly and accommodating to bring my food outside once it was ready since I had my dog. It took only a few minutes to prepare the food and we ended up eating on the bench is just outside the restaurant. We tried the pulled pork biscuit which I believe was the new addition to their menu. It was very tasty served on a very large biscuit with a reasonable amount of pork and topped with coleslaw. The only thing I would've liked was a little more sauce which I added to the leftovers I ate the next day. Biscuits are all priced around $10 but given their substantial size it certainly could make a full meal.",1,,2

143,Keegan B.,"Orlando, FL",59,17,6,5.0,4/18/2017,"The buttermilk biscuits automatically bring this rating to 5 stars. The egg in my biscuit sandwich (I got the avocado biscuit) was perfectly runny. The coffee wasn't my favorite, but the fact that I could get a second and third cup for no additional charge was pretty great. Delicious, cute little spot that's a relaxing step out of the busy city.",,,
144,Lana F.,"Manhattan, NY",9,38,0,5.0,3/30/2017,"very good quality of food. The menu is short but everything I tried was simply delicious, well crafted, made with high quality ingredients. Definitely my new go-to spot. Can't wait to try their brunch.",,,
145,Hit U.,"New York, NY",1,790,0,5.0,2/17/2017,"The best biscuits and gravy on the east coast! The gravy and chicken sausage dish is excellent. The biscuit was buttery, a bit burnt underneath but the entire entree was absolutely memorable. The owners are super sweet. I plan to return every week!!",1,,
146,Steve S.,"Williamsburg, NY",0,33,60,5.0,5/28/2017,Small place and usually crowded. Go early and enjoy the best biscuit breakfast sandwiches in the city! They are seriously delicious and you will leave stuffed. The coffee is also excellent. Friendly service and great music. Highly recommended.,,,
147,Layla A.,"Boston, MA",0,3,0,4.0,4/23/2017,Really good avocado sandwich. Great coffee. Uncomfortable / tight seating though. Would definitely recommend visiting solo or w 1 friend. Bad for groups,,,
148,Lindsey L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",193,2,0,3.0,12/2/2017,"It was my first time going here and my first impression was that the atmosphere was great. Decor was simple and eclectic. Noise level was low, so it's a great place to have a one on one conversation. The food I ordered was delicious - I got the quinoa bowl with an egg along with a drip coffee. HOWEVER, the thing that really turned me off was the fact that the woman tending to us did not ask how the food was, or how we were doing the entire time. Two men sitting next to us were given a coffee refill without them asking (I was not offered nor given a refill) The woman sitting next to us was intently waited on and was asked for her preference of milk with her coffee (this was also not asked of us) Overall, place was great, disappointed with the service.",,,
149,A M.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,8/3/2017,"Best breakfast sandwich and biscuit I've had in New York, hands down. Annoyed of those complaining of there only being one ""table"". If you want that kind of place, there are plenty of other places that fit the bill (try IHOP). Love you POST I hope you stay in the neighborhood forever!",,,1
150,Karen N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",242,4,5,5.0,4/21/2017,Such great food! Must recommend the Gravy & Biscuit! Also great customer service and cozy vibe,,,
151,chris g.,"New York, NY",15,12,1,5.0,3/16/2017,"A perfect neighborhood spot - I got the sausage egg and cheese to go, Mike (behind the bar) was a sweetheart, there was relaxing classical music playing on the radio, the energy was calming, decor simple and clean...and the food blew my mind. Well worth the $10 premium price...perfection! (and they order to go!)",,,
152,Jeff G.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,37,0,5.0,12/17/2016,"This part of the east village has desperately needed a great coffee/breakfast place for a while and this place is just what it needed . Super friendly staff, great food, I heard hey have a dinner menu too that I look to check out soon.",1,,1
153,Chris H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/10/2016,"Seemed like the only brunch spots right around here were bottomless brunch spots with a bunch of hammered 20somethings. Not any more, thankfully. Very chill small space with a small menu that packs a punch. Best breakfast sandwich I've had in the city, having lived here for nine years. Granola actually worth getting.",1,,1
154,Jeremy K.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,9,0,5.0,8/25/2017,"The biscuit's are phenomenal, they have great coffee, and the owners are wonderful. I am looking forward to trying more of the items on their menu!",,,
155,Kaitlin S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,13,0,5.0,3/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. Very cute restaurant (but small) with counter seating, though there is a table for four at the back. I had the burger and my guy had the chicken, and both were very good. I'd love to go back and check out their brunch and their drinks (when I'm not pregnant). And dessert (which we were told would be coming soon). The bartender/server/owner (I think?) was very nice and very attentive. This place will probably get more popular soon and there will be a wait for dinner, so go now while you can get a seat right away.",,,
156,Jared W.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,16,3,5.0,12/23/2016,"Love this new place. Super nice staff and the food is great. Stopped in for a quick bite after work and had the burger, which was cooked perfectly. Will come back again.",,,1

159,Kelli K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,1,5.0,2/26/2017,"Went here for brunch with my sister after stumbling upon it on yelp, so glad we stopped in. Would highly recommend the sausage and gravy.  Was incredibly pleased with the quality of the food and the portion size. The place is small, so it might be easy to miss the entrance, and there might be a wait to get a seat. When we arrived there was space, so we were seated pretty quickly.  We got a nice window seat; great place for food and people watching. Staff was friendly, and let us know in advance if there would be a longer wait for certain orders. It seems like it's pretty new, so I wish them all the best. Will keep this place in mind to take friends to.",,,
160,Jonathan W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,5.0,8/15/2017,Hands down best breakfast sandwich in town. The menu is short but I've been a few times and every item I have tried is a knockout. Amazing food with no pretension with a chill neighborhood vibe. This is a hidden gem in the east village. Go before it catches on and there is a line down the block.,,,
161,Marshall E.,"Manhattan, NY",100,28,0,5.0,1/5/2017,"Great new place in the neighborhood. Definitely recommend the Avocado biscuit! Based on the comments of the couple next to me, the burger is amazing too. Going to try that on my next visit.",,,
162,Theresa G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,1,5.0,1/4/2017,"Amazing place to 'post' up for brunch (plan to grab dinner on another occasion)! Decor is extremely welcoming, the food and coffee is delish and the owner is super friendly.  I recommend checking this place out!",,,
163,Michael S.,"Fitzrovia, London, United Kingdom",0,1,0,5.0,2/24/2017,"This place is phenomenal. I live on the upper west side and make the trek down to Post for brunch pretty much every weekend now. The first time I came here I got the sausage biscuit sandwich and was blown away. When I came back a second thme, I decided to try the biscuits and gravy, which was somehow even better. The place has an awesome vibe (pretty tiny, though, so not great for groups), amazing food, and, to top it all off, the brothers who run the place are great guys. Definitely my new favorite brunch spot in the city.",1,1,1

169,J L.,"New York, NY",0,24,11,5.0,1/22/2017,"Whoah, just had brunch at Post with two friends.  I had a biscuit with sausage and egg. first impression was that the chef takes a LOT of care in what they're doing here. The biscuit is light and fluffy, the egg was cooked just right, and the sausage was tasty, yet not overpowering. It was just a great balance. solid coffee too. The interior is really beautiful in its austerity , all white everything, just what ya need on a Sunday morning while you recover from what ever debauchery that took place the previous two nights . Friendly welcoming atmosphere , casual and relaxed. Definitely going back to try the rest of the menu.",,,
170,Dee B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,14,0,5.0,12/27/2016,On a biscuit tour. Yesterday had pies and thighs...today had POST. I had the avocado biscuit which was DELICIOUS. Dreamy biscuit for sure. Excited to have a new biscuit spot in the EV. Side salad was super yummy too (came with biscuit). Dinner menu looks yum excited to try the chicken dish.,,,
