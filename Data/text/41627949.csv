3,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,3.0,3/22/2018,"Unbelievably overpriced - even for New York. Though it is a cozy hotel bar in a really nice fancy hotel, it's not worth the money. I was especially disappointed by the Bloody Mary (aka Red Snapper - which was supposedly invented here) - it was the worst Bloody Mary I've had to date. The bartender hadn't bothered to mix it, I took a sip and got a mouthful of pure vodka. And everything else about it was all wrong, no flavor or seasoning, just plain bad.",7,1,4
4,Harrison S.,"Edina, MN",1,94,119,5.0,4/5/2018,"What fun! It is a lost concept on our world to dress up for the sole purpose of attending a bar to enjoy social time and a few drinks. I was pleased to feel underdressed in my suit and tie as half of the men were wearing full black tie tuxedos replete with hand tied bows, and the women were equally dressed to the nines in cocktail dresses and even ball gowns. Perhaps it was a group coming from another formal event, but in case the place does have a strict dress code and I expect that on any given night you will find folks well turned-out here. French cuffs and Hermes ties are found aplenty. Although it was almost too loud inside the small space (probably due to the marble floor and walls), the bartender was prompt, attentive, and completely classy, not batting an eye when I, as a non-drinker, wasted away a lovely hour sipping $25 mocktails and people watching. The barman even took the initiative to explain the intricacies of the gigantic ""King Cole"" painting behind the bar, which features John Jacob Astor cast as the eponymous king passing gas to his court and smirking. It's apparently insured for 10 million dollars, which ensures that I will never buy it! I will, however, return to this delightful slice of old-world aristocracy every time I am in town.",1,1,2

8,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",104,116,13,1.0,8/27/2018,"This bar used to feel so classy and upscale.  What has happened recently?  I sat down at the bar, and the first thing I noticed were the dozens of house flies swarming around the workstation.  After a few minutes, they started to feast on the dishes of snacks that the bartender hands out.  The dive bars I've gone to were never this dirty.  My girlfriend and I were planning on ordering food, but were scared off by the bug infestation.  If the bar was this filthy, I can't even imagine how the kitchen is.  We brought this to the bartender's attention, and he joked that they were ""fancy"" flies wearing gold Rolexes.  The conditions here were completely unacceptable and appalling.  I was totally embarrassed for bringing my girlfriend here. Needless to say, we left here feeling completely disgusted after reluctantly finishing one mediocre cocktail.  It makes me really sad that the King Cole Bar has turned into this mess.  Maybe the Trump Tower  just brought down the entire neighborhood?  My advice to native New Yorkers...don't even bother coming here anymore.  The nostalgia of the King Cole Bar is completely ruined.  As for the tourists...good luck.",2,,

12,Mallory M.,"New York, NY",136,94,11,5.0,12/2/2017,"Everything here is five star worthy: the bathroom, the atmosphere, the dining, service, and most importantly...food. You're going to have to let your eyes and wallet become numb when seeing the check, but it is so worth it. My roommate and I started off with tea and the pastry basket. We went during lunch and I asked the server if they still had breakfast and he was so kind as to tell me that anything we wanted they could make. Then we split the champagne risotto and oh my goodness, that alone was a reason to come back. I've never tasted something with so many flavors complimenting each other. I am so pleased with the experience I had here.",,,

Updated review","What can I say? The Old King Cole still looms, but I'm not sure just how merry he is any more. While the astronomical prices remain intact,  this once elegant spot has gone to seed. Gone are the classy, refined, Teddy Forstmann-ish days (in terms of both the clientele and the service)...What do you do when you see a bartender poaching and gobbling peanuts from the silver snack trays? What is the protocol? Do you just look away and pretend not to notice? Do you take him to task and demand your check? We need a new book of etiquette to cover these increasingly frequent gross moments of today....",3,,1

17,Gavin E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,110,0,3.0,10/8/2018,"Sure it's a  sophisticated living piece of Big Apple history. A lot of  golden-age, show biz  and ""high society"" keesters warmed these bar stools over the generations. I understand Cole Porter use to meet ""gentlemen"" friends here, all classy-like, and the depression-era bar tab was a then shocking $1 per drink! The Bloody Mary was invented here, the Maxfield Parrish mural is divine, OK, I get it.        But it's also like those sleek, vintage Jaguars that have a Chevy engine. All show, and nothing that special to propel it forward.   Talkin' about old cars and booze, the self-proclaimed ""very old ,Groton coot, an endangered species, or feces"" (his words, not mine, we can't all be Moss Hart) I come in here with,  has a bar, behind a glass partition,  in that faded, Navy blue Fleetwood, you see around, and in front of the ""best"" places.  He and select guests tank-up and snack outside,  (he usually has some White Castle sliders and onion rings in a vintage A&F picnic basket) in true old-money, urban  Grey Gardens-style, and then nurse something  mellow inside. The high drink prices and unwritten dress code do seem to keep ""that"" touristy/tacky element out. A $30 pre-tip cocktail is also the 13th step of AA. Those prices will keep a LOT of people from drinking, yowser!",,,
18,Mike G.,"Manhattan, NY",85,53,0,2.0,1/8/2018,"So this review is based on multiple visits and each has been almost identical. First the bar is gorgeous and the environment stunning, but that is where the good times end. Each time we have been there it feels like it is their first day - the service is so haphazard and bizarre and surprising. While we were there it was jam packed, yet somehow this was the time the manager decided to review schedules with the bartenders who both stopped working while this was happening. And speaking of the bartenders there is a grayish hair gentleman that has been there every time and he honestly is one of the most surely and unfriendly staff we have ever encountered.  Our waiter was a very nice guy, but super overwhelmed. I might have been more patient, but at $25 bucks a cocktail, you sorta expect better service...The Bloody Mary was delicious and my Vesper was pretty good by the way.",1,,1

20,Richard G.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,4.0,6/18/2018,"I had an oppertunity to meet a friend of mine here for a drink. I really don't come to these type of places but my friend was visiting from Washington State and wanted to see that famous mural behind The King Cole Bar. She is an artist and wanted to get a up close view of this painting. We walked into the hotel and WOW what a beautiful hotel! We walked over the King Cole Bar and were immediately greeted by the hostess Diana, she seems like a real pro and was very kind with us. We asked her to be seated at the bar so we could look at the mural better and have 2 bloody mary's (red snappers) She told us the story about the painting and began to tell us about how they invented the red snapper there as she guided us into sit at the bar. We sat at the bar for a couple drinks and some sliders and caught up on life with each other and enjoyed the early evening. Everything was great and my friend was very happy.",1,,

22,Jeff J.,"Chicago, IL",117,369,139,5.0,6/24/2016,"This has got to be one of the most beautiful bars in America and one of the most expensive. If you keep these two factors in mind, you can have a good time. The justly famous mural is gorgeous and worth gazing upon before your vision gets blurry. My Manhattan was perfect, made by a bartender who was professional and fast but not personable. The room is small and intimate and seems exclusive but of course it's not. Anyone can enter. There are reserved tables for people who look like they belong there, but plenty of people look like tourists. In truth this bar is an upscale version of what Times Square would be like if it had any class, tourists and locals mingling.Although the bar is crowded, there's no problem getting a seat. Turnover is fast. No one spends all night here -- because people can't afford more than one round of drinks! My cocktail was $25 with tax and tip. Ridiculous, right? But it was worth it -- to cross Old King Cole off my NYC to-do list.",8,1,3
23,Little G.,"Eastland, Charlotte, NC",10,126,23,4.0,5/29/2018,The service is super slow. The room is wonderful. The drinks are very well done. Nice intimate space for a cozy drink.

26,Howard O.,"Port Chester, NY",49,55,132,1.0,1/14/2018,"Yes the bar is beautiful and in the fantastic St Regis hotel. There is a huge famous mural by Maxfield Parish on the wall and this is the highlight of the bar. I typically don't complain about prices, because everyone knows super fancy places are expensive. But you typically get a stellar food and drinks when you pay these prices. Bloody Mary was supposedly invented in this bar. It's $25 and it was bad. Literally bad. Like vodka and tomato juice. Then we order a dozen oysters and have a conversation with the waiter telling him we prefer larger oysters. He suggests we go with the East coast ones because they are bigger. The oysters come out and I think he made a mistake and brought us the wrong oysters because these are tiny. Really minuscule. He goes back to the kitchen and says the order is correct. No apology. No offer of anything to appease disappointed customers. It is what it is and they don't give a crap that you're not happy about it. Should have just sent them back. My mistake. Oh, and the were $45 for a dozen. This bar is terrible. Bad drinks. Bad food. They don't care about the customer experience. Oh, and they are horribly overpriced!!This place is a joke. Stop by to peek at the Mural and then get on your way.",1,,1

30,Adam B.,"Durham, NC",182,359,1256,5.0,5/5/2015,"When I die, this will be my heaven. (Like I have any shot of that, ha! I'm destined for warmer climes.) But seriously, this is my favorite hotel bar in NYC and probably my favorite urban hotel bar in the US. It's absolutely steeped in history inside the magnificent St. Regis. When you enter the lobby off 55th St., just hang a left and keep going through the dining salon until you run into the semi-circular bar under the big mural of the king doing something inelegant.It's a small, intimate space with that curved bar and several tables. I recommend it for getting a mid-afternoon buzz going. They open at noon and stay open until late, but late afternoon starts to get very crowded. I prefer earlier when the bartenders are chatty and you'll often have some very interesting and well-traveled folks at the bar with you. I've had some great conversations there. In the afternoons, there's really no stuffy feel at all. The last time I was there, I saw someone wearing Dockers. Horrors! Evenings do tend to be pretty dressy, as they should.Yes, it's expensive, particularly the food (but try the cheese plate or the crab cakes), but this is a classic bar in the heart of Manhattan with impeccable service. So turn loose of that AmEx--it's worth it.",4,1,1
31,David D.,"Newtown, PA",177,357,2395,4.0,7/13/2015,"Outstanding breakfast service.  The restaurant portion caters to the St Regis hotel crowd. The menu is diversified and the food top notch.  I like that they're trying to be hip with a stab at flaxseed pancake, protein salads, and the like, while keeping it high-end dining with an emphasis on very fresh ingredients and especially excellent preparation.Silverware is all real silver, place settings are quickly removed and refreshed, and yet there's a easy going, ""would you like some juice?"" vibe as well.  They even have a smoothies menu, although the more popular items such as Regis French Toast are stand out.  I'd also recommend the granola parfait for the health conscious crowd.  This is the best stuff.",1,,1
32,May F.,"Angwin, CA",43,52,5,4.0,12/26/2017,This is a cool place to hang out.

35,Will R.,"New York, NY",21,82,60,1.0,1/5/2017,"I've been stopping by this place every year or so to give it another chance but I think I've given up for good. The maître d' doesn't know what he's doing and the bartenders not only have bad attitudes, but they just don't do a good job. I happen to frequent another uptown hotel bar that is so far superior that I don't know why I even waste my time at the St Regis. On my last visit to the King Cole bar I had to ask the bartender twice for bar nuts, and he ended up bringing me the crumbs from the bottom of the bag. That to accompany my $20 cocktail. I'm posting a photo from the aforementioned competitive hotel bar that knows how to do it right. I will never recommend the King Cole bar to any of my out-of-town guests as I have done in the past.",4,2,

37,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3836,3383,93,4.0,10/20/2015,"I am a fiend for Bloody Marys. They're probably my favorite thing to drink, for any reason and at any time of day. I've built travel plans around pictures of Bloody Marys--I'm a real sucker for the ones with bacon or elaborate pickles. That said, I also like a classic Bloody Mary, and when I heard the King Cole Bar was the birthplace of this hallowed cocktail, I knew I'd have to come by for a drink. This was doubly true as my husband and I were staying at the St. Regis for an anniversary getaway.I'd already heard that the Bloody Mary was like $25, but that didn't deter me. Hotel bars are always ridiculous, and we were already paying to stay at the St. Regis (in points, but still). Luckily, we got a voucher for a welcome drink when we checked in, and took that with us to halve the damage. Matt B. and I went in for a nightcap on our anniversary, which was a Monday, and had a very pleasant drink.The venue was gorgeous--I think the King Cole encompasses both the moody dark bar with the famous mural and the plushy, opulent, purple-and-orange lounge finery just outside, closer to the lobby. The main bar area is the place to be. I knew what it looked like before I walked in--I think I must've seen it in a movie or two, but in any case, it felt quite iconic. The bar was very quiet just before midnight on a Monday, with just a few other patrons enjoying their drinks nearby. We sidled right up to the bar and ordered a round of drinks. The bartender Mike was super friendly--I formed this opinion even before he comped us both of our drinks.The cocktails were good, not $25 good, but worthwhile and perfectly decent for a hotel bar. Matt got the Midtown Spice, an Old Fashioned variation made with Bulleit bourbon, apple liqueur, Canton ginger, Angostura bitters, and maraschino cherry. It was fine, nothing special, but easy enough to drink. I obviously got the Red Snapper, likely the first Bloody Mary in this country, possibly in the world. It was solid. Not amazing, I guess, but you know, this was like the Friendster of Bloody Marys and it's survived all this time. My first sip was too strong on the vodka, but after another stir and maybe a bit of ice melt, it got pretty delicious.We paid $10 total for this round (tip only--that's 20% on what was technically $50 of cocktails), and that did feel like a steal. I'm not sure I'd come back too often at full price, even if I lived in New York, but I enjoyed King Cole for its ambiance and sense of history. I'd definitely recommend at least one visit, particularly if you're into hotel bars and Bloody Marys.",13,12,13

It may have been a mistake - which is the only reason I'm not putting the waiters name on this review - but disappointing nonetheless. I came in for an end of the night drink on Monday last week with a co-worker. Just a quick catch-up before signing off for the day. It was late and still busy.

51,Denise S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,43,2,4.0,12/2/2017,"It's the holiday season and NY is jammed full of tourists etc this lounge is special for a number of reasons, it's located in a premier hotel the st Regis, regal and elegant. The food, ambience and service at lunch is superb, early dinner after work especially at this time of year you may chose to avoid. As afternoon tea slips into dinner time, service can be extremely slow. Water took 20 mins and then after a comment they got it together. The food quality, presentation are all in line with expectation. The attitude of one of the hosts Shah is superior another female hostess Elena, not so much. It may be that working on such a hotel gives a few employees the idea that they can sometimes behave as entitled, which doesn't want to make me race back.",,,

A hostess at the front will assist with getting a table, which has never been an issue.  Drinks have been made perfectly as requested.  This last visit we had a Grey Goose Martini ($24) and Echo Bay Sauvignon Blanc ($19).  Food options are priced at the higher end, this time we enjoyed the Cheese Plate ($29), which though a tad pricy, did include a sizable portion of cheese, crackers and grapes, all of which were tasty.  Service has been good for the most part, although I believe there are only one or two waiters for the space, so at times they can get busy/disappear.  Would be great if there was one additional staff at peak times to help out.",,,

I had the traditional one, allegedly invented in this very bar, and it was delightful and boozy.

For starters, if you're going to charge top dollar for cocktails, that's fine, but it better be top shelf liquor and not Tito's, have some class. Also just because you work at the St. Regis doesn't mean you're better than the rest of the world, your job is still to serve customers and treat them well, especially at the St. Regis, your customers should be treated like royalty, so please drop the attitude. As mentioned in other reviews, there are plenty of other Uptown bars that actually appropriately cater to Uptown customers.",,,

One of the best atmosphere I have ever experienced. From the beauty of the lobby, hallways, and the interesting mural behind the bar, extremely impressive. Friendly staff who obviously knows how to put you first and make you feel important. Had a couple martinis and the calamari, fantastic.

The St Regis Cab is 19/glass and I think the least expensive. It's outrageous of course, but so is every hotel bar of this kind. The Pen, Gramercy Hotel etc. I justified it by saying I spent only 8 dollars on lunch at Europa. So I just spent the money on wine.

There's couches lining the walls and a couple of tall bar tables, as well as the bar. We went on Christmas Eve for a drink in the afternoon and there was a line that formed after we sat down. Very awkward environment as people just stood at the door watching us as we had a drink. Also, the art work behind the bar is weird and takes up the whole wall. We had a glass of grappa that was $40. Normally, I pay around $15-20 at other nearby high end bars. Enough of my litany of complaints - I'm lucky to be living in Manhatten where there are so many other choices to go to.

69,Malcolm K.,"Columbus, OH",220,230,241,4.0,10/3/2011,"If you've ever been to any of the world's 'best' hotels' hotel bars, i.e. the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, etc., you've already been to the King Cole Bar. The same formula applies: oak. dimly lit sconces. wasabi peas, salted nuts, and twig-like cracker things for bar snacks. A global clientele that's as well dressed as it is educated. James Bond certified drinks with prices that will send you crying to the marble draped bathrooms.The King Cole claims to have birthed the original Bloody Mary, among a few other, less notable drinks. The Bloody comes in a wine glass, on the rocks, garnished with a lime wedge, a lemon wedge, and a 'St Regis' engraved stirrer. At $20 a pop, it's a damn good one, but you're paying more for bragging rights and exclusivity of venue than you are for the actual quality of the beverage. Nothing washes down a $20 Bloody Mary like good conversation, which is always to be expected in a bar of this caliber. Essentially, the mindset among everyone there is this: if you, along with everyone else in the bar, are willing to drop that kind of money on a wine glass filled with tomato juice and cheap vodka, you're inherently interesting in one way or another... And you are. Sometimes, it just takes a bar like this to figure it out... I suppose there's a value in that, too.In short, if you're looking to feel both inadequate and illustrious while sucking down a world-class Bloody Mary  and shooting the shit with the upper crust, take a break from your recession-hardened routine and feel special for 20 minutes, for $20.",4,2,1

Service was slow but ok with me as we are on vacation and relaxing.  We finished our first round and it was 15 minutes with no check in from the waiter so I flagged the manager down for another order.  Finally got the next round and was enjoying until they cranked up the lights and the music.  As they close at 1AM I'm thinking it's close to 1AM and last call.  No! It's midnight!  Bar was partially full of couples enjoying a night out and the bar was looking to move everyone out.  I saw couples all around looking at their watches in amazement at the timing of such a rude act.  They started cleaning, closed the doors and pretended like there was no one in the room.  I complained to the manager who stated he would comp me this and that.  I had no interest in ""free stuff"" but only wanted to alert him to the issues.  Anyway, we left as did many others as a result of their rudeness at not feeling welcomed.

The bar is pretty, the staff is attentive and serves up some yummy bar snacks, but when it came to the actual drinks? Not so impressive. I order the Madison Avenue (which is said to be a tequila based drink with blood orange juice), but it tasted more like a bitter cocktail tinged with orange soda -- not what my taste buds signed up for.

The thing that sets this bar apart from others is the famous Maxfield Parrish mural painted behind the bar.  It gives the bar a proper sense of both elegance and whimsy.  You probably won't want to drink the night away on $20 cocktails here, but it is a very nice place to step back in time and enjoy an adult beverage in the kind of place they just don't make any longer.",1,,

Where was the manager?  There were so many people working.  I noticed that the group were regulars and friends with the bartender - but that still does not make this conduct acceptable.  Everyone else turned a blind eye.  How did nobody intervene?

A place like this shouldn't need someone to do that. I am hoping on my next visit here that won't be the case. For those complaining about the prices, consider the area you decide to get a drink or bite to eat in. This bar is in a hotel on the corner of FIFTH AVENUE. I understand that it can be touristy considering its proximity to MOMA, but most people know that Fifth Avenue = $$$$$. I don't know how if money is an object to you that you miss the opulence of DeBeers, Prada, Gucci, St John, etc. that surrounds the hotel in which this bar resides. That said, both the drinks and the ""bar food"" were outstanding. I didn't have a Red Snapper (AKA the original name of the Bloody Mary), but simply a nice glass of Pinot Grigio.

My son & I arrived about 10:30 for our annual Christmas nightcap there. We went around to the end of the bar because it appeared there were 2 open seats. When we got there, a ""patron"" was asleep (passed out) with his head on the bar. The bartender was doing nothing about it. People sitting on the other side said earlier in the evening he and his wife had gotten into a fight and she had slapped him. Evidently, the bar staff did not ask them to leave at that point. The man continued to ""sleep"" with his head on the bar. I pointed to him and the bartender picked up his glass of water but did nothing to make him leave. Very soon after, the man roused and threw up right at my feel - all over his own coat, which was on the floor. One of the other guests came around and helped me move to his seat on the other side of the bar. FINALLY come hotel personnel came and started cleaning up the mess and getting the man out of the place. In my opinion, the staff should have taken control of the situation much earlier. Instead, a drunk, passed-out patron was allowed to sleep on the bar of one of the oldest establishments in NYC and eventually throw up at the feet of one of the sober guests! I'm not sure I'll ever go back to the King Cole Bar. This is a shame as it was long one of my favorites.",,,
92,Mac O.,"Alexandria, VA",679,1049,2377,4.0,7/19/2011,"When I was little, one of my most beloved books was a treasury of Mother Goose nursery rhymes.  Sure, I loved the rhythm and repetition of the rhymes themselves, but what I truly adored about this book were the breathtaking and detailed Maxfield Parrish illustrations.  I spent many a rainy afternoon poring over those pictures.  Moms and Pops passed many an evening reading a few rhymes with me before bedtime.  More than 25 years later, my mother still has this book on-hand to pass down to grandchildren.  In my family, the Maxfield Parrish Mother Goose is a treasured heirloom.Fast forward decades, and Moms, Pops, husband, and I are looking to kill an hour or so before dinner reservations at Aquavit.  Not wanting to wander too far, I, naturally, turn to the Yelp app to help us find a nearby bar for cocktails.  The nearest bar turned out to be one called ""King Cole Bar"" in the St. Regis hotel, mere blocks from Aquavit.  I think our group assumed this was a nod to that velvet-voiced crooner, *Nat* King Cole.  But imagine our sheer delight when we walked in to a larger-than-life mural of *Old* King Cole, so clearly a Maxfield Parrish work that we were all stunned into appreciative awe.  It is simply wonderful -- depicting a mischievous-faced King Cole, surrounded by his fiddlers three and a servant boy bringing his pipe.  None of us could stop staring at it.  Our server informed us that Parrish painted the mural in 1906 specifically for the St. Regis bar.On top of this incredible painting, the King Cole Bar has another claim to fame: as the supposed birthplace of the Red Snapper -- or the celebrated Bloody Mary -- in 1934.  Naturally, this is what most of us chose to order.  The bar offers several varieties, tho, and I'm a spicy fan, so I chose one made with crushed black pepper and hot sauce.  They whip up a mean Bloody Mary here at the King Cole Bar (with a mean $20 NYC price tag).  Complimentary bar bites include spiced mixed nuts, pretzel bites, and fiery wasabi peas.  Service is elegant and professional, and with your bill arrives a panoramic postcard of the fabulous Parrish mural.Yet another reason to love the Yelp app: it led us to one of the better and more surprising bar experiences I've had in a long while, with beautiful art to boot.",11,8,12
93,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,4.0,2/25/2012,"When I arrived here at 7 pm on a Friday, the bar was totally packed. The fancy staff in the St. Regis restaurant area directed me to the ""petit lounge,"" which was almost completely abandoned. The room is nice but didn't have much atmosphere, or a view of the mural, so we asked two different servers to let us know when a seat opened up inside the bar area. 10 minutes later, one of them waived us in and we jumped up, happy as clams, only to watch a different group swoop in ahead of us, ushered by another guy (the one we didn't approach). He apologized and said he'd give us the next table, but my friend was incensed that we were screwed over and things popped off. To his credit, the manager apologized and bought us the first round, which, in a place where cocktails run $20-30, was an especially nice gesture.As for the drinks...of course I had to get the Red Snapper, their claim to fame which the bar contends was the original Bloody Mary. It was well blended and nicely spiced. Not worth the $20 price tag and certainly not the best Bloody Mary I've had, but definitely better than most. The other drink (I forget the name) with 150-year Grand Marnier, champagne, and St. Germaine was OK but not transcendent for $29. That comes with unlimited mixed nuts, mini pretzels, and wasabi peas. The Maxfield Parrish mural really is cool and if you use your imagination you can picture sitting here 50 or 60 years ago amid a fashionable crowd sipping your Red Snapper. The atmosphere is both subdued with the muted lighting and lively as tourists, after-work groups, and couples dressed to impress hobnob.Somebody walked off with my umbrella but I'm hardly going to blame the bar for that.",1,,1

At 6.00 pm, the place is becoming seriously pack with an older crowd, investment banker and corporate lawyer types. Ladies who lunch will join them for a glass of wine or vodka martini.

104,E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",32,487,169,1.0,12/19/2012,"First of all ... this bar is where the Bloody Mary was SUPPOSEDLY invented. (It was called the Red Snapper back then) So, naturally that is a pretty popular drink here. In fact, its the signature drink of the Saint Regis hotel brand.A Red Snapper Bloody Mary will cost you around $22 before tip and tax here. $22 for a drink. Okay ... Its Manhatten. At least it will be served to me by a tuxedo'ed bartender named Luiz who spends 20 minutes tossing silver shakers around and beating fresh tomatos with a crisp celery stick, right?WRONG! I was appalled to see the bartender take out a narrow wine glass (I shit you not) ... pick up a clear plastic jug ... and pour a shot and a half of low quality vodka into a the glass and top it off with whatever crimson creation was glugg glugg glugg poured out of that plastic jug that looked like a miniature version of the type you'd use to fill your lawnmower up with gas.So basically, in under 1 minute, I was given a wine glass full of pre-made Bloody Mary mix, ice cubes and cheap vodka. For $22. wtfIt gets better ... I watched the bartender like a hawk after this. And saw him fill up the magical Bloody Mary jug with 5 cans of Walmart style tomato juice. I have NO problem paying $20 for a true artesean cocktail. If you use a shaker ... if you crush a tomato ... if you chop up some celery or squeeze some pollen out of a bee ... I'll give you $20 for a cocktail. But for a can of store brand tomato juice in a plastic jug?Also, I was staying at the Saint Regis (which is around $700 per night for a standard room) and walked into the bar at 11:15 p.m. one night. I was turned away by this manager even though the bar closes at midnight. He said last call is generally called 45 minutes before closing. 45 minutes!!! The person next to me (the bar was still full) told me he literally called last call 3 minutes before I walked in. So I summoned this creep back over and told him I just wanted to have one drink (this is before I found out that the Bloody Marys here are made with all the extra loving care of a 40 gallon jug of jungle juice at a frat party) because I was checking out the next day. I promised him I wouldn't need 45 minutes to drink a tiny wine glass. Still he refused. These are the times I wish I was Tommy Lee and could get away with turning over a few tables and urinating on a bar stool.Instead, I took a picture of the Maxfield Parrish painting behind the bar and left all the other people having fun and drinking their drinks.Sure, this bar is old school. It is always packed and you'll have to wait 30 minutes to get a table or hoover behind someone at the bar waiting to swoop in on their seats when they leave. But it was voted one of the top bars by some magazine at some point, so naturally people flock there. $20 for a drink, $30 for a sandwich. Oh ... and they serve Kobe Beef sliders. ha ha That should tell you everything you need to know about this place.Go once for one drink just to say you did, unless you are trying to land a rich husband/wife.",10,10,3

106,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1573,657,1217,4.0,10/18/2012,"The King Cole Bar is one of those classic, old school, landmark bars in New York City that you have to visit at least once in your life time. If you can afford the hefty price tag and tolerate the older crowd, then by all means go more than once. Why is this bar so special? Well for one thing, it's inside the famous St. Regis Hotel which was built in 1904 by business tycoon John Jacob Astor IV.* For another thing, and probably the more important reason, this bar is believed to be the birthplace of the original Blood Mary, or the ""Red Snapper"" as the inventor Fernand Petiot wanted to call it (obviously he was unsuccessful in that endeavor as people around the world prefer the name that stuck to this day). The bar itself is a beautiful sight to behold with its legendary mural painted by Maxfield Parrish, elongated carved oak bar, leather chairs and worldly ambiance. For a whopping $20 you can order the celebrated Red Snapper or one of its many variations depending on what you're in the mood for. Differences in alcohol base, seasonings, accoutrements and tomato juice all come into play when making a decision. For example, there is a variation that uses gin instead of vodka or uses Old Bay seasoning for some New England flare etc. etc.The drink itself is very flavorful (and I'll fully give them credit for that) but I must note that I was not super pleased with the ice cubes I encountered in my beverage nor the glass in which it was put. First off, this is a $20 drink so I do not expect to have a ton of ice chips diluting it. For a drink like this, I was expecting hand cut or the larger, more impressive cubes you often see at mixology bars that charge over $15 for a single libation. This coupled with the fact that it was put in what seemed like a wine glass just irked me a little. The glass type I can completely forgive if that is their tradition. The over abundance of ice most likely churned out of a mini freezer in the back? Not so much. That being said, I still enjoyed my drink as it packed a lot of zest with its ground white pepper and Tabasco. Despite the ice cube situation, there was still a nice amount of alcohol in there but Mr. Bartender, you'd do well to not adulterate it so the next time we meet.As far as the crowd goes, I was by far the youngest in the room (which I guess is not a bad thing) but appearances do seem to matter here. I honestly believe that the management places reserved signs on all of the tables in the bar area to avoid seating those who are not dressed up to their standards. Enter with class and you'll be treated with class. I myself showed up wearing black Valentino and was immediately escorted to one of these ""reserved"" tables next to two older gentlemen who looked like the sort that hangout in bars like this constantly. Later I saw a touristy-looking couple show up in jeans who spoke a few words with the host and then walked away looking disappointed. I was and still am suspicious.Many of you may not know to ask this but there is a secret surrounding the mural that can be acquired from the bartender. The ""secret"" is crass so don't get your hopes up thinking it's a wonderful, insightful piece of history. I assure you, it is not. It may, in fact, cause you to wrinkle your nose in disgust.Now having had the Red Snapper, I think next time I come to the King Cole Bar donning my finest and emanating chic appeal I shall opt for another choice of poison. Perhaps something more worthy of a $20 price tag, such as an Old Fashioned or Whiskey Sour. I can see it now: me, a dress, heels, hair down, sitting at a small table in the corner cloaked by darkness, sipping idly on my cocktail and surreptitiously watching patrons around me. I can hear the pretentiousness calling! Grab a friend (but never more than two) and head over to King Cole Bar to indulge in a beverage that will definitely set you back in your expenses and hopefully set you back a few decades. Remember, a little pretension never hurt anyone... permanently.*Random fact: He was one of the 1,514 people on board the Titanic who did not survive.",16,9,12

It was good and one of the three recommended drinks. Me likey but maybe not for $25 haha I will say that the drinks packed a punch though; you'd still need three to make you woozy, but I was pleasantly pre-buzzed at one. As for the Mary Terranean, my friend said her first sip was pure olive oil. You might want to swirl before drinking. Other than that, nothing special, considering that the reason I dragged her here was because it was where the Bloody Mary cocktail was invented. It's bucket list kind of place. Decor=======The kind of atmosphere you want for a bar. Crowded with well-dressed persons and the buzz of conversation. The type of seating is rather unexpected. Pin buttons hint at the era, but from what some of the other reviews said, what sounded like stuffed wingback chairs would have been better. There is the painting, and if you're lucky your receipt bill will come with a postcard of it. It's the namesake of the bar, so why not, offhand as it is, it's not the most appalling or appealing art I've seen. Would've loved to have seen Dali's ocelot. Would've been like a scene straight from a book.Service======I believe the waiter stopped by about four times, widely spaced apart. Think he's used to random drop-bys of people who will nurse their drinks. Not that we were nursing on purpose! Unless it's shots, we just don't gulp it down. His service reminded me distinctly of ""The Butler"" movie. Nothing racist, just the upper echelons, what ye socialites expect kind of feeling. Because of the large windows between drop-by, though, when we were ready for the check, we waited apropos time before tracking him down ourselves. Extra!======- The first table is for dining seating. At the bar, there really isn't a table, just a woman with a notepad, but she's efficient- Facing the entrance from the outside, the table in the upper right hand corner: directly underneath the vent on both seats.",,,

After calling nearly a dozen times over the course of several days, I should've realized that there was some absurd level of disorganization here, but upon finally reaching Paula and scheduling the tea for our group I brushed it off and was looking forward to the afternoon. The Friday prior to my reservation, I called to inform them that my party size was going to be 7 instead of 8, just to be courteous. The gentleman I spoke to informed me that he did not have any record of my reservation. The reservation I called about a dozen times to obtain and had set A MONTH in advance. I explained that I had gone through Paula and that perhaps there was some poor communication, and was informed that even if that was the case, they wouldn't be able to accommodate our party. I was promised that he would figure out what had happened, and call me back within an hour to confirm whether or not they would be able to work something out. I got NO CALL BACK, at all. I also hardly got any sort of apology for the clear incompetency of the staff in LOSING my reservation and ruining a birthday party that was planned a month in advance. Really incredible.

But, I imagine that it could get annoyingly crowded. I ordered a Manhattan and sort of forgot how expensive some of those fancy hotel bars can be... $25! It was a good enough cocktail, but nothing special. My niece and her friend arrived a little early, so before I finished my drink I moved outside to have tea. For $25, I would have expected them to bring my drink out for me--especially a drink in a martini glass. Oh well.Tea was lovely--the setting is beautiful and very comfortable. It's bright and pleasant. I believe they've recently renovated the atrium area so the furniture is more modern, but the ceiling, chandeliers, etc. are more old-world classic style. There was a harpist, which was a nice touch. We had a good time ""naming that tune."" It ranged from Twinkle, twinkle little star to Coldplay.The tea itself was good. Nothing really special, but good. I had the Imperial Earl Grey. My niece had the Mango Tango and her friend had the English Breakfast.The savory course included four classic finger sandwiches (salmon, roast beef, cucumber, egg salad) and one mini quiche (ham, I think.) They were all fine--again, nothing super special, but all tasty. The big disappointment was that they were all a little too cold. At least the quiche should have been room temperature--or even warm.The sweet course was also good. There were two kinds of scones (plain and raisin) along with a few other sweet things--a macaron, an éclair and some others I don't really remember... And of course, they were accompanied by lemon curd, raspberry jam, and clotted cream.Although it was very nice to enjoy a leisurely tea and not be rushed, the service was somewhat lacking. It was only after we finished our sweets that someone came over to offer more hot water for tea. And I don't really like to have to ask for the check unless I'm in a rush.All in all, it's a lovely tea--the setting is serene and comfortable, but it's not without it's shortcomings.

116,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",30,105,75,4.0,1/5/2012,"Sandwich and a drink: $63.50. Including tax.  Not including tip.Now the good news.Stopped in here on the recommendation of an English gent I know, a genteel sort who makes a living traveling the world dealing in esoteric, high-end horology.  A few years ago, he told me that the King Cole Bar was one of his favorite bars in New York. Never one to forget such a recommendation, I'd looked in a few times, but, since I generally dress like a garbage man, had always felt inappropriately attired.  Last week, though, with a thin wad of hundreds in my wallet and a vacation hotel bill magically reduced by the last-minute intervention of the Empty New York Apartment Fairy, I didn't give a good goddamn.  I waltzed in wearing my trademark strip mall tuxedo of Gore-Tex, 501s, and a clean pair of hiking boots, sat at the corner of the bar, and asked for a Manhattan.  To be made with Michter's rye.The drink was very well made, overlarge, and was served with both panache and a tri-lobed bonbonniere filled with pretzel bits, wasabi peas, and some truly excellent beer nuts.  In hindsight, this compensates somewhat for its $31 price tag.  Would definitely have walked if I'd asked or known the price before, though.Yet-- that would have been a mistake.  Because the charm of such rooms isn't the exclusivity generated by the prices;  rather, it's the type of characters they attract who are prepared to pay such prices.  By chance, I'd sat next to a couple of elderly, nattily-dressed American gents who were clearly very old friends.  They'd ordered food, and when one of them's gorgeously-plated club sandwich hit the bar, I immediately asked to be brought the same.  (Again, without asking the price.  Ugh.)When my plate arrived, I turned to the gent whose lunch I'd cloned, pointed at my sandwich, bowed, and said, ""You lead by example.""  What followed was one of the most urbane and civilized conversations I've ever had in a bar.Turns out these two were from San Francisco, had known each other going on 70 years, and one of them was originally from Montreal.  Both had served in the Pacific in the US military in WWII.  They'd been periodically meeting at the King Cole bar in winter to re-hash old times.  Our chins wagged for about an hour, on all kinds of topics;  we parted as friends.Much of my pleasant memory of that two-hour lunch is due to the presence of those two old soldiers, but a great deal of it can be attributed to the tone of the barroom itself;  a warm, woody, quiet haven of softly-spoken courtesy and old establishment good manners.  There is still a role for such places in our society, I think.Oh... the $27 club sandwich was fine, and it did seem to have most of a goddamned chicken in it.  I mean, they know they're fleecing you, they *admit* they're fleecing you, bare, but they try to be nice about it.I might drop in again, once every five years or so.  Because some times, one just can't get a stool at Rudy's.  So one makes do.",11,16,15

120,Dorian K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,41,0,4.0,4/1/2015,"Firstly this place is small, there is a larger marble lounge area right outside that is spacious and airy, but the bar area and the few cushioned velvet tables and coaches around it is small. If you come here on a busy night you might not get a bar seat or table. Cocktails are $20-$30, the bartender looked like Sean Connery or the Most Interesting Person in the world classy and out of a Bond film. Nuts are good and complimentary. If you come here for just drinks and cocktails this place is 5 stars. The decor is amazing and great. The mural on the back wall is classic and the rest of it is pretty decent too.Unfortunately after me and two other Wall Street buddies got our cocktails we ordered a cheese plate that should have been simple since nothing needs to be cooked but it literally took 40 minutes to arrive. So don't plan on ordering any food here not a good idea.Strictly a drinks/cocktails only place.",,,

So clean I could see straight through my glass, all the way to the other side of the bar. Obviously it was strong, but I like a little more dirty please.  And for $20/cocktail I should get what I ordered  My friend had the Bloody Mary, which is the signature drink of this swanky hotel bar. She didn't seem too impressed with it. The Bloody Mary mix came out of a plastic pitcher.  When I asked the bartender about it, he said it was made that morning. Who knows? It could have been Mr. &  Mrs T's. What was also underwhelming was the lack of garnish. No olives, no celery, no pickles. C'mon man! For $20 a pop, I'd like a side salad in my Bloody Mary. The actual bar was nice, cozy, dimly lit, perfect for a secret rendez-vous, not that I'm into that....",1,5,1

Both times, service was very rude and didn't act at all as if they cared about our business (different waiters). Drinks were both expensive (about 18 for a Bombay gin & tonic and 20 for a Moscow mule). I sent my moscow mule back twice and got no apology or inquiring questions from the waiter or the bar keeper.

It is beyond beautiful. The service was quite nice. We were brought small snack trays with wasabi peas, mixed nuts, and small pretzel nuggets while we waited for our drinks. I was torn between which signature bloody mary drink to get--the Red Snapper, the DC version (being a DC native, I'll just have to make it to the St Regis locally to try this version), or one of the other versions with tequila. I settled on the one that was straight up bloody mary mix with jalapeño peppers and tequila. It was tasty for sure, but $20 worth of tasty? Probably not. It wasn't the best mixed drink I've ever had, though probably one of the most expensive. Would I go again? Again, probably not.

Updated review","Well, I actually made it here for drinks, about 6 months after the ""no shorts allowed"" incident.  To be honest, I was pretty disappointed.  The bar was crowded for 7 PM on a Saturday night, but not packed.  Outside the bar, there is seating along the 55th st side of the building, with a Piano and player.  We decided to sit there for a while.  My parents loved the atmosphere, and to be honest, it was nice.  They went and requested a song, and it was a nice way to spend a few hours - but not what I expected.  But to hangout in the bar area itself - friend and fellow Yelper Meghan P puts it best - ""Too stuffy, too uptown... [drinks] completely average.""   My brother in law was annoyed by the fact we weren't greeted as we walked in.  Had we not asked if we could sit off to the side outside the bar, then they would have been perfectly fine with us walking out.  And, as opposed to last time, we were actually dressed properly. Drink menu was uninspired, and waiters did not know their stuff, service was slow and non-attentive.  And I know it's a small gripe, but no ginger beer?  While a Gin Gin Mule is not that common, a Dark and Stormy is.  It's not like the stuff goes bad...   I'm sure I'll come back again at some point... but if I had a choice I'll be at Bemelmans at the Carlyle.",,,1

141,J.

142,New York D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,43,0,4.0,7/2/2013,"The King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel, is one of the last old school bars in NYC which didn't let women in until the 1950s. Their claim to fame is that the Bar invented the Bloody Mary (even though Harry's Bar in Paris may fight them on that one).  In 1934, one of their  bartenders who just happened to  come back from a certain French city.... was asked by a patron to recreate a certain vodka and tomato cocktail that he had tasted while overseas. The formula was then spiced up to  include salt, pepper, lemon and worcestershire and voila,  the Red Snapper was born -- as apparently 'Bloody Mary' was deemed too vulgar for the King Cole Bar.Now as I'm not a Bloody Mary drinker, I opted for another signature cocktail, the $29 King's Passion featuring champagne and 150 year old Grand Mariner -- a bit stiff on all accounts. But I wasn't really here for the drinks. The main attraction was the Maxfield Parrish 'Old King Cole' mural that is displayed behind the bar. Apparently there is a secret behind the mural that if you're nice, the bartenders will tell you. It's kind of like one of those 3D paintings that if you stare at it long enough you just might see it. So I'll leave it for you to discover what's really behind that mischievous grin, but if you're like me and have to know....Spoiler Alert below. Secret of the Mural:   Colonol John Jacob Astor, who founded The St. Regis in 1906 (and as another trivia fact was the wealthiest passenger on the Titanic -- and went down with the ship), had himself painted as the face of King Cole. But not everyone knows that on a dare, Maxfield Parrish painted him in the midst of a fart.",1,1,1

144,Kate F.,"New York, NY",268,536,11,3.0,4/18/2011,"For the bar only - $44 for a martini and bloody mary is crazy talk, even for high end NYC hotel bar drinks. Though in a rainstorm after walking around MOMA for a few hours, we did deeply appreciate the club chairs and relaxed atmosphere. The tinkling piano was a nice touch too. A bit cramped but if not for the rainstorm, it would probably have been emptier with less of a din, which would have been nice, though if we were inclined to walk farther on a sunny day we probably would not have been at the St. Regis ourselves... so...If you are going in search of the original bloody mary, skip this stop. Bright red and tomato-y but with little depth and no garnish, I was not excited and left it unfinished. The martini was good and cold though - and its olives delectable. Also, the triumvirate of bar mix was a tasty meal in itself. My love of hotel bars sticks this right at A-OK, but in New York City, that probably means I won't be back too soon.",1,1,2

The Red Snapper is a must have if only once to satisfy the urban legend that the Bloody Mary was created here. The atmosphere is upscale and classy. The patrons are well dressed and focused on themselves. It is a place to be seen and seen with the beautiful people. Seating is limited so if you see an open spot grab it quick. Seating more than two to four people together is tough. Not a place to bring the office crowd for Happy Hour.",,,

Service was attentive although food took a long time to come out. I ordered a steak for $52. When it first arrived I was contemplating 2 stars for King Cole because it seemed tough and nowhere near what one would get for that price at strip house, Wolfgang, etc. However it did seem to get better as I ate it and coworkers loved their food. This place is ok if you are on business trip at hotel and don't feel like walking. Decor makes you feel as though you are dining in a board room. Not my thing but tastes vary.",,,

Famous cocktails, A large mural behind the bar. Hmm - going by my experience with the one other place that has these two in common with the King Cole Bar (Angel's Share, duh), this sounds like a success formula.Clearly, even the mad servers at Angel's Share who run after me occasionally for tips AFTER I've tipped them 20% didn't prepare me for the underwhelming experience at King Cole Bar.Drinks:Was the Red Snapper pre-made? Probably, because they brought it out to me in exactly 30 seconds. Either that, or these guys have the worlds fastest mixologist.Was the Jazz Me Blues (grey goose pear, st. germain, champagne) delicious? A resounding yes.Moolah:I'm hardly one to raise my eyebrows at expensive cocktails. But a $24 dollar price tag on a cocktail made even me flinch a little bit.Ambiance:Clearly, the rich and the famous in the city love their drinks. The place was brimming at 6:30 PM on a Thursday, with people in Tiffanys and Bottega Venetas spilling out casually from the overflowing little space. Inside, it is warm, the the mural looking down at you, Old King Cole silently laughing. It's classy.Service:This was actually the sorest point of the evening. My friend and I slipped into the only place we could find, at the side of the bar. The server joked with us for a little bit and told us he'll try to stay out of our way.He didn't. During the course of the next hour, he politely nudged me (understandable).another server rammed the bar flap on my arm because I, like an idiot, had to go ahead and place my arm on the bar top (accidents do happen).bartender took away those delicious nuts from right under my nose after I'd ALREADY told him once that I was still working on them! (WTF).How I wish I had better things to say, but I've really seen better, you know. I'm used to cocktail bars treating me like I'm special. Because I am.",14,9,8

Anyways, to wrap up this rambling story, we loved our drinks and the snacks and the people watching.  What we didn't realize until we were on our way out was just how strong each of the cocktails was... (at $23 a pop, we could only afford 1 a piece) we were quite buzzed!  To say the least, we had a very different experience on the way to MOMA and once there than we had expected, and it was all very memorable.So, moral of the story: go to free museum night at MOMA and instead spend your money on a shi shi cocktails here.",2,3,1

The wait staff was also pleasant. What killed me softly were the prices. I had gone with my friend here because we heard The St. Regis Hotel was home of the Bloody Mary (called The Red Snapper originally bc the hotel thought the name ""bloody mary"" carried a bad connotation) and I was craving the drink. I watched the bartender pour in a generous amount of vodka and the signature bloody mary mixture already pre-created (claims it was made that morning). He then gave me a postcard with the ingredients to making this signature drink. I proceeded to read down the ingredients and techniques involved and realized I didn't get the full experience. I took a sip, not too bad but not amazing, and proceeded to chat with my friend while we eavesdropped on the curious couple next to us. When he asked if I wanted a second, I said of course.

That being said, I was given the cold shoulder by the entire staff and had to wait for 10 minutes to order at the bar.The ambiance was mediocre at best.

Especially the one that sounded like a straight up ghoul! Total Scooby Doo  villain laugh..love it.The King is pretty packed during the day, especially  during lunch hours. At night however it's definitely a bit more laid back. The daytime crowd is very business lunch, or just getting out of work. At night the crowd is a mix of some of those people and people on dates.. one of which let out a conversation so vapid and senseless my friend and I actually left to go to a nightclub. This older guy who looked like the dad in American Pie, younger girl who looked like Fantasia(it wasn't)... she's trying to sound smart and says the mural reminds her of the ""photo of Dorian Gray"" and that if she had one wish ""I'd wish to be beautiful forever, I just don't know what it will be like to not be beautiful anymore"". One get the title right, two I don't see the Dorian Gray connection at all, three thanks for making me laugh.The drinks were ok. I ordered a mojito, which was bad.. no sweetness at all. The Kir Royale's were tasty tho, very fresh and light champagne with the perfect amount of chambord. The specialty drinks menu wasn't offered until I asked for it and I ordered something off of that menu that was quite tasty but I umm, can't remember what it was.The bar itself is very traditional in style and a great place to sit and have a couple cocktails.

To make matters even worse, the bartender took away the snacks in front of me before I had ordered a drink, which was rectified 20 minutes later by another waiter putting said snacks back in front of me again.The Hendricks martini that I was served was simply an embarassment; I  have been made (and could have made) a better martini. There was no vermouth in the drink (Mistake #1). There was too much gin in the drink. (Mistake #2). The martini wasn't cold enough because the bar didn't have proper cubed ice to chill the drink (Mistake #3).  I thought about having another libation, but neither taste nor wallet inclined me to pursue the cocktail menu any further. I'm sure Don Draper must have had a swell time having drinks in the swinging 60's, but unfortunately, the bar just panders now to the clueless tourist and hotel guest.My only advice: their snack mix is really tasty.

This place really makes you feel like an adult, with its dim lighting, wood-paneled walls and velvety seats. The little bar snacks (roasted nuts, wasabi peanuts) were zingy and fresh. But, the prices were simply too high. I mean, my guest's Campari and soda was $20 w/o tax and tip. My bottle of Amstel light was $12. I guess if money were no object, 5.",1,,

199,Kitty C.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,10/6/2010,"The other night I went for drinks with a girlfriend at King Cole bar in the St. Regis. A man who very persistently offered to buy us drinks, or steaks if we prefered, asked if we were prostitutes. Being drunk, I laughed and asked if he didn't think a prostitute might try a bit harder (i.e. not have her hair in a bun and be wearing a childish green raincoat and boots) and not make fun of him (he told me my large forehead must signify I was brainy, I retorted with jab about his baldness)? The next day my friend pointed out that everyone in the bar probably thought we were hookers. When we insisted that we were from the city, just looking for a quiet drink the bartender became less jolly and engaging, and when the bald man finally left us alone, two other old guys scooted down the bar and tried to engage us in conversation. I hadn't realized King Cole had a reputation for hookers and wish the bartender had asked him to leave. We turned down his offer for drinks at least 5 times before he tipped the bartender with a $100 bill, and an unrequested second round was lined up next to our unfinished first round.",,3,
