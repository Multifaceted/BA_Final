You only need one/ maybe two to get you drunk. ( I know, off of a frozen marg!!)The service is good, and the space is great.I'll keep coming here with my friends for sure.4.5/5",

The male bartender misquoted the price on the frozen margaritas then drunkenly proceeded to interject in the conversation my friend's and I were having about the mishap.He loudly told us ""if you do t like it don't drink it"" and that he ""didn't need those kind of people"" in the bar.We left our drinks untouched, tipped the female bartender who was excellent, and left. Luckily, Marielle at Vig bar across the street was a blast and took care of us the rest of the evening.",1
2,,8/9/2018,3,,"New York, NY",Tessie V.,149,3.0,296,"It's alright.Despite the outdoor space and neon lighting, and alright DJ. It's alright. I can't really put my finger on why it's just ok.Maybe it's because the 2/3 of the bussers are often jerks, half the time the tables are reserved 3 hours ahead of time for a birthday party that shows up late anyway. Bartenders ignore you, or roll their eyes when they serve you. It's one of those places where customers are a hassle. The bouncers are always hitting on you, and the bathroom lines are rowdy and nasty.But I don't know why it's just ok....In all seriousness, It's in my low level B tier of bars to go to. Especially on a Friday night when things are crowded. I think this might be a lot of people's mid/last level resort as well. I've come in at 11-12am and still been able to find a couple of seats. The margaritas are average. If you drink regularly, you will not find them strong. They're ""strong"" because they're layered poorly. It's an slightly below average bar and seems to keep me in it's web because the outdoor space, good DJ, and basically being the only bar in the area with those two things. Feel free to come, but be prepared to be overcharged, so check your statements after",3

There were a lot of bench seating inside and additional seating available in the patio outside in the back.The drink of choice as I look around is their frozen margarita. Seems like everyone orders the peach, so I did the same. I think the cost was somewhere around $11, and it was really good and really really strong. I like the fact that It wasn't too hard to grab the bartenders attention either. There's also a live DJ spinning old school hip hop. Definitely digging this place and love how chill it is. Unfortunately we didnt stay that long, my friends wanted to leave early. They told me to chug my margarita so we can go. Note, there is no possible way to chug a margarita.. no matter how hard I tried. Will try again the next time I come though.",3

When we arrived around 10 PM it was not too crowded but it definitely got very crowded over the next hour. This was a fun place with a chill vibe, indoor and outdoor seating. The reason for my low rating was I ordered one shot from a bartender for my friend, a bride. The bartender charged me for the shot I ordered and a different shot (she did not give me 2.) I noticed and asked her to correct it and she said she would only give me another free drink, which I did not want. She would not refund the $11 shot I didn't order. That was poor customer service.",

Updated review",397,2,"New York, NY",Rose K.,591,5.0,452,"Four years later and I would still call myself Sweet & Vicious if I could have a superhero name. We got here early to claim tables for a friend's birthday. The DJ was doing a good buildup around 10pm, but we got really hype around 11:30pm. The music was a fantastic mix of 90s hip hop and current stuff. When we made a request for Drake's In My Feelings, the DJ queued it up IMMEDIATELY. It was amazing. Kiki, do you love me?People were real chill, a diverse crowd. The back patio area is a place for a different vibe, but when you are ready to dance again you can go back to the divey bar area and get down. Bouncer was chill with some purple-lens sunglasses, and he'd periodically tell us to stop dancing on the table, haha. So, take your table-dancing elsewhere, but otherwise this is a fantastic casual place to go dancing (and you don't have to dress all crazy, people were wearing normal street clothes). Thanks for the music and a great time.",3

Has a good amount of space but it gets packed with people as the night goes on, which becomes a hassle when you're trying to navigate your way to the bar. Check out the outdoor space towards the back and try and grab a table. It's away from the loud music and it's a very chilled atmosphere. There seems to always be a line at the bathrooms, male and female, so plan ahead of time if you have a feeling 'cause you'll need the extra time to navigate through the people and hope the lines aren't too line.",

I would go back!",1

This margarita looks cute in photos but because of the layering, it tastes sour until you get to the guava flavoring at the bottom. It was also difficult to drink because there was too much ice.

I stopped her, asked if it was Patrón and she said ""I'm doing you a favor."" I told her again, I want Patrón and of course she proceeded to pour the drink so rather than dealing with someone who looked intoxicated to begin with, I looked for another bartender. She then intercepted the order and started to flip out on me and wanted to fight me. Of course it got out of hand and the manager came over when everyone around me was telling me that she was intoxicated and not to deal with her, when she then proceeded to spazz out. Manager finally came over and rather than dealing with it in the way a manager should, he just took her side and poured me my Patrón which I still paid for. No big deal, I have money to blow.My one horrible experience may not be the same for you. Saw crowds of people lined up and ready to join the party as I was exiting.

We had even warned the bouncer ahead of time that things are escalating between the two groups and can you please get involved. The bouncer brushed us off because we didn't have a reservation (which wasn't even the issue, but thanks for passively doing your job ). The bouncer didn't even investigate the situation after I tried to calmly and rationally explain what had happened. What's more is that when my friend was attacked, the bouncer only yelled at me while wildly waving his arms saying, ""Why are you putting more energy into it?!""  BECAUSE MY FRIEND WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND YOU'RE NOT KICKING THE DUDE OUT NOR THE FEMALE WHO PUT HER HANDS ON MY FRIEND FIRST!  At this point, I really don't know what the bouncers or the proprietors of Sweet and Viscous can do to make up for the events that happened last night as we won't be coming back ever since they clearly don't care about women getting sexually assaulted at their bar. They should have handled it better and more appropriately than blaming the victim and letting sexual assailants get away with their violently aggressive actions.",1

I threw my boyfriend a surprise party here--one of the managers, Ian, got me all situated with a great spot in the back, reserving it for me a month in advance and ensuring that all would be possible. Closer to the date another manager, Evan, helped out (he was there the day of and was incredible, helping out with the cake and candles, etc.). The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the head manager, Barack, was so horrendously rude to me. The day of, I came by to ask a question and just check everything out. Another girl was there with Barack (first time I met the guy) and she was very helpful and kind... Barack was getting so mad at me because I was bringing a cake (something Ian and Evan said was fine), as it ""makes it look like people are having a picnic in the bar"" I apologized and he snarkily commented and was horrible. I decided to appease his attitude and just be super, duper, overtly nice. I asked what's your name and put my hand out. He looked at me with such disdain, shook my hand, then immediately said, ""oh you should probably wash your hands... I'm sick"" then walked away. I may return, but might use my contact with Ian and Evan to make sure Barack isn't there. Ian and Evan, you're doing a GREAT job!!!!",5
22,1,7/24/2017,792,3,"New York, NY",Liz S.,1568,2.0,706,"My boyfriend and I wanted a quick drink before a reservation at Hemlock. Sel Rrose wouldn't take us, so we made a stop at Sweet and Vicious around 7 on Saturday night. A friend used to live next door and complained about the noise, which I should have taken as a warning.Bouncer outside stamps your forearm... yes, it's one of those kind of places. It has a divey cavern of a front room, and a big back patio. Sports bar atmosphere. This is one of the preppiest, whitest crowds I've seen in New York. More girls in tube tops and guys in polo shirts than I've seen since, say, 2010 at a Houston country club. And they are all very excited to see each other-- lots of shrieking and back slapping.Okay, so the crowd isn't my speed. What about the drinks? This is a well drink and lite beer situation, though I noticed the spinning slushy machines and decided to go for a margarita. They are served in giant mason jars for $9, which is a decent deal for Nolita.I'm from Texas so I might have high standards for my frozen margaritas, but they're pretty hard to mess up. I make them for parties all the time, and most of the time I'm using frozen limeade, not fancy ingredients. But this margarita was sad. It was basically syrupy sweet ice, with a slight burn of alcohol but none of that good citrus or tequila flavor. I had a headache before I even finished (splitting it, even), and it wasn't even from the brain freeze of chugging it so we could get out of here.Also, it was topped with maraschino cherries. Who does that?We did feel suddenly tipsy about 30 minutes later, so it wasn't money wasted, but I can't say I would return unless I was already drunk and wouldn't mind the crowds. Maybe worth it if you wanted to do a birthday party and fit all 50 of your closest friends who wear boat shoes and think that serving drinks in mason jars is ""super hipster.""",2

Good throwback playlist to the early 2010's, but no dance floor.The cons: I'm not sure why, but the staff seemed to have a vendetta against me. I was wearing a hat, like many others I saw inside the bar. For some reason, I was asked to remove my hat. I wasn't sure what the problem was, so I pointed out that others were wearing hats, including 2 staff members, and this staffer decided to bring the bouncer over to try to throw me out! The staffer kept gesturing and pointing at me, making a big scene, but the bouncer and other staff members left me alone. For the rest of the night, however, this staff member kept coming by my table and staring me down. He didn't seem to have any problem with the others wearing hats that I previously mentioned. Others in my group also noticed this odd behavior and told me they felt uncomfortable with how I was being treated. I decided not to get any drinks because I felt so antagonized.Also, a lot of people here had huge duffel bags. They didn't seem to come together, so I'm not sure what was going on, but it seemed a little sketchy. The overall dress code seemed to range from cargo shorts and flip flops to full suits.

I had a jargarita ($11?) which is a frozen margarita in a jar. Yummy stuff. The music was so on point that I could twirl on it and make a landing 10/10.

The place was crowded but wasn't being hit by anyone which is always a plus for me. The margaritas are huge and STRONG. I only drank 2 and I was completely done for the night, so I appreciate not spending a lot of money out and getting what I want for my buck. The flavored ones are a little bit better than the straight, but no need to order. The one this I did notice was there was not a ton of diversity and the bar to the point I felt almost uncomfortable being there.

To begin with, it was extremely loud and the patrons on the patio blatantly ignored the ""no smoking"" sign. But it was a nice day to sit outside, so we decided to give it a shot. We ordered a couple rounds of drinks (there were 4 of us). When we realized our well vodka drinks were made with gin, we went back to swap them - only to have to point out to our bartender that she was pouring gin, not vodka, when she proceeded to remake them. When it came time to pay the bill, the bartender handed us a check for what seemed like way too much for what we had ordered. When we asked for an itemized copy of our bill, she said, ""we don't provide that, and tip is included"". That seemed strange (I've been to many bars and have never been told that before), but she wouldn't pay any attention to us - so we paid, took a second look, and went to talk to the manager. The manager rolled his eyes, said ""we always give the itemized receipt"", and printed it out. Sure enough, we were grossly overcharged. When he called our bartender over, she looked straight at us and said we were wrong and that she DID provide us the itemized copy. When I raised my hands in the air as if in question, the manager grabbed my hand and told me to be quiet. He then asked us what we got, and told me to call back if I did not see a refund in 5-7 business days and stormed off. No apology whatsoever.All in all, I was shocked at the rude staff and very poor management of this bar. I will not be back and would advise others to go to any of the other great patios in NYC.",1

Shortly after, she asked the same bartender for one more drink and when she received her second receipt, she was charged for multiple other drinks she did not order. According to the bartender, ""Lindsey"" (not sure if that's her real name), the other friends (people we didn't know) ordered drinks as well and she decided to charge my friend for it. When my friend bought it to her attention saying she accidentally charged her, Lindsey started getting verbally aggressive, childish and condescending arguing that my friend needed to pay for the drinks, all the while waving her hands, rolling her eyes and twisting/turning her neck every which way. The manager Max was apologetic and voided the transaction, but didn't correct his employee, at least not while we were present. Even while Max was speaking to us, she was directly behind him rolling her eyes and sticking out her tongue like a child (what a joke).

As the wife of a guy in hospitality industry, I am always respectful of security understanding that they have a difficult job. But here is no reason for a man to be getting in the faces of guests over something as silly as two girls going into a bathroom together. I will not be returning to this venue.",3

I got a mango margarita on the rocks and when I ordered from the second bartender she said that's not how they make it and I told her but the other girl did. So she felt stupid and made me it but I think she charged me more and the bar itself has young 20 something year olds. Reminds me of a college bar. I would go here for outside on a casual day not night to try again. But even then this place is nothing spectacular.,

Prices themselves are standard for the area. Inside, the bar area is fairly spacious. The outdoor patio area is quite spacious and good for large groups, but staff will start corralling people inside shortly before 11PM - which then takes away from the space itself. Overall, this isn't a terrible option while the patio area is open and people are able to spread out more; some staff may be a bit rough around the edges, but with the volume of people that come here (and how some may act) it's hard not to blame them some times for being that way.",

The staff is attentive and friendly.  The crowd veers towards the younger side, with your normal bridge and tunnel crowd on weekends.  As the night goes later it tends to get pretty crowded and usually with much more intoxicated buffoonery.  This is too be expected for weekends in this area.  If you are already ""lit"" and want an open large space with outdoors and enough people to not really notice your stumbling, then this is your spot!Side not the bouncer on weekends scans ID's, I've never been a fan of being recorded where I'm at in that sense.  Expect long waits for the bathroom as well.",3

So I Poured it out where I was standing. The bouncer didn't like the location for some reason (""YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE STREET, AND YOU POUR WATER OUT IN FRONT OF THE BAR? YOU GOTTA STEP OVER HERE BRO""... so he told me to wait ten minutes before going in.  I've been going to clubs and bars in New York for years, and I've never seen a bouncer have such a superiority complex as this guy. He really got off on feeling like he was the boss. It was such a ridiculous thing to get riled up at, I was pretty much at a loss for words.Anyway, I waited ten minutes then asked what was up. He said let me ask my manager if you can come on (what? Over water?). He goes inside, I see him basically just stand at the bar and talk to nobody.Comes back out, and says not tonight. Obviously I got pissed off as it was the dumbest reason I've ever encountered for someone to not get into a bar with their friends, so I go across the street to take pics and tell him I'm putting them on yelp and leaving a bad review.Bouncer says I hope you get my good side, comes up to me, decks me in face, almost breaking my nose and getting blood all over me. I called the cops, filed an assault charge, will be filling a civil suit likely because fuck this place. I had a couple injuries, and getting hit up top definitely exacerbated them. Oh, I also saw the bouncer turn down a 50 year old tourist bc he had a passport.Yes, I know this sounds ridiculous and I'm sure everyone's first reaction is that there must be more to this story, but that is the honest to god truth.

There are several large areas inside for lounging/seating but normally, the DJ is pumping the music so loud, it's hard to hear anyone. It's a good strategy to get intimate so depends on your motive. Outside is a whole other story. The music isn't as loud so you don't need to get up close and personal to make conversation. It's a smokers area but it was not filled with them while I was there.

Flash forward last weekend and it was almost a replication of that except it wasn't my birthday! Still had the same local/neighborhood bar vibe. Got my drank on with jack-n-coke for 9 a pop which was a bit on the pricey side but i let it slide since they poured with a heavy hand. Jargarita's? was apparently a popular libation here which was a slushy type of drink mixed with tequilla in a mason jar. Not a bad spot to hang out at or even to finish the night off but be warned. They must of had 100 glade airfreshers going at once cause the room was kicking! Gag!,2

The second I walked in here, I was clawing to get my jacket and scarf off because it was just too hot, but I COULDN'T without elbowing someone in the face. It was just way too crowded and way too hot. Drinks were decent (If you can even make your way to the bar without getting smacked in the face by drunk flailing hands). Their popular Jargaritas are a bit tart and could use a bit more flavor than just tart slush, but I guess people don't come here for sophisticated drinks.",

At first I was completely ignored by the bartender for quite a few minutes. I then moved to a different spot by the bar and ordered a drink. I waited and waited for my drink to be served and noticed the bartenders and manager pointing and looking at me. I then went over to the manager looking guy and very respectfully asked what was wrong. As I spoke respectfully with the manager and tried to figure out what the heck was going on, he accused me of not listening to something a bartender had said to me but that's impossible because the only time a bartender spoke to me was to take my order (and not bring it).So that's my story, hope everyone else was able to enjoy their evening and that Sweet and Vicious staff will be more careful in who and why they refuse customers to be served.",1

Said he would run the cameras, call security or the cops and have me arrested. I've been living in NYC for years and never experienced this kind of treatment in any bar, by any manager. I ended up paying for the bill in full to avoid any major drama. Had a great night with friends and the money wasn't worth it.

Shortly after purchasing my first drink and settling in with the group, we were told that the back would be closing and we'd have to move. If the rest of the bar wasn't so crowded and devoid of seating this wouldn't have been a big deal, but we were herded into an already crowded room where there was barely any space to enjoy the drink I had purchased. I tried to raise this issue with one of the bartenders when I closed out my tab and I was completely ignored. I don't go to a bar to be pushed out of a comfortable space for reasons unexplained. Had I known this would be the case, I wouldn't have attended. They also stamp your hand with black ink that hasn't come off a day later.

I couldn't even finish one!Sweet & Vicious will definitely get packed on the weekend, and I would not consider this a lounge. A lounge is somewhere where you can comfortably sit at a table and a waiter will come up to you to take your order for an overpriced drink. There is no seating. There are no waiters.

My real problem is with the staff.My friend came to meet me and my other friends there. Just 30 seconds after he came in, a bouncer came over and asked him to leave, with no explanation provided. Both of us insisted that he provide some reason; he would not. I finally went to the manager, and asked what was going on. He said one of his patrons spotted my friend doing cocaine. Completely impossible - he had just walked in to the bar. When I emphasized that fact to the manager, he said ""well it doesn't matter now, because my staff already said he has to go"". It gets worse. I walked outside with my friend, who was still trying to get an honest answer out of the bouncer as they were kicking him out. After he was out the door, I went back in to grab my coat, and I heard the bouncer mutter ""f***ing beaner"". My friend is Samoan-American, and has a beard.

Note, I first offered to buy a bottle and/or shots for my party , but he didn't care.Eventually, he let half our party in but told the other half they weren't getting in.

Updated review",0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Angelina R.,0,1.0,11,"Honestly, this bar has so much potential.  The space and huge and the drinks are super good.  But it gets SO packed it is out of control.  It was impossible to get a drink without pushing someone aside.  Also, the music is dog sh*t.  Not to mention that I went on a Friday night and they made me wait in line outside because the bar was at capacity. When I asked the bouncer if I could stand inside because it started raining he gave me an attitude and demanded if I was on the list. This is a bar, NOT a club.  Meanwhile, behind him he lets a bunch of girls go in that I guess he deems to be pretty enough or whatever.  Also, this place is notorious for the bouncers walking in on women in the bathroom.  I have heard it from several people and it happened to my friend as well.  Be careful ladies!.",

Don't know know why but this place never really leaves me wanting more...Their space is pretty nice with lots of wood and a non-snobby feel, very casual/ / laid-back city hip is what I would use to describe this place. The music is usually ok, mostly DJs spinning top 40 hits with brief spurts of good ""back in the day"" hip-hop and some mainstream indie splashed in just for kicks...The drinks are ok, usually rather hit or miss depending on the bartender you get. The men are definitely more heavy-handed with cocktails here than the ladies that I've tried have been. This is most definitely not true everywhere, nor is it a strike against female bartenders, but with my experiences here, go for a guy...Speaking of cocktails, ""Jargaritas"" are definitely your best bet. They come in mason jars so you're getting your money's worth on amount and they don't use sour mix so they're usually rather pleasantly potent.Sweet & Vicious is a lot of fun if you're in a group or if it's a nice day because they have a really nice outdoor patio space that unfortunately becomes a zoo on weekends so you're best enjoying it on a Wednesday or Thursday.

From the second he answered the phone he was awful, and very degrading asking why I even cared about paying too much (really?! This is NYC...). I spent 40 minutes on the phone with him and have never been so angry about a conversation. He also blamed me for being naive and thinking that the first manager would handle the problem. As someone in the customer service industry I try to be understanding, things happen but there is NO excuse to be rude to a customer who has been pretty understanding for a mess up that was made at your establishment. No apologies were made and he flat out refused to help. I later found out that Max was the pony tailed man who initially over charged me to begin with!

195,1,5/23/2014,615,1,"Seattle, WA",Vania K.,372,3.0,585,"Sweet & Vicious, I think I liked you more last summer. I've changed quite a bit in the past year, more so than I can say about most years. I remember coming to Sweet & Vicious early last summer for an after-work happy hour date (there are no drink specials, I don't think) and thought it was cute. Maybe I actually just liked the guy I was with, or maybe Sweet & Vicious is more of a summer day-drinking spot. The outdoor space was open, and I thought it was charming. I got the frozen margarita (which they serve in a mason jar). I can put away quite a few of those... yum!  Anyway, fast forward a year later... on a rainy spring evening, my friends and I decided to wait out the rain (we're from Seattle so we don't believe in umbrellas). The place was pretty packed but we found some seats along the long benches in the back. Drinks are pretty standard ($7 for a Guinness) and they still serve those cute frozen margarita in mason jars, but the ambiance is completely different. They play dance-y music from the 90s and more recent decades, and we sat right below one of the speakers so we found ourselves SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER even though we're literally sitting right next to each other. I don't mind the loud bar scene at all, but sitting in that corner by the speaker really reminded me of being stuck at an outrageously loud spinning class that was getting stuffier and more crowded by each passing minute. The bartenders were attentive and quick to notice a lady in need of a refreshing alcoholic beverage, despite them catering to a bunch of different semi-drunk groups. The crowd was actually pretty diverse, not at all as fratty as I thought it would be. Seems like you can reserve tables for big groups (there are really only 2-3 tables that we saw), so that's a plus. We were kicked out of our table (which we didn't reserve) because the 11pm party decided to show up early (it was 10:15!). We protested slightly as we took the last sips of our drinks, but then the bouncer (?) showed up and told us to give up the table because it was reserved for the party who had just arrived (after the host told us that we had roughly another hour before we needed to give up the table just a few minutes before!). Overall though, a pretty chill bar to drink with friends on a weekend night (not my favorite time to drink), or a charming, outdoor day drinking destination.",2

You'll be able to get some seating in the back (or even on the patio if it's nice out), and won't have to deal with any lines to get in.Bartenders are quick, and the drinks aren't totally unreasonable ($9 for most lower to mid-shelf mixed drinks, and also $9 for their knock-you-on-your-ass margaritas).The crowd also seemed to be really good, though it was too crowded for dancing. There was a big ass TV in the corner for March Madness. There was a bouncer specifically for the bathroom (to make sure girls didn't go to the guy's room to avoid the line. It was fun watching him bust people). And the guy-to-girl ratio actually wasn't horrible by the time I left around midnight. But then again, I was with a gigantic group of girls. So your mileage may vary.",

Tons of 80s and 90s music. 4) Plenty of dancing for all levels...and lets stress ALL sorts of contortions were eagerly expressed5) Relatively more spacious near the bathroomCons:1) Outdoor space closed at 11:30 pm...wth2) Turned into a sweaty sardine can3) Only place with space was near the bathroom4) Not the best, not the worstOverall, it was pretty fun to just hang out, chill, listen to old toons and get slosh-faced",1
198,,9/15/2015,1,,"Manhattan, NY",Sarina M.,0,1.0,2,"Service was terrible. Bartender was extremely rude. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Too many bars in the city. Don't settle. We were watching a football game on a Sunday aka FOOTBALL SUNDAY and with 10 second left on the clock, the team about to score and potentially 13 shots ordered, the manager storms over and shuts the television off. Wow. Okay. Super lame move. He refused to turn the television back on. The easiest way to lose money. Our entire group would have ordered a round and he failed. Major fail. And upon addressing our concerns on the way out he says. ""Get out."" Unbelievable. I'm surprised they even have business. Shitty time overall. If you walk past this place.... Keep walking. You can find better. IF I COULD RATE THIS NEGATIVE 5 STARS, I WOULD.",2
