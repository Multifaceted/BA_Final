0,Kevin T.,"New York, NY",281,70,173,5.0,3/11/2018,"A really nice place to grab drinks with a friend and actually have a conversation at normal speaking volume. It's more of a lounge than a bar, and opens to the public around 4pm. The decor is nice and there are plenty of seating options, from booths to lounge tables to the bar. When a friend asked to get drinks to catch up and discuss something important, this was the ideal place around FiDi. I came with my friend on a Thursday night after work and it wasn't too busy. I had the Kentucky bourbon drink, which was really solid. The bartender was also really friendly - she recommended this gin and blueberry drink she had just created that day, and it ended up being really good! They do have seasonal drinks so I'm looking forward to similar cocktails when I go back this summer.",2,1,
1,Jung-In S.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,162,450,3.0,6/5/2018,"Blue Bar is a hop away from my work, so it's been the team's after work spot a couple of times. The decor is quite traditional and there hasn't been a wait or a crowd either time I came. Blue Bar has been good for going out with work colleagues because it's not too loud and nice, but not too nice if ya catch my drift. Do note that there aren't any hally hour specials though! Also, there are wedding photos all over the place since it's more of an event space than a bar scene. The first time I came, I tried some cocktails as well as some snacks, including the truffle fries, calamari, and flatbread. My only complaint was that the calamari was so salty. We didn't finish it. The second time, my party got a mix of beers and cocktails. For noshing, we ordered the pretzel and truffle fries again. Unfortunately, the truffle fries weren't crispy and had nary a taste of truffle. Perhaps they just forgot to toss the spuds in truffle oil, who knows. The pretzel was tasty at least, although we could have used a knife since we were sharing. It was fine though. No complaints about service either time, but if I come back, it will be for drinks only.",1,,
2,Nicole C.,"Brooklyn, NY",290,61,98,4.0,5/6/2018,"This place seems very much meant for those who work in the financial district to come for a drink after work. The ambiance was interesting, but got better as it got more crowded. Ironically and pleasantly, they played 90's pop hits, which wasn't what I'd expect from a swanky lounge like this. The snacks were good!",,,
3,John I.,"Summit, NJ",1,7,1,5.0,2/20/2018,"Folks, can we all agree to stop talking about this place, before it does become a scene?  Seriously, if you're looking for a classy place for some drinks and some snacks where you can actually hold a conversation, this is it. Don't come here looking for a scene, bring your own scene and enjoy!",1,1,
4,Aly M.,"Brooklyn, NY",195,152,173,4.0,2/23/2018,"Very interesting spot! Beautiful high ceilings and in a beautiful building. A bit of a strange experience (the big screen tv doesn't quite go with the colonial ambiance but might be fun to watch a game there) and the background music was 90s hits (Celine Dion and Britney Spears). Again I can't really complain because who doesn't like a throw back within a throwback but just a bit odd. Had a Brooklyn India Pale Ale and Lagunitas IPA and the hummus and olive/artichoke appetizer. The hummus, olives and pita was delicious. The artichoke was cold and I could have done without. Would definitely stop in if you are looking for a quiet place to talk near the hustle and bustle of Stone Street.",,,
5,Julie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,61,53,4.0,6/27/2018,"This is a great and quiet spot to have drinks. The service was a bit slow in the beginning, but once the gentleman manager(?) noticed that I was sitting at a table waiting - the one bartender became much more attentive. Drinks are good, but again, most importantly one of the few spots in FiDi that isn't overly packed and where you can actually hold a conversation with a coworker or a friend.",,,
6,Tony C.,"New York, NY",0,1,4,5.0,11/30/2017,I've been here only a few times but had a great experience every time. Great food and even better cocktails. There's a nice atmosphere where you can actually hold a conversation. The bartender Beata does an incredible job there. She's very attentive and have a great personality. I'm in the industry and I've never seen anyone that could multitask like Beata. She basically runs the whole bar by herself and she does it seamlessly. Definitely will be back!!,,,
7,Mendy Y.,"Austin, TX",547,534,421,4.0,11/26/2015,"Saw that this place was right in the neighborhood and couldn't resist checking it out. I'm so glad I went! This is not your typical bar. The India House is actually an event venue and the bar/lounge area is only open to the public in the evenings Monday-Friday. Because the space itself is a large house and not a restaurant/bar, it has quite a different vibe. I went on a Monday night so it was pretty empty, but the atmosphere felt chill rather than dead. Plus, the bartender and manager there are really fun and I had a great time talking to them. They have a great selection of cocktails and wines. Don't forget to check in because you get their fried shrimp box, which comes in a generous portion and is a good bar snack. I think overall this place is great if you're looking for somewhere very calm to drink and looking for a space with personality!",2,,1
8,Peter D.,"Manhattan, NY",19,65,332,3.0,12/28/2017,"We had our office holiday party here. Okay place, but the food was not very good. Nothing was served hot enough, but to be fair it was buffet. The staff was not very attentive, we had to ask three times for soy sauce to go with the sushi platter (who doesn't use soy sauce with sushi rolls?). The attendant left make-shift coatroom that was set up an hour before the party ended leaving our coats open to anyone in the building (they had multiple parties going on at the same time). Nothing was stolen, but not a smart move by the staff.",1,,
9,Kelly G.,"San Francisco, CA",45,1,0,5.0,12/3/2017,"I had a wonderful experience at The Blue Bar! It is such an inviting, classy environment where I can bring a date or colleague for a business meeting. They have delicious food and their service is spectacular. I also loved their bartender, Beata. She's the perfect combination of friendly, witty and attentive...AND her cocktails are perfection. I highly recommend this place!",,,
10,Robert BigRob M.,"San Francisco, CA",64,1,0,1.0,12/15/2017,"Date 12/15/17 my brother and I had been hired to Dj a party at this venue from the beginning walking inside the venue my brother and I felt like we were being judge the receptionist was a TOTAL MORON she did not know anything or what party we where there for meanwhile she had a schedule book in front of her I proceeded to tell her the name of the college that was having the event still didn't know anything she called the manager. He comes down to show us where we would have to load up to go into the party room off the bat he was very rude he didn't even introduce himself I just got a ""hey you need to go around back I will wait for you"". I proceeded to go to the side door like instructed first thing that comes out his mouth is I HAVE NO TIME FOR YOU YOU NEED TO HURRY UP!! I said ok no problem we get the equipment in the elevator so I went to go back into the building because I still had some stuff to bring inside and the ""manager"" locked me out I had to wait for my helper for at least 20mins for him to take out the equipment by himself then come and open the door. Fast forward..... where set up now Ant DJ would agree with me we all test the sound befor the party starts testing sound lights or whatever the client requested the ""manager"" proceeds to run over to me and rudely tells me ""you need to lower the music Bc my guest in the dinning room are complaining mind you I only texted the sound for not EVEN 5 mins.fastforward end of party....we pack up get the equipment in the elevator I went to get the vehicle pack the truck (took me no more than 5mins to get the truck I left my brother behind to watch the equipment  in the loading area when I return the manager was very rude telling my brother he needs to close the door because his guest are cold KEPP IN MIND THE BAR/RESTURANT IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR and we where in a dirty and disgusting loading area so I return and I see that there more workers there than there should be the MANAGER proceeded to YELL at my brother telling him to close the door but I had already pulled up to take out he equipment I see my brother is upset I ask wats wrong and he tells me that the manager had a problem that the door was open long story short the ""manager"" of this bar/resturant isn't professional at all he told my brother if you dnt close the door you can get the fuck out and I will call the cops we actually would have rather him call the cops because guess what my father is a NYPD Detective so it would hv been interesting to see his dumb ass face when we the cops would have came my brother and I kept our composer but at the end no so much. Fellow djs this place is a NIGHTMARE TO GET INTO AND OUT OF THE VENUE if you have to do a gig at this place make sure you charge extra for the headaches. What a F***ing joke this place and guy was!!!!",1,,
11,Madhu S.,"Staten Island, NY",143,73,8,5.0,3/30/2017,"I love this place.  Good drinks and apps and a great atmosphere to just talk in.  There is no scene,  its just like a cool living room turned bar.  Ive only went once, but ill be back.  No real food, but drinks and apps are usually all Im looking for.",1,,1
12,Lauren S.,"Edgewater, NJ",697,165,1030,5.0,5/6/2015,"Wow what a gem. This tiny bar makes you feel like royalty. Located in the historic India House, Blue Bar is located on the first level in the back. The staff is super friendly and they will explain the whole history to you as you admire the space.ANYWAY! The cocktails are in the $12-$15 range but they are a fair pour. There is also wine and beer. My bf had a manhattan and said it was delish. The food menu looks very interesting as well!The highlight is the atmosphere of this bar and I love that there is a lot of history here. This would be a perfect spot for a date night or a business meeting.",3,1,1
13,M S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,0,4.0,12/6/2017,"Great place, great atmosphere, great bartenders.  The only complaint is that the music they play SUCKS.  It used to be more of a Motown and Sinatra vibe, but I have no idea what they're going for now.  Not the kind of place that invites loud Pearl Jam songs IMO.",,,
14,Sarah T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/7/2017,"Not only is the Blue Bar the perfect spot to hit up for the perfect cocktail, it also offers an ambience that is friendly, fancy, and peaceful. If you're in the mood for a night out with friends, a place to regroup after a long day of work, or just a really good meal, this is the place to be. Every time I go I always have a great experience. Beata, is a wonderful worker and will make your experience nothing but amazing. Beata puts a golden touch on the Blue Bar!",,,
15,ivona s.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/30/2017,"What a wonderful place  to grab a drink after work! Great ambiance, delicious little bites and wine. The bartender was very sweet and attentive, I wish I had time to visit more often. 5 stars!!!",,,
16,M P.,"New York, NY",12,11,0,5.0,10/31/2016,"If I had unlimited funds and could build a bar in my fabulously large square footage NYC apt, it might look like this. LOL. Seriously...cool, low key but very upscale place. Custom cocktails are super yummy. The crispy shrimp bonus for checking in on Yelp is scrumptious!",,1,1
17,Mims B.,"Hoboken, NJ",114,78,0,5.0,5/2/2016,"A hidden gem in the Financial District!  This little bar is located inside India House, which is a private club.  The bar is open to the public after 4pm during weeknights.  They serve delicious food and cocktails.  What's great here? The duck kebabs, the burger and the sliders!  Also great? The decor-- bright blue walls and banquette seating, a beautiful and huge crystal chandelier, dark wood bar, and a model ship hanging in the alcove. Definitely check this place out - you will feel like you're in someone's fancy home in old New York.",1,,1
18,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,5.0,4/21/2015,"Really, REALLY nice upscale venue.  The ladies room stall is humongous, at least by NYC standards and maybe even by suburban standards.  The upstairs is truly awesome for events.",,,1
19,Sohani B.,"Manhattan, NY",40,5,0,3.0,9/15/2014,This would be a great place for a quick meeting. The food is not great. The bar is open to nonclub members from 5 to 7.,1,1,1
20,J. K.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,335,55,5.0,7/9/2013,"This place is too, too cool.  I have been working down the street for over three years, and swore that I had tried every bar within a five-block radius of the office, but alas, I was wrong!  I didn't even KNOW about this place until I saw it from the Hanover Square Starbucks and Googled it.  Honestly, I'll try to describe the decor but you'll have to Google it to understand.  First of all, it's in an actual (huge, brownstone) house.  I felt as if I was in a governor's mansion, circa 1910.  It doesn't feel like a bar.  There are plush couches, dark oak tables, curving staircases, and miles of perfectly polished floors covered with ornate rugs.  High ceilings, carved white moldings, beautiful walls.  Each room has a different theme.  This is the place you go to when you want to impress and feel transported.  This is where you take that client, where you celebrate that partner's birthday, where you have that memorable heart-to-heart with your best work friend.The place is an exclusive club EXCEPT for the Blue Bar, which is open to the public basically during happy hour.  HOWEVER, no one seems to know about this.  When we got there at 6:00, we were the only ones there, though admittedly it was a Monday.  (I legit felt as if I owned the mansion!)  The bar filled up a little more around 8:00.The wine selection was great (about $12 per glass), and our classy bartender (crisp shirt, cufflinks, vest, the whole lot) repeatedly topped us off (and my officemate and I had two guys join us us-- he legitimately was just being nice.)  Also, they put a nice assortment of classy nuts out for you.  Gotta love the nuts.  Wayyy better than the crowded bars of Stone Street, if you're looking for a low-key thing.  Definitely a new favorite.",10,2,5
21,Andrea R.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,0,2.0,7/24/2015,"Came here for a drink after work. The staff (other than the waitress at the bar) were unfriendly and actually a bit rude. The Blue Bar was just ok inside - nothing spectacular. My cocktail was $12 which is a reasonable price especially for the area, but it wasn't very good. I don't think I would return. One of the many places on Stone Street would be a better bet.",1,,
22,Brittany P.,"Manhattan, NY",2,49,0,5.0,8/20/2014,"I enjoyed my evening at the Blue Bar at India House. A lot of people don't know it's there so it's usually pretty quiet. Nice place to grab drinks and appetizers. Classy place but it's low-key, not snobby at all. Bartenders are very attentive and professional.",1,1,
23,Johnna M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,5.0,11/10/2010,"I love this bar.  The Blue bar is the city's best kept secret.  I've been walking past it for three months and never knew it was there.  Glad I was brought in by a coworker.  It's elegant with good food and great drinks.  The staff is exceptional, smart, attentive and good looking.",1,,1
