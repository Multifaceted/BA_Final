0,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",650,1624,413,5.0,8/19/2018,"I learned of Pouring Ribbons by an article a friend shared with me. The article talked about various cocktail bars across the US which featured ""intelligently crafted"" cocktails heavy on complex flavor and intrigue, and Pouring Ribbons was the cocktail bar featured for NYC.  Armed with this, a few of us came here for ""research,"" of which I am a firm believer of verification testing of this sort of thing. After you climb up a flight of stairs, a hostess seats your party. The atmosphere is relaxing, maybe a little bit divey. The cocktails are indeed intriguing, enhancing your curiosity with their sliding scales for adventure and spirit. I stuck with bourbon-based cocktails for the evening, and I can vouch for where they fit on their sliding scales. They really need to pass out straws, because it's hard not to want to try everyone else's drinks. Our server was knowledgeable, humorous, and all-around fun with whom to chat. I give Pouring Ribbons a Blue Ribbon!",5,,4
1,Ava F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,33,20,4.0,6/9/2018,"This is a cute, chill speakeasy bar in the east village. You'd have no idea when you walk past the door because its just bland and honestly that part of the street doesn't have that much going on. But once you get upstairs it's relaxed, and you're able to enjoy really well-made drinks with a great playlist all while still hearing each other and being able to talk. It's of course prohibition themed, as are lost speakeasys. We went on a Thursday night and it wasn't packed at all, which was so nice because we were looking for a relaxed environment to enjoy our night. The prices weren't bad for that kind of place I think it depends on what you get. In terms of selection their cocktail menu is great, it's definitely more of a cocktail bar than anything else since they do not serve beer on draft but still offer a few.",,,
2,Mari M.,"New York, NY",182,58,375,3.0,4/8/2018,"I was expecting more from this place after some friends suggested it. We came on a Friday night, really cold outside. They said at least a 30 minute wait, so we waited outside for a while. Eventually we were let in the door to wait at the bottom of the stairs, again for some time. The bouncer was pretty standoffish and made us feel like we should be thankful that he let us stand inside. Finally he let us in, and the place is half empty with many open tables, and for our group of 5 they just pulled 3 small round tables together for a somewhat awkward circle. It was kind of dark with no special lighting, not really any music playing, it felt almost like sitting in someone's dining room. The one good thing was the menu and drinks. We ordered:LADY PINK (Lady Grey-infused Tanqueray Gin, Lemon, Copper & Kings Immature Brandy, Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto, Egg white, lavender, rose)DANCETERIA (Scarlet tea-infused absolut vodka, grapefruit, st-germain, aperol, cinnamon)WHEELS OF STEEL (Tanqueay Gin, toasted coconut infused plantation star rum, Giffard blue curaçao, pineapple, toasted coconut, mint sprig)  My friend also got a tequila drink I didn't catch the name of and my other friend some whiskey on the rocks. Overall the drinks were very unique in their own way, very carefully concocted. The Lady Pink wasn't too sweet and had a nice balance. Overall a nice place to have a chat with friends for a chill night, but it wasn't my favorite in terms of the ambiance and overall experience.",,,1

The owner and hostess were also really nice and made sure we were happy with our drinks. Very attentive.",,,
4,Maya N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,84,98,3.0,3/17/2018,"I went here on January 20, 2018. This one of my ""backlogged"" reviews. I got pretty drunk here which had less to do with the quality of the drinks and more to do with the fact that I didnt really like a single drink I got, so I just kept ordering more in the hopes that one would be satisfying.To be fair, I thought this place was fun, and their gimmick of ranking drinks from most familiar to most adventurous on one axis, and most refreshing to most spiritious on another axis was charming. I went with friends who also ordered drinks, so I got to try a wide variety. My biggest problem was this: with each drink one flavor always completely overwhelmed the others and nothing tasted like what you expected it to. The drinks were either too sweet or too boozy-tasting, which isnt something I like in a drink that isnt straight-up. Several drinks also call for cinnamon, which is mixed in at a ratio that completely overwhelms the other flavors. This place is also expensive, even by manhattan cocktail standards.I either tried or ordered the following drinks. I cant remember which is which from the pics, but I'm pretty sure this list is comprehensive:- SNO-CONE: FORDS GIN, LEMON, COCCHI AMERICANO, GIFFARD BLUE CURACAO, CINNAMON, PEYCHAUDS BITTERS (this one will f**k you up)- WHEELS OF STEEL: TANQUERAY GIN, PINEAPPLE, TOASTED COCONUT-INFUSED PLANTATION 3 STAR RUM, GIFFARD BLUE CURACAO  (this one came with a sprig of mint which made the drink tast like sweet toothpaste)- GEM SPA PIERRE FERRAND 1840 COGNAC, CAPATAZ ANDRES CREAM SHERRY, ANGOSTURA 7YR RUM, TEMPUS FUGIT CREME DE CACAO, WHOLE EGG, VANILLA  (this one tasted like a watered-down boozy chocolate egg cream...not my jam)- DINER MILK PUNCH MAKERÂ€™S MARK BOURBON, CLARIFIED CEREAL MILK, 146 PROOF TRINIDADIAN RUM, MARKET SPICE BLACK TEA, SPARKLING APPLE CIDER (this one tasted like straight up apple cider)- LADY PINK LADY GREY TEA-INFUSED TANQUERAY GIN, LEMON, COPPER & KINGS IMMATURE BRANDY, ITALICUS ROSOLIO DI BERGAMOTTO, EGG WHITE, LAVENDER & ROSE",,,

Its on the outskirts of the east village but it felt like no-mans land. Without the line out the door, it would have been easy to miss. The doorman was nice as were the staff. I sat in the read center of the bar and ordered to drinks  both were good but not fantastic. I want to say their bar manager, though he could have just been an intelligent bartender, was explaining sugar levels within drinks to a cocktail n00b. He really knew his stuff and was enthusiastic in his explanation and knowledge. I might have been eves dropping a little. Anyhow- I got two drinks. The first was a blue foamy thing that was good but not mind blowing. The second was good but not memorable. I liked the vibe and would come back to try more of  the menu.",,,

8,Casey S.,"Queens, NY",0,12,0,4.0,10/9/2018,The presentation of the drinks takes the cake on this one. I've not see such to do about a cocktail as I have here. They are really experiences. When coming with the group it is always just as exciting to have my own drink as to see what others have ordered. The bar staff is friendly and takes good humor in their work. The menu changes so that each time I find myself here I get to explore a new land of flavor. Highly recommend this spot ideal for dates!,,,

10,Anita V.,"Manhattan, NY",22,93,44,5.0,9/21/2017,"Just fantastic. I cannot recommend Pouring Ribbons enough. Firstly it's just the vibe you want if you're looking for a snazzy bar with high quality drinks, excellent service and an atmosphere conducive to a laid back evening with a dash of class. The drinks were delicious and are in fact the focal point of this establishment. The servers are very familiar with the drinks so they can actually help you decide what you're in the mood for. If your are coming here, I'd say know what liquor you like and don't because the menu can be overwhelming for a novice.  We started with the Salvador Dali and Zaha Hadid and we loved it! I recommend highly.  We invested in the sopressata too and also liked it, tho let's be real, it's expensive :). Still all around 5 stars for the experience and will absolutely be coming back.",1,1,1

Thankfully, the drinks weren't mediocre.At 8 pm on a Sunday, it was pretty loud, largely because there was a private party happening around the bar. An older crowd. Service was reasonably prompt given the rush. Ambiance is decent.The menu has a grid of spiritous vs refreshing and adventurous vs comforting mapping their drinks. I don't think it's actually useful, though it may give you some confidence. Just look for ingredients that interest you. My date and I each had two and none were disappointing. Maybe I'm remembering it too fondly, but I would put it on par with Death and Co, Bar Goto, etc. Worth the $15 price tag for me.My visit was of the ""crossing this off the list"" variety but I did enjoy myself and it deserves a revisit.",3,1,

An older crowd awaits, no teeny boppers here. Relax and enjoy your night! The menu filled with cocktails galore includes a map showing the various cocktails. From sweet to bitter and adventurous, the map is key to finding your favorite cocktail. I opted for Just Like Heaven (14) and fell in love with the smell of the torched thyme and the sweet but rustic taste. It's surely different and not what I had expected but definitely really good.

It is definitely one of those older people crowd kind of places, but man are the drinks are strong and delicious. MENU: I would say that every drink I tried of our group of friends was mighty tasty. They have a nifty little chart on the menu stating the taste, i.e. how adventurous versus comfroting the drink can be. There is something for everybody's taste! That speakeasy type place is always fun to visit in New York and I highly recommend spending a night out in the town around this side of Manhattan!",,,

18,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,4.0,4/17/2017,"Speakeasy cocktail bars are not a new concept in the city but this one stands out thanks to a no-fuss door policy - no fuss vibes period -  a variety of good, yummy cocktails ($15+), good service, quiet ambiance, and... SPACE. You can come here with a large group (you might have to wait) but the space might have been the biggest speakeasy bar I've ever seen and believe me that was a plus. The menu has different sections and creative names and sadly I don't remember any of the names- they have numbers in which you can use to order.  My friend ordered one neon blue drink that was topped off with sprays (from a perfume bottle) of lavender absinthe.  Many drinks have a theatrical component  - i.e. my husband ordered a smokey Old Fashioned type drink which had some like of tea smoked in it.  He and the other guy we were with ordered traditional Old Fashion type drinks which were boozy and spice-y (like with cloves and such- spiced). I had a champagne cocktail with lemon and honey which was nicely not too sweet, refreshing and fizzy.  They also all the nice glassware, ice and adorn decor to all drinks.   Service is attentive but relaxed and the bouncer was tolerable. Highly recommend if in this quiet part of town.",3,1,2

Unbalanced and just not fit for human consumption. These are cocktails that taste like paint thinner going down and guarantee that you'll feel crappy later.My beau and I went last night, with the intention of having a few rounds after a show nearby. Instead, we finished our drinks (Richard Serra and Ortega) with chagrin - honestly, we should have just settled up and left them there - and then moved along to the SUPERB Amor y Amargo nearby.

They had a Cuban theme when I visited a week ago and had a Cuban style drink menu with Cuban artwork on the walls. If you have ever been to Catalina Island, this place reminded me of that. Perhaps it was their seasonal Cuban theme, but had an Island vibe with it being a little secluded and upstairs. We had an attentive server who provided recommendations and the drinks were strong and tasted great. They give you a post card with your tab so make sure to write it and send it to a loved one!",,,

You can actually hear what you are talking about.I'm a gin lover but was not sure about the mixed drinks menu- they have ~18 different kinds plus beer and wine- so good selection of drinks.The server was so nice: she recommended drinks and told me if I hated it she would replace it for me so I can enjoy my time there. Ended up loving all of them! Especially the gin with Greek yogurt ( if you are like me who loves the refreshing taste of cucumber g&t, don't worry about this drink being creamy, it's perfect with the coconut hint). The gin with aloe wasn't bad either but not as good as this.Will def come back!",,,1

The servers are super helpful and friendly in helping you choose a drink from their VERY well thought out menu. Essentially all of their house made drinks are placed on a grid, helping you choose between the strength of flavor of your drink, to the type of liquor. All beverages are themed, which definitely provides a fun, quirky touch to the venue. For a weekend spot, the bar itself wasn't too packed and there was plenty of space / it wasn't too loud to catch up with a friend. The entrance to the bar is slightly hidden, giving the bar an overall speakeasy-like feel.

The place isn't too difficult to find, since you'll find a bouncer at the door followed by a group of people waiting to get in. It wasn't hard to get in either. My friend and I got in with ease after just telling the bouncer there was two of us. The atmosphere was chill with dimmed lighting. We sat at the bar, but if bar seating is not for you, there's a bunch of couches and tables with stools. I can see it being a great place to come with a group of friends.The drink menu was extensive too. My friend and I actually had a hard time ordering because there were so many choices. Not only cocktail choices, but whiskey and other mix drinks as well. I ordered the punch cocktail which was very unique and flavorful. My friend got one with pineapple-a more tropical drink-and didn't enjoy it as much. Mine was strong too, which made it really worth the $15.If you're ever in the area or looking for a cool place to chill with friends, check this spot out.",2,1,1

The drinks were very good, but the ambiance was not Cuban at all. How are you going to sell Cuban drinks to some hip-hop music? Maybe I am a purist, but that's how the establishment is advertised. Also, the place sounded more like a crowded bar than a speakeasy. If you want drinks but don't care for the place not being a Cuban speakeasy, then yea sure go ahead.

If it wasn't for the bouncer outside, we might've just walked right by it. When we were let in, we couldn't help but love the music and the all around vibe of the bar. I felt like I was back in the 60's even though I've never visited.

33,Beatrice W.,"San Francisco, CA",143,517,81,3.0,6/24/2017,"My review is about two months overdue but I still want to share my two cents.  The menu is presented as a 2D graph illustrating how refreshing vs. spirituous each drink is, and how comforting vs. adventurous.  A clever idea (which I've seen copied on the West Coast), but I think it's mostly intended for customers with limited knowledge of craft cocktails.  I first ordered the Ambrosial Sin (lapsang souchong infused rum, scotch, mole bitters) - a tasty take on an old fashioned but not that adventurous as I've seen those ingredients combined many times before.  The most unique feature was actually the bamboo koozie around the glass that awesomely prevented by hand from getting cold!After my first drink, I upped my standards for adventure and asked the bartender about My Dear Unfortunate Successor, which listed milk as one of the ingredients.  I liked all the other ingredients but was hesitant about the milk and she told me the milk was subtle so I went ahead and ordered it.  Well boy was I fooled - the milk flavor was so prominent I did not enjoy the drink at all and only finished it after it had been sufficiently diluted by melting ice.  Oh well, that's the risk I took when I decided to order it so that's on me.  But this is what really irritated me: When the bartender came by asking how our drinks were and I was like, ""Uhh, it's really milky...""  her response was,  ""Oh, well I don't think so"" and walks away!  Do you think at $15 a drink you could care slightly more whether your customer likes the drink?!  At any other cocktail bar there would have been more discussion, and some bartenders might even whisk away the drink and make a new one!   Moreover, when my friend asked her about a mezcal behind the bar she was completely not engaged and said she couldn't make him a drink with it.  All in all, service was bad and drinks were fine.  Maybe there's a reason this place was mostly empty on the Saturday night we visited.  The experiences I had at Amor y Amargo and Death & Co were infinitely better.  Next time I return to NYC, I doubt I'll hit up Pouring Ribbons again.",,,

35,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,529,28,4.0,7/10/2016,"I'd like to take a moment to rave about Pouring Ribbons. First, I liked that everything from the décor to the menus to the presentation of the drinks to the drinks themselves are influenced by the ""along the silk road"" concept. You'll find cocktails made with exotic ingredients such as makrut lime leaf poured out of opulently decorated teapots. Second, the drinks are wonderfully complex and delicious. I had the following:Gun Powder Empire (different rums, lime, sherry, house blackstrap rum, black pepper):  I found that the flavors in the blackstrap rum (licorice and molasses, especially the licorice) were most present in this drink, which is fine with me because blackstrap rum is awesome. Served over ice in an elegant mug.Stone Roses (bourbon, vermouth, orange-cherry shrub, root beer bitters): Hands down my favorite of the night. Distinct flavors that combine to create an incredibly tasty cocktail. The root beer bitters are very easily tasted here and add a lot of complexity to the drink. Love it. My boyfriend ordered the Painted Veil (Scottish Toffee Pu-Ehr Tea-Infused Beefeater Gin, sherry, amaro, baiju) and another drink I'm forgetting. Unfortunately, he wasn't quite as thrilled with his drinks as I was with mine-- hence the 4, not 5, stars.Nice touches include:-The [refreshing - spirituous - comforting - adventurous] matrix which helps patrons choose their preferred style of cocktail. However, I personally didn't find it to be very useful when picking a drink.-The spotlight on chartreuse. We are lovers of chartreuse, but only to the point where we are aware of the difference between the green and yellow varieties. PR has an entire page devoted to different kinds of the herbal liquor, lest you want to become a chartreuse scholar.-The thoughtful service. We were visiting PR on a busy Friday night, and although we were seated right away, the bar was apparently pretty backed up around the time we ordered our second drink as it took a long time for them to arrive. Patience apparently pays off here, as we were rewarded with shots of absolutely delicious whiskey for being the only group that didn't complain about the slow service. Just a note: Yelp says that Pouring Ribbons takes reservations, but they don't.",2,1,2
36,Yasmin R.,"Teaneck, NJ",255,333,201,4.0,8/22/2015,"We arrived promptly at 6pm, opening time, on a Friday.  Greeted by security, my group and I were asked for our IDs, on his mic he signaled how many were coming up.  We walked up a flight of steps that led into a bar room with chairs and tables.  We sat near the main and only window of the venue.  The menu differs slightly from the online menu, however, because I wanted something that I saw online and not on the actual menu, they were kind enough to accommodate me with my request.  Cautionary Tale, Larceny & Old Lace, Vendetta Road, a classic Screw Driver, and Champagne were the drinks that circulated at our table.  Everybody enjoyed their own drink, so pending your taste buds and the mood you are in, go with it.  I doubt you will be let down.  The Cautionary Tale sorta reminded me of a French 75 with Tequila. However, I did end up ordering a champagne cocktail that bordered along the lines of a 75, however this one included a touch of lemon and a sugar cube.  It was soooo delish.I rarely, if ever, give credit to too many bartenders who refer to themselves as Mixologists, however Pouring Ribbons has exactly that.  These were perfectly created; the right about of alcohol, and mixers, neatly garnished with twists.  The atmosphere went from early evening daylight to comfortably dimly lit.  And not so dim you are falling asleep, but dim enough to still see the face of the person in front of you.  The music was a little to 80s for me.  And not that I don't appreciate the 80s, I wad looking for something a bit more up current and upbeat.  So were the couple we ran into as we were leaving.  Everybody enjoyed their cocktails, but it was the music that had us seeking new retreats.  But I will be back.",1,,
37,Sahil S.,"New York, NY",127,28,13,5.0,3/4/2017,"I came here with a date upon her spontaneous suggestion, after having a couple drinks at Mona's across the street. I was surprised when she said there was a cocktail bar right on that block, as I had lived in that area for 2 years and never heard of it. It's definitely well hidden, with a small door sandwiched between a local grocery store and Subway. As a result, the place had plenty of open seating when we arrived around midnight on a Saturday. I quickly found myself in love with the interior, a simple but beautiful room made largely of oak. The front of the room has a large seating area with a window overlooking the street. The waiter was very helpful and funny. I started with the Heart of Darkness while she got the Just Like Heaven. Mine was strong yet delicious, while hers was more refreshing. After we raved about the drinks to the waiter, he was awesome enough to get us free shots! Bill came out to roughly $16 per drink, so this place is certainly not cheap.

42,Kate V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,32,1,5.0,3/12/2017,"This is my favorite cocktail bar in the city. I've tried drinks off of 3 of their seasonal menus and have enjoyed every single one of them. I love how they organize their menus with a chart in the front with descriptors like adventurous, spirituous, refreshing, etc. It really helps me decide what I want since their menu is pretty significant. And while I always get sad when the menu changes (because I find my favorites), I am never disappointed with the next version of the menu. There is always something new to try and I like that they keep me on my toes.Not only are the bartenders knowledgeable about the drinks on the menu, but also of the spirits behind the bar. We had a long discussion about gins and have even done a chartreuse tasting which was very interesting.The space is very comfortable and I like how it's not overly crowded. The location is kind of out of the way, but I feel like that is good because it means less people are in line because they need to really want to go.This is an awesome date spot or great place for friends to congregate and catch up. I would go at least once a week if I could afford it.",,,1
43,Katie B.,"Pasadena, CA",5000,1448,7149,4.0,9/26/2014,"Happened upon PR during its once in a quarter on the last Monday of the month in that quarter special event. It's a tongue twister, calendar counting shake of the head, for sure. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to it, but it definitely drew a fun crowd. The theme was luau-pirate-70s from what I gathered. All the people who knew they were there for the occasion dressed up and the place had a little tiki-ish vibe, but I'm not certain the decor that helped give it said vibe is regularly island-themed. Beyond the anomaly of the decor and fashion of the crowd, the tiki-inspired drinks were a lovely surprise, as I don't think these are always available. A girlfriend got hers aflame, which is an exciting spark any evening libation, and I got one a tall drink of water (that was really some rum concoction), sporting crushed ice and a surfbort! I was straight grainin' on that wood, if you know what I'm sayin'. We both loved our punch drunk love libations enough to order another round. Our server kept an eye on us the entire time to make sure we didn't get swallowed up in the craziness of the night. While I can't comment on the average night at PR, I can definitely say, it's not to be missed if you're on the hunt for a cocktail in the East Village.",15,12,15

46,Chris C.,"New York, NY",148,25,9,4.0,12/4/2016,"Speakeasy style. Went on a Saturday night around midnight, wait was about 5 min outside.  Not obvious to find, but the doorman makes an excellent marker. So it's true, they make you wait but then there are plenty of empty tables inside.  Whatever, at least it's not crowded.  The bar is on the second floor, dark green library / card room style towards the front. The music was really loud and like...early 2000s pop / hip hop, which didn't really fit the menu of ""moody authors,"" but maybe it's different other times of day. Service is great.  Drinks solid.  I had #18 ""Real Horrorshow,"" a rum based drink with cachaca, earl grey, absinthe and clarified milk. My accomplice had brandy. The loukanika cured meat had some bite with the spicy fennel; good if you want something small to nosh on.  Our server threw in some complimentary wheat thins haha. Our cheese and loukanika portions were so dainty that I welcomed the carb-rich lunch snack. Not in love with the place because of the music, but maybe it takes a few tries / drinks.

It has to be Pandora or Spotify, because the sound quality is really all over the place, sometimes worse than the radio, sometimes better than a compact disc, but whatever the theme of the evening, it's always unrelenting, and for me, when I'm looking for a break, it's not ideal.Other than the music, which prevents the atmosphere from ever being ""chic"" or ""fab,"" which may or may not be a bad thing, this is a very comfortable place to lounge, and the drinks are consistently incredible, and the wait-staff are consistently very friendly.",2,,

51,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,8/10/2015,"Delightful cocktail bar that has the allure of the speakeasy without the label. The semi-hidden entrance would be difficult to find...if there wasn't a comically serious bouncer guarding the door. In any case, that's more for show - he'll make it seem like this is some sort of exclusive venue, but chances are, you'll get right in. Came here on a Friday night around 8:30 and the place was maybe 60% full (filled up quite a bit as the night went on, as one would expect). 8:30 turned out to be a great time to go, because we were seated quickly (albeit next to a couple that decided Pouring Ribbons could be their own personal make out den). I appreciate the table service here - cocktail bars of this ilk aren't always that generous, so I very much appreciated our bubbly, down to earth waitress.The menu here can be described as an example of simple genius. Under each listed cocktail, there are two spectra on which the cocktail falls - comforting to adventurous, and refreshing to spirituous. I say simple genius, because any cocktail bar could do this. Sure, you could find this out anywhere with enough questions, but the fact that this is already laid out for you is a nice touch. If you're new to cocktails, this little guide is your friend. And even if you're a cocktail nut like me, knowing that a cocktail is on the adventurous side (okay okay, if you're a cocktail nut like me than you can probably figure out where a cocktail falls on that spectrum without assistance) can affirm your hope about a particular drink.\Now for the drinks: I tried the ""Rags to Riches"" (Fighting Cock Bourbon, Cardamaron, Vanilla, Root Beer Bitters) and the gin old fashioned. The Rags to Riches is definitely more on the comforting side - it's essentially a boozy root beer float. What could be better than that? It's simple, sweet but not sickly so, and will definitely put a smile on your face. The gin old fashioned isn't for the faint of heart. This baby is STRONG. But fantastic. One unique thing about Pouring Ribbons is its twists on the classics. I've only experienced an old fashioned with whiskey. But I actually got a little lesson in mixology while I was here - an old fashioned simply implies a preparation with sugar, bitters and orange. The rest can be improvised. So over the past few months, Pouring Ribbons has offered both a tequila and a gin old fashioned. Wouldn't have been able to stomach this drink with tequila, but I thoroughly enjoyed the gin version. If you're a big gin fan and prefer a spirit-forward cocktail other than a martini, go for this one.",8,7,5

53,Scott S.,"San Francisco, CA",152,463,656,5.0,5/31/2014,"I very seldom visit bars that don't specialize in (craft) beer nowadays, and I seldom leave said bars thinking I want to come back. But I would come back to Pouring Ribbons any day and here's a few reasons why.Pouring Ribbons is another one of those faux-Speakeasy type bars that seem to be trending in NYC right now. It's hidden very inconspicuously on the second floor of an unsuspecting city corner and you wouldn't notice that it's there save for the formidable looking bouncer that's guarding the door with the ""you shall not pass... unless you're of legal drinking age"" look on his face.Despite being a trendy, classy joint, Pouring Ribbons was also overly accommodating. I was in NYC unexpectedly for the weekend after I learned that Misha T. was in town all the way from the Best Coast. This happened while I was grocery shopping at Mitsuwa in Edgewater, so I was kind of walking around in grocery shopping clothes. (comfortable clothes, clothes that would be denied entrance in most classy joints) I myself was walking around with a t-shirt, jeans and birkenstocks, while my friend was wearing a sports jersey. But the bartenders and the bouncer didn't care; hell they didn't even give me an awkward eye for being severely under-dressed while sitting on a fancy reclaimed vintage wooden stool sipping 15 dollar mixed drinks on a table by the window. Now that's my kind of joint.And of course, the drinks. The fancy menu they have here sorts drinks in four distinctive criteria: Comforting, Refreshing, Adventurous and Spirituous. Their menu also lists the active ingredients for each drink , but their little drink graph definitely helped me pick my poison of choice from their arsenal of delicious concoctions. I may have mentioned earlier that I don't frequent bars that specialize in mixed drinks, and that is mainly because my spirits of choice tend to be Scotch from the marvelous island of Islay. Pouring Ribbons has two amazing cocktails that they conjure up using Laphroaig Quarter Cask(!) -- If you're a Scotch lover, definitely try the ""Bad Habit"" and ""Penicillin."" It'll make a believer out of you as it did me.Overall, amazing drinks, great atmosphere, awesome service. I'll be coming back very very soon.",3,1,2

Up a flight of stairs that shields you from the street, you come into low light, a beautiful arched window, intimate tables and cozy couches. Service was friendly, attentive, and helpful. I forget the name of the drink I ordered, but it tasted like it was made specifically with me in mind. Both sweet and spicy while also being balanced, it had some chipotle....syrup, I think, that made the whole thing just a little smoky. It was perfect, and came in a big ridiculous glass with an umbrella. The atmosphere was *begging* for some kind of jazz or funk, but unfortunately we were getting....well, things like Pharrell Williams's ""Happy"". If I can hear it at a supermarket, I'd rather not hear it at a speakeasy. Then they busted out with the Spice Girls ""Wanna Be"" and it was our cue to go. I couldn't tell if I was mortified or impressed, but I think it speaks to their fun personality that they played it. I mentioned I'm coming back, right?",1,1,1

Highly recommend it and they also have 4 categories of drinks and a grid filled with the different numbers of different drinks and based on how ""refreshed"" and ""adventurous"" etc. you want to be, you pick the number and match the drink on the menu.

63,Grace K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,4,5.0,6/23/2015,"Pouring Ribbons serves delicious, beautiful cocktails (for a whopping $14 per drink). When I went two weekends ago, I was with a group of 6 and we were worried about not being seated since it's a rather small lounge.  The bouncer was super nice to us and said they could make room for all of us upstairs and we were seated at high tables with stools. Later on, 2 more people joined us and when another large party left we were moved to their couches (much more comfortable.. their stool/table ratio is really odd)... I ordered the gimlet (except with vodka) which was absolutely delicious and the Moscow Mule, which was a bit too gingery for my taste. Water is automatically given to everyone and constantly refilled which is always nice. The waitresses were friendly but also pretty slow - It took us over 20 minutes to flag one down and get the check.I also came here just yesterday on a Monday night, and was pleased to see they had created a new Summer menu. I ordered a pina colada variation with chipotle, which had a great smoky taste and garnished with toasted coconut. The rum, chipotle, and coconut all tasted so good together and it was a nice switch-up from the original too-sweet colada. I also had a drink (the name escapes me) with vodka and watermelon, garnished with a flower shaped watermelon which was sweet but not too sweet. The drinks are honestly worth the $14.",1,1,1
64,Dominique D.,"Boonton, NJ",463,291,332,4.0,8/5/2014,"I am a huge fan of unique cocktail bars and NYC has no short supply. It thrills me when I come across one that has actual personality and fantastic cocktails, like Pouring Ribbons.The bar itself has a gorgeous wooden interior that is more classic than contemporary. We chose to sit at the bar, close to the mixing action.  Round One:Bad Habit - Wild Turkey 101 Rye, Cantaloupe, Cynar, Egg White, Laphroaig Quarter Cask: This was my favorite of the four that we tried and I would return just for this drink. The Wild Turkey 101 Rye and Laphroaig Quarter Cask gave it a nice, strong punch while the cantaloupe and egg white kept it fruity and frothy. I truly felt like a lady-like tough girl sipping on this wonderful creation.She's No Lady - Linie Aquavit, Lemon, Hayman's Old Tom Gin, Lemongrass Syrup, Celery Bitters: This cocktail was incredibly refreshing and absolutely perfect for a hot summer day. I recommend this drink if you are not looking for a strong flavor of spirits.Round Two: East of Eden - Citadelle Gin, Lime, Laird's 7  1/2 Yr Apple Brandy, Orgeat, Granny Smith Apple: Another refreshing cocktail with pleasant apple notes from the brandy.Chartreuse Swizzle - Typically, it consists of Chartreuse (a French herbal liquor similar to Strega), falernum, pineapple juice and lime juice and garnished with nutmeg and a mint sprig: This delicious drink was served in a tall glass packed with shaved ice to keep the booze level steady throughout.The menu at Pouring Ribbons has enough variety to keep me coming back and their garnishes are fresh and beautiful. The mixologists behind the bar are very accessible and will even write the recipes you would like to know about on the backs of their post cards. We had a great discussion about Chartreuse with ours, it was great to learn about a liquor that is, to us, unfamiliar.  All in all a great experience.",,,

We were seated at a comfortable corner booth that was spacious enough for all of us. The service was great. One thing that's awesome about speakeasies is that the servers really know the drinks. They give great recommendations and know about how the drinks are made. The drinks were all quite delicious and not ridiculously strong. Between the 6 of us and the 2 drinks/person, we tried probably 8-10 drinks. I think there's only 1 or 2 restrooms, but I never found it a problem and didn't have to wait. The whole speakeasy is pretty dim but has several different types of seating- bar seating, sofa lounge areas, high stools at high tables, etc.We were definitely making a bit of a raucous towards the end of our time at Pouring Ribbons, but the servers were really cool about it.

73,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,5.0,6/16/2015,"I came here for the first time this past weekend and had no idea what to expect. When we got there, there wasn't a line outside, but we had to wait a little bit before we were allowed inside. This place definitely has a speak-easy feel and loungy vibe so they try to limit the number of people allowed inside. I was definitely in a bit of an adventurous mood and decided it was about time I stepped out of my comfort zone full of gin and tonics with a splash of lime. Anyone who knows me know that I am one of the worst person at making unimportant decisions (aka what to order on a menu) and usually just panic and get something I don't like. WELL I was determined that today was not going to be that day. They have this grid graph thing that you can pinpoint your exact mood on to determine the most appropriate drink for you! How neat is that? (that's pretty neat) It ranged from spirituous to refreshing, and comforting to adventurous. I think they should try to incorporate #sassy into that grid somehow as that tends to describe my exact feelings, but I guess their current one will work. I guess I was feeling more on the ""refreshing"" and ""comforting"" side at the time as I ended up getting the Larceny and Old Lace cocktail for $14. It was super refreshing and also had a bit of comfort to it (wow funny how that works . . . well done Pouring Ribbons). It was a tequila, hibiscus and raspberry drink which is not something I would typically order but hey that grid thing is pretty neat so happy for me that it worked out I guess! Brian (being the manly man he is) ended up getting some sort of dark hard alcohol without any ice type of thing aka my worst nightmare (but he liked it so happy for him too I guess). The vibe is very loungy and there were a lot of dates. I saw one big group, but besides that it was definitely more one-on-one dates. Oh wow there was also a couple getting a bit down and dirty on the couch next to us so happy for them too I guess!This is an awesome date spot all you gents out there. I guess $14 is a bit steep for a cocktail, but for a place like this I feel that that's the standard at this point slash sorry boyz.",,,

Pros: cocktails were great, our waitress was super friendly and helpful, the ambiance was great, and they let you bring in cake/cupcakes without charging a ridiculous ""plating fee""Cons: got berated by the hostess for no reason. We initially showed up as a small group--no reservation--and they seated us quickly. So far so good. There were a few other friends who had said they might stop by, but we left it open ended. When some of these friends showed  up later, the hostess got flustered and starting yelling at me about needing to notify her in advance if anyone else was planning to join. A) No need to flip out regardless of what's going on B) I didn't know I needed to notify her, since we weren't working with a reservation, C) it's 2016...people don't provide air tight commitments to things unless they are specifically asked to do so, and this didn't seem like one of those situations. D) it wasn't that crowded at the time--shouldn't they be happy with more patrons? When I told her I didn't know that these friends were planning show up, she said, ""you have a phone right? Tell them to text you"". She was so hostile that several people from our group just left and went to the bar across the street. In conclusion, if you know exactly how many people will be part of your group, this is a wonderful place to get a cocktail. If you're trying to coordinate a larger meetup, be careful.",2,1,
79,Kristina M.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",400,502,298,3.0,5/2/2015,"Pouring Ribbons is a cozy speakeasy with a sexy, intimate vibe. They keep a limit on how many patrons they host at a time, so there may be a short wait outside until the doorman gives you the ok to walk up the stairs into this dimly lit hideaway. A pretty good choice for date night if you want to impress someone. With plenty of quiet corners, it's a change of scenery from the typical loud and overcrowded East Village bar. Their cocktails are defined on scales of Refreshing to Spirituous, and Comforting to Adventurous. They even have a nifty chart in their menu to help you identify where certain drinks stand! I recommend the Wings of Desire. If only the ""mixologist"" serving us that night at the bar wasn't so pretentious and rude. She really killed it for us.",,,

Later two guys joined us, though, and it was a bit more problematic - they were barely let in! And our waitress complained about having people join us.Speaking of which, she was suuper annoying/mean in general, and didn't let us move to a free table when we first arrived (she told us, ""this is not the type of place where you can just go to a table""..)Once we got a new waitress, though, things changed - she even changed my drink (tried Acquavit & Cynar drink - hated it) to a tried and true vodka gimlet. Also tried a gin & lime and that was good too.Ah, and the bar also had very cool menu with locations, where you could locate your perfect drink based on how ""adventurous"" or ""refreshing"" you wanted to be!

84,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,276,32,4.0,11/3/2014,"As someone who is still deeply entrenched in the college bar scene, where shots are cheap and encouraged to be taken in loud, racuous groups, this place was a definite change of scenery. The name is written in yellow on a brightly lit green background, and looked like it could have been a small bodega. What awaits upstairs was unexpected. I've never tried out any other speakeasy's for drinking (I've been to one other for dinner), so I didn't know that inquisitive bouncers were standard. I was just confused as to why the bouncer cared so much about whether me and my roommate were going to meet anyone upstairs. There was a group in front of us that was told to come back in 20 minutes because there was no room. But they waited, and their patience was rewarded within 5 minutes. I guess this place isn't a big fan of a long line to get in--playing the part of a bootlegging joint, maybe. My roommate and I were allowed in after being told that there might only be one seat, and that there was a chance we would both have to stand. Of course that was fine, because I didn't even know that there were bars where you didn't expect to be standing...We walked up the carpeted steps and entered the 1920s. The people were dressed nicely, albeit casually, and the bartenders on that night were both women wearing cute, hipster-chic outfits complete with suspenders. There was a ""garnish"" area--very fancy. The menu is printed on beautiful paper, and there is a scale listed under each cocktail that goes from Comforting to Adventurous, and Refreshing to Spirituous. I only tried one drink--the airmail (sparkling wine, honey, some other good stuff), and it was delicious. My roommate opted for the gimlet, which was great. I tried a couple of our other friends' drinks as well, and they were all very good. The prices, which are not printed on the menu, are not particularly low, but wouldn't break the bank if you're just casually drinking and not looking to get wasted. There's something that seems inherently blasphemous with chugging well-made cocktails, anyway... These drinks were works of art, and the candle-lit space gave the impression that you would never, ever hear anyone shouting for tequila shots here. I felt classy and upscale, and it was annoying when the waiters/waitresses kept telling us we HAD to sit down because it felt restricting, but I respected that there was a certain ambience to uphold. Pouring Ribbons seems like a beautiful spot for a date, too. I would definitely come back.",1,2,1

The only thing is I had to wait at the door, in the cold when it was pretty empty upstairs. But my annoyance was gone once I stepped inside the decorated space. I loved the interior design and how the seats are designed and placed. The menu is cute. I didn't know what I want so when I told the waiter I want something sweet, he said you gotta give me more information (coldly). So being someone who doesn't drink a lot, I was like hummm and suddenly the waiter goes I KNOW WHAT TO GET YOU and he went away. I personally trusted him being that I have heard good things about the place. The only thing is when it came, he didn't tell me what it was. I was expecting him to be like this is blah blah blah. I didn't ask either but it was pretty spot on as to what I like and it is very light ;) I like how they don't rush you and that it has a relaxing vibe.

This neighborhood has great places to eat and drink and Pouring Ribbons deserves a spot on the roster. It feels like a speak easy. Our bartender was so gracious in his recommendations.  I was frightened of most of the house cocktails since they seemed very serious.

92,Nadia Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",794,753,5276,5.0,4/7/2014,"Love the setup - there is a bit of everything here, from tables by the window to comfy couches to talk bar tables and stools. Your pick, but you sure will find good space to park yourself and enjoy their well-crafted cocktails. They were not very busy early in the evening, which works perfectly for those of us with odd working hours (or if you manage to escape work early to grab a drink!). Hostess was a darling, and super helpful with all drinks discussions and selections.Now, to the drinks. I had to try Pisco, of course. The Colonial Affair was very citrusy as I expected, but also much lighter than traditional Pisco cocktails. May it was an addition of Lillet Rose... It was delightful no less. If you like refreshing and light cocktails, definitely give it a try. My second choice, Yellow King, was fantastic. Mezcal, gin, campari, yellow pepper and thyme syrup - perfect. That I will most definitely order again.Special mention goes to their homemade hummus, served with truly artisanal, delightful crackers - yum! Great snack to go with drinks.Great lounge, spectacular cocktails.",9,6,9
93,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",88,202,101,5.0,11/20/2015,"No contest: this is the best place I have ever been for cocktails. We visited during the Route 66 menu (highlights: Night at the Wigwam, Complements of Mr. Harvey, Best Thing Since Sliced Bread, and No Crying in Baseball) on a Monday night. There was lots of space at the bar, so that's where we asked to be seated. The menu has this great grid system for explaining whether a drink is refreshing or boozy, and traditional or adventurous, which I felt made ordering our first drinks much easier. Once our bartender, George, realised that we were interested in cocktails, he let us talk his ear off (and returned the favour) for hours. He was great at making recommendations based on what we found interesting (we're frustrating because we like everything and never narrow things down), gave us the lowdown on the best cocktail spots in Manhattan, and told us all about the Pouring Ribbons 'program' - what they're trying to accomplish there, which is just pushing the limits on what you think drinks can be. I'm positive that they'd make an outstanding whatever-you'd-like-to-drink, but you should let them test your boundaries. He also walked us through several of the cocktails we didn't have and gave us a taste of some of the ingredients they've developed or are working on. Because the menu changes, if you have a drink you really like you can ask them to write it down on a postcard for you so that you can make it at home or they can reconstruct it for you if you come back after the menu changes. They keep loads of ingredients for off-menu drinks on-hand, so it's likely they can accommodate. Also the only place I've ever seen with vintage Chartreuse, including some that sells for $100 a half-ounce and is 70 years old. They said that it's one of only two bottles they know of. Given the it the Canadian dollar has taken recently, this was a little tough on the pocket book, but worth it. I so hope we'll be back sooner than later.",1,,
94,Jill M.,"Middletown, NY",0,5,0,3.0,3/7/2017,"The chairs/stools at the large tables were extremely uncomfortable, they left us wanting to finish our drinks quickly and leave. Maybe that is their plan?  I had the Misfortune of Virtues cocktail, described to me to be similar to a French 75.  It was very heavy light lemon but otherwise just ok. Nothing special. This place has a lot of potential. Bathrooms were messy and it wasn't even that busy, so I don't know how they let them reach that point.",,,
95,Vicki L.,"San Francisco, CA",162,479,118,5.0,4/7/2014,"Hey bartender! Pour those delicious ribbons of sweet, sweet liquor straight into my greedy mouth, puhhleasseee ...The moment I climbed up the stairs past the cute little teal painted door, I fell in love with this place. Unpretentious decor, spacious tables, friendly waitstaff, light snacks, appropriately dim lighting, and music at a tolerable level, all set the ambience just right for a small get together with fellow cocktail enthusiasts on a sleepy Sunday evening.The waitress was fantastic at handling our party, and also kind enough to let me order off menu (I got the deliciously complex ""Lust for Life"" which is a throwback to PR's original menu, no longer on the seasonal rap sheet, but available upon request) and settled nicely into a buzz shortly thereafter.Another fun novelty of the menu is that you can simply order by number along their cocktail profile grid (adventurous, spirited, refreshing, etc etc) if you want to be a little more wild. Of course, you can easily reference the drinks by their ingredients as well, but where's the fun in that?If you've never been, I suggest ordering one house specialty, and then trying a more traditional drink (think negroni, martini, old fashioned, aviation, if you catch my drift). This is a surefire way to get the best of both worlds - the creativity and novelty of a fun/weird/unexpected drink, and the boozy dependability of a classic.I'll definitely return, well worth a trip on the L train!",3,2,3

98,Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",495,794,740,4.0,1/10/2016,"Aside from great cocktails, the ambiance of this place just works. A lot of other speakeasy style cocktail bars can be so dark you can't even see who you're with, or you squashed at a table or seat at the bar and basically breathing down everyone's necks. This place had both dimly lit lighting that aired on the side of inviting and able to see your companions, as well as spacious enough that you felt comfortable the whole time. Note though: the bar stools could be a bit more comfy. After two cocktails I felt like I had been out on my road bike for several laps around central park. If I had to choose again, I would have opted for a table, out of sheer butt comfort. All that being said...I really liked my two drinks. Best Thing Since Sliced bread was a winner. It reminded me of the butternut old fashioned from J Bird (RIP), that I loved so much. Great peanut flavor on the front end and a nice full bodied bourbon to round it out. Our bartender was great. When my friend didn't love one of her cocktails he actually just picked it up on the tab. He wanted us to be happy about what we got so he took it upon himself to make sure we were happy. I would definitely recommend coming here if you enjoy carefully crafted libations. Oh and the music was on point. Really good mix of today's hits mixed with hip hop favs like Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Biggie, Drake, Rihanna, and Missy Elliott. Deal Seeking Diva tip: Pick up your motel key on Sunday or Mondays and try each of Route 66 cocktails before they change the menu in April (doesn't have to be in one visit), and you'll receive an Old Fashioned travel kit.

101,ND J.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",27,11,3,1.0,11/13/2016,"This place takes itself so seriously that it becomes nothing more than the butt of bad joke. If you want to be welcomed by an inviting host/ess, you want to enjoy an intimate setting and/or the ambience of a ""speakeasy,"" and you want a great mixologist to make you $15 cocktails that are worth every dollar, try Raines Law Room or Dear Irving (or, Hell, any number of other places that seek to offer all of the above, rather than trying to create a false sense of exclusivity). But do not make the mistake of coming here, thinking you're getting anything more than a laughably pretentious hostess who makes guests/patrons wait outside unnecessarily before meeting their party, which in our case was already inside, and a half-empty bar serving outrageously overpriced cocktails. When not using her almighty walkie-talkie to radio the doorman to turn would-be patrons away or make in-comers wait unnecessarily, she made herself thoroughly useful by fluttering around the room refilling bottomless glasses of water. We must have had 20+ glasses of water at our tables.While we waited to be ""let"" inside and watched the doorman turn people away, he was telling them that there were three private parties going on and that, basically, the bar was at capacity. When we walked in there was only our party and one other party having the quietest, most tame 30th birthday celebration I've ever seen. The rest of the bar had a sprinkling of patrons here and there. We estimated the bar could have easily fit another 30 patrons at the empty tables and probably still not have been full. And those tables stayed empty all night.The only reason we knew the other party was even ""celebrating"" anything, if you can call it that, was because they had big ""3"" and ""0"" helium balloons at their table. They left WELL before we did, probably out of boredom. We stayed, but only because it was easier than moving everyone to another bar after all the effort to get everyone inside. The bar started playing ""My Heart Will Go On"" at around 1:30am to encourage everyone to get out. At that point, the place felt like the Titanic. We'd clearly overstayed our UNwelcome and we couldn't pay our tab and get out fast enough!",,2,

They used to have these grungy looking couches all over the place and getting a drink was a pain because the place used to be crowded with hipsters and young professionals alike. Well the couches are gone, replaced by more respectable looking tables. The funky smelling floor is no longer there.  Most importantly, you don't have to climb over people's shoulders to get a drink anymore cuz they have excellent wait service. The drink menu is extensive. I had a couple of mezcal drinks - the midnight marauder and another one that I asked them to make with lime and pepper. Both were decent. Not top of the line in terms of taste but good enough.It was easy for our group of 8-10 people to have a good time here.  We had called earlier and they said they don't take resos but asked us to come in saying they would figure it out.  At first it was just my friend and I who walked in. As tables opened up, they moved us from a small table of two to a table of 6 and finally the bigger corner table where we all congregated as more of our friends came in.  Without the friendly service, I probably would have gone with 3 stars but like I said, they were helpful throughout and made sure we end up with a large enough space for our group.

So happy we didn't have to deal with the hour waits and the ""we'll call you"" BS of other bars like this. We were given the choice of table or bar; we chose to sit at the bar. Our bartender was friendly and recommended a cocktail for F that was exactly to her liking. I love the layout of the menu; the first page is a grid of all their cocktails denoting whether they are refreshing or spiritous, comforting or adventurous. Genius!I had the Sing For Your Supper, a refreshing & comforting drink with vodka, vanilla passionfruit syrup, aperol and Peychaud's bitters. It was well made and exactly what I was in the mood for. We ordered some beef jerky and cornichons to munch on, no complaints there. Next time, definitely want to try the cheese and meats on the menu.

However unfortunately, what happened afterwards brings down the rating for me. But I'll start with the positive. The obscured walk-up entrance is really cool and gives this place a vibe of exclusivity. The bouncer was nice and dressed formally, already making this bar seem very bougie. As expected, the crowd was older and more composed. The inside is atmospheric and lit just enough to be romantic and not sketchy. There is a bar area that is louder and an area with cute small tables on the other side which tend to be quieter. Our bartender was fun and helpful in deciding our order. For a bar that has three dollar signs on Yelp, the cocktails aren't terribly expensive at $15. Then the drinks came. I actually ordered a beer because I was in an urgent mood for it, but tried all 6 of my friends' cocktails. All very average despite the cool descriptions that the menu boasted. The beer was a pale ale and was just all right. That was one of two beer selections available. I came back to this bar the next day because I felt that there was a problem with the bill where I got charged for an extra drink (I would've noticed it right away but I was covering for a few people and assumed they were responsible). It was one of those moments when I figured it was too late to argue for it, but I went anyway as it was very close to where I live. Whoever I talked to was quite condescending in describing that the extra charge I was talking about was an included 20% gratuity that of course comes with big groups. I found the interaction irritating as I wasn't being pushy or clueless at all, merely inquiring. Anyway, my entire experience combined gives me a mediocre taste of this place in retrospect.

114,Sam G.,"New York, NY",40,9,5,5.0,12/18/2016,"This place is where I bring my friends who are visiting Manhattan for the first time. The usual response after taking a sip of their first cocktail is... ""OMG this is the best cocktail I've ever had in my life."" I love the concept of their drink matrix it is a grid that shows you where each drink falls being more spiritous or refreshing and comforting or adventurous. Its a great place to start the night before there is a wait to get in and then head to one of the restaurants down the street.",,,
115,Joelle G.,"New York, NY",289,763,71,5.0,5/6/2014,"This place is on it's own level. Definitely a top-tier bar. I've had my share of amazing cocktail places. This one stands out because within the drink I got here with a friend, we tastes ALL the notes in ALL of our cocktails. I've never had that occur. Things get muddled and lost in a lot of cocktails. Yes, even at classy establishments.And the music here is amazing. It's like jazzy house music. I know. Doesn't make sense. It's classy, yet catchy.  Service is impeccable. Amazing staff. They know their cocktails backwards and forwards & they make great suggestions.I'll be back. Can't believe I have a gem of a spot so close to my place. One of the best bars in the world according to many lists...",,,1
116,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",162,257,919,4.0,2/10/2014,"Head up stairs and you enter into a room that almost transports you back to...well, a year you probably weren't even born yet. This is not your average grab-a-spot-where-you-can bar. Seating is a must and capacity is set to seats just like a restaurant. Warmth and class are what drives this bar. I started with their Midnight Marauder (Vida Mezcal, Bonal, Cynar, Mole Bitters). Now, I was feeling a bit adventurous, and I was pleased with my decision, but I might not order this one again (just personal preference). It had a great smokiness to it, which I do like, but, a bit dry for my taste. In fairness, that was the description I was given, but I decided to go against what I usually order. Glad I tried it, but went for something else after this one.This is the something else. It doesn't exactly have a name, it was a hybrid of a couple cocktails and this is their love child. It was definitely lovely. Another great thing about mixologists, name the qualities of a drink you like, they've got the answer.",1,,
117,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,7/31/2013,"Really enjoyed my time here. Stuyvesant Town was promoting Pouring Ribbons at the Oval Concierge office, so I took one of their menus/postcards. I was a bit reluctant to go at first because it seemed like a typical ""speakeasy"" cocktail bar, but I had been hearing good things about it, so I gave it a shot. Not really a cocktail junkie, but everything I've tried here is damn good. I tried the Spezzatura Royale and the Teddy Bear. Don't normally go for drinks called the ""Teddy Bear,"" but my girlfriend recommended it and it did not disappoint. Tried some of the cheese dishes, and they were great. Cheese was supplied by Beecher's, my favorite cheese place in the city.Not suprisingly, drinks are on the expensive side, but they're made with a lot of care, so I don't really have any issue with that. Bartenders aren't pretentious and they're pretty pro at what they do, so next time I'm there, I'll defer to their judgment when I select my next drink (or twelve).",2,,3

Their extensive cocktail list is made more easily understandable by an axis of essentially how strong or traditional you'd like your drink to be.

You're not yelling at the top of your lungs and attempting to climb over a mountain of humanity to get to the bar to place an order. Instead, the bouncer only lets you in once there's a table available for you. I've been there many times on a weekend night and the wait has never (so far) been terrible. The waitstaff has always been nice, never pretentious. Once, when our drinks took a while, our server sent over a round of mescal shots even though we were content to wait and hadn't complained. The drinks themselves are always interesting, and you can tell how much thought has gone into them. I haven't loved everything I've ever ordered there, but there have also been some amazing drinks that I go back for multiple times. The only bad thing is that once the menu switches to a new theme, all those old drinks that I liked are gone. The good thing about the switch is that now there's a whole new menu worth exploring.

Updated review","I hate to do this...but I have to. As you can see from my earlier review, I have had a few stellar experiences at this gem of a cocktail bar in the past. Sadly, the most recent time I went very well could be my last.I came back here with a friend of mine on a Saturday night around 10pm in the middle of December. The doorman outside let us upstairs shortly after arriving and checking our IDs. We went up and asked the hostess for a seat at the bar - which was pretty packed. The place itself was also rather busy as you might expect on a weekend evening. We were seated about 3 stools in from the service bar area and one of the bartenders handed us the menus. So far...so good. From my recent experience here having a fantastic pisco sour, I wanted to attempt to replicate that rather than order off their cocktail list (though, as I mentioned before - it is pretty extensive and they now have a grid-like first page showing where all their cocktails fall on a spectrum - which is very clever and helpful). I am not exaggerating, I think it took the bartender (who I did not recognize from my other visits) at least 10 minutes (probably 15) to even acknowledge we were sitting there and waiting to order. Okay, so they were busy, but even just a ""Hello...I'll be with you in just a minute"" check in, or ""how about a glass of water?"" would have been nice. Fine, we wait, and we eventually order. My friend ordered an on-menu cocktail (the name of which now escapes me) and I asked him to make a pisco sour since the last one I had there was so darn amazing. I am not kidding, again, another 10+ minutes for him to actually start making our drinks. He was blatantly unhappy to be there - complaining about having to work that night and just really moving at a snail pace. I mean, the service bartender was cranking out the drinks for the tables in the place - working hard and fast to get things done. I don't mind a leisurely time, and I certainly understand that these drinks are art forms and take crafting, but this is a service role and apparently that night he was having none of it. We eventually received the drinks and took our sips. Sadly, because I had such a phenomenal version of the pisco sour here another time, I now have to compare any future ones they make to that original, mind blowing one (made by Joaquin I believe), and this one was a far cry from that. I mean, yes, it had the proper ingredients, but the foam had somewhat separated from the drink (which is what gives it such a velvety luxurious mouth feel) and there were bits of ice chips in the cocktail that were palpable.So...now about 50 mins in to our time here, we want to order another drink. I decide I want to try something on the menu (the Moscow Mule) and my friend will likely go to her staple, the old fashioned. We sit, eagerly watching the bartender who is now not paying attention to the guests at the bar but actually refilling bottles (tinctures or house-used syrups? I'm not sure) and actually taking a shot of some alcohol himself. Oh, he also checked his phone, and purposely didn't make eye contact with us for at least 15 mins while our drinks sat empty and we sat waiting. Finally, we decided that as much as we love this spot, obviously the service that night, and the drink quality, were not up to their usual par, and we couldn't believe we would do this, but we just wanted to leave after 1. Long story short (too late) it took at least another 15 minutes to get the bartender to give us our bill and run our card. All of that (almost 1.5 hours) just to have a mediocre drink and to be treated pretty abysmally. I have never had such a terrible experience here before, and definitely not at a craft-cocktail type bar. I am sad to say, I am not sure I will be back.",6,1,
127,Kathryn A.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,101,262,5.0,6/12/2016,"I've been here once and loved the ambiance. The security guy out front was really cool and we chatted a couple of minutes while waiting for the hosts upstairs to let me in. Having them approve people seems to keep the place pretty low key, even on a Friday night. The drinks are bangin'! I'm definitely headed back at some point in the future to try out the muddled fruit concoctions. They serve a tea infused liquor in a tea pot! How cute! And the other glassware and garnishes they have are on point. Other cocktail bars could learn a thing or two from this place.",,,1
128,michael d.,"Miami, FL",3,81,1,3.0,4/26/2017,"We went early so maybe that's why the atmosphere wasn't booming. Drinks were very good and inventive and the wait staff very sharp. Much needed upgrade for the ""bites"". Over priced, too literal on the ""bites"" nomenclature and totally lacking in imagination. Looking for a quiet out of the way rendezvous this be it. Next time we will try it much much later and let you know",,,
129,Valerie C.,"New York, NY",305,736,221,4.0,3/15/2013,"I was easily able to make reservations for this new speakeasy via email just the day before! Make sure you make those ressies though because for a random Wednesday evening, the place sure filled up!The bouncer outside will try to give you a hard time, but just play along - he's a huge teddy bear! He charmed my friend and I with stories of people falling UP the stairs to Pouring Ribbons. I could tell he really enjoyed his job - unnecessary ear piece and all ;)Inside, Pouring Ribbons is very spacious and homey! My best friend and I were having a catch-up session and Pouring Ribbons served as the perfect backdrop. The menu of drinks was easy to navigate through and our waitress was lovely and informative. Great choice!PS - the pate is TDF!",2,1,1
130,Jessica N.,"Denver, CO",107,434,699,5.0,1/11/2013,"So far this is my favorite cocktail bar in NYC... and possibly beyond. Another trip is in order to determine. I selected my drink based on a helpful grid found in the menu. My drink, Death & Taxes, was well-crafted, refreshing, and boozy. I enjoyed that the bartender took time to make our drinks, not rushing any step. While you're there, you must try at least one kind of chartreuse. My friend and I compared a vintage to a modern. Herby, intense, and smooth. The vintage much stronger and more complex. Bartenders were conversational and extremely knowledgeable. Ask them anything about the drinks. You'll be excited to hear and they will be excited to tell.",5,,2
131,Vivi A.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,37,1,5.0,8/4/2016,"Absolutely fell in love! Went twice, into my birthday 12ish am, and the night of, which was Tiki Night. The drinks are simply amazing and the theme of the place is so elaborate: from the menus, to presentation and unique tastes, so the price of $15 per cocktail is worth it. I must give a big shout out to George (bartender) for making my birthday even happier! Very well informed and super nice, made it seem as he was inviting us to his home lol. So glad he convinces us to come back for Tiki night, and I know I will return soon.",,,
132,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",281,760,25,5.0,1/13/2013,"We came early on a Saturday and adored it. Prabu Punch (bourbon, orange, garam masala, pumpkin syrup, curry leaf) is my new favorite drink. The decor is more your-cool-suburban-neighbor's-woodpaneled-ranch-home-circa-1964 than the Victorian vibe that you see at the Day-Kaplan cocktail bars. I loved the ceiling lights, they look like igloo sandcastles. It may be hard to get in here later in the evening, but it's not a snotty place.Good music choices as well.I do wish we had been able to sit at the bar; I think something gets a little lost in translation when you're telling your waitress, rather than the bartender, ""I like X, can you ask the bartender to put together something?"" I would be curious to see who is ordering the $125 chartreuses here.",4,,
133,Jay O.,"Tampa, FL",78,148,165,5.0,7/23/2015,"I love this place, great drinks and super friendly staff. The atmosphere is super chill and dark. It's up a long staircase into a room with a bar on the east side and tables on the west. Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar. Watching the bartenders make drinks is just something I enjoy doing. You know they are doing it right when they take the time to taste the drink before it goes out to the customer. Not just slamming something together and getting it out.It does take some time for your drinks so when the first round comes out, it would be safe to order your second round then. If you are of course sticking around for a few drinks.Keep an eye out for the green awning or you'll miss it. It's kinda hard to see but once you get there you'll find it every time....Whiskey sour is my favorite but try the dueling banjos. Even if it's not on the menu just check with one of the bartenders, chances are if they have a batch of the corn simple syrup  (pretty sire that's what it is) they can make one for you.",,,
134,Alicia B.,"Cleveland, OH",220,198,55,5.0,1/4/2013,"As we were leaving for our trip to NYC, the latest issue of Imbibe arrives on my doorstep announcing Pouring Ribbons the Cocktail Bar of 2012.  Perfect timing.  We make a mental note to try to make it there during our trip, but don't get too excited because, while I am sure the editors of Imbibe have fastastic taste, I don't want to get caught up in all the hype.I will just say. They are absolutely correct on this one.  Well, maybe.  I haven't been to every bar in the country - though, we are certainly getting up there in numbers.  We were totally blown away with Pouring Ribbons.First, they have a gentleman for a doorman.  Great.  This person is the front of your business and the first person customers remember - great customer service goes a long way.  They are definitely doing this right!I love the atmosphere inside.  It's cozy while still being modern and updated.  It's also larger than other NYC bars, which is nice.  They still do not allow it to get crowded or cramped.I especially appreciate the scale letting your know how adventurous or refreshing your drink  is.  It makes it very easy to choose the perfect drink for your mood. I tried the Ragin' Glory and the One Flight Up - two of the best drinks I have ever tasted.Our server was very friendly and prompt, and while we didn't need her guidance, she seemed very willing to give assistance and made sure to come back after each round was delivered to make sure we were happy with it.My advice - go now.  Before everyone else finds out about the place they have a line around the block.  It's going to happen.",3,,

(Seriously, down to the droplets on a flower).  The service is amazing and the waitstaff know, literally, everything there is to about each cocktail.  The only complaint I would have is the way the bar can smell while they're making some of the drinks, but goes away after a bit.  Easy to walk past the vintage looking door out front -- so be on the lookout.  But!  A great place for dates, girls nights out.",,,

After spending hours wandering around cold NYC, we were ready for a drink before Ko. We were at Pouring Ribbons door as soon as they opened. We headed upstairs and seated ourselves at the bar. We discovered our bartender used to live in Colorado, so talked about that and swing dancing. Between that conversation, we managed to enjoy one delicious drink apiece, talk about chartreuse labels, a digestive apertif I found in Portugal, and vintage chartreuse acquirements. Our cocktails were enticing, flavorful, and picture worthy.Do you ever battle between desire and fiscal responsibility? Desire won as I order a half ounce of the 1940s era green chartreuse. I took pictures of the chartreuse collection, both green and yellow 1940s era chartreuse bottles, and my drinks (1 2012, 1 1940s pour). Words cannot describe what I tasted.

It was a spacious ""speakeasy"" setting with several kinds of drinks on the menu and they will rate each drink by the alcohol level, the taste, adventurous level... so if you are in a mood of trying something really adventurous, you can decide a drink based on their rating..I don't remember what I ordered.. All I remember was it has some pepper kick in it and I love it.. I didn't want it too strong because I wanna be able to get home..Erin M.

But hey, crossing two off my bucket list is surely nothing to complain about. Pouring Ribbons is in a very charming upstairs location, the stairs is a tad narrow but it adds to its ambiance. The seating is intimate and the lighting dim, to set the mood. The menu has a large variety for you to choose from... which makes it hard to decide because everything sounds so amazing. What I liked about Pouring Ribbons is that it's not too overcrowded and you can come to enjoy a nice cocktail and convo with your party. The drinks were top notch, as expected... but with so many solid choices, it was hard to finally decide upon one! Our waitress was patient and delightful. I definitely want to come back again a few more times to try some other drinks on the menu! Pouring Ribbons is everything a specialized/ bespoke cocktail bar should be like- great service, a little off of the beaten path, and most importantly, amazing drinks to throw back. Needless to say, I can't wait for my next visit!",4,1,2

Cocktails are rated on an x-y axis of refreshing-spirituous and comforting-adventurous. I've tried the Fort Julep, Spirit of Diplomacy and the Rake & Consort and all of the cocktails were stellar. They also specialize in chartreuses, so if you're into that, go for it. The place has a sort of retro school hall feel to it. I really love the curved windows that overlooks the street. The place is painted in this saturated and rich teal color, and even the wooden flooring is stained in this teal color. It's on the second floor of a nondescript-looking Alphabet City apartment complex, but the carpeted stairs definitely make you feel like you're being transported into a different world.And oh, I love that it's still relatively unknown.

152,Michael B.,"New York, NY",1,17,0,5.0,8/22/2016,"Easily the best cocktail bar in New York City. Consistently the most creative and well executed drinks and never a ridiculous wait time like you'd find at Death & Co, Little Branch, or Raines Law Room.Joaquin Simo, the head bar tender, is one of the most admired among the bar tending community. He is constantly pushing the envelope with ingredients that NEVER compromises taste, deliciousness, and enjoyment for the sake of experiment. More and more cocktail bars these days pad their menus with all kinds of far-fetched ingredients, some of which barely make it into the final drink, as a way of inflating their cachet to the clueless hipster masses. Pouring Ribbons is the kind of place that knows a perfectly executed ice cube will do more to ensure the deliciousness of your drink than the other place's bone marrow bitters or flambéed absinthe wash.Not that PB shies from the experimental and showy. I've had the most interesting drinks I will ever taste here - lots of riffs on clarified milk punches, many-different-pepper infused agave-based liquors, and some incredible, almost 'narrative' experiences with drinks (see their two most recent menus, inspired, respectively, by the sundry flavors of route 66 and the silk road).As a nice bonus, all the servers (or almost all of them) rotate as bar tenders, so everyone is extremely knowledgable, while also being modest enough to happily field any kind of question.",,,
153,Todd B.,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",733,694,6,5.0,2/7/2013,"I'm from Nashville, and Patterson House there is perhaps the best bar in the country, and particularly for mixology. That's not just my opinion -- it's the opinion of several friends from LA and NY that visit too. I was very excited to see that the guys who opened Patterson House have now opened Pouring Ribbons on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. I finally made it down there tonight, and I was excited to see the bar thriving and doing so well here.The room is quite large, but it is warm, friendly and classy. The menu is more extensive than Patterson House with about 20 specialty cocktails, another 20 or so classics, and a fairly long wine and bourbons list. There are also some food bites, but nothing that seemed too appetizing to me. The menu could use something more fried or crunchy -- after all, it is a bar -- but I do confess to being a southerner.I love that the menu ranks the drinks on a scale from refreshing to spiritous (strong and stiff), to comforting and adventuresome. I of course chose the spiritous and adventuresome.I had a spicy cocktail made from chili-infused tequila, coffee, and bitters that was small but so packed with spicy / sweet deliciousness that it took me an hour to drink it. I followed up with a whiskey on the rocks that the server recommended. It was so smooth and perfect that it didn't need a mixer at all. The servers and bartenders were incredibly nice - mostly male rejects from Mumford and Sons -- and very knowledgable about the menu, as I've come to expect from this group.Troy was my server, and he did an incredible job of being attentive, patient, and helpful.This is now one of my ""go to"" places in NY. If only they were in Hell's Kitchen. If you haven't experienced this place or Patterson, you gotta go.",1,,

We waited outside for 45 mins before they let us in, and once we got in it was basically empty! And the whole time we waited, only a couple people had left. That seemed like they were just trying too hard to make it seem so exclusive and hard to get in. Also, the ambiance was weird. maybe because it was so empty and I had such high expectations? It was oddly bright.I don't remember what cocktail I had, but it was very good. But I've had just as good if not much better at the numerous amazing cocktail bars right around there with no false wait. I'll give this place another try someday because I can't understand how it has such great reviews. Maybe it was just an off day?",,,

I came on a Thursday night with my bf, we almost missed the entrance to this place because the bar's facade is literally a door with a bouncer, as the bar is actually located on the second floor. This bar has a seasonal menu and being a fan of summer drinks this place definitely has the right selection going on. I really liked the Wet Hot American Summer drink, which is very popular. It is a green tea infused drink with rum and tropical fruits, so yum! I definitely hope they keep some of their summer drinks around as fall and winter approach. Also, there is a drink map on the menu that categorizes drinks by how ""comforting, refreshing, adventurous, and spirituous"" they taste.

It was tasty, but a li'l light for me, but a nice start. then I requested their Old Fashioned (one of my goto drinks nowadays.) the waitress asked if I wanted the menu version or something more authentic. as I leaned toward the more authentic she suggested a few versions so I told her to go with what she thought would be best. I mean, when you're not necessarily a cocktail connoisseur but you lurves liquor, how can you go wrong? and go wrong she did not. the old fashioned was excellent. then upon friends' suggestions I tried the sazerac. never had one of these before and it was verrry nice. I also tasted the Pistols in the Morning (how gangster is that title, amirite?) and that was excellent as well. if I wasn't driving I would have ordered one for myself.I also loved that our waitress kept the water glasses filled all night.

I was a bit overwhelmed when i first started looking at the menu because all the choices. The thing that made everything easier was the layout of the menu. They organize it by two scales, one refreshing vs spirited and the other comforting vs adventurous. I decided to go on a whim to go with a more adventurous and more refreshing drink. I can't for the life of me remember the name of my drink but i attached a picture of my tiki drink from the gods! It was so different and refreshing. The presentation alone was enough to get someone excited to drink this. If this drink is a reflection of their other choices i would be extremely impressed.

163,Steve S.,"New York, NY",32,125,523,4.0,6/15/2014,"Yes, they pour glorious ribbons of booze. The place is discretely located next to a shady liquor store with a yellow awning. Then again aren't all the good cocktail places hidden in such a manner? I noticed the door guy wearing a secret service ear piece and it was used to efficiently communicate with the staff upstairs to make sure seating was available for all the members of our group.It should be mentioned the service at this place is great. Upon arriving upstairs, we were seated and bottles of water and glasses were placed on our table along with cocktail menus. The bottles of water were continuously refilled throughout the course of the night and our server was quick to answer questions about ingredients. She also dropped by enough times where it never felt we had to wait for her to arrive. As for the drinks, I say just use the matrix they provide on the first page of the menu. Don't even look at the ingredients in the drink, just choose based on this. The categories are refreshing vs spirituous and comforting vs adventurous. I like this new take on choosing a drink depending on your mood. Cozy, night by a fire place or rafting down a river filled with piranhas, it's up to you.I first went with the Jungle Bird (I think #25) in the refreshing and adventurous group. I enjoyed it and you have to appreciate that they use actual snow cone like crushed ice and not just regular ice cubes. I then moved to the boozy Brooklyn cocktail. You may want to order the Yellow King (good use of spice) or the Dark & Stormy for a hot summer night. Lastly the Pistolas at Dawn is another good drink to try but it was oddly sweeter than expected. They were able to accommodate our group of 8 but I saw several couples there as well. Pouring Ribbons is definitely a chill spot to enjoy a nice cocktail.",1,1,2

The greeter lead my friend and me to a table, poured us water, and gave us the menu. I was really happy about getting water. Was thirsty from walking all the way to Ave B. Anyway, the waitress was very helpful. I told her that I liked vodka, and she recommended her favorite vodka-based drinks. I ended up getting the Montgomery Burns, which is made of vodka, lemon, plum brandy, St. Germain, Don's Mix and Cinnamon Bitters. I normally don't like cinnamon in drinks, but it was very subtle. It also cost $14. Needless to say, I only got one drink. It was worth the splurge though.

168,N P.,"New York, NY",105,44,43,4.0,1/21/2014,"""First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you."" - F. Scott FitzgeraldPouring Ribbons (PR) is worth a long story. The bar earned a worldwide reputation of excellence in cocktail crafting very quickly. This avant-garde gem has brought some of my best drinking experiences in the City. My first visit roots back to their opening month when it used to be a hidden door without any sign but the bouncer. An adventure starts at the door. Henry is a clever gentleman who will make your wait worth it. Among his most interesting chronicles, were these two ladies looking for vodka shots. Henry, with high courtesy and chivalry, kindly explained what a cocktail consisted in. On a more timely note: about 20 min on Friday night at 10:30 pm (party of four) was the longest I waited for. Paradoxically, complexity and audacity are mixed in a very simple and unpretentious setting. The style combines 1920s design with minamalism, making it less kitschy than other ""prohibithentic"" speakeasies. Art deco bulbs softly lights conversations in this tinged red, library-wooden and stonewall atmosphere. In the back, the half-oval window widens the space, thus making your experience more relaxing.PR has a unique approach to mixology, which is truly risk-embracing and detail-oriented. You know the drill: navigating along the Refreshing/Spirituous/Comforting/Adventurous axis. House cocktails, please (I have tried some classics, including a Manhattan and wasn't astonished). Come here often and dare a new one each time - you won't have a choice anyway since the house menu is seasonal (or bi-annual). Those of you expecting a familiar flavor, be ready to be surprised. Here, a spirit is just a single ingredient among others and only the result matters. Bourbon will not taste like dry oak. You will feel a unique and strong flavor instead. Rake & Consort, for example, mixed Bourbon, Scotch, orange cordial and bitters in the same beverage. Their take on the Old Fashioned? Sounds like it but does not taste so. The result is smokey, subtle, boozy and bitter - closer to Campari - drink with a strong after taste. Bartenders have a wide range of spirits and inspirations. I once had a cocktail made of Lambrusco red sparkling wine and a brown liquor (I pray for its return on the menu). Or I recall that time where the Eye to Eye (Bourbon, strawberry, falernum and bitters) surprisingly felt like an intense rush of ginger balanced with the bitterness of the amber liquor. Likewise, In Spades was an interesting floral take (Gentiane) on Whiskey. And Chartreuse lovers: you have reached heaven here. Final tab for two drinks: about $40. Very good price-to-quality ratio. In a nutshell: they know how to put on a smokescreen.So much that... PR is not even perfect. Service is very friendly, approachable and loyal (same faces since 2012). However, waiting time can be quite long when served at the table as I have often waited 15-20 min for my drink. More, although certain that people come to appreciate excellent drinks, the bar would gain by feeling more sociable sometimes. Regardless if you come for a party or for a tryst, your senses will be thankful.At times when you are striding around Alphabet City, Pouring Ribbons is an institution where you must pay a visit.",4,1,3

My mood was sinking fast, but this place wasn't far, so we braved the cold again to check it out. When we got upstairs, I was struck by how teal the walls are. They really are a fantastic color. Almost all of the tables were full, but the bar was still not overly crowded and was a comfortable place to be. We were seated along a wall in some high-top booth seating that was even a little high for me (I'm 5'10"" and all leg), but I love finding seats like that! I did feel badly for my shorter companions, but they managed to get seated eventually.The best part of the bar was the drinks. The second best part was choosing what to order, because their menu is absolutely brilliant. It features a graph showing all of their cocktails, scaled along spectrums of refreshing-spirituous and comforting-adventurous. Smart idea! This gave me a much better idea of what to expect in a drink, and allowed me to choose a drink based on my mood. Between that and the server's suggestions, I ended up with a fantastic couple of cocktails and really enjoyed sampling my friends' choices as well. Did I mention that some of the drinks were garnished with orange peel moustaches? It was a super hilarious touch. It turns out my friend recommended this place because he had met a guy at another bar we visited earlier that evening and this guy suggested that he might be going here later. Misguided attempts at romance aside, I'm really glad my friend guided us here. I dig this spot and look forward to going back.

I've made so many great memories here - definitely an awesome place to have engaging conversation and good times.Service is top notch friendly and the doormen/bouncers are just so sincere - I have a special place in my heart for Henry (but it seems that he hasn't been there recently).",1,,
182,Richard L.,"New York, NY",18,169,0,5.0,3/7/2014,"On an empty, cold street, this place appears! I'm not a big cocktail person but the Action Bronson I had was exquisite. That's right, I used that word. The bartenders are great to talk to. I've never had chartreuse, and wow, that was some seriously amazing stuff. I had the yellow and the green. The flavor is extremely potent, like drinking concentrated extract of a garden. Unlike a lot of bars in NYC it has breathing room, you can come here on a date, there are nice small circular tables for two, and larger tables for a group. Try the chartreuse!",1,,
183,Elizabeth B.,"Washington, DC",157,279,4,4.0,3/9/2014,"Pouring Ribbons was a big treat.Delicious cocktail menu. I got the MEASURE OF A MAN and the KASHMIR SWEATER; both were voted best drinks of the night by our table of six. I thought the DARK AND STORMY was particularly wonderful--very strong ginger profile--but watch out for some of the ""fruttier"" cocktails. The darker small-batch stuff seemed much better.Atmosphere was a bonus. This place is crowd controlled, so you're not going to need to yell over music or fight anyone for a seat. Pouring Ribbons is a great place to start your evening in comfort with some good conversation.I'll be back! Def a gem!",1,,
184,Karina F.,"Manhattan, NY",292,164,98,4.0,9/22/2014,I met someone in HK who referred me to this place and I look forward to becoming a regular.Cocktails are $14 apiece.Really like their menu and I tend to gravitate towards the spirituous/adventurous drinks - Trouble in Paradise!Menu at the place is even longer than the one online.Place is not so busy at 6-7:30pm on weeknights so it's nice to catch up with someone but is certainly more happening in the evenings (much harder to get in Fri/Sat late nights).Walk up the stairs and it's a pretty open space so you don't feel cramped like many other speakeasies in East Village/LES.,,,
185,Mischa P.,"Arlington, TX",0,46,19,5.0,12/6/2015,Great bar service. Speakeasy style and not much atmosphere but they care about making good drinks! Neat menu.,,,
186,Joe G.,"CANAL STREET, NY",58,138,16,5.0,2/17/2014,"For a cocktail bar this may be as good as it gets. Couple great things about this place. First and foremost, the drinks are SUPERB. I ordered the Border Patrol it had Mezcal, lime, pineapple and a spicy mixture. It was yellow at the bottom and red on top. Looked pretty cool, tasted even better. My gf ordered the Duck & Cover with vodka, brandy, cider, maple and ginger (yes I'm on their website looking these ingredients up). She loved it! I thought it would be to sweet, not at all. They were $14 each but both came in a long glass that made it almost double the normal cocktail size.  I loved the actual space. It was on the second floor of a random building overlooking Ave B and 14th street. Really great spacee upstairs and the tables are all spread throughout - so you're not on top of other people. She mentioned the atmosphere could have been better and I agree. Could definitely use minor renovations, but I'd take comfort over being cramped in a swankier bar. Last, we went this past Valentine's day. We stopped in before dinner (waiting to be called for our dinner reservation) and stopped in after. On both occasions we didn't have to wait to be brought upstairs. The bouncer at the door even remembered us and jokingly welcomed us back. Staff was super friendly and accommodating.  Definitely will come again and again.",1,,
187,Christopher M.,"Chicago, IL",32,386,0,5.0,10/31/2014,"NYC has a growing cocktail scene and Pouring Ribbons is ahead of the pack.  Beautiful space with great waitresses and an adventurous, yet complete, cocktail list.  The drinks were fantastic.  It's away from Midtown, but if you're visiting like we do it's well worth the journey.302/365",,,
188,Karry L.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,475,273,5.0,8/29/2015,"It reminds me of Happy Ending's sign, it's located on the 2nd floor of yellow sign at alphabet city, once you're up, you enter this spacious cocktail oasis, bar is all the way on the right and most seatings are to the left side of the bar, so bartender can concentrate on making their drinks, jk! Cocktails menu are extensive, came w variety of spirit, drinks separated by shaved or shaken, and each drink is specified/measured from its refreshing to spirituous and from comforting to adventurous. I love my riches to rags and one of the tequila drinks, the drinks were made to perfection! we also ordered something off the menu and it was just as good! this is the kind of bar I wanna be at each and every time! service was very friendly and unpretentious, tables are spread out so there's plently of privacy if you get intimate w your date! there's also lounge seatings by the window, just go, I guarateed you'll have a happy ending w cocktails!",,,
189,Emily C.,"Chicago, IL",51,398,28,5.0,5/16/2013,"Love this cocktail bar!  We were greeted by a super friendly bouncer (though we did think we were in the wrong place - it's above a Subway) - he's quite chatty so make sure you are prepared.  I thought he was trying to distract us from coming in, but he was just being friendly.  We then went upstairs and entered into the bar.  Very cool vibe - and more space than I was expecting. Comforting to adventurous. Refreshing to spirituous (tastes like booze) - that's how they rate their drinks.  Every one I had was spot on and matched the description perfectly.  It was really nice to be able to use those scales to order other drinks too.  And I loved the menu holders!  It's the little things...  Good service too!130/365",6,,2
190,H P.,"New York, NY",6,12,15,4.0,1/15/2015,"Great speakeasy! I love this place. Will be returning. Great service! Great drinks! Great for groups or less. Went on a late Sunday night, and it was a mixed crowd.",,,
191,Mishkin L.,"New York, NY",0,285,52,5.0,5/2/2013,"After breaking up with Raines Law Room, I decided to endeavor upon Pouring Ribbons which has been on my list of things to try for a while.  The experience was so  lovely - I can't wait to go back.  The drinks were impeccable, the service was attentive and the room! There is so much space, it feels so amazing not to be on top of a total stranger for once in New York City, I love that it is not in a basement and has a huge window. I just loved being there - it was a Room of One's Own, a place to enjoy a drink and let the worries fall away.  I started with Death and Taxes, the name seemed relevant enough, and it tasted like a Lion's Tale and was simply superb, then I had the Walking Home with it's subtle, perfectly balanced absinth.  Afterwards, we explored Chartreuse, which is an owner's passion; it was a decadent flight of yellow and green, of herbs and decades.  Never had anything quite like that. Atop of all this, the bartenders make cocktail garnish into an art form. A welcome surprise, not that those drinks needed any more reasons to be adored :).",4,2,4
192,ash w.,"Portland, OR",173,18,0,5.0,6/1/2013,"Love this place.  I'm not sure there's much I can say that others haven't already said about it.It's an experience from the moment you're greeted by the chatty bouncer at the door who radios up to a hostess who greets you at the top of the stairs, to the very knowledgable bartending staff, to the wonderfully laid out menu to the actual beverages themselves.Everything is done with much thought and care.  You don't feel like you're at another one of the many speak easy mixology bars in this city, this place really stands out as a unique experience.Way to go Pouring Ribbons, you've really outdone yourself!",3,,1
193,Liz B.,"Manhattan, NY",335,220,909,4.0,7/16/2014,"Drink #1 - bartender's choice. I thought it was ok but wasn't a fan of some of the bartender's mixer choices - sometimes it pays to be VERY specific of what you do/don't like. Wasn't feeling too adventurous that night.My next cocktail was straight off the menu, a classic Champagne cocktail. Delicious and refreshing!Overall, I thought that Pouring Ribbons was a beautiful space and was quiet enough to have conversations with your friends or date. I will keep this in mind to visit in the future!",,,
194,Steven C.,"New York, NY",29,199,79,5.0,1/16/2014,"OMFG this is my new favorite cocktail place! As a budget conscious New Yorker.. I think this will be where I go on those special occasions. Yet even at $14 a drink.. I did love everything about my experience here.I loved the wood paneling interior, high ceilings.. very large.. entire 2nd floor of a brownstone. It has a single huge rounded half dome window that looks out onto Ave B. Our waitress was very attentive and sociable. It's kinda like if The Spare Room @ The Roosevelt Hotel in LA (my fav spot there) came to NYC?Ordered: #6 FEVER DREAM.  omgggg I love savory drinks and this was basically a potent alcoholic hot chocolate!Our party ordered: Kashmir Sweater and 5 other drinks I don't remember the name of.. sorry they were potent :)Music was quite nice, and they finished the night with Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody with a matching lights show!Definitely a place to bring special guests / friends / clients to!",1,,
195,Megan L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,79,0,2.0,8/7/2013,"Eh.  I came here right when they opened, as I live a mere avenue away and live for speakeasy-style cocktail bars.  Four of us showed up on a Saturday evening, right after they opened.  Upon approaching the intimidating bouncer (really, guys, this is Avenue B, come on), we were told he had to go upstairs and check if he could squeeze us in.  At 6pm.  After we told them we were looking for pre-dinner drinks (translation: not hanging around until midnight).  Lucky us, they could.  So, up we went where we encountered...emptiness.  One other table was taken up, and this was a big bar.  Clearly, they could not only squeeze us in, but give a whole corner booth!  The cocktail menu was exceptionally extensive and impressive, and whatever I had, which has escaped me, was good.  However, the fact that this place is trying super-cool and super-trendy and super-hip in a neighborhood that prides itself on being laid back has turned me off.  Maybe I'll come back one day, but for now, I'll stick to the Wayland and Summit Bar for cocktails.",2,,
196,Ian C.,"Alameda, CA",304,384,397,3.0,12/7/2013,"This is a good mixology bar, not too busy when I got there early for happy hour on a friday and the space isnt amazing but the drinks were solid. I wouldnt come here if youre hungry though, I thought there would be food in an establishment like this but there wasn't anything of real substance. If you want a good well made cocktail in a no frills setting this is it.",1,,
197,Morgan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,113,0,5.0,9/20/2015,"This is the best cocktail bar I've been to anywhere. Between the four of us we tried siz different cocktails, and all were delightful. I started with the Murder Country and finished with the 19th Hole. If you like gin and freshness, you'll love the latter--I'd go so far as to say it's the best cocktail I've had in my life. Yeah, it's pricey, but it's great. Highly recommended.",,,
198,Madhuri I.,"New York, NY",290,272,0,3.0,2/26/2013,"3.5 starsOkay, so we have yet another one of the cocktails bars on the scene. Of course Madhuri's gonna have to go check it out. You know, for the purposes of research.We walk over to 225 Avenue B, and there's this guy in a jacket standing there. Me: Is this pouring ribbons?Him: Yes.(Awkward silence, followed by teeth chattering in the cold)Me: We'd like to go in. Would you like to see our IDs?Him: How many are you?Me: Two.Him: You sure?Me & Husband: Yes, yes.Him: No one else joining you?Me (confused) : Umm.. should someone be?Him: Just checking.He then paged the guy upstairs and we are finally let into the warmth of indoors. Carpeted staircase, turqoise walls and door. We walk into the space and are immediately shown to our seats. So far, so good.The music is loud and the table next to us is trying to talk over the music. Shortly after, 3 more people join in and sit next to them, all loud and smushed into a table for 2. Now I know why the bouncer was acting so anxious.Our waiter comes in and hands us our menu. A map of all the drinks on a two scale axis (Comforting/Adventurous) vs (Refreshing/Spirituous). Quite an interesting way to help people pick their drink. I think someone questioned why a Sazerac is adventurous, but I think these people mean adventurous on the tastebuds, as opposed to indicating it is a popular or a classic drink.My husband got a couple of stirred drinks and I tried a couple of shaken (refreshing) ones. We both got lucky in the first round - the Prabu punch is delightfully complex without trying too hard. The pumpkin, garam masala and curry leaf are all subtle and let the bourbon shine. The Hagar and Helga is a strong aquavit based drink with cumin and cinnamon notes, an excellent combination and it comes with a drunk cherry which is equally delicious. I think, wow, these guys know how to make a drink.We also tried the Tropic of Cancer (tequila/cofee/chili) which is extremely spicy and the Corn & Oil (rum/falernum/lime) which is extremely sweet. I had half a mind to mix the two together in the hope of making an acceptable drink, but I didn't want to offend anyone behind the bar.We got a couple of the cheeses to share and the hummus. The cheese was served with some crackers (I wish they had some fruit to go with it, that would have been thoughtful), the hummus was absolutely dry and flavourless. And it was served with the same dry crackers. Ugh.I think I would surely go again to try some of the other drinks and to sample the chartreuse collection.. but it hasn't made it into my list of favourite bars, just yet.",9,8,7
199,Dawn O.,"Middletown, NJ",0,77,7,5.0,11/8/2015,"Warren Red's design and the alchemy of fine details with comfortable yet refined ambience makes for the perfect cocktail bar. Our server was awesome and the cocktails each offer an exciting blend of tastes. The cylinder ice cubes were perfect for whiskey. Delicious drinks, sofas and intimate seating with cool music and fun staff make this spot worth visiting.",,,
