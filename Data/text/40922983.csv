They bake the bread and make your food right there in front of you and, when they are baking the bread, they put out free samples of it up at the counter that you can snack on while you wait. I got the tomato basil mozarella panini and my colleague got the bbq chicken pizza. They were both really good, came out quickly, and were very filling at a good price. I thought some of the people working there were loud, obnoxious and inattentive, but the food was right on and I have no real complaints. Would definitely grab a bite at this location again.",3

The place wasn't crowded at all and the line moved relatively quickly. In fact, I ordered my sandwich, sat down and ate and the whole process was only about 15 minutes. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was pretty good for a free sandwich. There's not much to complain about when something is free. Also gave money to the donation box on the way out. I like how complementary snacks are offered at the register so that's a plus. You have your choice of baby carrots or potato chips. I settled for the chips.

They open at 6 AM on weekdays but don't open until 8 AM on weekends.I came here either for breakfast (mostly got their muffins and scones) or a late dinner (TBM sandwiches).

The problem is the pace at which the sandwich maker is moving, at a snail's pace. Wow, I never seen someone move so slow to make a sandwich. Obviously they are in no hurry. If they moved this way at lunch, I can see a huge line here. I find Cosi a bit pricey for what you get. It's just a sandwich. We got two sandwiches for $17.83. That is nearly $9 for each sandwich which are not especially big. They are just the right size for one meal but we've been spoiled by Sal Kris & Charlie's Deli in Astoria where you pay $8.25 for a sandwich that is loaded with meat and fixin' and feeds two people easy. I don't know about Cosi sandwiches. I do not find they are worth the money they are charging. For $9 I expect more from a sandwich at Cosi.",3

It was nearing 2:30 and there was no line and plenty of open tables to choose from. Decided to stick with my usual order today: taste two with 1/2 a chicken tbm and tomato basil soup. My friend ordered the same meal minus the chicken.Sat down and started with the tomato soup. We love their recipe here, always consistent and always so yummy. Worked my way to my sandwich and I couldn't help but feel like I was biting into a ball of wasabi... THAT was unexpected. It was definitely the dressing- Soo strong and pungent! I was so confused since I order the same two things everytime I stop in and never once had the flavor hit me this hard!My friend put her taste buds to the test as she bit into her tbm... Yup! Not just me. We took our meals back to the ladies working at the salad counter to address the offness. They tried the dressing for themselves and confirmed there was too much dijon mustard poured into the bottle. They apologized and were shocked that no one else complained as it was already the middle of the day. Right away they offered to fix the mixture and make us new sandwiches. Muuuuch better, and we were really pleased with the way they handled the situation. Thanks ladies! We'll be back for our tbm/tbs fix soon.",

She was the black lady who always had a miserable expression on her face. Every morning I had the urge to ask for the manager because it was seriously taking 10-15 minutes for her to scoop up the oatmeal into the container. So THANK YOU.Their oatmeal tastes great. The best in a 5 block radius. I've been to Pret, Guy & Gallard, Europa Cafe, Lenny's, etc... They are all either watered down or tastes horrible.

This is one of a few coffee and quick food franchises in the area. Located in Midtown East a few blocks from the subway. The prices for coffee and general bites are standard to other Cosi locations but did seem a bit much for the quality. The staff are attentive but can be a bit loud when talking to one another.

It's a little expensive for lunch but if you get a sandwich and a salad, you'll be full all day. It'll just set you back about $14.I tried the Chicken pesto sandwich and the Cosi signature salad. The pesto sandwich was flavorful and the Cosi bread wonderfully soft and fresh. I think you should definitely try the Cosi signature salad. The toppings tends to fall to the bottom of the bowl so but sure to mix it up well. The combination is sweet and salty is just great. I love that they have dried cranberries in it.

There are some very terrific salad options, including the ability to choose a healthier dressing option and the ability to add ingredients as desired. I like the table service that is often (but not always - hours I guess) offered when you dine in. The staff will bring you your meal to your table and it's served on china with real utensils. They'll also clear your table when you're done.Room for improvement is to be found in the temperature settings of the dining area. Even though it is located far from the door, it tends to be very cool in the winter and over-airconditioned in the summer.Lastly, I'm not going to dock this location on this, but the chain in general needs to deemphasize its bread a little bit in this low-carb world and also digitalize its rewards program (they are still using a magnetic-striped card which makes your wallet fatter).",

In the last two weeks I've had:- a 20 minute wait for a salad (before the lunchtime rush - there was no one in line or waiting when I ordered)- old hard bread with salad - not possible to open the bread- missed ingredients (left out chicken one day, left out bacon another)The old system they had where you just got in line, ordered your salad, got it, and paid, just worked a whole lot better than what's there now.

As it was after the normal lunch hour it was pretty empty.Sandwiches here are ok, but nothing to write home about. It's a chain and they are all around the city. Had the Tandoori Chicken sandwich on whole grain bread. The chicken always is pretty tasty here but the bread was kind of hard to chew. Almost like cardboard. At least you have the option of a small bag of potato chips or carrot sticks as a side. Also, it can get kind of pricey here for lunch when you add on a drink, and I don't feel the quality is deserving of that. There are better options in the area for lunch at a similar price.

Their trashbins are overflowing daily with plastics, styrofoams, metallics, and exorbitant amounts of unused napkins A guy tried to foist an extra plastic plate and bowl on me, and when I insisted I didn't need them, he shrugged and casually tossed them in the trash. Seriously-- if we go on like this, the human race will eradicate or at least seriously debilitate itself. The ingredients they use are of mediocre quality, not particularly fresh, and all industrial, no organic anything. The food is mediocre.

Sandwich was served on the cold very dry bread. Never again! At least not at this location.",

60,,8/7/2014,122,,"New York, NY",Reshma B.,6,2.0,311,"This is the closest Cosi to my apt but unfortunately not a great one.  Since I started a new job, I no longer can go to the 498 7th Ave location, so I stop by this one after work.  There are usually only a handful of people there during this time, yet I still have had issues with my service. My first problem is with the layout - I don't like that you pay first and pick up afterwards. I prefer to have one scoop of dressing on my salad (otherwise, the salad is soaked) yet somehow from the cash register to the assembly area, the message gets lost.  Now I always have to stand back and monitor when they start making my salad so I can tell them in person.  Second, the assembly takes FOREVER, even though most times there was no one ahead of me.  I guess this is the time period they do clean-up, but it irritates me to watch the single server bake bread, put away the bins, make other (take-out?) orders, etc. while I'm waiting there for my one salad.  Can't that wait till after you serve your customers, who are not that many to begin with?  Finally, I have left many a time without utensils or napkins including last night. The server gave me an attitude, presumably cause I asked for one scoop of dressing, so I guess I asked for it? Finally, only after I paid, did I check my receipt and see I had a free entree on my card.  Would have been nice to be alerted this before I shelled out the cash, eh?In any case, going to this Cosi has made me miss my old Cosi at 498 7th dearly.  The service there had it's own issues, but I don't blame them during the lunch rush.  I was always told when I had a free entree on my card before paying, you tell your server directly how you want your salad (and watch him/her make it) and they always give utensils and napkins in the bag.  The 461 Park Ave S Cosi has a lot to learn!",
61,,7/6/2010,109,,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Shea D.,88,4.0,547,"For a chain, this place is quite good. In fact, it's one of the best tasting chains for sandwiches that I can think of. Subway, Quiznos, et al., have NOTHING on this place.Last week I was really jonesing for a sandwich, and having only found a Subway within a 5 block radius of my office, I turned to Yelp for some much-needed assistance. Success! Found a place called Cosi, which while not terribly highly rated, also didn't look too bad. When the competition is Subway, it's not hard to find a place that can overcome it. I walked the several blocks over to Cosi, walked in, and stood in line. I was waiting in line for all of 30 seconds when a staff member came up to me and asked me for my order. I decided to be adventurous and ordered the Tuscan Pesto Chicken sandwich on wheat Cosi bread. I'd never had Cosi bread, and did not know why Cosi bread was so special, but nevertheless, I knew I must have it. I only ordered the sandwich since I tend to drink water for the most part and had a bottle back at the office, but my meal still ran $7-8. Coming from the land (or Manhattan neighborhood) of $3.50 fresh deli sandwiches, I cried a bit and sheepishly handed over my debit card. There was a LONG line, but I think I only stood in line for a grand total of 5 minutes from start to finish. I spent more time walking there and back than I did inside the place.I took my hard earned sandwich back to the office and was surprised with a staff meeting, so I carted my sandwich a little further into the back of the office. I finally got to sit down and enjoyed my first bite, and...wow! This is really good! I took another bite in disbelief and yep, still good! I was the envy of my coworkers with their Tupperware and TV dinner lunches throughout the staff meeting, and finished every last bite. While I certainly won't spend $7-8 every day on a sandwich, when I'm in the mood for a delicious chicken pesto sandwich, I'll definitely swing by.",

All we want is to pay and leave, but he's off somewhere steaming milk for half a dozen lattes. A solid 5-6 minutes later, he gets to us. We don't get a greeting or any kind of 'thank you' or 'sorry for the wait' - he just lethargically presses a few buttons, hands me the change and walks off. I don't expect five-star service at a fast food place, but I do expect some common courtesy with my nine-dollar sandwich..It's not the first time.

The room in the back looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a few days. There's trash left on the tables, and it looks very unkempt. It's also freezing in here. When it's November and people are wearing scarfs and coats, you don't need the AC to be full blast. Speaking of full blast, the music is way too loud for this kind of place. This isn't a bar, and I'd like to be able to talk to someone or think without having to shout. Also, Christmas music is so freakin' annoying, especially when it's blaring through the restaurant. As for the food. I paid $8 for a sandwich that was just so-so. I had the Chicken TBM (a Cosi ""favorite""). The guy who made my sandwich barely put any tomato and basil on there, and I figured it would  be toasted. Instead, it was cold. Both of the people who helped me (sandwich-making guy and check-out girl) were not nice or helpful. I stood there for a minute thinking I had to sign my receipt, since the girl didn't say thank you when she handed it to me. She just turned away.
