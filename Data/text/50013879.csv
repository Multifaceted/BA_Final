0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,33,2,4.0,11/12/2018,"So this place and I have a very interesting relationship. I first went to this place on a first date about 4 years ago. This guy I met at a bar asked me to meet him here on our ""first date."" I remember it being really crowded and we were sitting against a wall. We literally were staring at the wall while we were drinking Mai Thais. Then, I got really drunk and we went somewhere else. Then, another guy asked me out and took me here about a year or so later. I drank more Mai Thais with this guy and then we went somewhere else.Fast forward to about a year ago, a friend of mine wanted to go here. I got there earlier and they sat me by the fish tank in the back. The waitress walked away before you finished placing your order and she didn't blink. I was a bit confused. However, being an alcoholic (almost), I adored this place because the drinks were strong AF. Bad service, but strong drinks? I'll take it. I didn't need the waitress to like me. Just more Tito's! Recently, I went here with some ladies from boxing. We were rejected from a NYFW after party because we were not in fashion/entertainment (oh well). We went here on a Saturday and we got LIT! The drinks stayed strong and the service got better. The funny thing is they don't have a single nacho chip on the menu. However, their Tator tots with the nacho fixings...you can just slap your diet away in the most wonderful manner. Now, I am sort of a regular. I go here with friends all the time. It is to the point they started recognizing me. VIP much? (kidding) Pst! On Saturdays, happy hour is till 10 pm.",1,2,1
1,Sara P.,"Manhattan, NY",426,79,233,4.0,11/4/2018,"Super fun tiki bar themed bar. Great atmosphere, great drinks, fun crowd and great prices. They have an assortment of food and drinks; the tatchos were great to munch on!Highly recommend the palomas, but stay away from the acid drop if you value your life!",,,
2,Trisha L.,"Louisville, KY",82,153,176,3.0,10/20/2018,"Well there are 2 flights of stairs and no elevator. When you have a broken foot it makes for a hard time getting in and out. I get that most bars are dark and loud, but I could barely talk to the people I was with because of the loudness and then there was also the complete lack of lighting in the section to the right of the bar. I dunno. Maybe I will come back. Nothing made an impression that made me want to return for any reunion.",,,
3,Angel L.,"Linden, NJ",118,49,132,3.0,9/28/2018,"So I'm giving this establishment the rating I'm giving them because I didn't really know what the hype was. The bartender seemed annoyed when he had to attend us; on a Saturday at 5:30 pm and my party of three's first stop. Here's the reasoning behind my rating:-Food was mediocre-Service was ""meh"" to say the least he just seemed bothered working at a Mexican Bar -The drinks were okay-You had to walk downstairs - Smokers beware you will have to walk upstairs for your fix :')  (smoking is bad for you also)Glow:-The decor - although it looked fun it was pretty boring at 8 when I left-Coolest thing the Lifeguard chair outside lol (see pics)After everything, I would never revisit.",,,
4,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,2.0,8/15/2018,"I really wanted to like this place. On Tuesday 7pm this place was jam packed and poorly understaffed. Seats are first come first serve but you order with a waitress. We were able to grab 2 seats by the wall which were so uncomfortable. Come here early. It took 30 minutes for the waitress to realize we exist. After ordering, it took another 20 minutes for everything to arrive. By then we couldn't do a second round cause it was 8pm.1 star for the ambiance. It was actually cool. 2nd star for the food. I enjoyed the dodo hotdog and fish taco. The acid drop cocktail tasted like 100% grapefruit juice with no vodka. It should not be $6. We never got water, napkins or the full menu after asking over and over again. I couldn't wait to close the tab and leave. We even had to wait by the register to get our check. The service was so bad I can't see myself going back.",3,1,2
5,Jessie B.,"Queens, NY",213,213,146,5.0,10/17/2018,"Very nice spot for happy hour which runs weekdays from 5:00-8:00PM, Saturday 5:00-10:00 and all day Sunday. The interior looks like a Hollister store threw up all over it but in the best way. I had the Surfer Girl which was decently tasty as well as buffalo chicken tacos and fries. The service is good and the food is tasty. Definitely a different vibe from your typical happy hour spot.",1,1,1
6,Amita B.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,3,0,2.0,11/11/2018,A 21 year olds basement-paradise - if you like that sort of thing then maybe you'll like this bar.The mixed drinks (the two we tried at least) were so sugary:( so that killed it.  Seemed like a great hangout spot for people in their early 20's.,,,
7,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",947,751,3018,4.0,6/16/2018,"As corny as tiki bars are, I love them. Reunion is so cute and so fun!The drinks are big and strong, be careful! Also, it's tucked away underground so it's a tourist-free zone. If you're looking for a quick transport to vacation in the middle of Times Square, this would be a good fix. For a Friday night it wasn't too crowded which was nice to not feel like a sardine. Fun place, chill vibe, good drinks, and a lot of happy hour specials.",4,2,3
8,Alexa A.,"New York, NY",1,5,1,3.0,11/3/2018,"I love Reunion for their food, mostly their fish tacos. But I visited recently and they either changed their chef or changed their style of cooking. My friends and I ordered the esquites and they were horrible. The corn was over cooked and the dish overall was so bland, which is unusual from the esquites I've been ordering from here. The fillet in the fish tacos is now half the size of what they were before. There's more tortilla than fish. I finished the tacos in two bites.",,,
9,Reese S.,"Brooklyn, NY",251,60,71,5.0,6/4/2018,"This spot is awesome when you order the right things (aka the pancakes). I've also tried the falafel salad, which was really good, and the shakshukah (less good, but still good). Bottom line: if you don't get the pancakes, you'll be sad.Can be a long wait on the weekends, but the staff is really nice. Especially the v nice hostess, Ellen.",,,3
10,Edgar A.,"ASTORIA, NY",46,137,653,4.0,5/18/2018,"Had a need to kill some time before checking out the The Band's Visit at the Ethel Barrymore theater. Yelping led me to this place. I'd been there before years ago only for drinks, so I was excited to see what their food menu had to offer.My gf and I met up outside the place at 5:30 pm (when their happy hour begins). We stood on a line to get in, which moved quickly around 5:35 pm. Downstairs, we were able to grab a nice little table right by the bathroom. Speaking of, I can't believe the place only has one bathroom that can be used by only one person at a time.After being seated we were quickly given both the food menu and the happy hour menu. The happy hour menu pretty much only has drinks. The food menu is really interesting, especially because they offer a good number of plates with vegetarian options.The waitress first took our drinks and then no so long after took our food orders. My Corona slushy was very good, and the food was really yummy. The tator tots had the perfect crunch, and the guacamole and beans gave it great flavor. The fish taco also had a great crunch to it along with a subtle tastiness. As we were enjoying our meal and drinks a lot more people showed up. Our waitress was all over the place, and we had to work hard to flag her down for the check.I would definitely return, but most likely in the same time slot as before so we don't have to wait too long for service when there are tons of people there.",1,,3
11,Sue S.,"Newark, NJ",976,251,361,4.0,10/4/2018,"So i came here spontaneously with my friends for dinner while we were walking the streets trying to find a place to eat. We stumbled upon this place and figured why not because we were so hungry. Anyways, they checked our ID at the door and we made our way downstairs where you can either sit near the bar or sit at a table where you get service. We were a group of four so we grabbed a table in the corner. It was pretty dark and cramped but not too horrible. What sucked was that we missed happy hour by literally 5 minutes LOL; but it was alright because I mainly came here for the food. The pricing is decent, a little on the heavy side, but it was okay for New York. I got a cali burger which was only $6, $9 with their fries (WHICH IS AMAZING by the way). The burger was a bit small but it was good! Definitely a hectic night for the place but we still got attention which was nice. Definitely a good place to stop by if you're hungry and for happy hour.",2,1,3
12,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",342,242,298,3.0,3/12/2018,"Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Happy hour - lasts until 8PM. Worth it items: $4 beers$6 frozen cocktails (margaritas, palomas, etc.) $4 dodo dogs (hot dog with a slice of pork belly). Cocktails were good, and strong. Favorite is the paloma which has grapefruit soda and is not too sweet. Totchos - or tater tot nachos are also a great get here. Come early if you want a seat. Got here at 530 (when happy hour starts) and got the last table in the joint. Even if you come by yourself and hold down the fort until your friends come, it would be a good move. Reason for the tree stars: SERVICE. Drinks took over 20 minutes to come, and we tried to order more drinks before the server left, but she dropped the drinks and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Additionally, often items would be missing from our orders. It was very very frustrating.",3,1,1
13,Recep P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,1,1,5.0,9/10/2018,This bar you should definitly visit. I had great time there and the staff is lovely! I'm looking forward for a revisit.So if you want a good rum and a cool ambience don't miss the entrance when passing by watch out for the surfboard,,,
14,Kyle S.,"Portland, ME",288,157,750,4.0,4/29/2018,"Naturally on the rainiest evening during our NYC trip, we found it appropriate to start our night out at the Surf Bar! Reunion is located in a basement type area, so there are no windows or anything on the inside.... being that it was down pouring outside, I wasn't entirely upset about this.The aesthetic here is super unique and different from most other places I have been in the city. They really adopted the surfer vibe and went with it! There was surf décor everywhere and a bunch of humorous signs along the walls. Reunion has a great happy hour which has an extensive list of cocktails for $5 or $6 bucks which was super reasonable. The drinks were also well made and a good size. I ordered the Paloma which was probably one my favorites that I have had anywhere!My only con to this place was that it felt understaffed. Based on what I was able to see, it looked like the only real staff member that was the bartender. There was no additional staff that was walking around to any of the tables to take orders or anything. And given the crowd of people, the bartender did not have any capacity to step away from the bar and take orders either. However, given that we were only here for drinks I did not mind walking up to the bar to order a drink. If you ever find yourself in the area and are looking for a unique place and a good happy hour, I highly encourage you to stop by Reunion.",,,
15,Sapna D.,"New York, NY",140,29,33,4.0,7/22/2018,"So happy I found Réunion, a gem for Midtown West. I've been scouring the area for a drinks destination and found it with this bar's daily $6 happy hour that goes all the way to 8 p.m. Réunion has a cool vibe, as an underground surf bar with dim lights, upbeat music, and tons of people who've been let in on the secret that this is the place to be. I reached around 6:30 on a Thursday and had a hard time finding a seat/place to eat, which is only a problem if you get actual food. We ordered fish tacos - they have my stamp of approval -  and had to get creative with how to juggle these with the drinks we ordered. Oh, and the drinks. So good. I've had my disappointments of watered-down drinks elsewhere so I was very impressed here. I tried the Acid Drop (grapefruit and rum) and the Paloma (tequila and lime), $6 apiece. I really enjoyed both but the Paloma was my favorite, and it was definitely the stronger drink as well. The drink menu here is awesome and there's plenty of other cool specials I'd love to try, although I have my eyes on the different flavored rums they serve here. I would've wanted to try out a rum flight... but forget about it during happy hour, as it seems hard to get a complicated order in based on how crowded it gets and how few bartenders there are. It's a small place, so prepare to wait it out to get your drinks/food ordered. I can confidently say I'll be back here in the near future - it's a solid choice for cheap drinks and great grub after wrok!",1,,
16,Travis G.,"Pennington, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,11/10/2018,"What a despicable establishment. The embarrassing part (of course) is the fact that this patron cannot post fondly about his experience. My dear friend-- a wonderful man-- was forced to leave this establishment (in a rush) because he was not welcome. Even more, his responsible girlfriend (who was a middleSchool teacher & treated like garbage) left sobbing because they scared her out of their establishment by making her feel like shit. Why is that okay?",,,
17,Joseph G.,"New York, NY",259,248,1269,3.0,5/26/2018,"Stopped in a couple years ago. Had a few, rolled out. Returned and it is the same. I enjoy consistency!! Service is decent, drinks are tasty. What more can you ask for? The prices are on par with the neighborhood. They should add one more frozen drink too the happy hour. Oh, this time, they were doing happy hour prices all day or something. They should also open at 4. The burger looks good, it's a little small for the price, but you're not here to eat. You're here to drink. It's a surfers paradise, way downstairs in Manhattan. Be ye not wasted before entering!! The steps are steep, hold on to the handrail. The tater tots are good. I also enjoyed the sauce that accompanied them.",4,3,1
18,Michael A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,35,12,3.0,10/11/2018,"This is a fun place to have a quick bite to eat like I did, or hang out and have some beer with friends.I enjoyed the music they played, it was mainly 80s and 90s rock.Although i was a bit confused as some of the tables say a waiter will be with you but I looked around and there were no waiters to be seen...I got the 3 for... fish, pork, and beef tacos and I'll say i enjoyed the beef and pork. The fish taco, which seems to be the craze, I really didnt care for nor was amazed about. I dont see the hype but I can say I had it and it didnt live up to the hype.overall a fun place, i could picture myself coming back to just hang out",,,
19,Sam L.,"Chicago, IL",116,95,185,5.0,5/19/2018,"To be honest, I thought this was just going to be a casual birthday dive bar spot. No frills, nothing.Then the owner or hostess introduced herself and asked where we were from and what occasion we were celebrating. I was an out of towner coming to visit my BFFs in NYC for my birthday. A few minutes later she brings out an ice cream cookie cake with a candle. :') I'm blown away by the hospitality and friendliness of this bar. What a great ending to what I thought would be just a casual night 5/5 yes.",4,,3
20,Reed G.,"Bronx, NY",176,4,0,3.0,8/31/2018,"This place is just okay. Got here around 5:35 with a couple of friends on a Tuesday and all of the good tables were already taken (This place opens on 5:30). We sat in the back of the restaurant in a very dark corner. There was absolutely no light besides a candle.  Our waitress greeted us immediately.Pros: Decent happy hour deals. Drinks range from $4-$7. Our waitress was attentive.Cons: Drinks were watered down, they had barely any alcohol in them.  Card minimum is $20..... Really wish I would have known this information beforehand. Music is lacking. Overall, this place has room for improvement. Might be willing to try it again if I'm in the area.",1,,
21,Empress M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,6,5.0,9/12/2018,"Pretty good fish tacos! Especially on Tuesdays! I'll come back for happy hour because the drinks look delicious. Unfortunately the wait time was long for the fish tacos but I believe it was because Tuesdays are busy days (too be expected).

22,Rachel L.,"Miami, FL",281,322,273,5.0,5/17/2018,"Love reunion! I've come here a few times for Happy Hour. The beachy/surfer vibe is awesome and reminds me of California when I used to live there. I can't believe I haven't done a review yet! My only suggestion for management is that they really need to add a grip to the staircase heading down into the bar. It was raining yesterday, and the stairs were VERY slippery. My friend slipped down the entire staircase and luckily did not hit her head.. however she's covered in bruises all over her body! So scary!! Please please please consider adding grips to the steps for everyone's safety!",1,,1
23,Tara P.,"Caledonia, NY",107,47,15,4.0,10/25/2018,"I enjoyed the place, even though I was a fish out of water (surfer reference) since (at 50+) I was easily two decades older than most of the people there. The place was crowded at 6:00pm on a Thursday (happy hour lasts until 8:00) with what looked like young work/friend groups trying to have conversations in a rather noisy bar. The bartenders were attentive for a large crowd.  The Happy Hour prices were reasonable, and the mahi mahi tacos were great (two for $11.95 at regular price, cheaper on Tuesdays).  Not quite my vibe anymore, but that has more to do with me than the place.  This could have been the hangout for me and my friends 25 years ago, and it appears to be a favorite hangout for local 20-something NYC professionals. Not a bad place at all.",,,
24,Alina V.,"New York, NY",237,246,591,4.0,4/21/2018,"If you're with at least 3 people, get one of the big punch bowls. We got the scorpion bowl for 3 of us to share and it was huge! Sufficiently got all 3 of us drunk, as well as tasted incredible, and definitely a great deal compared to the price of a regular cocktail. We were only there for the drinks, so we didn't try the food, but the bartenders were great, the crowd was fun, and the music was on point!!",1,1,1
25,Andy L.,"New York, NY",333,133,785,1.0,8/18/2017,"I give Reunion one star because of the following reasons:-  We arrived when Reunion opened and as soon as we sat down by the wall, the couch smelled like vomit.  For someone like myself who has a bad sense of smell, being able to smell vomit means that to others, it probably smelled like sewage.  The couch should've been cleaned prior to opening time but it clearly weren't.  Another group sat on the other end of the couch and had the same complaint.  We all moved to the other room, which was much better.  There was a fish tank at the back which was nice to look at.- Unfortunately, when we ordered, the waitress told us that the machine for frozen drinks was not working.  That was terrible news because most of the drinks on the menu were frozen and that severely limited our options.  So we ended up ordering other drinks, which were pretty strong but didn't really taste that great.  We also got tacos, which were decent.-  Later on, it seemed that the machine was working again.  But we only knew that because the table next to us was told about that.  But why weren't we told?  So we called out to the waitress as she was walking away and she came back to our table.  When we asked if the machine was working again, she said it was.  So we got the frozen drinks we initially wanted.- When we got the check, the waitress told us that she would void out the first two drinks that we ordered due to the inconvenience.  She made it sound like she was doing a very nice thing for us.  We thanked her for doing that.  But in fact she actually meant she voided out the two frozen drinks that we couldn't order due to the broken machine.  Isn't it obvious that what we aren't able to order shouldn't be on the check??  But she acted like she was doing a great favor.All in all, I was very disappointed with our experience at Reunion.  I actually came with a group of friends last year and enjoyed it, which was why we were excited to go two weeks ago.  But the experience was a letdown.  I would highly recommend to make sure everything is cleaned and fixed before the bar opens.  I would not come here again and would not recommend Reunion to anyone.",10,5,2
26,Jinnie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,68,77,5.0,2/5/2018,Absolutely loved this tiki/beachy themed spot! It's a literal hole in the wall (and go down to the basement) type of spot which is super fun.

Came here with a friend after a workout... after she was talking about yummy fish tacos in the area, I had an instant craving, so we made out say down to Réunion.She recommended the fish tacos and the loaded tater tots. Man oh man... it was delicious. Sooo yummy and flavorful. Each bite of those fish tacos was so blissfully satisfying. The loaded taters were good. Lots of yummy chilly, sour cream, cheese and guacamole on tops. Very filly.This place is an amazing beachy bar field. Very cute and relaxing.",,,
28,Kaheem H.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,2,0,2.0,10/22/2018,"Meh. Meh. Meh. I'm just not sure what the hype is all about.A friend I went right after work, expecting the rush every bar in NYC experiences post 5PM. Bartenders were incredibly inattentive. I suppose when you have a ridiculously under priced happy hour, there is really no rush to provide great service.The layout is spacious, considering how small other bar in Manhattan tend to be. However, this place manages to put unnecessary fixtures everywhere. The second area for seating is disjointed and confusing. The surf decor and atmosphere is pretty cool, but somehow feels out of place in NY (I'm a born and raised NY'er so there might be a touch of bias here).",,,

The underground bar just makes you feel like you're in on some kind of secret, as you enter into the over the top surfer bar. You'll be greeted by super friendly waitstaff and a menu full of awesome choices.So the big musts are the Dodo Dogs and the Mermaids. The dogs are smothered in Hawaiian slaw and salsa with a big strip of pork belly (honestly, the dogs are the biggest reason to come.)

34,Joanne H.,"New York, NY",255,266,473,4.0,11/17/2017,Love this place for HH. Very cute and fun tiki bar situated in a dark basement. This place gets crowded pretty quick and it gets relatively loud. Very few table seats but there's also a back area as well (to the right as you walk down the stairs).Come here for $4 fish tacos on Tuesdays!!! Fair warning; they close early sometimes (even on weekends). I live on the same street and they're only a block away so I bring all my friends here and there have been a handful of times we couldn't get in.,4,1,1

This place feels very intimate and fun and I appreciate that.The happy hour deal is very good, though I wouldn't suggest coming here on Taco Tuesday.

It's not everyday you get to hangout at a surf bar in a big city so we had a lot of fun. The drinks had the island theme going and you could find any frozen drink you would ever want. I had the classic Pina Colada and it did not disappoint, in fact, it was very strong so we for sure got our money worth every drink there.",1,,
37,Nancy O.,"East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",11,83,242,4.0,5/17/2017,"Well first make sure you read their signs if you have never been there, I walked right past it not knowing. The entrance looks like an typical nyc parking lot entrance, but when you enter it takes you right down to the restaurant. Pretty cool.The decorations are awesome, especially the entrance into the ladies restroom. Just wish they had a little more lighting around the dinning tables.I went there solely for their happy hour which last from 5:30pm to 10pm with an average cocktail costing only $6. My waitstress recommend the paloma (a fake margarita I assume) and it was delicious. I didn't care much for the screwdriver because they used Orange Crush soda instead of actual orange juice.Since I wasn't super hungry I got the tots with veggie chillies and it came with a heaping amount of guacamole on top (not a guacamole gal at all). It doesn't state that it comes with guac on the menu (they need to change it). But the tots were good, greasy, cheesy and saucy. Had to share it with my friend. She also ordered some type of corn dish that comes served in a Chinese take out bowl. The corn was sweet, a Lil spicey. Overall I loved the place. Nice waitstaff and good vibes all around. If you want the best out of the happy come in at 6pm and leave at 12am which what I did.",2,1,
38,Scott B.,"New York, NY",8,171,204,5.0,11/12/2017,"I just moved here from Florida and on the first coldest night of the year we decide to do happy hour at this surf bar. The ambiance is great and the decor really seems like a Florida bar, even though you can still kinda feel that you're in a basement. The drink specials were great for happy hour. They have a beer and a shot special after that. 8 dollars for a 12oz beer and a shot. Food was actually pretty good and not too pricey. Probably cheap for the area. I had the hot dog (also in happy hour special) it has a dog dog and a strip of pork belly in it so very rich, the slaw cut through it though so I liked it. ""Tot-choes"" were huge and everyone loved them. They're exactly what you expect. Hamburger was described as good by a friend. Mixed drinks tasted great. Earned 5 stars from me with the setting alone. Service was also awesome.",1,1,1

Happy hour is great and goes until 8:30. Cocktails were only $6 - some beers were only $4. What??I had the mermaid x2 which is basically a frozen mojito. Very tasty.Bartenders were busy but still friendly and attentive. This place will get packed!! But it opens at 5:30 so if you get there at 5:30 you will get a good spot. I would definitely come back here.,2,,2
40,Frances T.,"Manhattan, NY",242,86,428,5.0,3/22/2017,"Awesome spot for happy hour. Entrance- look for the secret door on the left and walk down a couple set of stair casesHappy hour drinks- select shots for $3, cocktails are $6, and pilsner $4. Mermaid cocktail- frozen mojito with lots of mint. Paloma- taste like a sour margarita Taco Tuesday- $4/piece. Loved the pork carnitas taco. Served as a whole piece of pork instead of shredded with lots of flavor. Ambiance- California surfer shack-like feel. Brings me back to the west coast. Extra seating near the women's restroom. Plenty of hooks to hang up coats. Service- understaffed, but on point.",4,2,3
41,Susie M.,"Boerne, TX",0,11,2,3.0,10/29/2018,Went here because of yelp rating. Got Tacos. I got pork. They were Cold. It's Monday at 5:30. Didn't enjoy the tacos at all. My friend got the beef tacos. He didn't like them so I ate his second one. It was better than the pork. But meh. Atmosphere was fun with board games all around to play. That was fun. Very disappointed in the food. Margarita was just okay.,,,
42,San L.,"Massapequa, NY",337,133,63,5.0,4/19/2018,"Super fun experience here. Really nice vibe when you enter and the staff is really nice and friendly. Their drinks are really good, I would recommend the Mermaid for a nice happy hour drink and the waves of grain for the double strong cocktail pitchers! You really get your money's worth and it's quite strong. I believe it was $55 for a pitcher. The scorpion wasn't that great though so try other options. Overall, get place to socialize and get your drank on. Cheers!",2,,
43,Lior P.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,27,25,4.0,4/30/2018,"Drinks are affordable and decent. Affordable especially at HH. However some of the drinks were on the weak side and personally I prefer them stronger even if I have to pay a dollar or two more. One drink was mostly ice and was gone in 2-3 sips which was disappointing. Food was good, we had the spicy corn and both beef and vegie tempura tacos. Overall nice experience and I'd go back and happily pay full price for their top shelf liquor drinks...",1,,
44,Jason B.,"West Lafayette, IN",236,131,303,5.0,3/15/2017,"When the snow finally subsided from the recent storm in NYC, what better way to warm up than a trip to a surf themed bar? We found this place on Yelp while visiting the city, and man am I glad we did. This bar is the real deal. Friendly staff, great drinks, good snacks, and a fun theme combine to make this a memorable place to visit. We stayed for a couple hours, and I had three drinks in total. I tried one of the coconut-based drinks, as well as two of the surfer dudes, which was essentially a screwdriver with orange soda mixed in. Most drinks here are rum based, but you'll see some other options mixed in. They offer a good selection of frozen drinks as well, which is what my friends got. Also, try the ""acid drop"" shot - its grapefruit and comes with a sugar coated rim. Really good. Drinks run around $13 dollars, which for how strong they are, isn't a bad price. Food is pretty cheap as well. The decor is inviting and fits the theme. There are surfboards, lots of tropical colors, and other similar items. There are multiple rooms for seating, but we sat at the bar during our visit. Overall, I highly recommend stopping here for a drink if you get the chance!",2,,1
45,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",515,467,1964,4.0,2/16/2017,"If you're expecting to be dazzled then don't bother coming here. Instead, Reunion is a cute little underground bar with extended happy hour deals (8pm), cute drinks and a relaxing atmosphere to chill in. Their theme is fun and cheeky, while their girly drinks match their Hawaiian motif. The bartender was great! Despite the crowd, he handled his cool and was attentive to our needs. The drinks was not as strong as I would have liked, but it was definitely pretty looking so that was a plus. However, their short ribs tacos was only okay. Despite it being plentiful with the short ribs, my taco didn't really taste like a taco. Instead it tasted like a toss salad, with meat on the bottom.  The most criminalizing of all is that it lacked seasonings and sauce (hence why they lost their extra star). Overall, I would still recommend this place only if you're looking for a quick hang out or to kill time while waiting for a show in Time Square. However, I'm not sure if Reunion has long lasting appeals for me to wanna come back just so I can hang out for the entire evening.",3,2,1

50,Abby B.,"Philadelphia, PA",168,601,4,2.0,7/20/2017,"A surf bar that's so tucked away, you'd likely walk right past the entrance if it weren't for the large sky blue lifeguard chair at the door. I get what Reunion is trying to do - create a laid-back beachy/boozy scene in the middle of NYC. But it didn't really work for me. First, the bar is located in a basement, so there's zero natural light. It actually reminded me more of the dungeon in a GoT episode than a beach. Second, the noise. It gets crowded and loud. This is probably fine if you're into that sort of thing, but the older I get, the more I detest waiting in a mosh-pit of sweaty people for a drink.I also need to add that there is only one bartender (at least on the night I came). He was as attentive as one can be when making drinks for the entire establishment and taking care of his customers at the bar. I'd much rather be drinking though, not spending most of my time here waiting.They have happy hour specials, but most of those are mixed drinks. Tuesday they have $4 tacos, but come on any other day and the only taco special involves a heaping mound of tator-tots smothered in salsa and guac.I tried the pork tacos and they were delicious, but pricey for just two small tacos.Go here if you're in your 20's, single, and love yelling over loud music just to talk to your date/friends.",4,,1

Fries are cooked well done, nice and crispy with a delicious dipping sauce. The crowd here are all in their late 20s - so really note this. Around happy hour (like most bars) EXTREMELY PACKED. I went here for a going away happy hour celebration. I called ahead of time to see if they had tacos, and the woman was very professional, and stepped into her office to take the call. For a bar/venue, I thought this was very respectable. What made me laugh was the woman in the front in a beach chair checking IDs. She was so cute, and welcoming.

57,Sapan P.,"New York, NY",206,15,56,4.0,1/13/2018,"We stopped by Réunion for their happy hour before we went out for the night. We were a group of 5 and arrived for their happy hour on a Friday. Considering that they are located in midtown in a relatively populated part of the city, it really wasn't that packed and we were able to be comfortably seated at the bar. It didn't get crowded until closer to the end of their happy hour at 8pm at which point it was still enjoyable to hang out in, but you can definitely tell that it was taking longer to be served and we had to wait a slightly longer than normal time for a drink. Their ambiance is really ""West Coast"" which was a nice contrast to the weather outside which was below 20 F. It was definitely different than most NYC bars but was decorated tastefully with a well- paired menu that was respective to their theme. Their happy hours drinks are great in both quality and price! For $6/ drink, we were able to taste a few mixed cocktails for much less than we expected. To start, we order the ""Mermaid"", a frozen mojito. It was extremely refreshing and was slightly heavy on mint compared to most mojitos. Definitely the best $6 frozen mojito I've had. We also tried the ""Paloma"", a mixed drink with tequila, lime, and grapefruit soda. This was definitely my favourite drink. I'm not usually a fan of grapefruit but the bitterness of the soda paired nicely with the tequila and lime. It was a nice contrast with the simple syrup it was sweetened with. In between, we order ""Acid Drop shots"" (grapefruit vodka, grapefruit juice, and vanilla syrup). Again, just like the rest of their drinks, it was a really nice tropical flavor that can't be beaten for the price. During our time their, the bar tender gave us house tequila shots which was extremely, extremely nice of them and just further proof of their great customer service. Definitely worth going to for groups planning to go out in midtown, especially for their happy hour!",2,,1

Tacos are a little smaller than the size of your hand. My favs are fish and pork belly. Not sure if this is always the case, but when my friend and I went on a Tuesday around 5pm, it was not very crowded, but service was incredibly slow. Ordered 2 drinks and 2 tacos, waited about 15 minutes for our drinks. About an hour in, tacos were still missing so we ended up canceling the order because we had a show to catch. Server was helpful and apologetic, but it was very hectic because she was helping ten other parties or so.

As soon as you walk into this place it looks kind of sketchy; you go into the building and there's some sort of garbage room, then on the right there's a door that says ""must be 21+ to enter"". We went through the door which leads us downstairs through some dark staircase. When we finally get to the establishment we were told there was only bar seating or a table in the small hallway by the entrance, because all the other tables were reserved. We had tried to make a reservation on Yelp & Open-table prior to going but they did not have online reservations, so we asked the waiter how can someone reserve a table and she said that they don't always take reservations, only for parties of 6+ via email. We decide to sit in the hallway because we were a group of 4. However it was very uncomfortable because people were constantly crowding around us while they waited for a table & it was very cold. The happy hour menu was not very impressive as they did not have well drinks. So my friends and I decide to order the Mermaid Mojito. They could not make it on the rocks because it's made in frozen batches beforehand. The drink tasted good but had basically no alcohol in it. It was practical a mint smoothie. We then try to order a round of fireball shots but they do not have it at the bar so we do their house rum. It was disgusting and looked like murky water! In regards to food, we ordered the fish, pork, & steak tacos, the mozzarella sticks, the tater tots, & the hotdog. The tacos, hotdog, & the mozzarella stickers were really good but the tacos were very small. The chilli on the tater tots didn't taste good so we didn't like the tater tots much.",,,

No warning about the spice on the menu, so if you can't take the heat, you shouldn't order this.The surfer girl/dude was like an offensive OJ drink. The drink I liked more was the frozen corona, because how can you go wrong with that? Don't order the tater tots because they're not worth it much. The tastes on the tots didn't really combine for a good taste overall - there seemed to be something missing. It's almost like nacho toppings without the cohesive nacho cheese.

80,Jon P.,"Manhattan, NY",197,107,53,5.0,3/4/2016,"Came here for happy hour on a Tuesday evening. Great spot! Happy hour goes from 5:30-8, and Tuesdays they have taco Tuesday (4$ tacos - fish, pork, or vegi). Most drinks during happy hour are $4-6 ranging from beer to cocktails. Theme: tiki bar vibe, felt like I was in Hawaii and chilling at a beach bar. Dim lighting, casual, and nice music in the background. Food: I got the tater tot nachoes which is a great idea in paper, but in reality not too much. With the mixture of chili, cheese, guac, and salsa the tater tots became a bit soggy. So I used to tots on the side and dipped it into the middle like a dip. Very tasty and crunchy tots. Tacos: let me start off by saying I'm not much of a sea food person, so the fact that I ordered fish tacos is saying a lot. The fish tacos were deliciously crunchy, tangy, and fried to perfection. And they are HUGE. 2 tacos filled me up, I wish I could've ate more bc they tasted so good. Definitely order these. Mexican corn: the corn was just as good, grilled to perfection, not too creamy and just a hint of lime. Reminded me of the downtown LA corn in the cob that I used to have as a child. Drinks: I got the Paloma (tequila and grapefruit fizz -$6) which was strong, not too sweet, with a nice kick. I noticed a lot of ppl were ordering the Mermaid (frozen slushy mojito) which was also really good. They also have some beers on tap. Overall, great happy hour spot, great prices, and ridiculously delicious fish tacos.",6,,1
81,Laura C.,"Cambridge, MA",497,98,139,5.0,6/20/2016,"Fun surf themed bar located in the basement! Surprisingly roomy and not sardine-like in the slightest, despite the location. The bartenders are fun and chill, not so much that I couldn't think of more unique adjectives to describe them as much as it's just very true! That was wordier than it needed to be, but I blame the drinks. Reunion Sunrise was fruity, refreshing, and smooth. Singapore Sling's deep love affair with pineapple was well appreciated, as was its alcoholic strength.The star of the night were the Reunion Fries. Jesus H Christ. The Jamaican seasoning was perfect, just like the cheese sauce. All my life I've been searching for fries with enough seasoning, and now I've finally found them. I will be back for those godly fries in the near future. Oh, the Corona was also reasonably priced and the Pork Taco another surprisingly strong contender. As if this place could get better.",1,,

We found this one through Yelp, and loved the reviews and the theme. So, we trudged through the aftermath of ""winter storm"" Stella and came here. The bar is located downstairs and you stop by the lifeguard station to show your ID.  There are two main seating areas, the one around the bar, and another off to the side. The decor is surfer themed and it's so fun! They have lots of little signs that don funny saying, like ""must be this tall to ride bartender."" The drinks average about $13 and are very tropical themed. The selection of rum is quite impressive as well. The food is tasty and not too pricey.

Hang out for long enough and sometimes you can even trick yourself into thinking you're somewhere on an island paradise with the cool surfer/tiki decor. Even as busy as it was, it wasn't too hard to order drinks. Decent happy hour specials. Frozen Corona was definitely refreshing.

They have a separate room for private parties but the first time I visited was on a Sunday and the room was empty! My friends and I hung out in that room and danced for a few hours. It was so much fun!However, the cocktails are so watered down. The first time I was here I tried a few and each was a sugary disappointment. Stick to the beer. I revisited this past Saturday night with a group of friends and we grabbed the empty couch area (next to the bar) with signs that state ""table service only"". We waited and waited and waited. We were planning on having food and drinks there but after 1 hour and just 1 round of beers and the waitress nowhere in sight to take our food order we decided to leave.

While the flavor was good, the amount of meat and the size of the sandwich was so small.

I came here because I was hungry and in midtown -- the only reason someone would come here. Did I expect to eat the best fish tacos I've ever had in my entire life? No. Did I? YES. New York is notoriously terrible at Mexican food, but I have to say that I enjoyed these tacos more than any I've had in CA. I think they fry the tortilla a little bit, so you get this slightly crunchy/sturdy but still melt-in-your-mouth soft tortilla. The fish was perfectly breaded and cooked, and the slaw was delicious too. The main star is the sauce they put on top though, which I would drink out of a glass if they served it. The drinks were great, everything was reasonably priced, and the server managed to juggle like 8 tables at once, not forget anything, and was attentive/quick/friendly. They could use some windows down there, but you still feel like you're at the beach.",,1,

I got their Mermaid - frozen mojito (loved it but not as strong as I expected it to be) and my friends got their Paloma (margarita), Surfer Dude (screwdriver with orange crush), Acid Drop (not amazing), and Dark and Stormy (classic but not included in happy hour specials). All the drinks were made very well and efficiently. The tacos took forever and a year to come (tables were limited and even though they were limited the table service here was terrible which is why I knocked off a star) but they were absolutely delicious. I was full off of two tacos (the baja fish was incredible). Definitely recommend this bar as a hangout spot after work on Tuesdays.",1,,

Ended up waiting a full 40 minutes for an order of 2 tacos and a burrito. Meanwhile the party next to us on our communal table (who ordered after we did btw) got their food promptly with no problem. We mention this to our waitress and she simply said ""there's like 20 other tickets out, it's gonna take a while."" Not one single ""sorry."" I went from hangry to just ANGRY.We finally get out food shortly after that, but I couldn't help but notice our California burrito was luke-warm. Definitely not freshly made. Almost like it was prepared for a while but just sitting out with no where to go until someone finally came looking?Anyway, in addition to being luke-warm, the burrito was not appetizing. I do not recommend. The chili made it soggy and there was barely any meat. Did I mention it was luke-warm? Tacos were good. I liked the deep fried taco shells a lot! Honestly, more upset at the poor service from our waitress which just ruined the whole experience for me. And to be COMPLETELY honest, we were still so hungry after this that we went straight to Panda Express across the street  and were pleasantly surprised as to how their customer service was exponentially better than at Reunion!",1,,

The totchos (tater tots covered in guacamole, salsa, black beans and melted cheese) are great for sharing.

The young lady at the door was super sweet and Mike the bartender was pretty cool himself.The food is CLEARLY not why people come here. The grilled cheese dish was okay, I ended up taking most of the caramelized onions off because it was so much. I think it would be awesome if they allow guests to add something to the sandwich...spinach or bacon or both or something like that. The French fries were seasoned....seasoned so much it was overwhelming and I had only 3 of them. Just not my thing. I also would've preferred them freshly made, but that is me just being a pain in the ass. The fish tacos my friend purchased were decent and the tot-chos with veggie chili that was shared was also kind of okay. Nothing to call home about. Like I said, this place doesn't look like the kind of place you'd go to because of the food. The money here is the drinks and the ambiance. The decor is great but from the looks of it, this is a party place and probably is too rowdy and frat house for my style when its a weekend night.

Outside is a lifeguard stand (yes, really) where a bouncer checks your ID. I wasn't expecting to be carded on a Tuesday night so I strolled right in then the bouncer told me to show her my ID. Of course my ID is trapped in my wallet, she says it needs to be taken out (which I thought was odd since she wasn't scanning it). Then she stamped my wrist. Honestly the whole thing felt like I was entering a club loaded with 18 year olds on a Friday evening, which was a little off-putting.Inside the whole place is decorated like a beach shack. Tables are waitress service only, there is a private room with a cool aquarium and some funky looking bathrooms (there is tons of writing on the stall doors). The bartender was nice and pointed out the happy hour specials (written on a surfboard, of course). They are known for their frozen drinks so I decided to check out a frozen mojito (called a mermaid). It was okay but extremely watered down and lacking much flavor. I would probably try something different next time, however, it was refreshing. The HH was decent, the mixed drinks went from $12 to $6. The music is alll surfer-related, as well as the movies playing on the TVs.If you're looking for a theme bar in the theater district, come here. Otherwise there are better spots to explore.",,,

Apparently this was offensive to him as he decided to mention it, yelling ""really?! is that all??"" When we said yes, he started getting really angry, I thought he was going to try and fight us or kick us out. He then said, sarcastically, ""alright good luck in life, have a nice life"".

The unique cocktails, happy hour deals, tacos, and reunion fries have kept me coming back! While the food remains excellent, the service has sadly gone down enormously. It is clear that there is new staff on the floor. The past 3 times I've been there, the same server has forgotten to bring out fries. Usually we remind her and it's not a big deal, but this time we were waiting for fries until finally we told her just to forget about it. Her response was ""Fuck, you didn't get them?"" We all have bad days, but the fact that this continues to happen is disappointing. Usually I recommend this place to friends visiting New York, because of how much I love it, and its proximity to Broadway.

You head downstairs to the basement to a cozy spot. Not really that large but they squeeze in a bunch of tables to sit at and some bar seating.For bigger groups like ours they placed us in a side party room, which was really great since we had a large fish tank to view and some outlets to power up our phones.Good service overall.

124,Claud D.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",818,8,209,2.0,2/28/2017,"4$ for bad tacos every taco is fried except pork and it's dry and chewy I only ordered 1 and my gf ordered 1 fried fish to taste and it comes w shredded cheese  like wtf the tortillas tasted soggy and so much like dirty oil, lettuce tasted like a plastic bag the only hot sauce was Tabasco  it was bad choice this place is not a surfers taco it's a tourist taco in clear water Florida really disappointed for the price it was terrible there were other places for 2$ that were probably better On taco Tuesday I would have enjoyed Taco Bell, the bartender has no bar back no servers so u don't feel at all connected to the place u feel rushed... the drinks r I mean 6$ for a tequila mix drink called Paloma it's ok since  ny is unheard of ""6$"" drinks? So yeah that part was ok but I could have drank wine at home lol",,,1
125,Wael M.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,9,0,5.0,5/13/2017,"Love the decor and the atmosphere in this place! Definitely beats any touristic hot spot in the area and its a good surprise to go down and find a surf bar, especially on cold and rainy NYC nights.The cocktails are pretty good here too, prices are reasonable!",,,
126,Amy K.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,76,192,4.0,2/6/2016,"This place could be hard to find. You have to enter through this place and open the door to go downstairs to the basement. Once you get down there, there will be someone to check your ID. Be sure to have your ID! After you have been checked, they stamp you with a star (Woo-hoo I feel special) and you're free to enter. Came here only for drinks with a few friends on a Friday night. This place opens at 5:30 pm and we got there at 5:45 pm. The place was already packed and somewhat loud (from all the talking and the music). There is also limited seating. Luckily, we were able to find spots where you're literally a few centimeters in front of a wall (talk about being lonely). The first thing you'll realize is the cool, beach surfer style this place has. This theme is what really makes this place unique and seems like you're being whisked away to some other place than NYC, especially in the winter. I really like the style and decor this place has!They have happy hour until 8 pm and have a few drinks (4-5?) that are valid for happy hour. We ordered the Surfer Girl, which is a tropical screwdriver (orange juice and vodka) topped off with orange crush soda to start. It sounded cool, but when we got the drinks, we all agree that they were kind of bitter and hard to drink. However, we drank them to get the most bang for our buck (even though it was $6 each because of happy hour, originally $12 each). My other two friends ordered the Mermaid and the Acid Drop next. The Mermaid is their classic frozen mojito with a sugarcane stick in it. The Acid Drop is grapefruit vodka with fresh grapefruit juice and a vanilla sugar rim. Personally, I'm not a mojito or a grapefruit kind of person. But if you are, then I think you would enjoy either one of these drinks. As we are conversing and drinking, I couldn't help but notice how much crowded the place was getting. People were looking for seats and were blocking any place to walk. So when me and my friend decided to use the bathroom, it was kind of hectic to get there (think of a movie where it portrays people getting lost in NYC in a crowd, kind of like that I suppose). Overall, this place is pretty good to hang out with some friends/co-workers. Service was great, despite how busy it was! I recommend coming here at an off-hour, as this place gets EXTREMELY packed. But, definitely check this place out for its cool surfer beach theme. It's a great experience!",2,,1
127,Lindy D.,"New York, NY",160,72,69,5.0,5/22/2016,"We went to Reunion for a combined bachelor-bachelorette party, and it was excellent. This bar is surf/beach themed, complete with surfboards, a fish tank, and interesting drink choices like a frozen corona (yum!).Overall this place had excellent service, attentive waitstaff, and good, interesting drinks. The manager came by multiple times to check on us. At the end we had to move on to a karaoke bar on a schedule, and the waitress brought out all of our separate bills really quickly - I was pleased and impressed.I would definitely come here again, especially because they have a happy hour with great prices on the good drinks.",,,1

Updated review",Made a last minute reservation yesterday with Nina for tonight's Girls Night Out event with two of my girlfriends. I was luckily to get a table in the Fish Room but not next to the Fish Tank. One of my friends got there first to secure our table while me and my friend walked from my job to Hell's Kitchen. We were ask to show Ids upon arrival and guided to our table. Greeted by our lovely server Leah who welcomed me and my friends with her awesome personality and smile. Definitely take advantage of the Happy Hour drinks! Leah holds your credit card that way to track your orders and when you are ready to pay the bill...you can either pay in cash or charge it!Drinks: Mermaids (2)...less strong and Surfer Girl (3)...very deliciousFood: Le Americain (2)Overall it was great night to have dinner and drinks here with my girlfriends!,3,,2
129,Anne P.,"Manhattan, NY",67,8,11,4.0,3/14/2016,"A cute place for the young and hip! Haha. Almost seems like a speakeasy since after you walk into the main entrance, you need to walk through another door to the left then go down the stairs then voilá! We ordered drinks from the surfboard menu since its happy hour all day Sunday! I ordered the mermaid thinking 'oh that sounds like the girliest drink. it's probably yummy' and my friend, being a typical guy, ordered the frozen corona, but lo and behold, we ended up switching drinks (or more like I took his, haha). I generally hate beer, but the frozen corona tastes like lemonade on a summer day whereas the mermaid was a bit too bitter for my taste (I'm a baby with alcohol..). We also had a corner booth which was really cozy and the atmosphere was very relaxed - good for conversations away from the bar and other people. All in all, if you want a delicious drink that doesn't taste like alcohol (even if you don't admit that you don't like the taste of alcohol because who does?) the frozen corona is the way to go .",1,,
130,Mike S.,"Long Island, NY",638,624,2753,4.0,9/28/2015,"Came in for pre-show happy hour for a few drinks to find this underground bar packed with mainly twenty-somethings enjoying a great selection of nicely priced happy hour drinks. Prior to entering the hostess at the door from the street is sitting in a life guard chair and ask her a hacky joke question of ""how's the water?"". She informs me she doesn't swim - good thing she isn't a real life guard! She is kind enough to check my id even though the grey streaks emanating from my temples should be more than enough proof. All very friendly and cool.After descending to the bar which to me has a divey, surfer bar feel to it (Actually, for Ocean City, MD people it reminded me of Peppers Tavern) We decide on a couple of drink specials - Surfer Girl for my friend, which is a vodka based orange crush and I go for the Paloma which is tequila, lime and grapefruit soda for the win! These were the perfect drinks for us to say goodbye to summer.The young surfer dude bartenders know how to handle the crowd and mix a killer strong drink! The vibe is a bit loud and boisterous. We didn't eat any food but saw some delicious looking tacos whiz pass us. The service is on point with the bussers clearing away glasses as soon as they are emptied. Fantastic happy hour, great service and cool, laid back vibe in the middle of the Theater district! I will take it!",6,1,4
131,Mary N.,"Flushing, NY",275,73,94,5.0,5/30/2016,"A surf-themed dive bar with fun beach decor, strong drinks, great bar food, and tons of open space! The basement bar is decked out with surfboards, colorful walls, and string lights. The bar is open and spacious. I came for happy hour with a group of 6 people. I ordered The Mermaid, a slushy mojito that was smooth and refreshing with the alcohol kicking in after I was finished. The fries were SO GOOD and much better than what I was expecting from a bar. They were slightly crunchy with a spicy seasoning topped with Parmesan cheese and a tangy chipotle mayo-like dip. My friend ordered the burger which was tiny like a White Castle burger. Apparently there was a mistake with her order and they gave her another one on the house. Despite the mini size, she said it tasted really good.Our bartender was the best! He made sure we were take care of, joined in on our jokes and made friendly conversation. The music was great with pop 2k and 90's throwbacks that we all sang along to. We had an AWESOME time at Reunion!",,,
132,Kelly H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,4.0,4/8/2018,This is my favorite bar to come to for happy hour. They have one of the longest happy hours (going until 8pm) and have great cocktails for only $6! I highly recommend the mermaid frozen mojito!! The atmosphere is fun and well decorated. The only downside is that it's always super crowded (because it's so great) and it can take a while to get a drink. I took away a star because the last time I went I waited 30 minutes at the bar to get my drink.,,,
133,Sarina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",78,266,300,4.0,11/18/2015,"Love this bar! Their beach/island decor is so cute. Great spot to pregame or just have drinks with friends.

138,Kathleen C.,"Bergenfield, NJ",279,48,69,4.0,8/2/2017,Happy hour 5-8pm and cheap but strong drinks = perfect combo. Not many places extend their HH deals to this time and most drinks about $6 so my friends and I really enjoyed this place. We came toward the end of happy hour and there wasn't a big crowd either. This place is an underground bar in the Theater district with a surfer theme. It has of cool stuff on the walls too. Didn't get to order food but I would definitely come here again,,,
139,Athena B.,"New York, NY",149,47,8,5.0,2/17/2017,Such a cool spot! Easy to find because of the well labeled surf board on the street but did not realize it was underground. I walked in to some great 90s-2000s throwbacks and a lot of surf/ Hawaiian/ California paraphernalia. My friends and I shared the Zombie Pitcher which is rum punch. It came out in a pitcher with 3 straws and was nice and strong. We also got the fries which were deliciously seasoned and came with a special sauce. They have the bar but also a room with table service. They have a large menu for both drinks and food. I definitely have to come back to try more on the menu.,,,
140,Rona L.,"Federal Way, WA",238,667,2852,4.0,3/26/2014,"We asked our friends for a recommendation on a bar near our hotel and they suggested Reunion.We weren't sure if we had found it until we saw a small sign outside.  It looked pretty sketchy from the outside; to the point that one of my friends was reluctant to cross the street and go in.  I'm glad we went for it anyway though because once inside, you find a cozy bar with funky decor and a laid-back atmosphere. We couldn't find seating at first so we stood by the bar.  Service at the bar was completely cold but that all changed once we found a little booth in the corner and had table service.  They played some great music throughout the night (just loud enough for us to hear but not so loud that we had to yell across the table).  We ordered a few drinks and just chatted the night away.We ordered the Pitcher of Zombie and some other drinks, but what I vividly recall, is the Coffee Rum and Coke.  That's right -- COFFEE rum.  My boyfriend asked for a vodka redbull and after the server informed us that they didn't carry energy drinks, he recommended the coffee rum and coke.  Apparently, he infuses the rum with coffee beans himself.  When it came to our table...WOW.  I was surprised by the intense coffee flavor.  It was incredibly delicious.  Seriously.  I was trying to figure out how I could recreate the same thing at home. By the end of the night, we were nicely buzzing and happy.  I could imagine myself here often, if I was a local.",6,6,6

I was happy to see that they had many specials other than beer. My coworker and I were among the first few people to arrive so we sat at one of the larger tables and waited for the rest of our friends. Two more arrived and we got settled and began placing drink orders. Just a little while after getting our drinks, our waitress apologized and said that the table we sat at was actually reserved and she asked if we could be seated in their back room. She also said that the table in the back was just as spacious and that we would be comfortable there. Reluctantly, we moved and found that the table was half the size as the one we just left. We asked if we could pull up chairs and they said no because we were so close to the bathroom and it would be a fire hazard. There was actually room in that back area that could accommodate more people or even another table, but it was not set up that way. We also saw a group of chairs set up to face each other, without a table, that was ""reserved"" as well. I understand that mistakes happen and unfortunately, we weren't told to move quickly enough to find a better table, but they straight up lied to us and didn't do anything to better accommodate us. Needless to say, we finished up our delicious Palomas and headed to another bar near by.",2,2,1

I'm like a child at the candy store with the sugar haha. All of their drinks are pretty good, nothing too fancy but fit the feel of the bar. Their drinks can also be made into shots if you're in the mood for that.They have DAILY happy hour until 8pm! It does get packed on most weekend nights, so come early or be prepared to hover behind the bar and get shoved while people dance. You must order with the waitress if you sit at the tables on the side.The bar also serves a loaded hot dog, tacos, some other small bites. If corn is your thing, get the esquites! So good!

They were hardly slushy or alcoholic. We ordered food (tempura tacos & a burger) and they tasted great. The place was fully packed because of the ""holiday,"" so i expected service to be around a 6/10. What wasn't okay was that the bartender kept passing drinks DIRECTLY OVER my friend's head, instead of saying ""excuse me"" and passing on the side of her. And what do you know?! 4 glasses of liquor end up falling in her head! Hair, clothing, and my hair were drenched in booze.  What does the bartender do? Walk away without any apology. Now we're pissed. After the bartender IGNORES us for half an hour, we flag him down for the bill (meanwhile HE has an attitude). After he snaps ""What?"" at my friend who's trying to pay and leave, i figure I'd just talk to a manager before we go. After my friend signs her receipt, the bartender comes back and yells ""I DIDN'T SPILL THOSE DRINKS ON YOU! IT WAS THE OTHER GUY!"" K.

It's worth about 3-4 drinks in one. Not overly sweet or strong.....dare I say perfect. Had the pork belly tacos and the Mahi Mahi tacos.

They're not strong and great for sharing if you don't mind all drinking out of the same glass. Also you must get the totchos! It's tater tots with guacamole, salsa, sour cream, chicken and cheese.

I got the pork belly and mahi mahi. The mahi was my fav. It's very light but with a lot of crunch from the slaw and fried tortilla. Pork belly comes with avocado which is always good. 7:59pm on the dot the waitress comes around for last happy hour orders. $4 tacos also ends at 8. only con is that the waitress could have been a bit friendlier.

At the end of the day, it's a convenient HK location but there are better places to spend your money.",,,

It was packed too (Thursday night), so try and get there before 7pm.It's vaguely speakeasy-ish, simply because it's downstairs and the entrance is through a dark door in a hallway leading to another section of the building, but the yellow surfboard and bouncers outside will help you find it.",1,,

Updated review",Fun place to grab a drink. Very beachy surfer vibe which is different. Sweet happy hour specials and food is very cheap. Waiter was very attentive and friendly. Fries I had were good - crispy and spicy.,,,
168,Dipika P.,"Jersey City, NJ",194,53,25,3.0,5/8/2017,"The set-up of the bar is cute and while it does have a great ambiance (surf themed) this place can get a little crowded for Happy Hour. However, the happy hour menu are selected drinks. If you're hoping for a place to get a well drink that's part of happy hour this wouldn't be the place to go and unfortunately I'm a vodka soda kind of girl rather than a mermaid cocktail. The cocktail I got also had pulp which I wish they let you know in advance. Also, wasn't a fan of the bartender the day I went but this could be due to the fact they were really busy however I did see him make eye contact a few times.",,,
169,Karen N.,"Bronx, NY",69,43,123,2.0,4/23/2017,"I found this place through Yelp looking for happy hours for groups. I decided to check it out and scout the location to see if it fits. When you finally find the place, you have to open a door and walk down a flight of stairs. It definitely gives off a speakeasy feeling or make you question if you should walk down the stairs - feels questionable :P When you get downstairs, someone will card you from a very high seat. The whole bar has a surfing theme with very funny quotes and surfboard hanged up on the walls. Happy Hour is available everyday. We ordered the Mermaid, surfer girl and acid drop cocktail. The mermaid was the best out of the 3. We also ordered the dodo dog and tot chos. The tot chos were really good but the cheese was stuck to wax paper on the dish and made it very messy and difficult to eat. The dodo dog in my own opinion was not appealing and not good. I thought hot dogs would be the safe route to go for food but it was a disappointment. The bar is very casual as I noticed alot of group of people just relaxing and having a good time. I noticed the bartender was singing ""It raining men"" with the patrons and it seemed like fun. Our waitress did take FOREVER to bring out our drinks and appetizers and I had to walk to the register station to even get a knife or to get our bill. She was either too busy or not attentive and we felt like we could not get any service. My friends were too annoyed which is why we bar hopped to another location. It seems like a cool and fun place to hang out but I don't know how I will feel to come back here with a group of people because it was too hard to get service for just 3 people.",,,

The food was poorly prepared and low quality. The temperature was also unappetizing. My friend and I wish we would have known better but saw reviews saying this was a decent place. While I didn't drink any alcohol, my friends drink simply tasted like $12 juice. Bathroom also had no running sink water at the time.",1,,
171,Kat T.,"El Segundo, CA",2,14,8,3.0,6/25/2016,"Mixed feelings about this place. Great cocktail specials during happy hour. My husband, a surfer, loved the beach feel and watching surf videos on the tvs. However, for me it was way too loud. Before you call me an old fart let me explain that everyone was literally shouting... you had to to hear the person across the table. Music was so loud everyone else had to be louder. Seemed to be a large group in the back section by the bathrooms that prob added to the noise. Our waitress (tables are table service only... and the place was mostly tables) was awesome though. Super friendly and fun. Danced around like a free spirit.",1,,

173,Diana A.,"Tampa, FL",400,189,123,5.0,1/20/2015,"I read a comment on yelp that referred to this bar as ""weird"" instead of this being an insult as this reviewer intended that was the comment that made me want to go. This bar is so different from other Manhattan bars. Def a chill vibe . All around good energy but you know what was better? The DRINKS my friend and I tried about half of the drink menu And I must say not one was disappointing.  So delicious and the price was not bad at all the drinks were potent yet yummy. The bartenders where so welcoming and of course made amazing drinks . Drinks that I have not seen in any bar EVER . From the infused rums with earl grey and infused jalapeño rum to the bartenders and manager, not to mention the PLACE all in itself , this is my favorite bar. It's a must  when in Manhattan .",4,2,1

I'll be back.",1,,1

I will say that the fries here taste amazing though...if not for that Reunion would get just a 1 star rating.",,,
177,Lizz T.,"Washington, DC",42,30,2,4.0,6/13/2016,"This bar is something else! Close to Times Square, but not full of tourists. We thought it seemed interesting so we came in to check it out.They have a bar and tables. The tables are ""table service only,"" which means a server takes your order rather than you going to the bar to order. We ordered a mermaid (frozen mojito), which tasted good, but not strong. Next, I ordered the frozen mango margarita with raspberry swirl. It was good, and surprisingly strong. The bar feels like they got their inspiration from Puerto Rico, especially with the different drinks they offer.It's definitely worth checking out.",,,1
178,David Q.,"Manhattan, NY",30,29,16,2.0,5/10/2016,Avoid if over 25 years of age. Dingy and in need of maintenance / redecoration. While it certainly has the feel of a sun & sea weathered surf town look - it also charges Manhattan prices. You enter a via building thoroughfare a stake a sharp right via dark hidden door with a warning that says do not enter (which I presume is the back door to the place on the corner) and go down a set of dimly lit stairs with prison style hand rails that are barely secure.If you're a student who wants to get drunk (and can) on watered happy hour well drinks and need the vibe of a run down island surf bar - then you've found home.,1,,
179,Darren I.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",248,7,0,1.0,12/27/2016,"I went here to have an actual ""REUNION"", as such is their name, but starting from the bouncer to the management, holy crap were they extremely to our group. My girlfriend was feeling nauseous because she has a condition, and her friend was in the women's bathroom trying to help her, but the MANAGER (the freaking manager!!!) barged in to their bathroom and told them they need to leave and that she ""doesn't have to respectful to people like them."" What the hell??? What does that even mean??? What kind of a backhanded racist comment is that? Not only that, why in the world is the MANAGER barging into people's bathroom during a moment of PRIVACY. That's not even the end of it! They continued to bug us and harass us until we finally decided we've had enough of their entire waitstaff and management bullying us till we left. I tried my best to leave on a good note without any sour feelings but once I heard about my girlfriend being barged in on when she was in the bathroom, that was a final decision for me to never come to this place ever again. We tried to be respectful, but as soon as the MANAGER starts making racist comments and barging in on people's moment of privacy in the bathroom, that's when I lost all respect for the joint. I do NOT recommend this place if you're a person of color. They will NOT respect you.",2,2,1

181,Florann E.,"Boston, MA",233,205,197,2.0,1/26/2016,"Expensive and not worth the wait at the bar. I would give it another chance, but I don't think the commute is worth it either.",3,,
182,Amber B.,"Cincinnati, OH",8,46,48,4.0,4/26/2016,"Out of towner, here for business, looking for a chill non-work vibe. I used Yelp to find this place. I liked the downstairs hidden aspect of the place.  The music was RandB not the radio stuff but more chill. The bartender was super cool and made a great drink. Only reason I gave 4/5 is because a few younger patrons early 20s arrived and really were obnoxious. It was no fault of the bar though just the risk you take in a bar. I will go back again.",1,,
183,Kerianne O.,"Commack, NY",392,59,239,3.0,4/1/2016,"Pleasant surprise, this place is hid away around a bend and down a staircase. I made the mistake of coming hungry and just ordering blindly off of the menu.Value: They have lots of fun frozen drinks ranging $12-15 each and a cocktail pitcher is $55. I had the Hawaiian Pog and we agreed that it was better than the Coco Loco that our friend had ordered. We came hungry so we wanted FOOD! The food menu is limited to small sandwiches (no sides) for around $9. We both ordered the Vietnamese sandwich, and we were given a plate with two small sandwiches on it-- We thought, maybe the other plate will be out soon for the other sandwich (they were that small), but no. The $9 sandwiches were just that SMALL. We didn't fuss however, and just ordered some $5 plates (fries, tamales, etc). They have $8 beer can and tequila shot combos which seem to be a hit. Happy hour ends at 8pm, but the beer and shot combo is for any time.Food: The $9 vietnamese sandwich was good, but we finished it in under 30 seconds. If you come hungry, order the $5 sides because they give you a relatively decent sized portion in comparison to the more ""expensive"" dishes. The fries are served in a paper chinese take-out pint. Ambiance: I came on a Thursday night, and there were a decent amount of people floating around the bar. Dim lighting, throwback 2000s music. Decorations include pinup art, random license plates (tennessee), and surf boards. It was a bit weird that for a Surf Bar that the Table Service chairs were not beachy and did not match the other furniture in the bar. There is limited table service because there are not that many tables. Service: Our waiter was friendly and we found a table by our own desires. Food was delivered to the table at the average rate. Getting the check took 15 minutes of attempting to wave the waitress over, and another 10 minutes while another tables check was closed out.Overall, I recommend that you try this bar out if you want to try something different, but it isn't an everyday bar. If it gets busy then it will be hard to talk to your date.",1,,1

I will come back just for my favorite drink- the Reunion Sunrise - which tastes like a delicious fruity tropical mango raspberry paradise. The bar had a California Malibu theme going on so the fruity tropical drinks seem appropriate.Music was on point- they played fun old school hip hop and top 40s which was so fun to sing along to. I liked their eccentric and random decoration and quotes on the walls, it was quite entertaining. On a Saturday night, it wasn't packed but all the seats were constantly taken. The crowd was young and overall it's a chill place to grab a drink with just one friend or a big group. Would definitely come back if I was in the area.",1,1,1
185,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,2.0,11/17/2014,"What a weird fucking place.  I came here based on a coworker's suggestion after dinner on a date, and quite frankly I have no idea why she recommended this place.  Located in the basement of a building with a surfing theme, Reunion is pretty random.  Technically it's a cocktail bar (as listed on Yelp) because it does specialize in cocktails, but it's far too casual to call it a cocktail bar in the conventional sense.  Think of a frattish, kind of dirty looking bar.  The crowd is also a bit rowdier which is given that it fits the mold.  I just want to frame others expectations as mine definitely weren't.Drinks weren't bad but not as cheap as you'd expect for a place like this.  My blood and sand was a bit light on the scotch and was ~$15.  That's way high for this kind of atmosphere.  I'd recommend going to the small room with tables on the right unless you want to get banged into a bunch and spill your shit.  This place might be good to visit with co-workers who like to get belligerent but I'm not sure what it's good for otherwise.  Not my cup of tea.",9,2,

I emailed back and forth with someone named Nina, who was very patient with me (I had a lot of questions). She explained that they would be able to set aside an area that could fit about 20 people standing, called the ""peninsula."" It's a corner of the bar, basically, but it was great because: 1) you weren't separated from the rest of the bar 2) you had a great spot at the bar and 3) everyone could open their own tab. All they needed for the reservation was my name and phone number! I really loved their drinks as well - the Mermaid was amazing (who doesn't love frozen drinks??), the Zombie was potent, and the punch bowls were served in adorable glass pitchers decorated with palm trees and colorful twisty straws. I was told the tacos were delicious (a friend ordered some), and the totchos were AMAZING. It's a generous serving too - definitely a dish and not an appetizer.The happy hour deals looked great, and if I moved back to Hells Kitchen I would make this place a regular spot.",,,

Makes you feel like you're on a beach. They have a $5 happy menu. I had the Surfer Girl and the Acid Drop. The latter was not my favorite since it has grapefruit in it. Meh. Surfer Girl was awesome though. Like an adult orange soda. Great option for the Midtown area.",2,1,

It's more than just your typical dive bar. It has a cool-relaxed vibe with a (I think) hipster-esque crowd. There's tv's all around with images and videos of people surfing. They play good music and have a low-light ambiance.Also! They have neat drinks. You know... your average prices for any NYC bar. If you're worried about prices def go during happy hour.

I'm glad to say I wasn't at all disappointed! It wasn't overly crowded on a Saturday night which was good. Plenty of space for a group of about 10 people. I got the Surfer Girl cocktail which was fairly strong; good thing since the cocktails are on the higher end of the NYC price range ($12-14). They play really good music and there was plenty of space to start your own dance group :) They have tables, too, if you're looking to just eat or drink. It's not super loud either so you can still have a conversation. I like the surf bar theme and it's downstairs so you can take off your coat and pretend like it's summer even in the winter! ;) I'll definitely be back here to try more.",1,,

Hell's Kitchen has many bars but most are too noisy, too crowded and/or too small. When you go to Reunion, you enter and go down a set of stairs to a nice open area. The ambience is good & the music isn't too loud. The crowd is young and upscale. They have a nice selection of frozen drinks but the cocktails are diluted. Would return here for non-alcoholic drinks. As far as meeting people, you'll find mostly couples and groups here. Doesn't strike me as a singles bar. The female to male ratio is heavily female. Saw lots of women hanging out together in groups. No man was brave enough to approach them. Probably because the drinks were too weak.",,1,

I reached out to them prior to secure space (last minute) and they replied promptly that they were pretty full but recommended we show up when they open (5:30pm); fair. We showed up early and waited by the door before they opened. One of the hostesses working there literally hit my friend with door and told her to ""watch out."" It continues... They then proceeded to forcibly card my nearly 50 year old boss and would not let him in until he showed state ID. When I see how flustered he became and asked what the problem was - one of the hostesses gave me a rant about how they need to do this so if the cops show up they will not be get in trouble. Right. (Yet some girl in front of us did not have any ID and they let her in) Thankfully we had some seating. We got settled and our waitress (the saving grace!) was amazing. She was as attentive as she could be and allowed us to be as difficult as a large group could be. The bar is dim, super cool (for midtown at least) and has a very decent happy hour. If you sit at the tables you must get table service, which might be faster that grabbing a drink at the bar as the place is not large. However, the drinks/apps we had were all good and I was happy with our server. I would come back with a small group as the place got quite crowded. This would have been 4 stars for sure but the hostesses were absolutely horrible and should be put elsewhere.",,,

What is this sorcery?!)But now I get it. Reunion is great because it's all the fun of a *dive bar* without actually being a *dive bar.* In other words, it's not creepy and the service is great. It doesn't hurt that the bartenders are dressed like they just hit the surf! The cocktails are strong and delicious.

196,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,4.0,7/23/2014,"Happy hour is from 5:30 to 8. If you want a table, try to get there before 6 - but even then, don't expect any bar seating. It starts getting PACKED around 6:30 but around 7:30, it starts clearing out - which is weird, since happy hour isn't even over yet by that time..If you're like me and are not really a fan of cocktails (I'm more of a beer kind of gal - or as my cousin so kindly put it...a 'beer snob' - even though I don't think that's true!) and don't really like their happy hour beer options, stick with the acid drop cocktail (vodka, grapefruit juice, and a vanilla sugar rim). This was probably the strongest and least sweet out of all of them.I also had the Mermaid, which is basically a mojito. It was bitter. But not in that good strong alcohol way (yes, I realize how much of an alchy this makes me sound....) but in the biting into a lime peel way.Tried my friend's Surfer Girl, which is some variation of a screwdriver with orange soda. A tad sweet for my taste.But alas, I just couldn't stay away from the beer. I had the IPA and I wish I hadn't. It tasted like a gym sock. Seriously - stick to the the acid drop. And of course, you can never go wrong with a Longboard.As for food, we ordered the totchos and the fish tacos. The tacos were good. Nothing outstanding - just your average fried frozen fish. The totchos were disgusting. But I mean disgusting in a 'so-good-but-I-really-shouldn't-be-eating-this-junk' kind of way - like it was cheesy, sour creamy, guacamole-y, chili-y in its own disgustingly glorious way.

Obsessed with it actually.  The honey lavender rum  was delightful  as well.  The  bartender was so nice and helped me get acquainted with the house made rum.

I must say, I absolutely *loved* the ""frozen Corona"" and would definitely come back for one in the future. The ""surfer girl"" wasn't great and I'd probably avoid it. The ""zombie"" was really good - it was marked as a doubly strong drink, so I wasn't bothered by its failed attempt to mask not-so-great booze. The atmosphere is really cool and everything was reasonably priced. I'm a little confused by their claim to be a ""French surfer bar"" since I didn't really catch anything French (and they have things like Mexican street corn on the menu) but oh well. Overall, it's a fun place to be and I think it'd work well with a big group, as well.",,,
