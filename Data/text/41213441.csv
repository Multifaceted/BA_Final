0,Natasha L.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,18,6,5.0,8/28/2018,"Boise Tea Parlor is everything you can want in a tea room. It is quaint, spacious, affordable, and serves a wide selection of teas. The staff is helpful and would never rush you. A great place to have a quiet day with your friend(s) and chat with some tea.I've also tried their Chef's tea service. It was absolutely delicious and beautiful. You do have to book 48 hours in advance (Any other tea service is not required) but they will gladly accommodate you. This will always be my go to tea room. I really wish you can find a tea room like this in Brooklyn. Downside: Because they give their customers such a wonderful experience, those on the waiting list cannot wait in the parlor. This place gets very packed and you have to search elsewhere to wait for a seat.",4,,
1,Vanessa S.,"New York, NY",1014,594,811,1.0,9/27/2018,"While the Afternoon tea was great and the food was alright for such a location, what really bothered me was that the waitress straight up lied to us about getting our teapots refilled after we finished it. We weren't asking for a new flavors but asking for more water since we were a group of 8 people and everyone wanted to try everyone else's teas. So when our pots became empty the waitress came back to us saying oh you cannot get a refill on your tea at all and it will cost extra. When in the beginning we specifically asked her can we get FREE refills once we run out of water and she stated few times yes and that we cannot change flavors.Welp maybe if you come here alone and want one single small pot serving of tea this is the place for you... otherwise don't come as a group and beware of lying staff.",4,,
2,Nichol G.,"New York, NY",108,3,0,1.0,9/4/2018,"I'm posting a 1 star because of how unprofessional and inappropriate they handled the situation the day I was there. I've been in this industry for 8yrs so I know exactly how things should operate.I wanted to celebrate my birthday for the first time at a restaurant just like this, I heard nothing but good things. I called a week ahead to reserve a table for 6-8 people but he explained to me in order to hold a reservation I must put a deposit down for each person and they can only choose from a specific menu. I told him I'd prefer my guests to choose from whatever we want so if we walk in as a group on Sunday would that be OK and he said yes. The day comes, I called ahead AGAIN to confirm my guests will be arriving before me and to have them under reservation name Nichol. By the time everyone sat at the table I'd say an hour had gone by. He repeated that we can only order from a specific menu so I went over it with him again but he assumed we were a reservation that had put down a deposit. So basically he mixed us up even though I called twice and told him my name! He asked us to get up after more than half of us ordered drinks already and to wait. The place is so small there is no waiting inside and all tables were taken. So I asked him how can we be accommodated since we've been here for an hour and it was his fault he made the mistake, he literally said ""Well if you're not willing to wait I'm going to have to ask you to leave."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing and I wasn't even hearing it from a manager or owner it was still the server Ben. All of us were so surprised at his response he quickly apologized, explained the other reservation was waiting for the table, and offered us to take our drinks for free. We immediately left. The most embarrassing situation I have ever experienced at a restaurant in my life and I don't get embarrassed easily whatsoever. I'd appreciate it if the owner or manager would contact me to personally apologize for the mix up and inappropriate actions that were made. Definitely not suitable for groups obviously they can't organize properly.",3,6,
3,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",202,215,342,4.0,9/2/2018,So happy that I chose to try my first tea room experience here. So four of us shared the tea package for two as it had so many desserts. We clearly wouldn't have been able to eat all of that. Great that atleast they were flexible on letting us order the two package for four people. U get to choose sandwiches out from their menu and we mostly loved all of them- the egg salad was nice. The cucumber one too. The cheese sandwich with pickle was mehhh... I personally liked their cookies and Cannot go wrong with Madeline's. Their macrons are soft and they have diff flavors. Their tea collection is just superb as they keep a wide variety. We got this exclusive white tea and then the other one that changes it's color from blue to purple when u add some lime to it.Overall I recommend this place!!!,2,2,2
4,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",484,663,591,3.0,11/4/2018,"I was so excited to come here! My friends and I came after work for some tea. They have a huge extensive tea menu and a pot of tea is pretty reasonable. We started getting hungry so we decided to munch on a few things before heading to dinner. We ordered the earl grey crepe cake and the 3-cheese plate. Tiny must be a theme with the food because both items we received were very small portions. The earl grey crepe cake was delicious, but again, wish I had more of it. The cheese plate was just so small. It wouldn't even fill a rabbit! We each had like two bites and the plate was done. I recommend coming here for tea, but definitely not food.",1,,
5,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,8/28/2018,"Perfect Tea-Party! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice high tea experience. They serve this till 9 pm so it doesn't necessarily have to be in afternoon. We ordered the tea for 2 and shared between 4 people. It gives you decent amount of food and can easily be shared. We ordered the butterfly tea(not exactly sure of the name, but this is the color changing tea, which turns pink once you put lemon in it). Its a flower based tea with all natural ingredients, no added color. Has a very subtle taste. The second tea was a white tea called needle dust. In terms of flavor we definitely preferred this one more. Unfortunately, they were out of some of the macrons at the time and hence i couldn't try them all, but from the ones I had my favorite was the cheesecake flavor. The scones are pretty good and loved the raspberry sauce on them. Reminded me of my childhood memories of having freshly made jams! As for the sandwiches we really liked the salmon and cucumber sandwiches the most! Their service is really good. Our server was very sweet, highly attentive and helped us with all recommendations and suggestions. You can not get a prettier and perfect tea experience, especially for this price elsewhere.!",6,,4
6,Alan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,681,3400,4.0,8/14/2018,"I have never experienced a tea parlor place before. It was quite a unique and fun experience for me. Got the tea service for 2. You get 2 cup pot of tea, 2 mini scones with cream and jam, 3 portions of tea sandwiches, 2 mini tea cakes, and 2 macarons. The teas are refreshing, soothing, and top quality teas. All the food I can eat in like 1 or 2 bites, but they were good quality well made bit size food. I love the presentation of the tea service. It made the experience really fun and unique. Who doesn't want to spend an afternoon just chatting over tea and bite size food.",1,,
7,Taylor A.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",269,11,0,5.0,11/19/2018,"I absolutely love afternoon tea and this has been one of my favorite finds in the city. While it isn't necessarily the most traditional British afternoon tea, this is one of the only places that serves actual authentic clotted cream. The scones are amazing, the sandwiches are fresh and tasty and you're going to actually be full when you leave. I'm not a huge macaroon fan, but these are too good to pass up. Highly recommend!",,,
8,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,161,158,3.0,8/27/2018,"Bosie Tea Parlour is decorated as a small, cozy room for patrons to sip their tea and enjoy the quaint ambiance. However, both times I've stopped by, it's always crowded and really loud. It might be because I came during weekend afternoons, but I left earlier than I would have liked because of the noise level. The tea service was adequate and I appreciated the wide range of tea sandwiches available. However, the one of the sandwiches I ordered had slightly soggy bread, which suggests it had been sitting out for a while. I love afternoon tea and I love the understated homey elegance of Bosie but I feel they have fallen short of my expectations in recent years.",3,1,2
9,Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",800,2687,266,4.0,8/22/2018,"A small and very charming tea room, my wife and I made this our final stop on our recent NYC trip.We made advance reservations for their Chef's Tea Service that includes a variety of canapes (savory sandwiches and bites) in addition to the tea, champagne and sweets.  Everything tasted great, especially the buttery scones and chocolate eclair.Would definitely come back!",2,,
10,Anvita S.,"Manhattan, NY",362,251,644,5.0,3/25/2018,"By far my favorite tea shop in the city. $66 tea for 2 people is an awesome price, and you get your money's worth of delicious tea and pastries.The tea menu is extensive, with options I haven't seen before. We tried chocolate hazelnut and almond with caramel and absolutely loved them. Food wise, the scones steal the show. They were warm, buttery and melt in your mouth good. Also really liked the lemon macaroon and chicken curry sandwich.",14,5,17
11,Novella N.,"New York, NY",5,71,58,5.0,10/22/2018,Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We had to wait a little bit to be seated but so worth it! The Prix fix brunch hit the spot.,1,,
12,Miki N.,"New York, NY",39,41,442,5.0,5/12/2018,"This is a hidden gem.My most favorite tea place in the city.When you enter this tea place, great tea aroma is welcoming you.They have a huge variety of tea selections and offer an  afternoon tea service.I love their caramel earl gray tea, milk and honey on the side from the black tea selection. Organic Honey bush from the herbal tea section.Their organic rooibos tea is excellent as well.",1,,1
13,Tulina S.,"Chesterfield, MO",40,130,512,4.0,3/20/2018,"Mommy daughters tea party is a quintessential NY experience for me. We chose Bosie for all the good reviews on Yelp and were not disappointed!The tea service for 2 was $66  ( reasonable by NY standards). Each person could pick one tea, some sandwiches and macaroons. Scones with clotted cream and jam and Tea cakes, cookies are standard.While I enjoyed all the sandwiches and cookies, the scones are the stars here.Served warm, fresh and yummy!We added an order of Darjeeling tart which had a hint of tea flavor- loved it. Taking off 1/2 star for lack of interesting China and not so quaint ambiance.Must say the selection of teas, pastries and macaroons makes this my favorite tea place yet!Ambiance-4Food-5Service-5Overall-4.5",5,,2
14,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,1273,1201,5.0,8/4/2018,"I am obsessed with tea parlors. I love afternoon tea service just so very much. I decided to treat myself for my birthday and come here for afternoon tea service. Boise Tea Parlor is tucked away on Morton St in the West Village. I came around 1:30PM on a Thursday and the place was fairly full. It is so quaint and cute inside; exactly what you would want a tea parlor to be. I decided to sit at the bar since I was alone and didn't want to take up table space for other customers. There is an extensive tea menu that is broken up into different types of teas to make it easier to find what you are looking for. I chose the early grey creme and order the tea service for one. You can also get tea service with champagne but I refrained because I had to go back to work. You get to choose which types of sandwiches you would like as well as what macarons you would like to get. They had plenty of vegetarian options for the sandwiches, which I was pleased to see.The tea is put on a timer to make sure it is steeped properly before coming to you. Everything came out very quickly even though the place was pretty full and there was only one server there for lunch time (poor server!). everything was absolutely delectable. The sandwiches were adorable and delicious; crusts off. Everything was fresh in them which was lovely and appreciated. The scones were absolutely to die for. They just melted in your mouth. They were creamy and buttery and just incredible. The clotted creme was wonderful and fresh raspberry jam was given with them as well. The cookie selection (in addition to the macarons) were unreal. They had delicious favor and were rich and lovely. The macarons were tasty and delicious but a little too sweet for my taste. I feel that way about most macarons though. They just tend to be very sweet.This lived up to all of my hopes a dreams for afternoon tea service. The service was incredible and the food and tea were amazing. I loved this place just so very much.",1,,1
15,Claire H.,"New York, NY",312,156,224,5.0,2/5/2018,"Tucked away in one of those confusing but adorable West Village alleys is this gem. Although it seems like the portions are dainty, and you won't be full from ""tea and biscuits"", that's just simply not the case. I would advise you come not ravenous, but with an appetite. A few food things really worth getting here (basically all the things we ordered):-FRENCH TOAST!!!!!! Probably the best French toast I've had to date. Three slices of brioche cooked in a lightly sweetened, vanilla studded custard served with fresh blueberries and strawberries. It's soft but not soggy- and you don't feel heavy or gross after eating it. You really don't need the maple syrup. We ordered it pre-fixe and it was accompanied with a lovely almond croissant, pot of tea, and orange juice.-Salmon Benedict (butchering the name)- the eggs were poached beautifully, and I loved the fresh and lemony, tossed arugula it came with. Again, this was ordered pre-fixe and it came with a fresh chocolate croissant, pot of tea, and elderflower sparkling thing. -Tea tower, I guess you really can't come here without getting this. For starters, it's absolutely beautiful to look at. The scones, for me, surprisingly stole the show. They were warm, tender but with a loose crumb, and a served with clotted cream and strawberry preserves. I came with two others, and we actually ended up packing up half the tea tower to go. I don't think I need to mention this, but they have a kick ass selection of teas. And you can purchase them as well. ($6 for a small tin- a great souvenir for someone who's visiting NYC!) Additionally, I've been here previously and had some pastries. They are on the same level as Lauduree (though eerily similar).. so if you're feeling indulgent, be sure to finish off your carb-heavy tea sesh with one of those.",4,1,3
16,Alicia T.,"Edison, NJ",64,34,39,4.0,7/15/2018,"Came here yesterday after my yoga class to meet my friend.We ordered Boise tea set for two people - a small tea pot per person ( any tea that are 6-7$ are consider standard tea selections, anything that are more than that are extra price) -3 sandwich choices per person ( for both of us, we just got one of each 6 flavors they have)- 2 macaroon flavor per person ( I got pistachio, salted caramel and he got lemon praline and earl grey)- some pastries and scones Total was around 70 dollars ( not include tips)Overall it's a quite decent place. Wait time is like 5 mins. Service is really nice, they keep filling my water. I finished my tea, I got Kyoto rose green, I thought It was really nice, I really enjoyed it. We were there about 3 hrs, we just had a lot of talk about lol and kind forgot about the time. Staff there are very kind, so We didn't feel being rushed or any complains. Scones for our plates are to die for. My friend loves their sandwiches. I think they are ok but I loved their scones, and cookies. Macaroons are ok. Would totally come back again! Love it",2,,
17,Diane K.,"New York, NY",216,108,702,4.0,1/12/2018,"Neat little afternoon tea place, actually...it covers all kinds of meals. They have brunch, dessert, a bar (mostly wine), and it opens until 10pm. You don't see that often but hey, you can get a cup of tea anytime of the day as you wish! The main downside of the restaurant is it's a bit small. The bar can sit 6 people and there is about 6 tables total with only 2 4-people tables (obviously can be moved around for bigger party) You can only make a reservation for a bigger party, of 6 or more. So I recommend you going in with no more than 4 people. Four of us ordered a Bosie Tea Service for Two ($66) and 2 more pastries. We were all planning to eat a big dinner so the portions were pretty good. The sandwiches filled us up. They have six kinds and you have the choice of trying all 6 or pick the same flavor more than once - flexible. The scones were really delicious with the jams. They were made fresh because they fell apart when you cut into them. The macarons were okay, nothing special but they do offer many flavors (they pick the flavors for your Tea Service). The pastries we ordered aside from the Tea Service for two stood out much more: earl grey mille crepe was really creamy and if love earl grey, you would enjoy it. It's probably one of their popular pastries to try. Personally, the winner went to the Darjeeling tart. But between the four girls, it was 50/50 for the two pastries. The Darjeeling tart had a full, solid taste of the black tea. That flavor just couldn't get off my pallet. It's almost like you are drinking a cup of Darjeeling. The only comment for the piece was the bottom crust of the tart was a bit hard, too crunchy, not preferred to all the 4 of us.",4,1,2
18,Ellen F.,"Las Vegas, NV",459,173,685,4.0,5/31/2018,"Having the ability to order a ""high tea"" to go is pretty awesome in my book! We ordered tea sandwiches and scones to go. They had our order ready in about 10 minutes.Loved the sandwiches. They were exactly what one would expect from a high end tea house at a really reasonable price.  The scones were good but not a fan of the triangle size.  We prefer the traditional ""biscuit"" style scone that you can separate and turn into a bomb ass scone with clotted cream and jam.  These tasted good but were maybe a little bit dry.  The jam was excellent as was the tiny little bit of clotted cream.  Could have used more than what we got.This place is really cute on the inside and the staff is SO friendly and accommodating.  Love that they open at 9:00 in the morn too! Will be trying this place one more time before we head back to Vegas.",10,6,10
19,Jenny N.,"New York, NY",178,200,342,2.0,11/23/2017,"Cute environment that's ideal for hosting private events. The food and service could be better. Value wise, for hi tea lovers, it's a must try but honestly not worth the value. When I came in, I asked for a table for two. The waitress offered me the bar instead of telling me how long for a table for two. Then another party of two came in and I watched as she sat them at a table. Keep in mind no reservations, then during the time I was there. I watched her give other parties tables. Not worth the 20 percent tip I gave her. I found her to be rude.Anyways, I wanted to leave but decided to give it a chance since I was meeting a friend here. My friend and I did the tea for two. I got the salmon sandwich, chicken sandwich and crab sandwich. Daejing tea and earl grey macaroon along with a pot of cherry green tea. Chicken sandwich- I like the curry flavors, just not fond of finding a chicken bone fragment in thereThe salmon sandwich - the bread was dry and awful. Crab sandwich - was too salty the macaroons were most redeeming part of the service. I will not be returning again.",15,,
20,Esmira J.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",3,89,187,5.0,6/24/2018,"Came in one evening  after diner and after we unfortunately went to Milk(which was gross!), so we needed something to wash the flavors off of our pallet. Bosie was lucky open late and not full, so we went for it. The host and waiter was pretty great, he immediately put some tables together and made the space for us. We each ordered our own Small Chamomile tea, one Island White, and one one small Summer something. Each had amazing fresh flavors, they were so relaxing and the small portion was large enough and very filling. It was after 10 pm so I wasn't surprised that they were sold out of some of the macaroons. But the waiter suggested son alternates and we went for it. 6 for $17 when you get the half box. Both of my original choices were sold out so both the  Vanilla Cheesecake and the Passion fruit something were the waiters suggestions and absolutely amazing. The macaroons still tasted so fresh, so soft and full of flavors even though it was past 10pm! My sister really enjoyed the the matcha and pistachio flavors. All in all, I'll deff be back to try the rest of the menus.",1,,
21,Fatima L.,"New York, NY",20,173,1340,5.0,5/28/2018,"The paris-brest is so good. The pastries are perfect, light, fluffy, and not cloyingly sweet. The mille-crepe is quite good as well. The atmosphere is lovely, jazz plays softly in the background and the chairs are comfortable and plushy. The cappuccino is excellent and the waitress and quick and attentive. I was able to eat my pastries, drink my coffee and linger for a good hour afterwards. There's no rush to kick you out. Perfect place in the West village to have brunch or high tea.",4,1,2
22,Lisa E.,"Westbury, NY",472,488,1815,4.0,5/19/2018,"Attentive service, cute idea .... go if someone else is footing the bill !!! Reviews from others are accurate. I was not impressed w the tea at all. It should arrive hotter in the pot and mine special green tea was lacking any personality... and the tea had already been strained from the pot, not allowing for a longer steep... our waiter was excellent. The tiny tea sandwiches had a mere shmeer.... hey, for 33 bucks a person, plus a slight up charge for the. Ran and salmon, they could be a bit heftier. And I have never understood the whole cucumber on white bread thing... is it a leftover reminder of war torn days ?The scones, as frequently mentioned, were the hit. That's because they resembled scone shaped butter cookies, plump and warm, more so than a dry scone. Studded with pretzel salt like sugar, they were amazing. The little Madeline's, not so much. The macarons were pretty but incredibly sweet, fillings creme like instead of a clearer fruit, very good but sweet. I was really surprised that the bathroom was so plain. Perhaps some English garden wallpaper, decorative mirror and cutsie hand soap dispenser to carry the tea party theme into the powder room.Walk around the corner to Twelve Chairs on MacDougal to see a great little village bathroom.I agree about the set up of the tables and the less than comfortable chairs.. again, the theme and quaintness could be amplified here as well.There aren't that many quaint lady party places to celebrate special lady occasions and this is definitely one of them.",6,1,3

There were two 4 people table the whole time I was there and they were turning away some parties. My party had to sit at the bar and because we got the tea service for 2 it was a bit of challenge  to fit everything in front of us. Otherwise the service was pretty good and the tea recommendations were outstanding. The food was okay, nothing too special, but definitely tasty. Stop by for a pot of good tea and some yummy fingers foods if you are in the area. Their chicken breast and the cheddar sandwiches are delightful. The macaroons are bit too sweet, and the scones were perfect. The  rasberry jam was crazy good, but the cream was just okay. I personally hated all matcha products, but if you like matcha I suppose it's good.They do take reservation for 6 or more people, or if you are doing the chef's special.",2,,

Think light tea with a hint of chocolate flavor but not the richness from a hot chocolate. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for something different.My friend got the raspberry tea. Tasted very fruity.Didn't try any of the foods or the tea tower finger foods but it looked good. Maybe I'll come back when I feel fancy to do high tea!,,,

The sandwiches and macaroons were lovely and varitable. The scones were super fluffy and buttery. Can't go wrong with clotted creme and jam on a warm scone!

The tea also comes with shortbread and scones. Absolutely loved all the sandwiches except for the crab, which was too strong for me. The macaroons were good too though nothing special.

The crust was made of scones, the cheesecake filling was so light and creamy and the strawberry rhubarb topping was absolutely divine. We had the cheese tea sandwiches and they were absolutely delicious. I loved the onion jam they put on it. I wasn't a huge fan of the egg salad. It was just a little on the bland side. The crab salad sandwiches were also delicious. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were able to secure a table within 20 minutes. Service was very friendly. It was a very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon. I wish we had tried to tea but it was 90+ degrees outside so a bit too hot for tea unfortunately. I absolutely would return",,,

Although it was a shame there was very loud construction going on right outside, I barely noticed it during the tea because the Boise Tea for Two took my breath away! First of all, they have a very extensive menu for tea. It was quite a mental ordeal to choose--but the ones we did end up choosing (a variety of oolong and green tea) were wonderful. I'm sure whichever tea you end up choosing would also be a great choice.As for the tea sandwiches, we tried one of each flavor. I absolutely loved the crab sandwich and the cucumber sandwich. The salmon one wasn't as good as I'd hoped. The rest were fine, and starting with the sandwiches might have been a bad idea because it filled us right up. We didn't even have lunch and already I was satisfied. The scones were also very good as well as the macarons (although the day I went they didn't have a lot of flavors I actually wanted to order). The cakes were a little too heavy and sweet for my taste, but I can see the appeal. I would love to be back one day--maybe I'll save up for the special tea service that requires a 24 hour reservation.",4,1,1

We put our name down to wait for a table, but it took longer than the quoted 50 minutes, so we finally settled and took the spot at the counter. I ordered the Bosie tea service and thought it would be awkward to have a tiered stand on the limited counter space, but it didn't come on a traditional tiered stand. Instead, it came on a tray and it looked pathetic. Sandwiches were soggy and not good. Scone was dry. Cookies were old. I wasn't allowed to choose the macaron flavors. Both tasted old.

37,Heidi W.,"New York, NY",229,108,12,4.0,7/30/2017,"Parisian inspired cafe with an unpretentious flair in the West Village. I don't really venture in this neighborhood but I'd surely come back for the tea and pastry experience. My party of two (myself and friend) shared the Darjeeling tart, Paris-Brest pastry, and small pot of tea in Milk Oolong. No reservation made on a late Saturday afternoon and we were automatically seated upon entrance. I'm always down for anything that's tea-flavored so the Darjeeling tart was an easy decision. Not sure if there were any artificial ingredients but it tasted pretty smokey and true to the Darjeeling tea flavor. It was also nice to see some tea leaves embedded with some caramelized sugar layered on top of the creme pastry. Hands down, I would get this again in a heartbeat. The Paris-Brest pastry was a balanced pastry of praline creme and dough. Not too sweet and heavy - complementing the smooth profile of the Milk Oolong tea. My goodness - the tea deserves its own paragraph of praise and rainbow confetti. So let me proceed below! I've been on a frantic hunt for the Mariage Frere's tea in Milky Blue. It's difficult to find this brand in the states - being that this line is usually imported straight from France and custom fees aren't exactly low for international shipment. I was pretty defeated after realizing that Dean and Deluca's is the only shop that sells selected MF teas - excluding the Milky Blue line. Super understandable situation so I kind of just forgot about this altogether and went on my merry way of life UNTIL I saw Milk Oolong on the tea menu here at Bosie's. There was no way that I'd skip out on that so I tried it and boy, it tasted very similar and even almost stronger than MF's Milky Blue. Get this - you can also buy loose tea leaves from their wide variety of flavors on the shelves. No surprise that I ended up getting a 4 oz. cannister of the Milk Oolong!I look forward to trying the Chef's Tea Service for my next visit. Review will be updated soon!",,1,

You get your own 3 level tier with sandwiches and desserts!! Their scones were fresh and so fluffy. Comes with clotted cream and a berry jam which made it even better. Tea service was great.Table setup was exactly what we expected. FYI: for big parties more than 10 make reservations ahead of time and confirm or make changes 2 hours prior. For no shows they do change a $15 fee. But they will hold your table for a two hour table reservation. We got there 30Minutes late because of horrible weather conditions and they held our table however time was not extended. It was still 2 hours.

We decided to order a bunch of things off the menu instead. I got the caramel tea which was not bad, but I recommend the earl grey creme instead because it tastes better. To be honest, the small pot has so much tea in it that it should be more than enough for two people. I would recommend coming here for the desserts and tea rather that for lunch items. The sandwiches were pretty bland and the croissants weren't heated up or anything. I only enjoyed the clotted cream and raspberry jam. The cheddar scone was really dry!

Updated review","YUM. This place will satisfy any frenchie's home-sickness or a francophile's deepest desires. The desserts here are the closest I've found to the real thing. The paris brest is absolutely incredible, the service was great, and the decor was beautiful and detailed to perfection! The Paris Brest was absolutely phenomenal. Even better than some patisseries in Paris in my opinion. Absolutely exquisite. Before coming to this place, for some reason I imagined a much fancier setup in my mind. I guess similar to la duree. I guess it works because it is quite similar to a french patisserie, however I would really love it to be a little more upscale, at least the interior. I also never imagined how tiny the place was. But these aren't complaints. We had an excellent experience and highly recommend. The service was also lovely!",,,

Each sandwich tasted delicious and refreshing.For macarons, we picked Vanilla Cheesecake, Milk Chocolate Passion Fruit, Rose, and Raspberry Yuzu. Each macaron had great taste and texture. The Raspberry Yuzu had pink glitter all over it, it was so cute! For their choice of desserts, we received green tea cake, lemon cake, 2 chocolate cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

However, due to the lack of space/waiting area our host rudely, so very rudely, informed us we couldn't wait inside but instead have to go outside and wait. Ummm it's pouring rain outside and you want us to wait outside when you saw that we had no umbrellas? There's no one else waiting inside but you couldn't accommodate 3 people waiting to high tea it up at your establishment?

I still paid an additional $34 in taxes and tips making my total service $106 which is not bad value, but something I would not do again. The chef's tea service included two separate services: The first which includes small canapes (dinky sandwiches) with your choice of a tea and scones. I only enjoyed the slice of duck on toast and the farmer egg truffle canape. The crab sandwich one wasn't really good and we left most of it uneaten. Each person gets 12 canapes and the only variety we finished was the duck toast. The scones on the other hand was super BUTTERY and flakey that I LOVED. Couldn't stop eating it!The second service was a glass of campaign with your choice of pastry where we selected the passionfruit cheesecake and the tea time which were pretty good but too filling at this point. We also had four macarons and tea cakes that we were unable to finish. This experience was great but I definitely liked my tea experience in the England more.

Updated review","Loved the unpretentious vibe of this tea parlor in West Village.  They have an extensive list of teas - ranging from earl greg, black, roobios, green, and herbal!  I want to try them all!  My friend and I got the Dorian Gray which had a smooth taste with hints of caramel flavor at the end.  The color was a beautiful, rich hue of toasted almonds and it was served in a simple white porcelain tea set.  For dessert, we shared a raspberry gluten free mousse tart that had fresh raspberries that were perfectly sweet and tart.  Our wait staff was attentive and helpful with deciding which tea to go with and we almost stayed until closing time and they offered free pastries for me and my two other friends. The simple things in life should be enjoyed more often.  Definitely stop by for tea and dessert.",1,,

66,Tiffanie Q.,"New York, NY",422,63,9,3.0,1/21/2018,"I stopped by here for afternoon tea/brunch and it was decent. I usually get the afternoon tea here which is a steal for afternoon tea, but quite expensive for what it actually is, as all afternoon teas are. This time, I opted for the brunch pre-fixe which was $24.50 and included: a pot of tea, a brunch entree, a glass of OJ, and a breakfast pastry of your choice.The tea: great creme earl grey! I love earl grey and this one was super smooth, really liked it.Brunch Entree: I had the breakfast sandwich on a croissant. It was a fried egg with avocado and a sundried tomato spread. It was just okay, I which there was more sundried tomato spread because everything else was kind of bland. I love avocado, but there was almost too much avocado in this, I which it was sliced thinner/ had some salt and pepper and some chili flakes on it.OJ: tasted fresh, nothing to write about really Breakfast Pastry: I got the blueberry scone with clotted cream and jam. I was kind of disappointed by the scone because I expected it to be more fluffy/moist with blueberries inside, but it tasted stale and only have a small slathering of blueberry jam on top. But the clotted cream and jam were good, so the scone was okay in the end. Overall, Bosie's is always a good deal if you want some afternoon tea if you're in the West Village area but I have had better.",,2,1

The pitcher of peach ice tea was about $8, croissant was $3, mille crepe was $7 and the elderflower was $5. The croissant was a good size but it was a little hard. It doesn't feel fresh. While I didn't taste the crepe, I feel that the portion size was too small for that price. The drinks were normal, nothing spectacular. Overall, place was too expensive. I do not recommend.

68,Becca H.,"Hartford, CT",197,142,164,4.0,11/26/2016,"We stopped here for an early morning cup of tea to start our weekend off right. It was definitely the ideal place for a relaxing morning spent catching up with an old friend. They open early, but when we arrived around 10am we had the whole place to ourselves. We situated ourselves in the comfy armchairs located in the back of the shop. It was quiet and secluded enough that we were able to continue our private conversations even after the crowds arrived. We ended up sharing the Tea for One option ($34). Although the do have a Tea for Two option ($64) for those who want more of a whole brunch experience. The Tea for One comes with 3 tea sandwiches (cut in half), two scones, two macarons, a slice of matcha cake, and a small tea pot (we paid a bit extra for the large). For the tea, we ordered a large pot of the Almond Cookie Rooibos tea. The large pot was just the right amount for the two of us. The Almond Cookie Rooibos was extremely fragrant and smelled exactly as the name would imply. For the sandwiches you can choose between 4 types, but there are also 2 special options for $1 extra. We opted for the Chicken Curry, Cucumber, and Egg Salad sandwiches. The Chicken was probably my favorite because it was so flavorful and came on a tasty grain bread. The scones were simple and classic, but absolutely delicious served with cream and jam. They were the best part of the platter in my opinion. For the macaron (they have 10+ flavors), I chose the Raspberry Dark Chocolate which was a raspberry flavor on the outside and filled with dark chocolate. The matcha cake that came with the platter was also good and not too sweet. Overall it was a bit pricey to enjoy a pot of tea, but it was a fun experience. How often do you get to indulge in tea parties anyways? I'd definitely come back to enjoy their tea and snacks again.",2,1,1

76,Acinom W.,"Brooklyn, NY",78,88,182,5.0,3/22/2017,"I generally love tea parlors and macarons. Bosie is intimate and perfect for couples or a small group of friends to chat and enjoy desserts under a warmly lit atmosphere. The services here are very welcoming and their menu is extensive. They are open early in the morning and end late around 11 pm, but their pastries are baked daily. They sometimes give away their pastries such as scones and etc to customers near closing time. If anyone loves a wide selection of teas and desserts, Bosie is your local little French cafe. I made a recent second visit here with my friends and I finally got to try their ispahan and it is slightly like Laduree's, but definitely worth the price. Also their macarons are definitely cheaper than majority of places I know, $2.50 individually, but they have mostly tea flavors. Like always, anything rose hits a soft spot for me.Bosie's tea selections are sectioned off in types and I don't believe they offer you cream/milk/sugar to add/adjust. However they all smell delicious. Some of them are faintly hinted in the tea, but it gets better as you drink it. The tea cups are kind of large, but the small tea pot holds a little more than 3-5 cups of tea. The large pot is good for groups to share because it can probably hold 10 cups of tea. Sometimes their desserts are sold out before evening even hits. However, it gets very crowded and busy after 6-7pm. Lastly, their bathroom is very clean and kind of tightly spaced. It's gender friendly though, but lines do form.",11,9,9

The pre-fix tea service menu was really filling - half of our group had to pack the rest of our food to go!Seating is limited. They only take reservations for parties more than 6. Great place to catch up with friends or have dessert in the area.",4,,2

Based on previous reviews, I thought we would have a long wait ahead of us (did not make a reservation since we didn't have 6 people) but was surprised that they seated us immediately when we got there (around 11am on Sunday).Our group got two of the Tea Service for two and it was extremely good and surprisingly really filling. You EACH get to choose your own stuff (I thought we'd have to split) so I went with the egg salad, cheddar, and chicken sandwiches, pistachio and passion fruit-milk chocolate (I highly recommend it) macarons, and the apple crumble tea.The sandwiches were good for the most part (didn't really like the cheddar cheese sandwiches - it had some weird spread that I didn't really like) and the macarons were perfect. The tea was refreshing and light, naturally sweet so I didn't have to add any extra sugar (and I tend to like my teas sweeeet). It came with other cookies, cakes and scones with clotted cream and raspberry jam.LOVE LOVE LOVED the scones. I'm definitely come back the next time I'm in NY",3,1,

I suggest putting milk and sugar to get rid of any bitterness. Putting milk is a British thing to do!My friend got a fruity white tea, it was divine and flagrant. It swirls up your nose. LEVEL 1Each person gets to chose 3 sandwiches of their choice (Cucumber Dill, Curried Chicken, Egg Salad, Cheddar w/ sweet jam) It comes in halves too, so it seems like you're getting 12 pieces in the Tea service for 2.

The savoriness of the cheese and sweet jam pairing is something I would return for! I wish I could have tasted more flavor from the others, like a punch of flavor.

83,Ashish D.,"Manhattan, NY",56,195,254,4.0,4/15/2017,"One of my favorite tea places in the city. The number of teas they offer just blows my mind. Among all the tea places I have been to their collection is the most well curated. I absolutely love their milk Olong, in fact you can't go wrong with any of their Olongs. Also they have some pretty amazing Black tea, the one from Assam is my favorite. This is a small place, 10 tables maybe, I don't think it's great for groups of more than 4. In the night this place transforms into a little wine bar. They also throw parties which seems to be nicely done. They asked us to stay for a birthday party and enjoy the free pastries and sandwiches on one of the evenings.Their scones are sublime. My favorite has to the simple plain scone. They also have soups, sandwiches and macaroons which are all really tasty. If you are hungry and in the mood, you can do the tea service at 34$ a pop, it doesn't come cheap but they do give you a lot of food. The service is  friendly and they know their teas. It's one of the better, less touristy tea places in Manhattan with an amazing variety of teas and a pretty perfect scone.",2,,

From the time my daughter and I arrived until we left, the staff was friendly and accommodating.  We were warmly greeted and seated right away.  The hostess must have read our minds, because she offered us the table we wanted as soon as it became available.   We had the tea for two which came with mini scones,  mini Madeleines, cookies,  French Macaroons, finger sandwiches and two small pots of tea.  Everything was scrumptious-except for the curried chicken salad sandwiches, they tasted a little weird.  But the crab salad more than compensated for it!  The tea selection is voluminous and superb!  I enjoyed my Tulsi, while my daughter loved het Dorian Grey.   We were so full when we left that we had to take a walk in the drizzly weather to digest it all.  If you are in NYC and looking to sit down for tea, stop in to Bosie's Tea Parlor.",1,,1

86,Anne B.,"New York, NY",0,3,5,5.0,2/7/2018,"I've visited Bosie Tea Parlor a few times and I always enjoy the service along with the incredible variety of teas.  It's tucked away on a quiet street in the West Village and its a hidden gem.  The interior decor reminds of what you would find in Europe, with relaxing wood finishes and pleasant accouterments without being ostentatious.  I'm always on the search for places that are low key and have the New York vibe from maybe a decade ago before things became trendy and stark. I've spoken with the manager Jessica a few times and she is delightful.  We discuss Paris since she is from France and I reminisce about my favorite locals in Europe.  She always gives me a nice table or sometimes I sit at the bar and chat with the other servers. As for the tea selection itself the menu is extensive.  Especially since I've spent some time in England I really appreciate the variety of high caliber teas. The pastries are also amazing. Bosie has one of the best pastry chefs in the nation so you can't go wrong.  The macaroons in particular are very unique and tasty.  You can also do a full tea service but this isn't necessary should you not be in the mood.  Just stroll over, have a tea and a croissant... and relax, enjoy!",,,

Updated review","I visited Bosie yesterday for the first time and cannot wait to return. I've been trying to find a tea house that isn't outrageously priced, and Bosie gives you an amazing bang for your buck. I got a small pot of tea and 3 macarons, and that ended up being about $15.The tea I got was delicious; it was called Tropical Forest and was a green tea with pineapple and mango. It was light and refreshing, and I enjoyed it so much that I bought a large canister! It was also the perfect temperature.I had somehow never had macarons until yesterday, and I am really glad I made Bosie my first. I had the matcha, lemon praline, and raspberry dark chocolate and they were phenomenal. I plan on trying to go back next week when my mom is in town, and definitely will be trying more flavors.The staff were all very kind, and were very apologetic about an error with cards (my friends and I split the bill, and the confusion was totally my fault). They don't take reservations for groups smaller than 6 which kind of sucks (at least on Saturdays; not sure about the rest of the time), but it's understandable since it's a small space. There may be a long wait time. Possible patrons were unnecessarily rude to staff members when they were told the wait time (""are you for real? Are you effing joking?""), and it seriously made me want to throw my tea on them. But it was too yummy, and not worth wasting. But really people, don't be rude!!",,1,
88,Kavita S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",26,5,0,2.0,5/8/2018,"This rating is not based on the food.  Food and tea were really good.  This is based on how my friends and I were treated when we went to the tea parlor. About two weeks ago, we went to Bosie for the first time and saw the parlor was closed for a bridal shower. A sign on the door said the parlor would reopen about an hr and a half after we got there. We were really excited to try the food and tea at Bosie, so we didn't mind walking around for a bit and coming back later. My friends and I came back 30 minutes before the parlor reopened and were the first ones there as the staff finished cleaning up. About 20 minutes later other people started to come and started forming a line behind us. We were the first ones lined up by the door. When the resturant opened an employee opened the door, glanced at my friends and I, turned to the right and asked the people behind us how many people were in their party.  She eventually took everyone (even those without reservations) before us.  I completely understand someone with reservations being seated before us but majority did not have any. She didn't even bother to ask if we had a reservation. By the time she did get to us, she told us there were no more tables,  we had to sit at the bar, which was not the best experience. We all felt completely ignored for no reason by that employee. We were too hungry by that point so we stayed and our waiter was fine.  I was completely disappointed with the treatment my friends and I received at bosie tea parlor. I hope that if this situation should occur again in the future to someone else it is addressed differently and with more regard for the customers. I will not be returning.",1,,
89,Karen H.,"New York, NY",12,220,450,3.0,4/12/2017,"The place was quiet and cute, with friendly service. It's a good option to sit and chat, with a large selection of teas. We had a peach one and cherry rose one. For four girls, I think one large pot would've been enough. We also had the lemon tart, a chocolate cake, and Mille crepe cake. The desserts were a bit pricey for the size. They also were just average. However, we still enjoyed ourselves.",1,,
90,Maya E.,"Manhattan, NY",287,80,60,3.0,3/14/2018,"My friend and I came here for afternoon tea. We had the afternoon tea service for two ($66) which came with a pot of tea, 3 sandwiches, 3 Macarons, a tea pastry, and 2 scones (served with butter and jam) per person. I ordered the crab, egg salad, and cheddar sandwiches. All were average and the Macarons and tea cakes were average as well. The scones were probably the best part of the service. They were tasty and paired well with the clotted cream and jam. I am not a big tea fan, so I picked the Dorian Grey tea which was fine. Overall the food and service was pretty average but prices were fair. We considered $33 per person a pretty good deal compared to other afternoon tea offerings around the city. The ambiance was very cozy and intimate and we were seated in the back which made the dining experience pleasant. The crowd was quiet and we stuck around for 5 hours or so until 11pm without being bothered. I would return again for the dining experience mainly.",2,,

We had the basic Bosie tea service for two and it was fabulous! The macaroons are delicious, and the sandwiches are tasty, except the smoked salmon was too salty and I don't quite prefer the cheddar cheese one. The tea cakes are good for me, but for those who can't take sweets you might need to drink a lot of water. The scones are great as well!",,,
92,Sarah A.,"Manhattan, NY",15,83,80,4.0,4/3/2017,"Visited on a Monday during the late morning so the place wasn't busy. I went with two other people and we decided to order a la carte although the tea service platter sounded tempting because it would've been so much food and we were eyeing the pastries. We had six sandwich triangles, two scones and three pastries and one large and small pot of tea. We ordered the smoked salmon, cucumber, and chicken breast sandwiches, a cheddar scone, a blueberry scone, a chocolate croissant, the earl gray crepe cake, and the hazelnut pastry. The sandwiches are all very light but with everything we ordered we were full. I would highly recommend the earl grey creme tea and the scones with clotted cream and jam, the cream and jam alone would make me go back, it was so good. The hazelnut pastry was my favorite because I love hazelnut anything. Try this place out, it was a pleasant experience.",1,,

Most of us were sitted for over 30 minutes and already ordered tea when the server comes and tells us you actually dont have a reservation i'm gonna need you to leave. We asked if we could have a minute to figure out where to go and he said that we had to leave now. That was very embarrasing. I'm working hospitality for years and I never saw that... That is so bad!

94,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,4.0,1/21/2017,"Bosie is very, for lack of a better word, cute. In the world of teahouses, it's a little less in-your-face girly than Alice's Tea Cup with more of an emphasis on sitting back and sipping some chai. I also want to note that, in keeping with my general trend of refusing to order what a place is most known for, neither me nor my lunch mates ordered the tea service. There's a small menu of brunch items, ranging from the standard eggs Benedict to avocado toast to overnight oats to granola. Which I ordered. And ate with too much honey and wild abandon. What can I say? I love a good granola. The two small pots of tea we ordered were also delicious - any place that offers Almond Cookie Rooibos tea gets an automatic win from me. Nutty with a hint of marzipan. I took my cup with a healthy splash of almond milk and three packets of sugar. Didn't get to try the Apple Crumble. My stupid phone shut down after I wasted a good five minutes trying to find the tea parlor and the waitress was sweet enough to charge it during the duration of the meal. Will definitely be back to try the full tea service!",4,2,4

My friend added almond milk to his and complimented it as well. We ordered the Cobb salad panini and kale avocado salad which were both delicious. I could hear the crunch from his panini very loudly. My salad was a little overdressed but the dressing is fairly light so it didn't overwhelm the salad. We came for a light dinner and warm tea on a breezy evening, and were very pleased! Will definitely come back to try the other teas despite the prices being a little steep.",,,

98,Lew L.,"New York, NY",0,22,14,5.0,7/14/2017,"My boyfriend and I had reservations for the Chef's Tea Service.  The teashop is well-appointed and cozy.  Kara greeted us with a genuine smile and a ""spring in her step"".  We perused the Tea Menu of 100+ loose-leaf organic teas from around the world.  Flavors are hand-blended by resident Tea Master, Kiley Holliday (the youngest female certified tea master in America).  I chose Darjeeling Blue, and he selected Kyoto Cherry green tea.  All the teas are stored in copper-colored tins, and you're invited to smell each before choosing.  Teapots come in two sizes: small & large.  Even the small teapot offers a few cup-fulls.  Tea is steeped at precise temperatures/durations, depending on the leaf.When making your reservation, French pastry chef, Damien Herrgott--who worked at Ladurée in Paris and for Pierre Hermé--asks about food allergies, but the canapés and scones are pre-chosen by him.  However, you are invited to choose your pastries and macarons when you arrive.  Everything is made in-house!  I ordered a Black Currant Violet Almandine tart, and he ordered the Darjeeling tart.  (I'll try their Paris-Brest on my next visit!)  Given the option, we decided to have our champagne when the dessert arrived.  I appreciated how the food came out in courses.  Clotted cream (sweet and lovely on the tongue) & raspberry preserves accompanied our sugar scones.  The chef made four types of bread for the first course: scones, wheat puffs (filled with crabmeat), white bread puffs (filled with egg salad, topped by shaved truffles), and brioche toasts (with cold duck breast atop).  After the table was cleared, we heard the pop of champagne (Vouvray from Loire Valley), and our chilled flutes arrived, bursting with bubbles.  A bite of my pastry revealed luscious colors: blueberry, violet specs, and buttery crust.  The whole experience was so lovely, and we were attended to so warmly.  In the background, we heard ""regulars"" arrive for their tea and espresso, chatting with the baristas.Before we left, we chose some Viennoiseries: a Croffin (croissant made in a muffin tin, filled with cream) and a Canelé.  We also ordered a small tin of White Peach tea.  The aroma is unbelievable.  For $6.00, you also get a handsome double-lidded tin!  We will definitely be back many times!",6,,

The menu had a great mix of entrees and small plates, making it a great place to come for any time of the day. The tea menu was extensive and the herbal tea pot I got was perfect!We didn't make a reservation, which was probably my one regret about the experience.

101,Taufiq R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",234,1,0,1.0,1/8/2018,"In my 20 years in the city this was the single worst experience in terms of service in New York. What would Stephanie Tanner say? ""How rude?"" I feel like they should have used their tea at the Boston Tea Party all those years ago. In fact I wouldn't come back for all the tea in England or China or both. It may have been below freezing outside but it was even chillier inside. Someone got up not just on the wrong side of the bed this morning but likely slept in someone else's bed and didn't even get any sleep. Maybe the rudeness stemmed from the fact that I was Brown and not White. Who knows what was going on but apparently not much in the restaurant. At this empty place closing in 40 minutes apparently sitting at one of the many tables that were there was too much as maybe all of a sudden contrary to the rules of physics a dozen groups of four were going to walk in at that moment. But half of the tables for 2 were also off limits. Once we finally could sit Taking our coats off required someone to hover over us impatiently. The piece de resistance was a scolding about a laptop in a case underneath a scarf, a jacket and two pairs of gloves: ""just so you know we don't allow laptops on the table."" From the moment we walked in to the moment we left it was as if we were not wanted. I know that even on my best days I'm not much to look at. But this hurt my self esteem. The only thing I wish upon the staff is two spoons of sugar so that may just be a bit sweeter rather than bitter in their service the next time.

So you can only imagine my excitement when I heard NYC had tea parlors and what better occasion than to celebrate my best friends birthday in NYC sipping foreign teas and eating yummy bakery items. This tea shop is owned by an English man of Indian descent and the baker is French (so you bet you have the best of the best). I got the 'Tea Service for 2' which costs about $65. This service includes two pots of tea (each person picks a tea and the menu says each pot is two cups but definitely felt like more); 2 macaroons each; 2 scones each (served with house-made raspberry jam and a heavy cream- I imagine these change with the season); 6 sandwiches each (there are 6 on the menu, try all of them), dark chocolate cookies, sugar cookies, and 2 sweet breads. ITS A LOT. We had run 8 miles that morning and this service sufficed as a meal that kept us full for the entire day (but of course when you are in NYC you can never stop eating). For the tea, I'd highly recommend the jasmine green tea, I could feel it cleansing my body and the aroma was wonderful. For the macaroons, you MUST try the raspberry Yuzu, lemon praline, and salted caramel. The scones were amazing- super soft like they should be just like a sweet biscuit. The raspberry jam was to die for I wanted to lick the cute little jar empty- THAT GOOD. as for the sandwiches, my favorite was the chicken breast with raisin, smoked salmon, and cucumber sandwich.

It was pretty hard to tell what the three different gold ones were (one with speckles, one with sparkles, and one plain).  Also, ask for a few more stickers on your box to hold them together.  I went to lift mine out of the bag and they went flying everywhere.",3,,

I came mostly for the desserts, pastries, and because I saw cute pictures on my friends' social media. But my favorite part about this place, besides my girl friend who came here with me, was the assortment of teas. The Tea Service for Two was $64 ($32 per person). Each person can choose 3 sandwiches, 2 macaroon flavors, and 1 pot of tea. It didn't look like a lot of food, but was actually quite filling! The sandwiches were some of the most unique-tasting sandwiches I have ever had. The macaroons and scones were also delicious! I ordered the Almond-Cookie Rooibos Tea and my friend ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut Black Tea. Both teas were very unique and delicious, and I didn't even need to add milk or sugar.

It's a perfect place to unwind yourself after a long stressful day. You can come alone or with friends, no pressure. They have a huge selection of teas, a lot of them are from Asia..definitely ask them for recommendation if you're overwhelmed by the choices. They are so passionate on what they're doing, it really shows. Small teapot runs for $6 and the large runs for $10. As for the pastries, I gotta say, it's SO good!

I wish there were leaves in the tea pot for refilling options. Other than that- the sandwich options were great- chutney and cheese, chicken salad, Cucumber butter, salmon and cheese and crab salad- different option than other places but tasty and studded w capers. The scones were warm, crumbly and light. Perfect scones. My other slight complaint was that the clotted cream and rasp jam portions were tiny.There are delicious pastries, endless options of macaroons and sandwiches on the menu- so if you're not interested in afternoon tea- there are other options.

The macrons were good and the environment was so warm and inviting!",,,

The service was excellent and the tea service was scrumptious! We indulged in savory little sandwiches, yummy pastries, macarons, and delicious scones with custard and raspberry jam.  Was also here about a year ago for Mother's Day and had a great experience then too. Definitely recommend this place for afternoon tea!",2,,
117,Lila H.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,338,1552,2.0,11/20/2015,I went for tea time and was disappointed.They sat us right next to the bathroom which wasn't the best seating option.The sandwiches were mediocre at best and the egg salad sandwich tasted a little funny to me.The scones were ok.The desserts are usually the best part but at Bosie they didn't taste fresh and weren't that great.We go to a lot of tea times and this was probably my least favorite one that I've been to.,6,1,2

119,Ali E.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,8/12/2018,Worst customer service ever I have seen in NYC. We were almost dismissed after wanting to table from bar. This happened in the quitest time of the week and when most of the tables were available. It was counted how long we sat and it was so rude to hear we could go out and did not come again if we were not happy with this situation. No reasoning could be done and said only the company policy. It was the worst time I felt myself bad with my family and as a customer who had already ordered many things by that time.,,,
120,Sanam A.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,21,0,4.0,10/8/2017,"Stopped by for afternoon tea with my mom, and we had a good time. I liked the quaint interior - very no fuss without being boring. I also appreciated that they allow individual tea selection as opposed to sharing a pot during the tea service. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with the tea itself. I forgot to mention that I prefer my tea strong, so the first cup was weak and not all that enjoyable. However, our server was great and quickly brewed us a fresh pot. The tea service for 2 included three sandwiches  (loved those!), macarons (several flavors were unavailable, and they were a little dry), cookies and tea cakes (also dry), and scones with clotted cream and raspberry jam (which were DELICIOUS). Bonus points for those yummy scones.",,,
121,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",19,338,213,4.0,2/22/2016,"I came for tea service a year ago and I like that it's available for walk-in (except the Chef's Tea Service menu). I also like that the ambiance is casual and modern instead of frilly or theme-based. We went on a bitter cold winter weekday afternoon, so it was pretty quiet. We picked a table in the back with winged chairs which felt cozy.We had the Bosie Tea Service for two for under $65. We each got to pick our own choice of tea sandwiches, tea cakes, and macarons. I feel like Bosie allows each guest to choose much more of their tea service menu instead of offering fixed items or requiring all guests to pick the same choice. I thought Bosie's flexibility was a plus.There was a lot of food and the price is less than other tea salons. Three sandwich choices for one person and each choice came with 2 large triangles which I find unusual for tea service. Flavors tasted as expected except the crab sandwich. Unfortunately the crab tasted mushy and watery so I wouldn't recommend. The tea cakes were dense and too sweet for my personal taste. Macarons had several choices with some interesting flavors. I don't remember all the ones we had except Bacon-Maple which wasn't overpowering.I found their tea selection interesting. Some typical flavors, but they have a type of tea that I had not seen before. Had the Kyoto cherry green tea which was light and not sweet.My only complaint is that the bill included an extra $1 charge for each smoked salmon & crab sandwich we picked which I did not see explained on the menu (and is not in their online menu). I knew that premium teas were an extra charge, but extra sandwich charges were not  obviously stated, if at all.Despite the surprise charge, the Bosie Tea Service is a good value for the price and I would recommend trying this place.",1,,

She was very helpful in helping us pick out which tea to get.I ended up getting the strawberry tea (i believe) and the tea sandwich platter. I got the salmon which is $1 extra and the curry chicken one.It is surprisingly filling. The sandwiches were so delicious!! I will come back to try their tea service!!,1,1,1
123,Marissa M.,"South Hempstead, NY",627,521,1428,5.0,9/27/2015,"For months I have been researching tea rooms and venues to host a 30th Tea party. I wouldve never imagined Bosie would be the choice. I wanted a tea service that provided a gourmet dining experience with vintage flair. I scored big at Bosie.From the time I made my reservation, I was impressed with the impeccable manner staff handles customer inquiries. I booked my Tea for 11:30 a.m. and that was a great suggestion for my party of 7. We arrived on time and our table was nearest the counter and entrance door. Bosie is a very small West Village parlor. Simple dark wood furniture. Seating is tight but expected. Ben our host and waiter made us feel welcomeand and went above and beyond to provide impeccable service.We had a choice of a plethora of teas. 60 different kinds i believe. All listed in a cute red book. We each chose 7 different teas: Apple crumble, island light, toasted coconut, almond (many I cant remember). The teas were perfect for a chilly fall sunday morning. We requested an assortment of sandwiches: cranberried curry chicken, smoked salmon, cucumber, tuna, crab. All delicious but my favorite being the smoked salmon. The Macaroons here melt in your mouth. Delicious! The Raspberry Yuzu was amazing! The Scones and fresh clotted cream and jam was addicting!I dont recommend parties over 7 here because of how small the parlor is. My group fit comfortably thanks to Ben. I will be back again soon. The quality of the food and service was all i could ask for for my birthday wish.",11,3,6

Updated review","The best tea place in the whole New York. If you're like me, a tea devotee, this is the place to go. The only downside is that the sweets are really not that tasty (sorry guys, i know and hope you're reading). Thank God I dont eat sugar. I would also say its quite pricey, but for the quality of the tea they have here - its justified.",,,
128,Venkat S.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",1,7,0,5.0,1/9/2018,"Must-try little place if you are ever near Greenwich Village. They have some of the best french deserts and viennoiseries, and macroons.. plus a good variety of lunch and dinner entrees.. and also a great selection of teas. Its amazing how they packed so much into this little place! We went early in the evening so it was too early for dinner. So we ordered teas (comes in those cute little tea kettles), almond croissant, cannele, a lemon tart for dessert and a couple of macroons. Everything was super awesome. Special call-out to the lemon tart which was out of the world! Smooth custard topped with Italian meringue and encased in the perfect crust - it was amazing how something as little as a hockey puck could have so much flavor and texture! Will surely be back to try more of the selections from its expansive menu.",,,1

I had never heard of this place but was pleasantly surprised to find it so lovely. The tea sandwiches were delicious - fresh, soft bread and several types to choose from, all very good. The scones were perfectly crumbly and everything was carefully prepared and fresh. Our server Ben was so thoughtful - he even came running after us out the street to bring us something we left behind. This is not a fancy hotel tea place; it is smaller, charming and on a quieter street. I intend on returning soon.",,,
130,Rubi S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,40,5.0,6/27/2018,"This is our daughters first trip to NYC and on the top of their list of things to do was to experience High Tea and see a Broadway show.  After searching and researching BEST PLACES IN NEW YORK to have High Tea service I decided on The Bosie. I was a bit torn at first between wanting a fancy table setting place in a high end hotel or getting a great food experience. In the end I chose letting the food be the highlight and we were not disappointed. First, the price for 2 Tea Service cannot be beat...$66 and it includes A TON of food. All of it delicious. We each got to choose 3 different sandwiches and 2 flavors of macaroons. We ordered the chicken curry, cucumber cream cheese, egg salad, and cheddar sandwiches. Big triangular portions! We each got 2 large triangles of each type of sandwich. Our macaroons were chocolate, vanilla, and passion fruit. Melt in your mouth goodness. Plus it came with each of us getting 2 buttery melt-in-your-mouth hands down THE BEST scone on the planet, clotted cream, raspberry jam, madeleines, and cookies. Each person gets their own pot of tea. My girls ordered white peach tea, apple berry tea, and I ordered a chocolate chai latte. My husband did not order tea service but did have the Chicken Roulade and he cleaned his plate. We ate until we were stuffed and still had leftovers. Plus my girls were made to feel extra special with a birthday macaroon and candle on top. Our service was TOP NOTCH and the ambiance and staff were wonderful. In the end the food and atmosphere is what my girls will remember, not the fancy tea set. I'm so glad we came. This will definitely be a must each and every time we return to NYC. Thank you Bosie.",,,

Sandwiches were tiny but after eating them plus macarons and scones you will be glad they are indeed finger sandwiches! When I started this review I only had given Bosie 4 stars, I now decided to give this place 5 stars. Why? Because it's not the establishment's fault that the weird kitchen guy keeps peering out the swinging door window like a creeper. Also, I'm taller than the rest of my group so they didn't suffer from knocking their knees against the wall when they were using the restroom. TMI? My apologies, but consider it a public service announcement for those who are 5'8"" and taller!!",1,1,

133,Andrea L.,"Cambridge, MA",13,89,202,5.0,7/10/2016,"Best afternoon tea experience I've ever had!! Located in a cute neighborhood in West Village, the inside of this tea parlor is quaint/rustic - perfect for a date or ""girls' afternoon."" We were able to walk in on Sunday at ~1:45 pm and got seated at the bar, but the next party of 2 after us had a 1.5 hr wait..so plan to come early!Pretty reasonable price at $34pp, $64 for two. You get to choose 3 types of sandwiches PER PERSON, so my recommendation is to just get all 6 (you get 2 of each). Faves - the crab and the egg salad. For tea, we loved the Earl Grey Creme.You also get to choose 2 macaroon flavors each - none stood out, but all were good. Honestly would have given 4.5 stars since the scones were undercooked in the center - but overall positive experience and would def come again!",6,,
134,Elena F.,"Anchorage, AK",56,80,395,4.0,8/26/2016,"One of NYC unique tea houses, Bosie Tea Parlor has a unique and varied variety of different loose leaf tea's & delicious desserts. The atmosphere has a very bookish/literary feel to it. They're named for the lover/friend of novelist/writer, Oscar Wilde. If you're looking for a special, quiet lunch spot or a place to have afternoon tea service, I recommend them. Their desserts are among the most tasty I've had in NYC. My favorite dessert of theirs is the Ispahan, which is essentially a giant rose macron with rose petals. They also have these green matcha-like sponge tea cakes that are absolutely divine! They're tucked behind Morton St in the West Village. It's kind of a quiet area, which is good if you're looking for a quiet spot for lunch or dinner. The staff and bakers deserve major kudos for the good service I received while visiting here on a regular basis. In my humble opinion, they have the best herbal tisane tea's in NYC. I recommend their Tibetan Lavender.",2,,1

138,Tyler B.,"Pacifica, CA",3,21,7,5.0,7/26/2017,Bosie Tea Parlor was a wonderful place for a mid-afternoon respite.  It was not large but they managed to accommodate seven of us at the bar. The desserts were incredible. I had the rose macaroon with raspberry and lychee and a green tea. Both went together superbly and were just right for a between meal snack/pick me up. Bites of other people's desserts proved just as delicious. Another place in New York that I wish I lived closer to so I could enjoy its deliciousness more often.,,,

The atmosphere wasn't as fancy-schmancy as I had imagined but rather relaxed casual. Tea service for two costs $64 before tax and tips. This includes two pots of tea and an array of savory sandwiches, mini tea cakes, scones, and macaroons. You're able to select from a diverse selection of loose leaf teas and they even offer seasonal blended teas. For the most part, everything from the tea tray platter was delightful especially the warm scones with clotted cream and jam. Not to mention, teas and other sweet treats are also available for retail sale. I would certainly return again and indulge on the tea service. If you plan on coming squad deep, I'd recommend making reservations since the space is limited.",3,2,3
140,Louise M.,"Cranford, NJ",197,230,31,4.0,9/14/2016,"Strolled in here with my sister at 7:30pm on a Tuesday, and it was *empty* (so if you're looking for a good time to come in without a wait, here ya go!) People started to trickle in a little bit closer to 8, small groups and dates and such. It is a very cute and cozy date spot. It's also a bar but you wouldn't know it, since it's SO quiet. Anyway, we had:-  a large pot of Fujian white tea ($12) - which tasted like water, don't get this unless you like that sort of thing- earl grey mill crepe ($6) - so good, definitely my favorite dessert here, but so small! my sister joked around that we should send it back- ispahan ($7.5) - ok, another fave (can you have two favorites?!) if you don't know what an ispahan is, it is essentially a large rose-flavored macaron, but instead of the usual buttercreme filling, it is filled with pieces of lychee, a very light raspberry crème, and fresh raspberries. All of the above was a great post-dessert dessert (yes, we had dessert 2x that evening. actually 3x but that's beside the point). Light, refreshing, and not overly-sweet. Service was a little lackluster at first, but picked up a bit when our group got larger (our friends joined us after a half hour). Also, the location itself is very easy to miss at night. The dim lighting doesn't allow you to easily identify it from either corner of Morton St., so take care!",1,,1

Not sure if she woke up on the wrong side of the bed or what, but either way I'd strongly recommend that she take some lessons in customer service. When I arrived she mentioned the no laptop policy and then asked ""do you still want to stay?"" How about ""laptops aren't allowed on the weekends but we still invite you to enjoy our wonderful tea bar"". I also thought she should have immediately suggested the tea/champagne service given the amount of items I ordered, but she didn't. When I left -- no thank you or goodbye.",2,,
146,Christina L.,"Ithaca, NY",179,93,114,3.0,5/12/2016,"A bunch of my friends have been to Bosie's and said wonderful things about the spot, so I decided to come here with my family for Mother's Day brunch. I set up a reservation 3 weeks in advance anticipating it booking up. They have an interesting reservation policy - you can change your reservation up to 24 hours prior to coming, but for every person that does not show up, there is a $15 fee per person. I can understand that since it IS NYC after all and they have a small space, so it would be terribly rude to take up space from another person's reservation. Additionally, they have a 6 person minimum for reservations, which to me was a bit annoying because I was originally going to only come with my sister and mother and I wanted to play it safe and have a reservation.Regardless, the day comes and when we arrived we were seated right away, even though one of the people in our party was late. I greatly appreciated that. Three of us ordered the tea party and they were willing to make an exception for us and allow the rest of the party to order regular brunch entrees. Our waitress was great at giving us suggestions for types of teas we would like. My grandfather, the only male in the group, enjoyed his tea very much and he is a traditional tea drinking Chinese machine.Service = I would give 4.5 stars. Food was honestly, quite average. My sister, cousin and I shared a 3 person tea party special and we got their chicken salad, egg salad, cucumber and smoked salmon sandwiches. We had dark chocolate, rose, jasmine and matcha macaroons. The chicken salad sandwiches were lovely - the others were quite average. Macaroons were also fairly mediocre. The other pastries were fine but they did not seem all that fresh to me.At around 12:30pm, the waitress came over and told us they had a reservation coming in and even though she was fairly polite about it, it did make me antsy and uncomfortable. Otherwise, like I said the service was wonderful, decor very nice, neat and clean but the food was subpar, especially given the price we paid for it. I think this would be a cute location for a small bridal shower, but otherwise, I'm not sure I would return. Regardless, i am glad my Mom enjoyed her brunch entree (she got the breakfast sandwich) and some tea - that's what matters!",6,,

Scones, finger sandwiches, a wide variety of black, green, and oolong tea- what's not to love?My best friend brought me to this quaint tea parlor after begging me to come with her all summer. Let me say: I'm glad I obliged. The place was quiet at 6:30 on a Tuesday, just what I needed after a long day at work. Although the quinoa and quiches did spark my interest, I heeded her suggestion and got the meal for two, which came with 3 finger sandwiches each, 2 macaroons each, 4 small scones, cookies, tea cakes, and your choice of tea.I ordered the matcha latte for my tea of choice, which was slightly bitter and could have been warmer, but was still pleasant and came in a large portion size. For my sandwiches, I opted for the cheddar cheese, the egg salad, and the crab sandwich, all of which were good, but the cheddar was my favorite, and I could've done without the crab which tasted a bit stale. For my macaroons, I got the earl grey milk chocolate and the matcha, and the matcha was definitely my preference of the two- it was extra strong for all you matcha lovers like myself! The best part of the meal, which I'm sure others can attest to, was the soft scone with jam and butter. The scone was filling and sweet and I would definitely come back and get one for breakfast, especially the one topped with chai and sugar! The service here was incredibly friendly and attentive. I never had to flag anyone down and I felt like I had known our server for years based on our dynamic. Note: they no longer serve the matcha eclair here.

155,Jamie R.,"New York, NY",7,110,60,1.0,11/14/2017,"I had the afternoon tea here and there was nothing really good about any of the food. Everything seemed to have an old and not fresh taste. The sandwiches were so-so..we had the egg, salmon & curry chicken salad. The bread on the sandwiches seemed a bit old & stale. The cakes, especially the lemon cake tasted old, and the scones were hard (and definitely not the traditional English scones), and the clotted cream was not that great either. I had the black lychee tea and even that was ok. The only thing I liked were the macaroons (had the rose & green tea). Definitely not worth the price for below average food.",,,
156,Anna Z.,"New York, NY",73,68,28,3.0,2/9/2017,"Went with a friend and got the $64 tea service for twoService: 4 stars, friendly and not pushyFood: 3 starsScones: these were the standout, not dry at all and went so well with the clotted cream and jamSandwiches: I went with the salmon, egg salad and curry chicken. I liked the salmon one the most, followed by curry chicken. Felt extremely meh and unimpressed with the egg salad sandwich, didn't feel at all unique or upscale to me (for the price tag).Cookies/Macarons: They didn't have some of the Macaron flavors listed on the menu which was disappointing as I wanted to try the Jasmine (since that's not a flavor available at Laduree). Both my friend and I thought the cookies/cakes/macarons were overly sweet, and that really overwhelmed how delicate they should taste.One of the most disappointing parts of my experience was the tea, they strain it out for you so I did not get a chance to see the tea leaves I ordered. Not only that, but there's no chance of refills since they pre strain it, and the amount in the small pot does not last you throughout eating all the food. I also felt like the tea wasn't piping hot when I received it, and turned frankly lukewarm at best during the experience. As someone who loves tea and is Chinese, tea that is meant to be served hot should always be served hot not room temperature.I was impressed with their tea selection just not the actual execution/experience.Overall, for $64, I was not convinced that it was worth it. Definitely a cute thing to experience once, but other than the scones, I could put together a better tea service in my apt (making my own tea, sandwiches and sourcing macarons from Laduree). Sorry but don't think I'd be back.",2,,2

162,CC B.,"New York, NY",4,28,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"I had a similar experience as Connie's and it seems like this place does not care about customer experience or feedback. Came by Sunday afternoon without a reservation and was told the wait for 2 was about an hour. I was fine with that and stood next to an empty spot at the bar near the entrance to wait for my friend. There were three empty spots at the bar and I was not in anybody's way. In fact, the place was not completely filled and I was the only one standing waiting. After a few mins, the host marched over and asked me to wait outside in the cold as guests will be arriving to take the bar spots. I was completely taken aback and found the request to be absolutely unnecessary and downright rude. He could have waited until people actually arrived to ask me to go outside, or he could have invited me to stand inside near the bathroom. Nope, he kicked me to the curb.I honestly had better experience waiting at the DMV. Needless to say I'll never return.",3,,

165,Betsy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,0,5.0,12/9/2017,"What a treat!  Came across this place while looking for a quiet place for vegetarian-friendly dinner, and could not have made a better choice.  They serve an enormous variety of teas, including a long list of fascinating caffeine-free brews and tisanes.  Each of us tried a different tea, and all were wonderful.  The small pot is plenty for one person; the large pot serves three comfortably.Veggie burger (which I didn't order but my dining-mades did), pumpkin soup, and cauliflower mix were all top-notch comforting food on a chilly night, and all vegetarian/vegan to boot.  I especially recommend the cauliflower, which is mixed with a creamy vegan sauce and comes with a fresh, citrusy salad.  I was initially disappointed that the onion soup is meaty (using traditional beef broth) but that led me to an outstanding spicy pumpkin coconut soup that I wouldn't have tried otherwise.  We ended up staying until closing time, when the friendly waitress even sent us home with a few gratis pastries since new ones would be made in the morning!  Highly recommended.",,,
166,Ruby K.,"Oakland, CA",78,41,1,5.0,1/27/2016,"I was in town for about a week and needed a place to work remotely during the day. Generally if I'm out of the office I like to work from coffee shops, but I stumbled across this tea parlor with wifi (unusual) and am so glad I did! I returned 3 days in a row since I was staying nearby. The space: The interior is small but very nicely laid out. It feels cozy and inviting and well-maintained, with cushions on the chairs and even a couple of outlets on the wall. During the weekday there are plenty of tables available. They allowed me to stay for hours and work, which was very kind!The food/snacks: I tried the finger sandwiches, the french onion soup, and the Earl Grey crepe cake. The soup was solid. The finger sandwiches were disappointing, but I almost never like the sandwiches at tea places. However the Early Grey crepe cake is AMAZING. I don't usually like sweets, but I would come back here for the cake anytime. It has a distinct Early Grey tea taste so if you're not a fan of that flavor I'd steer clear, but if you are, you must try it. Also, I almost always find desserts to be excessively sweet, but this one was not at all. If you like a more muted sweetness, this will be perfect for you. The tea: A good sized small pot for $6 - very reasonable and more than enough for one person. Large for $10 - enough for 2 people. And the tea tasted very nice.",6,,2
167,Connie L.,"Washington, DC",14,16,5,1.0,12/19/2016,"Though I noted that most reviews were favorable and that is why I ventured to Bosie Tea Parlor, my experience at the parlor was totally disagreeable. Upon arriving, I was advised that there was an hour and one-half wait. We were to be a party of 4 and two of my friends had yet to arrive so I had no hesitation in putting my name on the list to wait the necessary time. As I stood waiting the host who had taken our name and phone number and placed it on the waiting list came to the corner where we were waiting and to tell us that if a customer needed the stool, where my daughter was sitting she would have to stop occupying the seat. Since it was in the far corner of the parlor and there was no lone customer the chance was nil but of course we understood and told the host as such. As I wait to be seated ( by this time we were 3), the same host came again to our corner to tell us that we could no longer wait for our seat inside the tea parlor that we would have to wait outside. This is when I had to point out that there was a party of 4 people waiting inside in front by the entrance and they were not being asked to leave why was my party of 3 who was away from the flow of traffic being singled out (twice mind you) and ALL of the other people waiting were never approached nor asked to wait outside in the cold. Another worker then chimed in and started arguing with my party and stated ""Just wait outside"" we would be called when a table opened up. As an individual who frequents many restaurants in a fair number of cities I have never been in an establishment with such poor customer service and contact ever until  Bosie's Tea Parlor.  For the record they never did call me to advise me that a table opened up. To all review readers I would simply add, if you want the true ambiance that high-Tea requires Bosie's is NOT the place where it would be found. Go to any other Tea Room for that.",7,,1

There are two menus that captured our attention: the tea menu and the dessert/pastries. We settled on a large pot of lychee black tea (if I can remember correctly) and ordered two desserts: the ispahan and a coffee flavor dessert (I can't recall the name).

I had the Tea Service for one and chose a caramel tea after asking my lovely server for a recommendation or two (I think her name was Jessica - who was SO awesome! Warm, friendly and checked on me often, my water glass was never empty and I felt very well-taken care of.).The food was very filling - Much more than I expected it to be, definitely a plus!!

177,Hiral D.,"Silver Spring, MD",203,151,141,5.0,2/3/2017,"This tea parlor is an amazing experience, whether it's with friends or for a more intimate outing. We came at 11 am on a Saturday and there was enough space. Everyone is super friendly and patient as we took forever in trying to decide which tea we wanted to try. We ended up being adventurous and trying the apple caramel and coconut and both were so relaxing and soothing. We decided to do a pre-fix lunch. For $23 you get a pot of tea of your choice, an entree, and a pastry but I believe this was for restaurant week. For $10 more, you could add a mimosa. Since it was my best friend's birthday, the mimosa was on the house. I ordered a breakfast egg sandwich on croissant which came with sun dried tomato, pesto and avocado and it was heavenly. I also ordered a blueberry scone with clotted cream and house made jam and it was soooooo good. I ate everything even though I was super full but I'd definitely go back as everything was beyond satisfying. It was a cute setting as well so definitely check this place out!",,,2

I went with two friends and we got the tea set for 2. It was very filling for 3 people. Each tea set comes with two choices of tea, sandwiches, scones, random cookies, two types of cakes and a few macaroons. I think my favorite thing from the whole tea set were the scones and jam. The macaroons were too sweet for my liking. Sandwiches tasted dry, but maybe that was because of the bread they used. The lemon cake was good, better than the green tea one and I didn't really think their cookies were that special. The tea set along with an extra tea came out to ~$35 per person with tax + tip...I was a little disappointed because I don't think it was that good for the amount we paid.Prepare for a 30 min to 1 hour wait because it's small and they don't have that many tables.

Updated review","Oh Bosie! Your Mini Vanilla Scones kept me thinking about them and I needed to have them, so I had to come back for Tea Service for One!This time, I got the Peach White Tea. I loved it! It was a very light tea with a pleasant aroma of peach. This is my new favorite blended tea.The scones were even better this time! They were fresh out of the oven and still hot when served. Scones are soft and fluffy on the inside. The clotted cream and homemade berry jam complemented the scones so well! My apricot macaron was so sweet and tasty, just like a kiss during a summertime sunset. On the savory side, the sandwiches are very gourmet tasting and filling. Smoked Salmon on Pumpernickel and Farmer's Egg Salad with Thyme Blossoms on Whole Wheat are my two favorite ones! Teacakes are still not my cup-of-tea in general, so I took home to people who truly knows how to appreciate them!Bosie is my favorite afternoon tea spot and my friends are now mad at me because this is my best kept secret hide-out that I did not bring anyone here yet. I guess it is time for me to spread the love!",8,1,4
180,Quoc L.,"Manhattan, NY",213,266,463,4.0,9/22/2014,"I give this place 4 pinkies up! 4 and a half really (imagine what that looks like).This place has quickly made its way on the map. THE MAP TO MY HEART! I came here twice to try out the notorious Earl Grey Crepe Cake; my first attempt was for naught when I found out the Crepe Cake usually runs out before 3pm. So ladies, you might want to consider dessert before lunch. This is America, you can have tea & sweets before lunch!My first time around, they had actually ran out of small pots & gave us an upgrade to large free of charge, woot woot. I remember having the Dragon Tears because how badass is a tea called Dragon Tears? A lot lighter than expected. It didn't have that peach flavor as described, which is great, because I hate peach flavored stuff. For desserts, we ordered the lemon tart and cheesecake. Pretty good, nothing to rave about... Better than Eileen's Cheesecake if you ask me, though. OH! Shot fired!My second time around, hoo hoo, I finally got the Earl Grey Cake. I actually finished it before my pot of tea. I even finished it before remembering to take a picture, sorry guys. Although, you might be disappointed to hear, it wasn't what I expected. *Gasp* I know. It kind of just tasted like a regular crepe with regular cream, no Earl Grey. The Earl of Grey himself would be flabbergasted! Tsk Tsk Tsk. I did however love the Dorian Grey Earl Grey Tea. I KNOW! There's a tea to raise your literature boners. Despite being bitter, it's incredibly smooth, with just a hint of chocolate. Forget whatever opinions you may have with chocolate and tea, this will do that combination justice.And remember gentlemen, pinkies up! That's a how classy man do.",4,6,3
181,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,8/29/2014,"I first stumbled into Bosie Tea Parlor late one evening after dinner almost a year back, but as we were only able to try a few offerings at the time, the experience was far from complete. The pastry chef behind many of the creations is none other than Damien Herrgott. Hergott, who hails from a family of French pastry chefs, is a protégé of Pierre Hermé, the mastermind behind the creations at Ladurée in Paris. When a friend of mine suggested a late lunch on a summer Friday, I knew Bosie would be the perfect spot.Bosie sits on a relatively quiet street in West Village. The interior is remniscent of a traditional French tearoom, with a countless number of large tea tins lining the walls. Seating usually isn't an issue, as there's a handful of tables for pairs or quartets, as well as stools against the counter, but be warned that lines can form during busier hours. The staff was kind enough to seat me while I waited for my friend, and were very sweet about asking to move us to another table when another party needed our seats later that afternoon.To start off, we decided to try the Apple Crumble Black Tea and the Iced Strawberry Green Tea. The former was served in a small teapot which we were able to pour for ourselves throughout the afternoon, and the black tea had a nice edge with a hint of apple aroma. I think I preferred the Iced Strawberry Green Tea, however, partially because it was a perfect beverage choice for the summer afternoon. The green tea was pretty light, and the additional strawberry flavor helped to mask some of the bitterness of the tea. I appreciated the fact that they serve their teas unsweetened, so guests can appreciate the subtleties in each sip.Bosie also offers a robust offering of savory bites and plates on their menu, so it's possible to enjoy a light meal here as well. My friend and I decided to share two dishes as we couldn't decide between the two, and they were brought out in short time. The Quiche Lorraine is on the smaller side, a minor complaint about the portion given how delicious it was . The egg and cheese filling was simultaneously fluffy and dense, and the richness from the addition of smoked Nueske bacon made for a tasty combination. The Chicken Cobb Panini took the ingredients typically found in a Cobb salad - egg, chicken, avocado, lettuce - and layered them between two slices of lightly toasted sourdough. The ratio of ingredients was just right and I enjoyed the hint of rosemary that was present in each bite.For dessert, we had to order the Earl Grey Mille Crêpe. I had gotten the mille crêpe on my first visit here, and had yet to forget it. The cake alternates roughly 10 or so crêpe layers with an earl gray-infused chantilly cream. The final finishing blow is the brûléed sugar on top, which adds an additional punch of sweetness and texture to an already exquisite creation. It's perfectly balanced, with just enough sweetness and earl grey flavor, and a light, citrus hint at the end of each forkful. The Lemon Tart paled only slightly in comparison, as the meringue topping was perfectly light and paired well with the lemon filling just beneath it. Our server even gave us a macaron each, thanking us again for being willing to change tables in the middle of our lunch; it was an unnecessary, but very thoughtful, gesture on the part of the business.It probably goes without saying that I'm looking forward to making yet another trip to Bosie, especially as they're one of the few places that offers a full tea service, complete with scones, miniature sandwiches, tea cakes, and the like. Regardless, it's hard to go wrong with anything on their extensive menu, which is perfect for any meal or light bite throughout the day.",11,5,9
182,Angel C.,"London, United Kingdom",262,606,0,4.0,1/20/2016,"Bosie is a true gem. Sitting pretty and unsuspecting on this short span of Morton, you are immediately in the mood once you enter. Basically the size of your bestfriend's studio, it is intimate but efficiently laid out (bar in front, pastry case in the center, seating along the left run), and almost always entirely full with the waft of scones and spiced tea drifting throughout. There are various seating options for the many tea types - stools at the bar, wingbacks in the rear, and 2-, 4- and 6- tables in the front-center. Service is perky upon welcome and then prompt but discrete thereafter. We had 2 small pots of the ginger and cinnamon, and 2 scones each over the course of 2 hours - we received smiles, but unless we explicitly signaled anyone over, we were left on our own to savor. The wait can be long if you are a larger party but in general you can be guaranteed seating within 25 minutes, and it'll be worth it.",1,,1

Yelp says it opens at 10am. it's about a 50 minute walk for me, so I planned to leave at 9am. Then I realize menu says it doesn't start serving food until 11am. So I wait another hour. At which point I am starving (usually eat breakfast around 7am). When I get there, the door says closed for private party 10:45 - 1pm. So I went elsewhere. Still have no idea if you can breakfast at 10, or if you have to wait until 11.Next weekend I call about 10:30am to make sure they are open. No one answers phone. So I call again at 11. Still no answer. I decide to walk there anyway. I had decided to get tea, breakfast egg sandwich and earl grey crepe cake. When I get there, they tell me I can't get the breakfast sandwich on the weekend. Even though the breakfast menu says served 730am-11am M-F and 11-4 during weekend brunch. So the only protein thing vegetarian spinach florentine, but I don't do runny eggs or hollandaise sauce. Too unhealthy. The have quiches too, but also too unhealthy. So I decide to go with oatmeal. Menu says with cinnamon and raisins. This oatmeal comes and it is not cinnamon and raisins. It is flax seed, chia seed and craisins. It taste fine, but not as expected. And my original plan was to have the egg sandwich so I could have the cake. The 1/4 cup of craisins in the oatmeal has about 30 grams of sugar. Now I don't process sugar well and that is 50% of someone's daily value.. So now I have way too much sugar, no protein.. so then I couldn't have my cake. Tea - I got plum oolong. Tea was weak. Didn't taste like an oolong. Tasted more like a watery japanese brown tea.Cake I got to go to have after I left and bought some food more substantial in protein. It was okay. They brulee the top layer with honey, which was fantastic. But the cream didn't taste much like earl grey and the crepe was a little thick and overpowering the creme. Also took 28 minutes from time I finished eating to when I got someone I could ask to get a bill for. The place itself I would give a two. But the waitress was super sympathetic and nice. So I'm going with a 3 just because of kind staff. But they really need to work on their menu being more accurate.",,,
194,Gina X.,"New York, NY",126,82,72,3.0,10/12/2015,"In the photo: Cucumber, smoked salmon, crab sandwiches (stay away from the awful crab sandwiches, they taste old and fishy).Lemon (super tart and lemony, loved!) and matcha pound cakes. Oatmeal and choc chip cookies. Raspberry yuzu (good) and earl grey (meh) macarons.Scones were a bit too crumbly. I prefer Tea and Sympathy's scones. Bosie was a bit stingy with the clotted cream... That little pot was only enough for one person.I had the Earl Grey Creme tea, which was lovely. But I wish they didn't fill the pots with strained tea... I prefer individual tea strainers set over cups.",2,,1
195,Melody C.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,325,42,5.0,9/10/2015,"I really like them a lot. Extremely.I was craving tea while the rest of my party wanted to stop by Big Gay in West Village. So really, without knowing anything about Bosie, I came in. SO pleasantly surprised by the tea selections. The only slight downside was that many of their green tea selections was from China. And I'm kind of...not the biggest fan of foodstuffs from China. My mother has ingrained this in me, unfortunately.ANYWAYS. The desserts looked delicious. It's too bad I wasn't in the mood. Definitely would love to come back here to try. There were surprisingly not many people when I stopped in. It was night time, so I would definitely recommend Bosie for a date.I got an iced tea and it was only $3! THREE! That's with steeping quality tea for each order (not bulk iced), and waiting the appropriate minutes for proper extraction. I got a lighter jasmine and the flavors were there without the bitterness.Plus, the girl who helped us was really sweet =)",2,1,3
196,Jess W.,"Manhattan, NY",247,39,27,4.0,4/7/2016,"What's better than afternoon tea service? Why, super fancy boozy afternoon tea service at a reasonable price, of course! My friend had a Gilt City voucher, which amounted to us gorging on tea sandwiches, pastries, tea, and champagne like I imagine the Queen herself would for $35 a person. The duck breast crostinis and crab salad sandwiches were delicious, but I was surprised to find the desserts more memorable here, because I've never had a huge sweet tooth. The desserts here are interesting and beautifully presented. The buttery scones melt in your mouth, and paired with the clotted cream and jam, they're unstoppable. The macarons come in a fascinating and unconventional variety of flavors, such as popcorn and olive oil. But wait, I'm a huge sucker for the DARJEELING TART, which was creamy, rich, and infused with potent tea flavor! The Ispahan was aromatic and flowery, which played a nice contrast to the tart. The Earl Grey mille crepe fantastically tea-flavored as well. This is probably one of the top, if not the best, tea service I've ever had, hands down.",,,
197,Yun F.,"New York, NY",16,11,49,5.0,10/30/2015,"I've come on a couple of occasions, once on a Saturday afternoon and once late on a Friday night. My favorite dessert is the ispahan- a rose macaron filled with raspberry and lychee. All of the flavored balance each other out and this makes the perfect level of sweetness and richness. I'm not a big fan of overly sweet desserts and this one is just right. Also, a lot of times rose flavored desserts taste very fake, but I didn't get that with this dessert.The atmosphere at this place is also very relaxed and is good for small groups to hang out. Service is also very good!",2,,
198,Tansy W.,"New York, NY",28,254,211,4.0,11/30/2015,"Cute little place! Came here for afternoon tea and had a fabulous time. Friendly staff and good tea/food.TEA:- loved the jasmine and the English breakfast tea.- wasn't as much of a fan of the pu ehr and the wuyai shi oolong. I felt like the pu ehr lacked flavor and the wuyai shi oolong tasted a little more bitter than usual. FOOD:- the vanilla sugar scones were FABULOUS. Definitely use both the jam and the cream on them. The center of the scones were super soft--practically melted in my mouth.- our tea service came with a lemon and a green tea cake--both were way too dry. had a bite and that was all.- our tea service also came with two mini chocolate chip cookies and two mini oatmeal raisin cookies. didn't like either.- sandwiches:  loved the smoked salmon sandwich and the farmer's egg salad. the crab sandwiches and the cheddar sandwiches were average--probably wouldn't order them again. - In addition to the tea service, we also ordered the Earl Grey mille cake and a coffee tea cake. didn't like either. - macarons - LOVED the vanilla cheesecake. didn't like the matcha or the salted caramel--they were far too sweet for my taste.Will definitely come back again! Especially given how much cheaper it is compared to some of the other afternoon tea places in the city.",1,,
