0,christine a.,"New York, NY",91,205,83,4.0,10/3/2018,"Truly an unusual New York place with a twist. I work next door and eat lunch and buy produce here occasionally. I find the staff super helpful and nice, and the produce is top notch. They feature produce from an upstate farm, along with a lot of other choices. If you're walking down the West Side path and need a sandwich, coffee, salad, a snack break or refreshment, Heermance is a good place to stop. They even serve alcohol. I heard they do catering, too.",,,1

2,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",383,633,1398,5.0,6/18/2015,"Heermance Farm Purveyors is a little gem in the very West Village. I stumbled upon it one day and was drawn to devour the s'mores cookies, I was then informed of a neighborhood get together. Heermance welcomed us and generously introduced us to their marvelous produces, delicious vegetables, and even more amazing finger foods! Some of my favorite were the smoked salmon toasties, the cold asparagus soup, the stuffed dates, the onion dip, the fried pita triangles, the cheeses, omg- the cheeses!, the homemade potato chips, and the cookies (chocolate chips and s'mores!). They are fine caterers, the food was more than delicious and they would make a party a success! Event apart, the items you will find are fresh, some are homemade, most are organic and all is yummy! Check it out and try the s'mores cookies, the chocolate chip cookies and the homemade potato chips!",3,,
3,k s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,1/19/2017,"I can't help but laugh at the reviews picking on their stock. When you visit, you will see why. It's a small place, with some local produce, a deli to order sandwiches, breakfasts and things (all of the ones i've had are delicious), snacks, a variety of bottled teas, waters, beers, etc, fresh coffee, a cocktail bar, and a place to sit in the center to enjoy your lunch. My experience is beyond wonderful everytime I go.  It's very clean, friendly, a great place to pick up a few produce items, lunch or have cocktails and snacks with friends. It's not a giant chain grocery store, so I think it's unfair to rate it as one like others have done. The selection is more boutique, fresh, and yummy. Jania who works there at the bar, is also incredible! Lovely customer service.",,,
4,Eyleen N.,"Orange, CA",184,15,3,5.0,2/20/2017,"Stopped in after a run, and was immediately was made to feel at home. I ordered a Cobb salad with turkey, and it was amazing! The beautiful woman behind the counter, was so hospitable. She gave me a couple of samples of the potato salad and coleslaw when she brought me my salad, both were so delicious!!! I plan on stopping in here after my runs. So glad I found this gem.",1,,1
5,Andrea C.,"New York, NY",0,1,49,5.0,10/11/2016,"Heermance Farm Purveyors has this great new deli department with artisnal sandwiches.I ordered from their catering menu a lunch for my office and it was amazing. Beautiful stuffed sanwiches with fresh natural and organic deli cheese and  meats. The all natural deil meat platter was generuos and a beautiful presentation. The Chocolate Chip Cookies are the best ever. Also I placed an order of Sweet Breads... Cinnamon Apple, Banana, and Carrot. So Good!! The delivery was prompt and delivered on time. Thanks Heermance Farm Purveyors, Great Lunch!!",,,
6,Gina K.,"New York, NY",530,172,922,1.0,4/4/2015,"Walked in because it looked cute and welcoming from the outside. I asked the cashier what kind of store it was. Her reply, it's like an indoor farmer's market but it was just winter so we haven't been able to get a lot of product in.That doesn't seem like a good business plan... But not judging :/ Maybe they'll be better with actual inventory and slightly more focus as to what they offer as a business.",,1,
7,Michael C.,"New York, NY",0,10,4,5.0,2/23/2017,"I walked into Heermance Farm Purveyors today for the first time and let me tell you it's fantastic! I ordered a Cobb Salad and while I waited for it to be prepared one of the servers offered me a free sample of the vegan minestrone soup. Absolutely delicious.  I'm not a soup guy and I immediately ordered a cup. I learned they were out of bacon for the Cobb but they offered to substitute it with Pastrami.  Why not?  Moments later my salad appeared with not one but two dressings: balsamic and Russian.  Mid way through my salad the chef came by and carefully toped off my salad with another round of pastrami.  I mean, if that's not customer service, what is?  Very friendly staff, large selection of organic and locally sourced grocery items. I'm definitely going back.  Probably tomorrow.",,,
8,A B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/11/2016,Love this place for so many reasons! Great food and staff and the vegan selection keeps growing. A seating area in the back where I can eat or have a hot apple cider while my baby naps- major bonus! When the weather is nice it's the perfect place to pick up snacks for a picnic on the Hudson river. Cute kitty that lives there. I'm so happy they're in the neighborhood! And their avocados are always ripe ;),,,
9,Aaron L.,"New York, NY",503,107,4,5.0,6/16/2015,Came here once to check out the farmers market and was introduced to amazing smores cookies and huge vegetables.  Came back for a welcome party where they showed us their amazing catering skills and where we tried tons of food including amazing hummus salads salsa and delicious beer and high quality whiskey. They truly carry top quality products and their shelves were definitely full. Bought some healthy dog treats too. If you're in the hood check them out.,2,,
10,Mili M.,"Greenvale, NY",3,29,2,4.0,6/20/2015,"Never seen a place quite like it! A grocery store, cocktail bar, restaurant all combined into one. We stopped in for a quick drink before heading to the pier. Really enjoyed their customer service.",1,1,1
11,Walter B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,38,3,2.0,9/21/2014,"I was hopeful for what they advertised but, as other review says, there isn't much of anything in the store.  It is a big space and off the beaten track so they need something going on there to stay in business.  Seems like they are not trying too hard. If they can't stock the place in the summer/fall, what will they have there in the winter? Also, unfortunately, some of the things they do have seem a bit overpriced. Will try one more time....",2,2,4
12,Anonymous a.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,1,1.0,8/16/2014,"After walking by a few times to see if stock would improve, I finally stepped in about an hour after their opening time on Saturday. Owners seem unfriendly or unappreciative of customer visits and lots of empty shelves, as in, about 50% of the place was barren. Wondering why most of the produce is bruised badly and leftover-looking. This farm has great stuff at union square, but not here. I had high hopes but left the place feeling like I'll never return. I guess it just seems like the focus is design rather than stock.",2,2,3
