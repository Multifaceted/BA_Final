2,Caroline B.,"Manhattan, NY",167,30,51,5.0,2/24/2018,There are few places in the city that treat you like family- this is one of them. Kira and Ange have been angels to this place and the customers come from near and far to play a little pool and get great service. You can talk to anybody here and always get a great chat and good advice. Very few places like this exist anymore. I like the happy hour $5 wine til 7- and try the chicken fingers or the  cheese fries for a snack. The Sheppard's pie is pretty good too. The best part is the human factor and everyone will know your name. Watch the pool guys and gals take each other to town for some real entertainment. Also good for renting out party space - the place is huge!,,,

When I told our waitress, after waiting 25 mins for her to return after taking our order (the busboy brought it out) all she said was ""oh, ok"" with no apology or suggestion to make it right. They were at least a few days after being stale, as hard as if they were frozen solid. The times prior the food and service were also subpar, both have been steadily declining sadly.",,,

Some of the other beer prices aren't bad, 6 for Leffe isn't bad at all.Had some sliders for a meal because we were in a group. A bit greasy but serviceable. Came with onions. 3 for 10 bucks which is OK but it is New York. Waitress was surly and the bartender was a bit bored but nice. Ketchup was watery which is a bit weird.Tried the Applebee level chips (which isn't a bad thing) and dip as well as a fry from someone else's burger. Fries were the normal. Cheese fries with bacon looked comforting but I didn't try.Some nice people in here, two guys came in for 2 dollar pool and both were quite friendly and they seem to frequent the bar, so there is that.2.4, it's ehh at it's most ehhhhhh",,,

Nothing special about it to make a trip across town, but if you're an UWSider then its a great place to put on rotation of neighborhood bars. I live on the UES, so it's a quick M86 ride away from me.

31,Carol H.,"New York, NY",9,144,5,3.0,10/15/2014,"This place fascinates me. I've never seen more than 20 people in it, and half of them all seem to be regulars who know the bartenders or know the cheap Corona happy hours. I originally found it because I needed an ADA-accessible venue space for a ton of students - which it is - but I've come here a couple more times on non-business just to try and figure it out. They generally have some kind of soccer on, with a big projector screen at the end, and most fun, they have some beers you don't usually seen on tap! Newcastle Cabbie Black Ale (lesser known cousin of the Newcastle Brown Ale) and Boddington's! Beers aren't cheap, although they're not as expensive as they could be for imported stuff. Happy hour is more or less cheap domestics. Food: Meh. Better than frat bars, but skip it unless you're really hungry. The steak nachos were passable, the chili absolutely tasteless, the bangers and mash all right. Food comes out in a decent time at a decent temperature, but that's about all I can say for it. Service: Nice, solid service. Like I said, there are a good bunch of regulars, which is generally a good sign. Bartenders are attentive don't feel the need to make conversation with you constantly.",,,

Brunch is great but it isn't bottomless. You get 5 drinks and a two-hour time limit. Choices are between mimosas, belinis & bloody Marys. Try to get a seat facing the street on summer/spring/warm days; a nice view of Third Ave and zone out people watching after your third mimosa. It's a little on the chi-chi side, we sat next to a what looked like blonde triplets from the New York Housewives. It was entertaining to eavesdrop on their convo though. We ordered steaks and eggs and bacon and eggs with q side of potatoes for brunch. Like I said portions are super small now. I know times are hard, but come on. The potatoes were really nice and buttery though. Overall we had a chill Sunday during Labor Day weekend. When the city is probably the least crowded. Staycations rule.",,,1

I had the chicken wings, fish and chips, and apple pie. Chicken wing was ordered as hot, but it wasn't spicy at all for me. The fish chips wasn't crunchy so that's a little unfortunate.

37,Marissa G.,"Manhattan, NY",5,16,1,2.0,12/9/2015,"I've been to Parlour many times for post sports gatherings and generally have enjoyed, but last night I had a very different experience.  My alumni group booked a table for 15 of us for our annual holiday dinner gathering and while the reservation was made only the day before, Parlour told us it wouldn't be a problem.  The service was absolutely abysmal.  We initially had one server take orders and then he disappeared for the remainder of the night.  We had a couple late joiners and it was like pulling teeth to get anyone to take their order or even allow the rest of the group to order more drinks.  When we flagged down the only waitress we saw she acted beyond annoyed that she had to serve us.  I am sure she was overwhelmed being the only one working but as a former server myself I expect at least an ounce of politeness, particularly when you are getting a guaranteed 20% gratuity because of the group size (which was NOT at all warranted).  Additionally, it took over an hour to get our food and we are not talking gourmet meals.  The food itself was average but it was very overpriced, particularly for the portion size.  Most of us stuck around to play trivia since we knew even closing out our check would take forever and while we ended up winning a round of shots we never actually received them.  The bartender confirmed our prize with the group and our selection and after 15 more minutes of sitting and watching him chat with people at the bar we realized he was never going to actually bring the shots and we got up and left.  The entire experience was quite frustrating and I do not plan to do sit down service there ever again.  In fact I am hesitant to return at all.",,,

Head to the right and there is a large Irish pub bar area with another bar, and a seating / dining area with a good amount of tables and chairs. Lots of people were eating the burgers so I must come back here to try one out. Spacious place overall. Good crowd. Seemed like everyone knew each other here.

It's nice and spacious enough that you don't bump into other tables while playing beer pong or something else. We did not try the food so can't comment on that. They did run out of cups at some point but with all the wastage around, you can't completely blame them for it. If you have a large group and they like to drink and be loud and have fun, the parlour is a good option for you. It's conveniently location in Upper west side right outside the 1 train station.",,,

The waitresses are SO rude and absolutely ignore you at a pretty empty bar, even when you ASK if you can order a drink (this happened on three different occasions). No one here cares about your patronage in the least, or cares that you brought 15 people here 4 months in a row. It also kind of sucks that they don't look at their reservation book. Our group showed up last night with no where to go, they had no clue we booked the back room, didn't apologize once for their oversight and didn't keep us updated on what was happening. Only when we asked did we get updated, which was ""the manager is coming in shortly"".  In the meantime, its 30 minutes past our reservation and 10 of us are standing here, empty handed, looking for another place to go because weren't sure if we were goign to get a spot. Rude, horrible, not a way to run a business. They'll just give you attitude like its your fault.I hate this place with all of my soul.",5,,

It turned from a pub to a ""club""Two things that are bad1. The fruit flies...they gotta get this under control because they are really distracting and not good for the Parlour's image. 2. The shady regulars...These guys roll up in there and drink their drink and just chat it up with anyone they can..and trust me I love a good talk...but when i get asked about if I have a man in the first question or kids...or if I live alone...not cool...i would never go there by myself knowing that these guys are sitting in the corner of the bar [probably since noon] and watching me.",3,3,1

53,Amanda B.,"Queens, NY",182,43,1,3.0,10/12/2014,"I've been to The Parlour a few times with co-workers for a drink just out of convenience. Long Island Iced Teas are super strong but tasty.. makes it worth the cost. It is a big place with a downstairs and can become pretty packed on a busy night. Food is nothing out of this world. It is a typical Irish pub. I do like that they have a music player.. but besides that I would not plan a night out exclusively at this location. Probably a lot more fun with a larger group of people. Overall it's not a bad place, maybe just not MY kind of place.",1,,
54,Sam Z.,"Washington, DC",1,18,0,3.0,10/26/2014,"Been here a few times for different events. It's got a very nice space, and the food is fine by New York pub standards. Last time I went with friends was for trivia and I was not as impressed. The veggie nachos were great, but the trivia setup was not. Hard to hear what the quizmaster was saying, and the sound system basically didn't work for the music round. Might try it again in a few weeks, but it was definitely not a winning experience.",1,,
55,Sam S.,"Manhattan, NY",58,131,0,3.0,3/8/2012,"The space consists of three bar areas: a small upstairs bar by the pool table, the primary bar area by the jukebox/game machine to the right, and a large downstairs bar area with tables suitable for beer pong. There is also another room on the first floor I've never seen it utilized. Anyway lots of space here; it's not a bad choice for a large group, if you're looking for a a nice, dark Irish joint with solid bar food. Easy access to the 1 train makes it a nice rendezvous point for groups situated on the West Side. If size/location isn't a primary concern, however, I recommend heading to other nearby Irish bars like George Keely's (~.5mi east/south), which has an excellent beer selection, & The Abbey (~1mi north).",3,,

59,M M.,"Portland, OR",37,46,0,1.0,9/26/2013,"The Parlour was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Anywhere. Ever. Period. I came to The Parlour with two friends for dinner. We wanted to try something Irish for a change. It took an hour and a half for our appetizer (onion peels) to be delivered, and almost two hours for our meals. When we did get our meals: utter disappointment. I had the fish and chips for $15. They were supposed to be homemade. Unfortunately, the batter was over an inch thick in places, and gooey in the middle. I wish I would have taken a photo. There was very little fish. I would have preferred frozen fish and chips to these. Near the end of our meal, one of my friends ordered dessert. He said vanilla ice cream with chocolate on top. He got apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top. Needless to say, he's a little more easy-going than I am. When the waitress came to check on us, she noticed that the kitchen staff had brought the wrong dessert and said something like: ""oh, I wasn't sure. I thought I might have pressed the wrong button.""  When the waitress brought our onion peels, she told us they were on the house. In between the onion peels and our meal (about a thirty minute interval), she asked if we wanted another pitcher of beer. We said ""sure, if it's on the house."" She replied: ""yeah, no problem you guys have been waiting forever."" We waited forever for everything. And when we got the bill, nothing was on the house. Not even the dessert that was totally screwed up. To top this off, the barman had told us there was a special on pitchers ($15 instead of $18), which was also incorrect on the bill. I had to bring all of this to our server's attention.I nearly had to argue with the server to get her to honor the correct prices and take off the items she had agreed to comp. We still had to pay for the apple pie, but we took it out of her tip.Bottom line: don't come here. This Parlour is a disaster.",3,1,1

Somehow, this place manages.On top of that the service is just terrible.

I sat by the bar area knowing exactly where the food usually come out first (i'm a pro now since this is my third year going!) I kept eye-ing towards the back kitchen and it took them a good 45 mins to bring out the first rounds of appetizers. They were typical bar food - nothing too special. The pizzas lacked sauces and the chicken fingers were overcooked. I didn't drink anything other than diet coke since I had patients the following day. The bartenders were friendly and kept refilling my diet coke throughout the night. There's an area for beer pong right by the stairs and bathrooms available on the same floor which was convenient (didn't have to keep going up the stairs!) I didn't stay long since tt was freezing in the basement and I had to keep my jacket on the entire time.

Our Guinness was served in plastic cups, and way less than a pint and yet charged the same amount. Hmm... We ordered 2 entrees and an appetizer. Can't complain about the mozerella sticks, they were fine for an appetizer. But the $20 ""Irish Stew"" which was more like a can of Progresso soup, and the $19 fish and chips which totally disintegrated and fell apart with a bit of malt vinegar were overpriced for what they were. To top it off, they added $11 gratuity to our check. I might've added something near that amount for the waitresses, as the service was outstanding, given the busy atmosphere. We were definitely well-taken care of, and I do appreciate that. But the quality of the food, the beer, and automatic gratuity was really a let-down, especially on St. Patrick's. Yes, I know it's a bar, I was not expecting fine dining by any means. I love bar and pub food, and Irish food, too. But there are tons of great Irish pubs here in the city with decent stews, fish and chips, and Guinness in real pint glasses that don't charge nearly as much.  $75 dollars later (2 beers in plastic cups, an appetizer and 2 ""entrees"" and automatic gratuity), I left pinching myself and my wallet...",1,,

Upstairs is a much nicer setting... you'd be surprised what's going on downstairs once you first walk in.  The bartenders are fun and willing to drink with ya, I love that!  Usually always have a great selection of music and they've always got some kind of sporting event on.  I'm sad to say I was here when the Celtics lost the finals... heartbreaking but the atmosphere was so much fun, perhaps a great place to check out over big sporting events as well.

Anyways - I came here after Santa con which you can imagine was absolutely insane and living in the East Village, I was okay about coming up to the Upper side of Manhattan since Santas were crawling all over Lower Manhattan.While sitting down I looked around and noticed everyone hooking up - like it was ridiculous. One minute they were chillen, the next their faces were bombarded by saliva and other remnants of facial hair. Okay that's a bit descriptive, but it seriously seemed like that. I was starving and at first all the waitresses ignored us until I stalked one and got her to bring me a couple of menus. She did and she was rushing us to no other and got my friends order wrong. She dropped the bill and insisted that we pay immediately so that she could leave. All in all... B-yatch. I was not impressed and would have much rather ordered from the bartender to be completely honest. While playing pool, my friends were killing it on the table like doing super duper well playing by the rules that are most common in pool. However, when we began playing against there other people they insisted that that's not how they play here and that they had played there before. So pretty much EVERY rule that we did that we would have beat them, they said ""we dont' play that here"".... Are you F-ing kidding me. They SUCKED. At the end they ended up beating us due to their stupidity. All in all - this bar is good if you don't like playing pool, you don't mind rude waitresses and you're down to hook up.

101,Moneek M.,"New York, NY",4,129,1,3.0,2/15/2012,"Came here on a Saturday night and it was definitely better than what I expected. The atmosphere was laid back, the drinks were reasonable, and the bartenders were attentive.  Nice place to hang out with a few friends.",,,
102,Scott R.,"Austin, TX",303,784,12,4.0,1/7/2007,"Solid pub in the UWS.  When I tend to go (weekend afternoons), it's usually a mellow crowd - not the place I go to meet someone but cool to hang out.  The beer selection is okay and is no bargain ($6 pint on Sunday afternoon?). The food is generally good - the chopped sirloin burger is great.  It's just the right size (maybe 8 oz.?) and packs a lot of flavor.  The fish and chips are also recommended.    On weekend nights, they open up the downstairs.  I've seen bands play down there before - tends to be a young crowd...not sure if the Columbia kids still make it down here in full force like they used to.  They've also got a pool table that rarely has a long wait.",3,,2
103,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",51,754,127,2.0,3/2/2009,"The food and beer were solid (I had Fish & Chips and Boddingtons) but this place is really not for me.  Lots and lots of loud thumping music, which we could hear even in our private birthday-party room in the back.  If you like bars where you have to scream to talk, this is your place.",1,,1
104,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",738,57,1,4.0,4/30/2011,"Came here last night.When I first approached 'The Parlour' it seemed very ritzy. There was a large crowd outside dressed in suits and pearls. I felt pretty awkward with my high waisted skirt that might have been a smidge too short... When I walked in, everything changed. It was pretty laid back, small clusters of people standing around drinking. I met some friends and ordered a beer on tap.  They also had nice large tables for bigger parties to sit....Cool place to have a drink and hang out... This place is pretty intimate.",,1,2

106,Matt H.,"New York, NY",114,139,0,4.0,12/4/2008,"For the love of the IrishThis throw back pub is cute and cosey. Great for secret meetings and illegal rendezvous. I always eyed the place in HS, because my teachers used to go pound out the days stress there. Once i graduated from college i showed up on the night of the kids graduation and bought my teachers a round of tequila shots, they took them like champions.This is a relaxing bar with good food and reasonable drinks. The crowd is obviously older and quite. Great place to grab some grub and wind down with a pal. All in all, try it out.",1,1,1
107,Suzanne G.,"New York, NY",98,259,5,3.0,5/19/2008,"I was looking forward to trying The Parlour since it's so close to home, (I'm still looking for my ""stumble bar"") and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was.It's clean, spacious, and the bartenders were really cool. When two guys tried to step in front of me before I ordered drinks, the bartender politely told them that I was there first and took my order. That was awesome! Plus she made great drinks!The playlist that night was late 80s-early 90s including MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice. Pretty awesome. The crowd at Parlour is better than the Amsterdam bars- less frat boy and a little more professional. That's definitely a plus.It didn't make the ""stumble bar"" position, but I definitely had fun here and will be back!",1,,2

109,Meg P.,"New York, NY",29,176,0,4.0,10/7/2007,"I like this place. It's clean, it serves good beer and the wait staff is super nice. I walked in on a saturday afternoon and the top floor was filled with raucous rugby fans. I was ushered downstairs by my friends and I walked into a room filled with tables for flip cup and beer pong. I had a fantastic time and will be going back next week!!",1,,1
110,Kristin M.,"Manhattan, NY",22,67,9,3.0,12/1/2011,"A really spacious, chill bar on the Upper West Side.  Their appetizers were pretty good, if a little pricey.  Burgers and beer list were just so-so.  Still, a good place to stop by for a drink if you're in the area.",,,
111,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",95,11,0,4.0,3/7/2010,"Great fries! Great curry sauce for the potato skins. Good cheap burgers and Guinness.This place is gigantic and a great place to go with a group of friends. My friend, who's a DJ, sometimes uses the humongous room/bar downstairs to spin and it's almost like a completely separate party. Did I mention the great fries? Yum.",,,
112,Morgan J.,"San Francisco, CA",5,8,0,4.0,11/5/2008,"Only a block away from the post-grad insanity that is Amsterdam, lies a pub for a much low-key and relaxing evening: Parlour. The beers on tap are on point, and the atmosphere can range from singing Euros to a more classic, easy-does-it London pub feel. The TV's are plentiful (I was there last night watching Barack's acceptance speech) and sporting events are always on -- just watch out for the rugby and FIFA days, those bring out the hard-core drinkers from across the pond. It's a solid neighborhood spot, where you don't have to stand and elbow your way through a raucous crowd just for a pint.",1,,
113,Charlie C.,"Bronx, NY",1,36,0,5.0,11/6/2013,"Can't comment on the place as a restaurant, but as a bar, you won't find a friendlier staff or a better poured Guinness in the city.  As comfortable as being at home in your own living room, with a nice mix of a respectful young crowd and a mature crowd.  If you're looking for a good neighborhood bar in the city, this is your place.",,,
114,Johanna Z.,"New York, NY",140,24,1,1.0,3/27/2015,"I used to go to this place when it was close to the apartment my boyfriend was living at the time.  I'll never go back again.  First of all, the food isn't that great.  It was okay bar food and a convenient place to go.  But it's not worth it for the service.  I had one experience that was bad enough to not want to go again.  One night my boyfriend and I came in and say in the bar area.  After waiting a long time for the bartender to serve us, my boyfriend walked up to ask for some menus.  At that point, the bartender accused my boyfriend of having started a fight in the bar a few nights before and refused to serve us in front of other customers.  A few days later when my boyfriend went back, the bartender saw him and apologized and said the person who actually started the fight came in a little while after us.  My advice to the parlour is.... you better know what the fuck you're talking about before you go refusing service to paying customers.",,,
115,Mark P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/10/2011,I love neighbourhood pubs and belive in supporting them but when one tries to take the mickey out of me with overpriced beer and and food that is late ( order was not put in correctly) so my friend ate alone as I waited and when the food arrived it was just warm and the saugages were burnt...basically The Parlour sets back pub food quality  to 1980 England yet charges 2011 prices. Staff were friendly enough but offered nothing for poor service and sub quality food!!!!  Will not be frequenting that as my local!!,,,
116,Ken W.,"San Francisco, CA",4,6,0,4.0,5/12/2006,"Wow - I cannot believe I am the first to review this fine establishment on this site!  The Parlour is my preferred haunt on the upper west side.  The business model for the Irish pub is flawless and has withstood the test of time.  Few pull off this better (on the UWS) than The Parlour.  It has all of the requisite ingredients of a good Irish pub. 1) It must pour a good Guinness2) It must serve an excellent burger3) It should be patronized by friendly folks with Irish accents. I just got back from an evening at The Parlour and after a few pints of the black stuff I can vouch for number 1.  My burger or ""chopped sirloin"" as it is called on the bill was indeed excellent and there were more than a few redheaded hooligans in ""football"" jerseys milling about.  Incidentally, when the waitress asks rhetorically, ""do you lads want another round?"" in the musical tones of the old country, you know you've found a home.  I have yet to try the fish and chips (the true test of an Irish pub's pedigree) but I have been to The Parlour on a number of occasions and am comfortable calling it my favorite bar on the UWS.",,,1
117,Megan T.,"Denver, CO",100,291,23,2.0,9/26/2008,"Reminded me of the days I used to go to frat parties, play flip cup, be terrible at it, and then leave the scene my shoes sticking to the floor. Because it is exactly that. That Friday night it was overcrowded with flag-football teams, still in uniform, having just come from a late-night game. Everyone was downstairs, where a handful of beer pong tables were set up and everyone lined the sides waiting for the flip cup tournament to start. Ehhh....being all dressed up to go downtown (this was a preliminary pitstop) I just really wasn't in the mood for spilled beer to be crusting in b/w my toes, because stupid me...I was wearing sandals on that warm late summer night. I really think I might need to be wasted to still enjoy a scene like this...or maybe go back in time and be 18 again.",,,
118,Kirsten S.,"Ipswich, MA",139,183,93,4.0,10/13/2010,Great to watch any sporting events. The basement is usually filled with local intramural sports teams playing flip cup and beer pong. I love the food but I have heard mixed reviews from other friends.,,,

121,A B.,"Boston, MA",1,294,0,4.0,4/18/2010,I am mixed between 3 and 4 stars.  It was pretty good.  The service was not that great....they were kind of aloof.  I shocked myself on one of the beer signs on the windows (I was sitting by the window) as there was an open wire exposed.  That was kind of awkward.  But the food was good....we all seemed to get turkey burgers and were happy!  I saw a sign for happy hour and that seemed pretty great,1,,
122,Dev J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/2/2013,"Went to this place for a nice drink with some friends. The owner John was incredibly rude and pushed us out the door while asking to see our ID.

123,Sara T.,"Manhattan, NY",136,144,1,2.0,7/27/2010,"Went here for a friend's birthday party.  It was so loud, I had to scream to talk to anyone.  By the time I left, I had to push my way through a huge crowd just to get out the door.  The drinks weren't too expensive, but also didn't have all that much booze in them either.  I think I'll pass next time.",,,

126,Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,619,238,3.0,6/11/2007,"For a regular bar/pub, this place was pretty nice and fun. It wasn't divey or grimy like many of its kind, nor was it too macho/hetero and the people were nice, and they served cheap drinks. It is a large space, tons of televisions and decent music... They have a jukebox, if you into that. I had good company too, so this place gets three stars, but it's not work more. It's probably a great place to have a birthday get together or anything involving a large group I'd say.",3,,3
127,Ted S.,"New York, NY",19,192,0,4.0,1/23/2007,I grew up near by and never actually went here until last year.  The space had always been a string of generic Irish pubs with little particular appeal to me.  A Buddy told me though that they had one of the best burgers on the West side so I went with him to investigate.  I don't remember much about the interior ut it was pretty empty.  We had a couple of pints and the burgers which really were pretty damn good.  I always forget about this place but it does have one of the finer burgers around.,3,1,1
128,David S.,"San Diego, CA",304,652,282,3.0,3/16/2007,"Pretty decent Irish pub. Not the dark-dirty-smelly-is-this-vomit-on-the-floor kind of pub, more of the clean-well-lit-a-little-upscale kind... I mean, this is UWS. I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general (they sometimes bore me), but I had a pretty good time there. Some of the drinks were relatively cheap (the cheapest draft beer was $4, and well drinks are $4 as well during happy hour, until 7pm). They even had a promotion for Guinness with free Guinness samples, I'm guessing because of St Patrick's day approaching (not really for me though, I've always found Guinness a little yucky). I didn't try the food, but from what I saw it all looked pretty good. 3-1/2 stars.",2,2,1
129,joe r.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,173,27,3.0,6/20/2007,"A bit swankier than I like my pubs, but the food is good.  I went to a friend's birthday party there and he got real good and drunk.  (I gave him an Aquaman action figure.)  As I was leaving with my girlfriend he made a ""whipping"" sound.  This friend is probably my only nice friend.  I was shocked.  My now-wife still doesn't believe that he's the nice one.",1,1,1
130,L S.,"New York, NY",0,106,15,5.0,12/15/2011,"Everything was surprisingly good.  There's a little back room if you want a quiet meal.  The burger (""award winning"") was very good.  I can actually believe that it is award winning.  The service was excellent.  It seem like a pretty nice place to hang out and relax.  It's a nice change from the myriad of small, crowded bars in Manhattan.  The beer selection was good.",,,
131,K K.,"New York, NY",122,256,37,4.0,5/2/2008,"The Parlour is an absolutely massive (for New York City) space on the UWS.  I wouldnt call it 100% authentic Irish, but with fish and chips, shepards pie and other Irish entrees, it gets the job done.  The food, by the way, is very good for pub fare and the chicken fingers were among the tastiest I've ever had.  I suppose it's a tad on the expensive side, but nothing atypical of Manhattan.  There are multiple bars and a back room dining room that is suitable for families and children (i.e. you would be separated from the main bar/driking area).  It also has a downstairs and occasionally has live music, parties etc...  I know that they play live sports from Europe, which is very popular on the weekends.  It is certainly much cleaner than your stereotypical Irish pub if that's a concern for you (it sure isnt for me).   If you're in the area, it certainly worth a stop in.",1,,1
132,Andrew T.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,5.0,6/23/2008,If you are looking for a friendly neighborhood place on the UWS this is it.  The patrons are great and are a cross-section of mid-aged and young.  Bartenders are awesome.  The owner hangs out by the door to greet you.  Great beer - yes its $6 but you are paying for the large space and the decor which is better than your a typical dive.  Their Shepard's Pie is awesome too.,1,,1
133,Robin G.,"New York, NY",2,45,0,4.0,12/18/2011,"I've eaten there a few times.  Our last meal was excellent, a nicely done grilled salmon dish and a grilled chicken (4 pieces - a huge portion).   We ate in a smaller room off the main bar, which was more intimate.  It's a nice neighborhood bar with potential to be lots more.",,,

Not any more. Lady bartenders are classy sweethearts. Boy bartenders have never grown up. They suk.Went there a few weeks ago. Many TV screens. Wall-to-wall Irish football or rugby or whatever they call it.  Asked boy bartender to put Yankee game on one of the screens. He ignored me. Went back this past holiday weekend. No air conditioning.

But alas, every time I walk in to The Parlour, I leave regretting having done so. There seems to be only two types of people that come here - miserable people in their late 20s/early 30s who are looking for fellow sadsacks to imbibe with until they get drunk enough to be take their misery out on others, and Zog Sports team members who come here to hang out with each other after a game. Shoot me. Literally every time I go here I wind up having some kind of issue with some drunk asshole starting shit with me, and/or having to protect some poor female from such an asshole. It's literally a beehive of douchebags. I don't know why that is, but I feel my soul slowly dying whenever I'm here. Also, the drinks aren't cheap and  the food sucks. There is absolutely no reason to come here, no matter how close you live to it, unless you're miserable and want to stay that way. Do yourself a favor and go the extra block to Amsterdam.",1,1,
139,Dean D.,"New York, NY",1,1,0,4.0,6/26/2008,"This place is great. It's large and spacious and lit perfectly. I don't know what that other dude was talking about saying that it's too bright. It's by no means cheap though, coors was 5 and a pitcher of miller lite was 12. I usually go during the week (mon-thursday) and it's never too crowded but there are always enough people there to make it fun. The karoke is a big attraction and the whole bar gets into it when someone can actually sing, however those who can't aren't shunned. I'd say most of the people in there were late twenties early 30's definitely a few younger and older though. It's also clean which isn't nessecary I guess when you're going to these types of bars but it's nice not to have to dance and drink in dirt. 1 pool table and two bars upstairs which means no waiting for drinks. Go there!",,,
