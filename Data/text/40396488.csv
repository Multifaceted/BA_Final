Updated review",1,,"Lopez Island, WA",S T.,0,4.0,33,"I'd like to provide an update, as I was contacted by Seth, one of the owners of Fortuna, after leaving my review and emailing the company.Seth took the time to explain some of the growing pains the company is growing through.  He was clearly concerned about my experience and wanted to reassure me that new practices are being put in place to prevent communication issues.  I felt quite reassured that these issues will be taken care of.  It's not all that often that one gets to deal directly with the owner of an auction house, and Seth was very pleasant and easy to talk to.  I will be giving them another chance, for sure.",
3,,5/4/2017,0,,"New York, NY",Carlos C.,0,5.0,5,I would definitely recommend Fortune for a first time seller of jewelry. The Fortune team were professional and more importantly Honest. I know nothing about Auctions but they never made me feel that way. Instead they guided me throughout the process and never made me feel lost. On top of their service they were on point with the market price and actually my piece sold for more money than expected. Their fees are also the best compared to other Auction houses! They are a definitely deserving of 5 stars.,

Anna and Seth are very professional and they helped me every step of the way. Two rings of mine sold at one of their auctions for  $7800, when the Jewelry stores offered less than half of that.I highly recommend!",
