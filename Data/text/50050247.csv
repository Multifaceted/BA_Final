0,Lucien D.,"New York, NY",3,179,2,5.0,10/26/2018,This is a crown jewel of theaters in New York. It just recently reopened after extensive reworking in it. They have an amazing concession stand of items you wouldn't find in any other theater. A bar in the lobby and a restaurant on the top floor with a small nook of a bookstore selling arthouse film books. The seating is firm and a tad bit uncomfortable after awhile. The theaters themselves has an original country-barn feel. The projection system and sound is superb. Their programs are of an excellent quality. Very clean theater and courteous staff. Good management. If you like arthouse films you definitely would want to go here.,,,
1,Jenny L.,"Brooklyn, NY",227,20,3,4.0,10/14/2018,"Wonderful, bespoke movie theater with excellent seats, huge screen, restaurant upstairs (separate review), a great snack collection (kombucha!), and thoughtful programming. I just saw the newly restored The War At Home, with a talk back with the filmmakers. Downside of this theater -- price. Snacks are expensive, and movies are $15. I have not explored membership.",,,
2,LG ..,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",1,10,20,4.0,8/14/2018,"Terrific programming, exceptionally tasteful film selection!Charming and slightly mysterious interior. Box office staff is just average. Concessions totally overpriced. Now, the hardest part...if you have been misbehaving lately, then those chairs there are patiently waiting to punish you, and they will. Chair spacing between rows is another issue, so make sure you are not very tall, and if you are tall and still want to go there, you may wish to wait a bit, as you know people shrink as they age :). In all seriousness, avoid the balcony as it has the least legroom. Enjoy!!",,,
3,P C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,26,0,5.0,10/29/2018,"Great repertory program, as well as interesting new indie releases. One of my favorite cinemas in the city. They often project prints here as well. I haven't been here for the bar or restaurant.",,,
4,Colin K.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",131,299,28,5.0,7/20/2018,"This gem of a theater, discreetly tucked away on Ludlow St. in the LES, has a constantly-refreshing stock of movies playing, from indie movies to throwback blockbusters.  They also run lots of cool themes, such as a full week dedicated to Stanley Kubrick or another influential director.  That's what initially lured me in!  Finding this place on Google, I found out they had an upcoming rotation of Kubrick movies, so of course I stopped in and saw Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, and the Shining all in the same week!  Such a cool thing to do.The theater itself has a throwback art-house feel to it.  It's very easy to miss from the street (there is no outdoor signage for the theater), but once you step in you'll appreciate the ambience they've cultivated; art deco appropriations and velvet carpet abound.  It feels like you're stepping back into the 50's when you come here.  They have a restaurant on the upstairs part (I haven't tried yet) and a bar downstairs, as well as a nicely-stocked concession stand.  The only thing that would be nice is if you could bring alcoholic drinks into the theaters...I'd love to sit and watch a Kubrick movie with Old Fashioned in-hand.  Otherwise, this theater is the place to be if you're looking to catch some interesting offbeat movies.",2,,
5,Rima F.,"New York, NY",179,391,12,5.0,5/6/2018,Lovely theater with very interesting films and events.  Kind of like a mini MoMA film place. Comfortable restaurant upstairs.

6,Sam H.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,169,21,4.0,12/2/2017,"After seeing Kedi, Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Lost Highway here, this place has grown on me. Sure, the stiff seats are butt-numbing and the ""artisanal"" popcorn is stale, but the programming is really, really good. I seldom go a week or month without there being something I want to see here, and the fact that they're currently running a series called ""Goth(ic)"" for the entire month of December is such a great way to attract moviegoers looking for a darker edge in the midst of the holiday cheer. I mean, I can't remember the last time I had tickets for more than 1 film in a one-month NYC cinema series, including at BAM. Also, their programs are designed super lovingly and lushly produced with great ""liner notes,"" which denotes care and respect for the moviegoer. It's a shame the theater itself is so uncomfortable (if you're prone to pins and needles, prepare to shift around) but I *am* glad they have ADA seating. As for the ""Commissary"" restaurant (I've been twice; for brunch and dinner/cocktails), the dinner menu is expensive but serviceable new American bistro fare, and the brunch menu has very few really delicious things with fruit and vegetables, so think eggs and hollandaise.  All in all, I'd say this is the sexiest date ambiance you're going to get in a cinema in NYC. Low lighting, leather and velvet couches, mind-melting films, and a decent mixologist behind the stick.",6,,
7,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1723,604,7753,5.0,6/8/2017,"I love the movies and going to the movies is an absolute treat for me! When I heard Metrograph was doing a full Terry Zwigoff marathon and that the director himself would be there, it was a must!I am a huge fan of Ghost World and I've never seen it in the big screen. And thanks to Meteograph, that was about to change. And my heart completely melted into a puddle under my seat when I knew I would be hearing the Q&A with Zwigoff and another fave of mine, Steve Buscemi!! They told the most hilarious ScarJo stories and also visits to Playboy Mansion sans ScarJo but showing Crumb. Heffner was a bit of a comic book artist.My friend and I ordered tickets online, weeks in advance!! She was even able to get a seat right next to me. I kinda liked the assigned seating so I didn't have to leave work early to claim a spot. The early show was completely sold out. I came close to the wire.There are concessions which I will check out next time but this time I didn't want to miss a minute. This is not a table service type theater. I now follow this theater in Instagram and Facebook and their film selections are spot on. They know they stuff!! I look forward to spending some uber hot summer evenings or crisp winter Sunday afternoon at this spot!",3,,2

9,Earl G.,"New York, NY",81,1,0,1.0,10/15/2018,"With the seats made out of recycled barrels, the most uncomfortable seating in the NYC (and I've sat in plastic cheap dirty folding chairs at other venues).  Surprisingly the reclaimed wood can also be broken as well as a complete back destroying experience.  I've given this theater many chances because of the selection of rare movies that are curated.  The lovely and informative brochures.  The best single stall bathroom in the city with its fancy artisanal soap... but something really screwed up happened.Sold out Tom Savini show.  I had called the theater ahead of time to ask if i had a picture of the ticket, I could give it to my friend and they approved.  We are a part of a meetup and he offered the ticket for free to any who would claim it.  I get a text from him saying that he wanted to confirm the photo of the ticket was ok, and that he would pass it along at the theater since no one claimed it.  He told the box office who took my information, then when someone came in to go and buy a ticket, the box office told them they couldnt use my picture of the ticket, then proceeded to sell them my seat.  A seat that i paid for.  The box office attendee had charged another person for my ticket.  My friends were so angry.  I was bedridden at the time and surprisingly the box office would not take my calls!  I wanted an explanation and i couldnt leave a voice message, because the box office voicemail box was full!  Talk about terrible communication.  I tried again Sunday and no answer.  I left a message for the manager, and no response.  W.T.F.So this is the final straw.  I'm done with this theater.  I will never recommend the theater to any souls even if there is a rare feature that is exclusive to this place.  It's a shame.  The potential for greatness is there, but bad staff combined with uncomfortable seating, you're going to have a bad time.",,,
10,Gary R.,"New York, NY",0,18,3,2.0,4/11/2018,"This theater has great programming, special events, good movies, and it's a cool space. This is the good news. The bad news is if you become a member, their website (logging in, purchasing tickets) is absolutely HORRIBLE. It's confusing, it usually does not work, it's the most frustrating thing ever. For reasons which escape me, purchasing tickets is so much easier and straight forward if you're a non-member. Logging in and purchasing tickets as a member has been a NIGHTMARE, and often special events are only open to members. Also, don't ever email them, because you won't get a response, and if you call, you'll only get an opportunity to leave a voice message which won't get returned. It's too bad, I really REALLY want to love this theater--and in some ways I do--but for the reasons I've outlined above they definitely need to work on enhancing their customer service which currently is really bad.",3,,
11,Kate S.,"New York, NY",76,679,3081,4.0,11/4/2017,"I like coming to this movie theater because it has a cozy feeling and it plays some very interesting films that you will not see elsewhere. That being said, having been here several times, I feel that as much as I enjoy the old timey retro feeling and the décor in the actual movie theater, the chairs are not very comfortable. So my only complaint is I wish they could somehow make the chairs more comfortable to sit in so the movie watching experience is more enjoyable.",1,,
12,Cristina X.,"New York, NY",434,447,3554,5.0,1/16/2017,A hidden gem in LES!! Amazing amazing movie selection--mostly independent or very classic ones and only in 35mm film. Highly recommend purchasing the tickets online before your visit (can choose seats in advance too). There is also a lovely bar/cafe on the second floor where you can grab coffee/lunch bites/drinks.,10,3,7
13,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,9/12/2017,"Metrograph is probably offering the best programming in New York currently.Sure, you've got Anthology and IFC Center and Film Forum and Quad Cinema and well actually New York has a lot of great programming. Still, I seem to turn to Metrograph most frequently. They have a few new offerings, but the majority are cult classics, movies you should've watched by now, and movies you've never heard of. They have some sweet, sweet '70s content lately.Tickets are typically $15, which is average for Manhattan. What I cannot abide, price-wise, are the concessions. One cup of popcorn (pre-popped) and a sparkling water was $10.My other annoyance is how early you have to plan ahead. For example, last Saturday when I went to the 6:30 pm showing of Tarkovsky's Stalker, there were only a handful of seats left around noon. If you show up without tickets for most screenings, you'll be out of luck. The earlier the better, as the seats are sloped on a relatively flat grade, leaving the short sitting in the back with some difficulties.Regardless, recommended. Stylish theater with thought provoking content, and low-key food and beverage offerings in the neighborhood (Kiki's, Jajaja, 169 Bar)-- you can't go wrong for a hipster date.",1,1,1
14,Caroline D.,"Santa Monica, CA",118,137,78,5.0,10/23/2017,This is definitely my fave movie theatre in the city.

17,Noah I.,"New York, NY",8,104,255,5.0,2/10/2018,High Fashion version of an independent movie theater. Very short walk to the East Broadway stop on the F train.

18,Heather M.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,83,2,2.0,11/11/2017,"We got to see a great old film on the big screen tonight but $120 later, we're 99% sure we'll never be back. The reviews that all mention the awful seats are spot on. I just can't imagine how anyone tested out these seats and thought they were good for a theater. Good luck getting comfortable. They're hard, stiff and angled oddly forward. It's 40 degrees out and I'm pretty sure there was little to no heat on in the theater. Cheaping out on heat is a lame move when tickets are 15 bucks and candy isn't cheap. We had dinner upstairs before the movie and it was a complete waste of money. The burrata came out so cold, right from the fridge, you could barely taste anything. The steak came out very very rare rather than medium rare. They refired it but didn't bother to refresh the fries so they were old and soggy. The steak, cooked properly the 2nd time, turned out to be a tough crappy cut. The chicken entree had a nice sauce but was completely dry and overcooked. It was about on par with chain hotel food. But since they clearly spent money making the place look so pretty, we expected much more. The manager did take the steak off our bill which is appreciated but we'd prefer to pay full price for an awesome meal and experience. Great movies coupled with the facade of a great theater. Unfortunately it was so uncomfortable and disappointing I find it hard to imagine any reason to ever go back.",6,3,1

The candy selection is the BEST! Not better than Mr Toback's Q & A at the end of the film but darn good. He's a good story teller. I've included a clip in my review. Check it out for a chuckle.",,,

Brunch upstairs at the ""commissary"" and then downstairs for a screening of Mildred Pierce (be glad I didn't pick Mommie Dearest, mother). The restaurant has a cool and relaxed nod to the 40's. Food is as I expected- satisfactory. You're paying for the ambience and access to the theatre. But! Don't despair, food is fine. Mom was very happy with the unique decor and friendly, young waitstaff. Good meetup for friends or perhaps a date night. The theatre downstairs was comfortable.

21,Javier M.,"New York, NY",718,388,174,5.0,9/16/2017,"If we were to compare computers or cell phones to movie theaters, Alexander Olchs would be the Steve Jobs of cinema; he has given New York and the world the most stylish, eclectic and flamboyant movie theater and curatorial programming to-date (not that apple is that eclectic and flamboyant but I digress), and I should have told him so when I chanced upon him on Canal and Orchard this past 4th of July Weekend (sorry again Alex)Metrograph is the dandy of cinemas; brick warehouse on the outside, fin de siècle detail and space modern appurtenances vying for supremacy on the inside and upstairs, at the Commissary restaurant and cafe. The theater features seats that are a crossbreed of Titanic-era deck chairs and old Opera red upholstery, and a corner bookstore filled with choice film literature. Want to buy Robert Bresson's ""Notes on the Cinematograph"" while munching away strawberry Pocky sticks? You got it. Want some Avocado toast with anchovies and a Bloody Mary while you unfurl your laptop and do some work? Come sit upstairs, the Commissary has a perfect nook for you. But first and foremost of all is the variety and decided vitality of the movie programming in a city that already had a highly discriminating battle royal between the BAM, Film Forum, MoMi and MoMa, The FS of Lincon Center, Anthology Film Archives, and the now resuscitated (and extremely dapper) Quad (Landmark as well, but now sadly with its days counted), Metrograph enters the fray as an enfant terrible, effectively changing the dynamic that existed before, forcing a cinephile to make choices: Are we going to see the Marlene Dietrich retrospective at Metrograph, or one at Film Forum? You have to choose. Since Metrograph happened, I find myself constantly scrambling plans to fit a just announced must-see, and it's not always possible. Hence, missed out on extremely rare chances to see, for example, Chris Marker's ""Congo Oyé"", or Albert Maysles ""In transit"" (also shown at MoMi a few weeks afterwards. Coincidence?), but got the chance to see Rohmer's ""Rayon Vert"", or Josef Von Sternberg's ""Anatahan"" for the first time, among many others. Thank you Metrograph. So come thither film lover, and experience movies the way an intellectual fashionista thinks you should. You'll be dazzled. Now, if only the deck chairs would recline.... *hint* but I'll give you all my stars, nonetheless. Keep up the good job Metrograph!*I left out Videology, Film Noir and Syndicated, all in Brooklyn on purpose. The Roxy Cinema @ the Roxy Hotel in TribeCa as well.

The seats are cool looking and fit the art house vibe, but they are extremely uncomfortable. It's like sitting in a wooden fold-out chair for two hours. The concessions are almost worse. They sell tiny overpriced packages of popcorn that are often days old. (The popping date is stamped on the package, which I guess is supposed to be a good thing??) And the service, at least when I went, was practically non-existent. If you wander in for the first time and are not sure where you're headed, don't expect anyone working there to notice or point you in the right direction.Five stars for playing the films other theaters don't, one star for every other part of the experience.",4,1,2

As Elaine Benes put it: ""It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films."" One-star for a genuinely charming staff and the occasionally good people watching, if you like watching the nouveau riche pseudo-bohemian class toasting themselves for their insufferable éclat with $14 gin and tonics.

33,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",289,244,358,5.0,5/9/2016,"""We have to go for the experience,"" I was told. I grumbled about the fact that we were watching a movie that we've seen many times and one which we *own*, but I was persuaded and equally eager to prove him wrong. I could not prove him wrong. Metrograph is located on Ludlow Street near Canal in an area you wouldn't expect to find a theater. We had purchased tickets beforehand (with reserved seating!), so we just had to show the PDF on a phone. As we walked in, there was a huge sign above the box office area with the day's films, and an even cuter concession area. Typical movie theater candy boxes lined fancy shelves along with Pocky boxes, pistachios, and packaged popcorn. Everything was pretty overpriced, but it was aesthetically pleasing.There were only two screens here: one with a balcony, and another smaller one without. The seats were wooden seats lined with velvet cushions, so they weren't the most comfortable, but we had the opportunity of being in the larger theater where the screen was pretty big and the sound was great. Metrograph curates films and typically shows them in 35mm prints. They often devote a couple of days to a week to a certain film, director, or theme. They even have an alphabet series in which they showcase must-see films of/from different genres and countries in alphabetical order. Make sure to grab a booklet with you! It includes the dates of movies being shown at Metrograph in the next two months. You'll leave impressed and excited to plan your next visit. ----Likelihood of another visit:After the movie, we went upstairs and looked at the gorgeous commissary and tiny bookstore corner. They currently only do dinners, but will offer brunch and lunch service soon. I can't wait to come back. I'll gladly buy a membership since I'm interested in so many of the movies being shown here.",11,,9
34,Min T.,"Dallas, TX",159,140,684,4.0,3/30/2016,"**At the time of this review, the theater is still incomplete.**The invention of smartphones outdated brick cell phones decades ago. In a similar way, Metrograph quietly opened last month at Lunar New Year with an ambition of innovating the normal functionalities of a movie theater. There will soon be a complex bar and restaurant space inside this arthouse theater. I pay a visit to the half-done theater and witness its potential in the business. Wooden chairs in red velvet have a nice old-school vibe. Leg room at each seat is a first class experience. For now, it is these seats that cover all inconveniences of the one-month-old indie theater. Here are some highlights: - LOCATION: The theater is between a funeral services building and a fish market. Really?! I didn't expect a former food storage warehouse to become Manhattan's new arthouse. Looks don't matter, but in an area where every building has the same brick color, the possibility of missing the spot is high. And even at an unflattering location, a ticket in the afternoon on a weekday is $12. Needless to say, prices in the evening are surely higher. Metrograph has 2 screens: a small 46-seat and another 166-seat theater. One big perk is that you can choose your own seat at the cashier. The bigger theater has a balcony with 2 rows of chairs, very similar to the Paris Theater, but new chairs at Metrograph are much more comfortable. - AIM FOR THE BALCONY: The view from the balcony is fantastically the best for your cinematic experience. But the stairway to my scenic balcony is quite laborious. Seating starts exactly 5 minutes before show time, but I cannot sit in the lounge yet because it is not finished (only at the time of the review). Then before entering the balcony, a ticket staff has to point a flashlight to the entrance door for me because the room is too dark. I excuse Metrograph for being a newly born baby in the theater industry. Anyhow from any seat, anyone should be able to enjoy a very wide view of the screen. - CONCESSIONS: Futuristic concession boxes are backlit at the center of the lobby. Motley candy and snack packages are organized in white office drawers. Japanese snack fans may recognize overpriced Pocky and gummy candy. The concessions here are beyond classic popcorn and soda - olive oil/turmeric popcorn and craft bottled sodas. No movie popcorn smell, but organic boutique-esque, eh? Cheers to concessions with a side of healthcare and natural farming. -STAFF: A shout-out to the staff. People here are young and very friendly. They keep apologizing for the annoying aspects of an incomplete theater. So, what's next to expect? A small film bookstore, a restaurant, and 2 full bars are being added to Metrograph. New wooden bars, new tables, and new sofas are already set out upstairs. I am told that the whole project is expected to be complete in a few weeks. Metrograph also joins the film club of 35mm prints. Before entering the balcony, you can see through 2 projection rooms. Even in a digital era, someone's got to show movies in their original format, and Metrograph pledges to do so since the opening day. I look forward to upcoming programs behind the doors of Metrograph.",12,,7

I do not want to be distracted by heat/humidity while sitting through a movie. The bar is cute, but they serve beer in these fake miniature pint glasses that probably house 9 ounces of beer, I ordered an IPA and got a Pilsner for $8.

36,Chaya C.,"New York, NY",9,36,0,5.0,1/12/2017,"I wasn't happy with this movie theatre when I came here intially within the first couple of weeks when it first opened. But I thought hey, they're new, they need to iron out their kinks. And iron out they did.Love, love, love this place. Staff -- the ticket sellers, floor staff, the commissary (I guess that belongs to another review), bookstore --  are genuinely friendly, pleasant, informed, and welcoming. Great selection of films (mostly independent, obscure, under-the-radar films. But they do occasionally show popular films  under a nicely curated theme, like ""Die Hard"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as part of their Christmas/Holiday themed movies). Films that are made and worth seeing  on a big screen esp. in 35mm. The talks after a film are great, very informative and stimulating. Aliza Ma, who mostly have the talks with the filmmakers, is lovely, smart, erudite, and congenial. Would love to have a drink or talk with her at the commissary or at the lobby and just be blown away by her. The audience aren't bunch of snobs and thumbs their nose to their fellow film-goers; they're there to enjoy the film as much as you do and you get into a considerable conversation with them before or after the film -- it's a social ritual. Still waiting for them to offer a membership. Overall a splendid cinema and wonderful experience when seeing a film here.",13,1,1

Even though I'm more interested in seeing new foreign films, the pleasure of watching films in this location would incline me to go here even if the film they were showing wasn't my top choice.A HUGE perk of coming here, putting Metrograph in the 1% of NYC movie theaters, is having assigned seats (and giving you the ability to buy online early and reserve good seats). The rest of the world has managed the assigned seating trick for decades, but alas this feature is still cutting edge for us poor American movie-goers.",,,

It has a thoughtful selection of films that aren't so artistic that a commoner like me can't appreciate or understand but enough specialization to distinguish it from other theaters of its kind. The seats are comfortable enough the screen is a good viewing distance I recommend the back so you don't have to crane your neck. But I was very comfortable for a 123 min feature.The snacks like most theaters are expensive but also well thought out. Would definitely go back and recommend this place to all my friends.

51,Davian H.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,107,0,4.0,2/17/2017,"I'm a fan! The Metrograph is wonderful. Movie selection - really unique and broad spectrum in terms of genre and tastes. Location - close to the F train, and there were plenty of Ubers/Taxis in the area.Decor - Loved it! Loved the whole scene. Spacious and and sleek without being sterile, and because of the bar and commissary, a very festive vibe. They had fresh flowers around, too, which is a nice touch. Even the chairs in the theater were beautiful - a kind of weathered wood look. Reminded me of half of a wine barrel. Theater - I was surprised by how big the theater was! Despite seeing the seating map when selecting seats, I was expecting a TINY theater, akin to the some of the smaller theaters at the IFC. This was a good size, and the seats were on a graduated incline so the view wasn't blocked, at all.Food & Beverage - didn't eat at the Commissary but would like to next time. Movie concession snack choice was good, lots of domestic and foreign candies and treats. I was disappointed with the popcorn situation. A few small improvements can make it 5 star.1) The popcorn situation - it's prepackaged ""flavored"" popcorn in plastic containers. It was tasty enough (the flavor was sea salt and olive oil). But the portion was relatively small for $6, and it was room temp. I was hoping for at least a regular movie fresh popcorn option.2) Streamline the service a touch. Everybody was very nice, but there were some informational lapses that could have been avoided. Stood in line to ""check in"" at the box office per the email I received after purchasing my ticket online, and then when I got up there they said I didn't need to check in, and to just show my ticket when it was time to go into the movie. Ok, so why did I stand on line? Wasn't clear what food we could bring into the theater without asking - like could we order food from the commissary or bar and bring it in? No. Concessions only. Seats in the ""bookstore"" area? Could you sit there and order drinks? Not really, but we'll let you so long as you don't read the books. Little stuff, but I spent a lot of time asking staff questions because things weren't exactly clear. But I do want to reiterate that everybody was nice, and accommodating. There's just some confusion that can be avoided, especially for first-timers.I hope to enjoy many more movies here in the future!!!",3,,

53,Matt K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,0,3.0,2/16/2017,"Nice theater, certainly the most stylish and upscale of all repertory theaters in NYC thanks to the design and numerous amenities. There's one significant flaw and that's sound - they need to cover the exposed brick, at least put up some panels, there's no excuse not to. For this reason, I still prefer to catch a film at the Walter Reade, MoMI and MoMA (unless it's a film that's not likely to play outside of Metrograph anytime soon).UPDATE: They've finally installed sound panels on the walls, so the acoustics are no longer horrible. I finally checked out the restaurant upstairs, and the food was mediocre. It looked nice but otherwise tasted pretty underwhelming. I suppose the convenience is the selling point, but if that was imperative, I'd rather eat at the Modern, which is located right next to MoMA's theater, or eat at Lincoln Center Kitchen (or Indie Food & Wine), which are more or less next door to their theaters too.",2,1,1
54,Eric N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,4.0,11/29/2017,"Great programming, showing a wide range of films. The commissary is pretty cool, with some good drinks and food. My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the seats are very uncomfortable. I would go much more often if it had better seats. By the hour or so mark, I'm fidgeting in my seat for the remainder of the movie. Nonetheless, I'm thankful this place exists.",,,
55,Jeremy M.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,17,1,4.0,4/2/2017,"I love this place and will likely be a regular. (Having relocated away from the east coast shortly after it first opened, and then come back, I missed most of its first year but have been going a lot recently now that I have the opportunity.) The lack of that last star is due to relatively minor things that nonetheless could be improved on, but which will not stop me from coming back again and again.First off, the main reason to go to Metrograph is the film selection. It is one of the better theaters in the city to catch newer smaller and indie releases, which is saying something as relative to most cities NYC offers an embarrassment of riches in that department. Maybe even better though, in its regular rotation the Metrograph includes a number of different film series and classics around different themes - as of the time of this writing, for instance, they've been running a series including various sci-fi films involving cyborgs and artificial intelligence, and on tap are series like films David Letterman made cameos in (what an eclectic choice) and various Universal Pictures releases from the '70s. When listing the films on its site, The Metrograph helpfully indicates how the film is being screened - i.e. digital or 35mm - and the 35mm selections are quite plentiful and appreciated. Although there are some other theaters that do this (the IFC for instance), it's still a rarity to be able to see films on actual film prints these days, and Metrograph seems to make a pretty concentrated effort to show as many of its older films in that format as possible. In my experience the prints are usually quite nice, too. (Obviously some specs and scratches will come with the territory, but it's so much richer and nicer than most film projections these days, and especially as compared to most mainstream theaters' projections of classics which often look very cheap. No joke, outside of New York I've had theaters charge money for screenings of Blu-Ray/DVD copies before. I saw the menus come up at the end.) While the midnight movie circuit in particular at other theaters can be a bit repetitious, even the mainstream films at Metrograph are pretty varied - how often can you see the likes of A.I.: Artificial Intelligence or Beavis and Butthead Do America in the revival theaters these days? On authentic film projection prints no less?The space itself is also pretty nice. The lobby is clean and pleasant, and in my experience the employees are friendly and helpful. The seats are comfortable enough and the theater rooms are among the nicer ones I've been in. Now, there are some drawbacks. The first problem is that the theaters are a bit small (although one of them is at least pretty good sized). This can be slightly disappointing when you've booked tickets for one of those rare classics, or even a newer film, and find that you're not getting the biggest screen in the world, although the screen itself is quite nice. The bigger problem though is simply that it can be hard to get tickets at all; although it will obviously vary by film, I wouldn't expect to be able to walk an hour before a screening and expect to get good seats. The seats themselves are by reservation and the good ones tend to fill up, sometimes well in advance (and often shows sell out). Thankfully, it's pretty easy to book tickets online (they don't even force you to make a log in with some external service like so many other theaters do), but it is something to keep in mind. There are also nice schedules put up every day in the lobby that show the times and which shows are sold out, but is simply an unavoidable problem of the relatively small space that unless you book well in advance you may be sitting in not the greatest seat or not be able to get in at all. So don't treat it as you would the multiplex and just show up assuming you'll get in!The other more avoidable problem is some of the prices; the tickets are fine (within the understanding that NYC ticket prices are always going to be a bit inflated, even at the multiplex), but the food prices are really kind of ridiculous. 6 dollars gets you a popcorn, which sounds fine until you realize it's a pretty small, pre-packed box of popcorn that hasn't been heated or anything and can be finished well before the trailers have finished rolling. The popcorn itself is tasty enough, but it's just not really worth the price. The candy is similarly absurd (four dollars for gummy bears, four or five for a box of Dots, etc) and while I appreciate the interesting choice of Mexican sugar Coca-Cola as a drink option, the drink options are also overpriced as well as pretty limited. I believe there is a bar available which I have not sampled, but as far as the traditional snack and beverage choices I usually just skip them and plan on eating elsewhere before or after. Despite these drawbacks, though, I highly recommend the Metrograph and would consider it one of the best film going experiences in NYC today.",,1,

57,Jonathon F.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,189,96,5.0,4/17/2016,"A welcome addition to the city's cultural scene. This cinema in its self is restrained, intelligent and stylish.

The staff are beautiful humans interested in others, and, one can surmise, good cinema. There is more to come. Perhaps too much more! A bookshop! A bar! A cafe! On top of all of this: THE PROGRAMMING IS UNDERSTATED GENIUS. I look forward to this place being a part of my cultural life.

They have the right idea - a beautiful interior, great film options, and a community space for *almost* everyone. Metrograph, unfortunately, remains inaccessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing customers. They have refused to provide captioning options for their films.Despite repeated outreach to them and efforts to connect them with access providers, their demonstrated disregard (evidenced by being ignored and lack of follow-up) for the value of equal access for all customers has been, at best, disappointing.I hope that this review will encourage them to follow the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act (as other theaters are doing), and - like making sure people in wheelchairs can access these films - more of an effort will be made towards equal access for deaf and hard-of-hearing would-be customers.",16,,1

The seats aren't very comfortable the staff are far from helpful and had no idea what was going on and the scheduling between shows overlap each other a considerable amount. By far the worst part was the acoustics of the theater itself. No consideration was giving at all to the acoustics of the room it's nothing but a hard box. Brick wall on one side and Sheetrock on the other had to be on of the most unpleasant experiences I couldn't wait till the movie ended and my ears are still ringing some 2 hours later. For such a ""high class"" establishment you would think they would actually spend the money on the theatre movie watching experience and not just focus on a glitzy glam lobby.",9,6,2
63,Justin H.,"Manhattan, NY",42,11,0,4.0,12/23/2016,"This stylish boutique cinema that specializes in second run films was a fun little trip and worth the time for cinephiles. There were some unique quirks that hindered the experience. We did not get the opportunity to experience the commissary but we did have a glass of wine at the bar before seeing ""Die Hard"" as a special holiday screening. The entire lobby, bar and concession experience was wonderful. Attentive and polite staff bounce from station to station as needed. The concession area carries items for those who seek the more gourmet side of things as well as the traditional movie going snacks. My only complaint here, is that there is at this point no opportunity to purchase hot popcorn. The popcorn in this theatre is prepackaged in clear cups, flavored with olive oil and sea salt, which does sound delicious depending on your tastes. But it is slightly disappointing that fresh popcorn at a movie theatre isn't an option.Again ... this is a nitpick, a minor complaint at most. Be sure to pick up a free printed bi-monthly program, with some of the best graphic design for any cinema house. My only real complaints reside in the theater itself. Although the aesthetic is rustic and fun, the seats themselves grew to be very uncomfortable during the two hour and twelve minute run time. The padding on both the seat back and the seat itself, looks fantastic but unfortunately doesn't provide comfortability or support for extended periods. It also didn't help that the space felt sparsely air conditioned and without any sort of air movement whatsoever. Maybe it was just for this particular screening, but it was exceptionally stuffy and progressed to be so throughout the screening. Once these details are addressed, I would say this may be a mainstay for filmgoing in NYC.One Other Note: When I bought tickets to ""Die Hard"" I expected it to be a 35mm presentation. I thought (and must have been mistaken) when I purchased my tickets that it would be presented in glorious 35mm. It was a DCP projection. This could have changed since I purchased my tickets as many things can go wrong between an announcement of a second run film and a screening of said film. But I would suggest, especially, if these things are important to you, that you very carefully pay attention to the type of projection your are purchasing tickets for. (A good current example ""Carol"" for the Christmas season in the program boasts it will be shown in 35mm, on the website now clearly reads as a DCP projection.)",,,
64,Liz C.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",69,9,0,3.0,6/8/2016,"I really wanted to love this place. With theaters like Nitehawk in Brooklyn that combine high quality food with high quality films, this theater has a lot to live up to. We got a couple drinks ($10-$12 for wine, $8 for beer) while waiting to be admitted to the theater. I was about 3 sips in when they called for seating, but they don't allow drinks in the theater... Glass of wine went to waste as they seat 5 minutes before show time. My boyfriend didn't notice the petting zoo-like smell in the theater (like UCB theater anyone??) but that was another huge turn off. The film and south quality were good, and the seats were comfortable, but overall not work the expense and sense of pretentiousness the experience offered.",5,3,2
65,Leo S.,"New York, NY",20,41,9,2.0,3/19/2017,"Wanted to love this place, especially since they had a lovely Madonna retrospective a few months back. My first and probably last experience here though was disappointing. We arrived right at the time our showing was about to start but were made to wait in an extremely crowded lobby because they were ""running a few minutes behind"". Maybe they should pay closer attention to the running times of the films they are showing. Finally after about 15 minutes past scheduled start time people start to leave the theater. Then we have to wait for it to be cleaned. Finally we were let in and when I got to my seat it was broken. Slanted downward, I would be falling out of it throughout the 3 hour film. It was really annoying to sit in. My husband's chair was fine so I know it was an issue with my seat and not seating here in general. I went to inquire about being moved however they were sold out and the only option offered to me was sitting in a regular chair from their lobby which they would bring in to the very last row. Nope. Just give me a refund. They really tried to talk me out of it. Would I like to come back and see the 8 o'clock showing. Definitely not! Especially since it probably wouldn't be starting on time. Would I like a voucher. No. Finally the manager came to give me a refund but first had to comment how she sat in the chair and there was nothing wrong with it. Ok lady I guess I'm a nut who travelled all the way down here from the upper east side just to start problems. She figured me out.

But who makes a movie theater with solid brick and concrete walls? What terrible acoustics. The seats are classier looking but much less comfortable than a standard multiplex. They have assigned seating (which I know I am in the minority for not being a huge fan of) but I have gone to shows where they switched theaters and told you to ""sit anywhere"" which is kind of a disappointment if you show up at the last minute thinking you had your perfect seat already secured. Concessions are also fancier but even more overpriced than a standard theater. I'll be back on occasion when they're showing something that is playing nowhere else in the city but the whole design is style over utility and I'm always going to pick the theater with the best sound and sight-lines over the theater that looks cool and old fashioned.",1,,

68,Ian J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,70,0,4.0,3/15/2016,"I've already been to several films here. Overall I'm a fan and am trying to overlook some of the more annoying aspects as they've just opened. Movie start times have definitely been operating as a suggestion which can be problematic when you have an expectation of start/end times and have planned your day/night accordingly. The clientele has been all over the place - one would have expected cinephiles but there have been a lot of people who have just seemed to wander in. The Kim K. soundalike behind me for a Goddard film who told her friend she struggled to stay awake was a real treat. Nothing can take me out of the cinematic experience and make me homicidal like people talking or texting during a film and of the 5 films I've been to so far, 3 have featured these behaviors. Perhaps a little intro reminder to people that they aren't in their living room and to not be barbarians? Snacks and beverages are insanely overpriced but unique (Pocky, fancy flavored popcorn already packaged, Boylan's soda, etc). No real communication from staff when things are running behind or even when they are seating a film. Pre-buy tickets to select your seats online, rows are roomy, seats are comfortable enough, and overall a great addition to the cinema scene in NYC. Ticket prices are too steep for me to continue going at such a break-neck pace ($15 a ticket adds up quickly and unless their membership offers equally generous discounts as my other theater memberships I won't be purchasing one) and I'll be curious to see how they alter their programming schedule as most screenings I've been to have been 1/4 to 1/2 full. A bar, restaurant, and bookstore will also be opening in the space but I'm not sure when. The lobby already feels crowded when people are waiting to be seated so I don't know how the bar is going to work out. Time will tell.

If you care about design, art, and movies at all, or if you want to trick your date into think you do, Metrograph is your spot.",,,
75,Ken M.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,74,19,5.0,11/18/2016,"I've been to most of the independent movie theaters in NYC and Metrograph is currently my favorite. The programming is absolutely top notch, with films old and new (a good amount on 35mm). Lots of screenings have the cast or filmmakers present for a QnA session after the movie, I'm talking big name actors and filmmakers. The tickets are reserved seats so you don't have to rush to the theater early for a good seat. The monthly program books they put out are beautiful (and free!). The concessions are very unique and cool, and the bar/restaurant is really good, especially for a movie theater. The staff has always been very friendly, helpful, and not pretentious at all. And most important, the projection, seats, and sound systems are very very good. I highly recommend The Metrograph if you are looking for a good place to check out unique films and have a pleasant viewing experience. Best place to see a movie in all of NYC.",1,,
76,Dan J.,"Ithaca, NY",0,4,0,5.0,1/18/2017,"Unbelievable programming, almost always shown on 35mm prints, friendly staff, spacious main screening room, new indies in a small second theater, classy bar. This place is an answer to prayer for New York cinephiles. Overpriced concessions, but that's going to the movies I guess.",,,
77,Jo C.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,5.0,3/21/2016,Very happy this place was created. The movie selection is a treat. The interior design (including snacks corner) adds to the vintage vibe. Thumbs up for the staff & the manager for being really kind & helpful. Be aware that tickets for some movies may sell out a few days in advance.,,,
78,J J.,"New York, NY",0,70,0,1.0,6/26/2016,"A retro theater to showcase films seems to be a welcome to the neighborhood.  It is located north of Ludlow at a street that is less than tidy (garbage amass).  As you enter, a front desk list the films time for purchase and a modern openly displayed concession stand in bright white with healthy variations.  But I'd notice the food items where sitting in dusty white shelves, would be nice if it were kept spotless, especially for those prices.  Then upstairs to the bookstore I heard about, I was surprised to see it was simply a shared small corner of an old selection of books.  The opposite end occupied their dining space, which is where most of the action takes places.  Overall, it may be a nice place to watch films, grab drinks, or to dine in less of a casual spot.  The stars I gave were simply for location purposes and simply the unnecessary need to highlight a non-existent bookstore and the unkempt concession stand.",1,1,1
79,Gail A.,"Manhattan, NY",173,90,7,5.0,10/10/2016,Every weekend they have a kids' movie at noon on Saturday and Sunday. It is a perfect family event. Old school movie theater with charm but great screen. The movie schedule is great and the snacks are great.  This is what a movie should be.,,,
80,Frank T.,"Brooklyn, NY",334,54,0,1.0,3/12/2016,The theater is in Chinatown and the theater itself feels like a plumbing company. The worst part are the seats which feel like cinder blocks. I won't be returning,2,4,2
81,Carla C.,"Manhattan, NY",10,156,0,5.0,7/24/2016,"Very cool theatre. Movie selection is eclectic, as are the snacks. And the restaurant upstairs (Metrograph Commissary) has excellent food and decor. I love being able to reserve seats.",,,
82,Ray V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,1,5.0,3/29/2016,"New Yorkers couldn't be luckier than to have the Metrograph added to a short list of serious film venues. While finding the theater was a little tricky, the experience was well worth it. The Metrograph is a great venue unlike the stereotypic multiplex stylized as tired hotels. Most important, the Metrograph's film offerings are very eclectic and provide filmgoers with much in entertainment opportunities. My only hope is the Metrograph consider offering a varied price structure (e.g. early bird rate, senior rate). Thanks Metrograph owner/staff for opening your doors to New York film lovers.",1,,
