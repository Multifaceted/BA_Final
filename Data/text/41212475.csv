0,Saba S.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,324,234,3.0,9/23/2015,"This is a campus cafe, so you can't expect much. The prices are reasonable and it's good enough for students. You can spend the whole afternoon working and no one will say anything. Been going there since 2006 and I can't complain much.",,,1
1,Winnie W.,"Pearl River, NY",252,40,70,1.0,4/29/2015,I should've left it 0 star but I had to write something . Moe's cafe is the worst cafe in this area . The owner is a thief . I witness the owner stealing a young girls phone and I couldn't believe my eyes . Do you honestly want to come to a cafe where the very own owner steals ?? I am very disappointed . The food is okay but I would never ever come here again .,1,2,1
