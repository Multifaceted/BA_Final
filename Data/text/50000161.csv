0,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,4.0,11/7/2018,"The food at Charlie Bird is simple, but elegant. I so enjoyed the Burrata appetizer, which was super fresh and delicious. And the Rigatoni Cacio e Pepe blew me away. Though the portion was ample, I could have eaten two or three servings just because it was so tasty! Service was decent, though the table space is tight which makes the intimate nature of the restaurant just a little too close for comfort with your neighbors.",2,1,3
1,Quin T.,"St. Charles, IL",125,540,4,5.0,9/26/2018,"I am really confused about the negative reviews. I LOVED this place. We had excellent service starting with the 2 hostesses we encountered when we entered the restaurant to our waitress Eunice who was so cool.While bobbing our heads to a great mix of hip hop we started out with the burrata and diver scallops that were both very good. Actually, the diver scallops were amazing! In addition to our apps, they also bring warm focaccia bread for the table. The bread was so good, that we requested another serving. For our main courses, we had the crispy farm chicken, summer spaghetti with lobster, zucchini, and basil, zucchini blossoms, and cacio e pepe. While I am not huge on chicken, this dish was excellent as was the spaghetti. The cacio e pepe was made with rigatoni and it was good, but it's usually best with spaghetti. For dessert, we had the chocolate budino and it was a great way to end the evening. Cocktails were great, music was great, service was great....what is there to complain about? I will definitely be back.",2,1,1
2,F G.,"New York, NY",101,23,2,3.0,9/5/2018,"I wouldn't go out of my way to return. I'd wanted to eat there for a while, and so my husband made a dinner reservation for my birthday.We walked in, were seated at a small table for two by the door and bar, crammed into a row of tables for two. It's a somewhat small, loud bi-level space. The scene reminded me of How to Make It in America--everyone was hustlin'. Lots of bro dates.It was noticeably hot. As our waiter took our wine order, I politely asked, ""Is it warm in here?"" He went on to say that the windows had been open and the A/C was just kicking in. Never happened.It was uncomfortable. People walked out. I went to the ladies' room twice because the air conditioning worked there and they also had a fragrant Aesop hand soap.The food was good, but forgettable. The farro salad was the clear standout--fresh, flavorful, and satisfying. The zucchini blossoms and roasted octopus were fine. Pastas (cavatelli and cacio e pepe) were standard. Nothing to write home about, and smallish portions for the price ($22-$26 per pasta).My biggest takeaway was that the service was inattentive/inept. They handled (ignored) the extreme heat poorly. A manager came around to ask if we ""had everything we needed."" She was flushed and sweating--and in denial.A small token (gelato on the house?) or even just being upfront about the situation would have gone a long way.",1,,
3,Victoria G.,"Fairfield, CT",103,43,253,3.0,8/17/2018,"I had very high expectations for this place because my friend had gone and raved about it. When we ate dinner, the raw appetizers were the highlight, but that was about it. The main dishes came extremely slowly and they were a lot smaller than expected. We had a party of six and they seated us in a corner that had five spots. The employees were very uncooperative and we had to awkwardly stand at the cramped entrance until someone led us to a table with enough legroom. The meals were agonizingly disappointing and the entire atmosphere was very loud - I couldn't really hear what my friends were saying. Overall, just a disappointing dinner that started out with great hopes.",1,,
4,Pamela A.,"New York, NY",157,313,685,5.0,8/3/2018,Delicious dinner! Great spot downtown with nice views. The outdoor seating is awesome for summer.   It was my first time but definitely not last! All the pastas and roses were great!,,,
5,Oliver S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,112,1,4.0,7/10/2018,"Went to Charlie Bird for an unemployment lunch. Liked the hip-hop music because it meant the restaurant is trendy. Liked the service because it was good and attentive. Ordered the chicken liver and the gnocchi with an iced tea to wash it all down. I'm not sure how big a chicken liver is, but I'd guess this dish contains a small village of chickens. It made me feel guilty. The chicken liver was spread over toast and topped with a cherry compote. It reminded me of an earthy and umami unsweetened PB&J. But while eating a ton of peanut butter isn't, like, weird, it felt kind of strange to ingest half a pound or so of liver. It tasted good but I'd rather eat something similarly tasty that has less chicken liver. The gnocchi was really good but not too memorable. It was served with tomato sauce and a little bowl of chili oil, which was a nice touch.",1,,
6,Desiree M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",170,78,123,5.0,7/23/2018,Amazing meal. Order the razor clams radicchio salad and special lava cake dessert with olive oil ice cream.,,,

8,Moniece W.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,5,0,1.0,11/17/2018,Work for a delivery service the kitchen is VERY VERY VERY VERY SLOW when going to pick up an order you are prompted to walk downstairs and ask for the order YOU ARE NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED very rude.  Have been there multiple times and had problems with this. Makes it hard to do your job when THE WHOLE STAFF IN THE KITCHEN IGNORES YOU!!,,,
9,Diana H.,"Houston, TX",190,127,348,3.0,10/19/2017,"In the typical New York fashion, the restaurant was pretty small with limited indoor seating and maybe 2-3 tables outside. They have large French style doors to open the restaurant up, which I hope they only do when the weather is decent. Across the street is a highly active fire station. Emphasis on highly active. Their choice of music? Old school hip hop. I definitely was not expecting that, but it fits. This is New York. Anything goes. -Farro - (4/5) with honeynut squash, arugula, parmigiano and pistachio - I thought this dish just tasted healthy, something you could find in the Whole Foods prepared food section. It was very simple and the parmigiano gave it a nice salty bite ($18)- Chicken Liver - (5/5) with pear mostarda & grilled cibatta - This was the most surprising dish of the night for me. I normally would never choose this because of the fact that it is liver, but I'm glad that we had a liver lover at our table lol. It was incredibly smooth, creamy and flavorful. Just a warning to ladies, it will get all over your lips and you have to pick it up. It was impossible to try and cut it. I did wish the cibatta was a bit more toasted to offset the creaminess. ($16)- Roasted Octopus - with N'duja, green chiles and mint - (4/5) octopus was really tender. ($19)- Burrata - with pumpkin, hazelnuts & grilled cibatta (3/5) - burrata is mozzarella and cream. It was pretty flavorless... just a creamy texture. I think it should have been paired with a salty item ($18)- Live Diver Scallop - with meyer lemon & pistachio - (4/5) I cannot believe we literally got one scallop  lol. Not worth the price, but it was good nonetheless.The citrus kind of overpowered the scallop and you're left with just the texture. ($16)- Razor Clams - with fennel & pickled chiles - (4/5) You get 4 razor clams. Same comment as the scallops. ($17)- Carmelized cauliflower - with calabrian chile, mint and pine nuts - (3/5) thought the cauliflower could've been cooked more and more flavor added to it. ($13)- hand cut french fries - with rosemary & sea salt (5/5) - thin, crispy and not greasy. I'm pretty sure I ate half. ($10)I'm going to stop here and say to just get the appetizers. The large plates didn't appeal to any of us. The pastas didn't wow me and were salty. (3/5)- Agnolotti - with prosciutto, game hen, brown butter and sage ($22)- Cavatelli Campidanese - with sausage ragu, saffron and kale ($23)- Cacio e pepe - no longer on the menu but they allowed us to order it. - SALTY. Would I come back? I don't think so... For the price, I expected more. You are definitely paying for ambiance, which gets killed by the fire station. Maybe if i was craving some chicken liver lol.",5,1,3
10,Ellen H.,"Manhattan, NY",37,52,6,2.0,7/30/2018,"This is my second visit to Charlie Bird and the food was just as I remembered - tasty, but nothing to write home about. Diver scallops were fresh and well seasoned, artichokes were nicely cooked, burrata was actually heavenly and spaghetti was just okay. And if things ended there, I would give it a solid 3 stars. But the reason why I am giving it two stars is because of the POOR HYGIENE we experienced. Immediately upon sitting down at our outdoor table, we noticed that wafts of sewage smell was drifting into our noses. We told our waitress about it and she very dryly answered ""this is new york"". Yes we know that, but I've never experienced this WHILE sitting at a restaurant's terrace. Needless to say, this foul smell interfered with our enjoyment of the meal.BUT more horrendous was the fact that midway through the dinner, we heard a scream from a lady at another table. As we turned around, we spotted the source of her distress - a huge rat was running through the terrace towards the garbage area behind the restaurant (where the sewage smell was coming from). This happened not once, but MULTIPLE TIMES.For a restaurant like Charlie Bird, this is totally unacceptable and I hope that management will be smart enough to address these issues promptly. Until then, I'll take my pasta cravings elsewhere...",6,1,1
11,Lin C.,"New York, NY",616,85,288,5.0,4/4/2018,"I've been eyeing this place for about 3 years now. I interviewed a chef who mentioned this was her favorite restaurant so I added it to my long list of restaurants. I stopped by for lunch on a weekday and I was blown away. Everything looked so good! From the appetizers, I tried the fresh oysters, razor clams, clam toast, chilled lobster, diver scallops. My favorite without a doubt was the scallops. Just divine. I can probably live without the clam toast, it was a little too salty for me. As for entree, I got the tagliatelle- which I highly recommend. I'm already thinking about my next meal here and hopefully it'll be for dinner. That menu looks lovely. I'll be back!!!!",3,,1
12,Amanda G.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,11,8,5.0,9/3/2018,"I was treated to dinner here a week ago and I haven't stopped dreaming about the suckling pig since. It was amazing. Also amazing was the wine, the cheese, the pasta, the dessert, basically everything. I can't wait to come back!!!",,,
13,Ayumi W.,"San Francisco, CA",394,175,325,4.0,10/28/2017,"We sat outside in a nice crisp evening. We were seated when we arrived at 9pm on a Friday. The bumping hip hop music seems off with the fancy dinner but I kind of liked it. We ordered the Burrata, the Octopus, and the Monkfish. burrata - Delicious! I loved it on top of the pumpkin and hazelnut. Order! I couldn't stop eating it. Octopus - very tender and flavorful. Has a nice spicy kick to it. Order!Monkfish - not as flavorful as I would have thought though the staff recommended it. It was too salty. Penicillin drink - not strong enough",,,
14,J C.,"New York, NY",10,32,4,1.0,10/2/2018,"My girlfriend and I wanted to celebrate a little anniversary that we had. So we went to Charlie Bird for a nice bottle of wine, a little stake, burrata... etc.We opted to sit outside, so they put us in the darkest corner outside of the restaurant, closest to the garbage which smelt just as you would expect.We both work hard in the entertainment business and since we weren't wearing a suit and tie. The host (I'm guessing) believed we weren't going to spend a lot of money. We looked young, probably because we look good. But I'm 35 and we make very good money. We ended up jumping up from the table because a huge COCKROACH started crawling up the wall less the 6 inches from my face. They moved us inside and we finished our date.COCKROACH ASIDE - I honestly wasn't that impressed with the food to be honest. I had heard good things, but it honestly wasn't anything special. I have been to many different restaurants around the city and in brooklyn. This place is subpar. Of course when we left, I saw a young couple sitting at that terrible table outside. They looked miserable. The truth is, unless you look like you went to Yale and you have money.... I would suggest spending $400 for two elsewhere. Overall, huge waste of money. Oh but they gave us free still water due to the cockroach. Unimpressed. Oh and the manager never came up to us to apologize. The host said sorry. So overall, Free still water and a sorry for a miserable night and being treated like a child. Thanks",1,,
15,Josh L.,"West Los Angeles, CA",2063,299,482,4.0,1/30/2018,"Very good lunch spot.  Went there with a couple people, which was good because it is a small plate share menu. I would recommend that if you like to try a lot of different foods. The atmosphere was pretty cool. Exposed brink wall and a new America look, it was set the stage for food that matched the vibe. The crispy chicken, cauliflower, tagliatelle, and spaghetti were fantastic. The octopus was just okay and burrata was just above okay. The burrata was interesting because it used squash as the complementary flavor.  Overall service was good. Went there for lunch. I would recommend trying this place out for lunch.",7,4,7
16,Rose K.,"New York, NY",397,452,591,5.0,8/23/2017,"I love Charlie Bird. It's one of those places you always pass by and you think, ""This looks like a great place to hang out."" It is. It was August and still warm outside, but the kind of warm where you KNOW summer is ending. I felt the desperate need to have rosé outside on a patio. We walked over and there was a long wait for tables, and only indoor ones. We decided to wait anyways at the bar. Indoors, the hip hop was on full blast. I dig it, but it would have been hard to have a meaningful conversation. A nice guy at the bar struck up a conversation. He was waiting for a date that was late, and he said he had arrived super early to make sure he got a seat. Sounds like a good start to me. Charlie Bird is that kind of place -- be prepared to wait a little, but it's worth it. The bartender was great, very knowledgeable and friendly. I got my coveted rosé. Someone canceled a reservation and we scored a perfect table outside.The live diver scallops paired with pistachio were tender and perfect. I had been craving pasta and the pork shin ragu bolognese tagliatelle was perfectly cooked. We also tried the octopus and charcoal grilled beets. The service was pretty good, and it was great to enjoy the last month of summer outside drinking wine.We were super happy with the caliber of food. People-watching was fun. Hope that guy's date made it.",2,,
17,Jesse C.,"Staten Island, NY",36,46,15,5.0,2/12/2018,"Charlie Bird has done it all right. From the wine list, food menu, hiring of friendly and knowledgeable staff to simple yet elegant decor. This is a place you'll take your parents to meet your significant other for the first time. You'll take them to a place you trust in every single aspect. Where you can all be happy because of how good of an experience everything was.The service can be compared to any place in NYC, it's that good. The menu is as thought out as your college essay, it's something to be remembered. It's refreshing, Charlie Bird exceeds at the simple items and blows your mind with the exotic ones.The ribeye is worth the price, they just do something special with it and I still haven't quite figured out what it is.  WINE WINE WINE",2,,3
18,Jemima B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,19,0,1.0,8/20/2018,"I was abroad the year this restaurant opened (with lots of press) and have been super busy since I settled back in NY. So last weekend, we finally came to Charlie Bird. Very disappointed. Service exists only to upsell (would you like another glass?), they couldn't care less to check if you needed something (maybe some parmigiano for the pasta, or bread for our appetizers? Our waiter came only to see if he can sell us something else. Where's the hospitality?  Food was so-so, no amount of publicity and trying-to-be-cool hype can support the small portions, lifeless salad, very tough gnocchi, flavorless dorade, pitiful chocolate budino (pudding). Lunch for 2 with just 2 glasses of wine and tip was $185. I don't mind pricey meals if I get the equivalent in quality. Alas, price-to-quality ratio here was way off.",1,1,1
19,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",102,439,0,4.0,6/11/2018,"Loved Charlie Bird! I've heard the best things about this place so was excited to finally go with a friend. We sat outside on the most gorgeous June evening, split a bottle of delicious and reasonably priced wine. Their farro salad is, as everyone says, delicious and one of the best of its kind. I've been making it for lunch ever since (Melissa Clark has the recipe on NYTimes.com). My friend's taglietelle was to die for, but I was slightly disappointed in my bucatini with octopus. I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes. Friendly staff and fun atmosphere!",,,

22,Judy H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,68,37,3.0,8/27/2018,"Came here for a Saturday brunch, sitting outside. Great ambience and plenty outdoor seating. However, they don't really have brunch food, just a lunch menu, which is pretty much a smaller version of their dinner menu. Ricotta with bread was amazing, everything else we tried was good but not memorable. (We tried farro salad, Cacio Pepe and poached egg and polenta). This is a four star review, however the portions were small, and we had a horrible lasting impression due to service. The waiter charged my card twice instead of splitting the bill on two separate cards. They came afterwards to correct this, but there was a confusion and argument over the receipt to be signed. My friend had signed the duplicate of my receipt, and ripped it upon seeing that her signature did not correlate to the name on the receipt. We were chastised for ripping the receipt, even though the error was on their part. If a restaurant makes a mistake, they should try their best to rectify it instead of getting annoyed at a customer.",,,
23,Ling H.,"Oakville, Canada",0,23,12,2.0,4/1/2018,Average. We ordered four five dishes and the gnocchi was good but the rest was average. Not worth the trek to the restaurant if far away. Portion is small. Octopus was disappointing - it was spongy without any spring in the meat. Cauliflower - just ok. Brussel sprouts - just ok. Not great. Tomato gnocchi - good. Pork shoulder - just ok. Overall average. Will not trek down again.,2,,

Food was amazing because it was made from scratch, servers were very attentive to your needs.Food was pretty good. Got a small plate of Grilled Octopus which was BOMB!!!!, the Agnolotti, and the Gnocchi Rosa. All were soooooo good.

Sitting on a stoop around the corner from C.B was NY legend Patti Smith-a real New York moment. Enough of that now, off to the food..Seated in the upstairs portion of the restaurant, Shady quickly tore into a bottle of fine Bruna Italian white. with the much ballyhooed rap music playing in the background(not obtrusive at all), Shady and lucky lucky guest ordered up the famous C.B farro salad and the octopus as starters. The farro was all that it is made out to be. Shady literally shoveled as much as he could take while washing it down with the Bruna. For mains, the gluttonous twosome kept it simple and hit two pastas-cavatelli campidanese(sausage,kale and saffron ragu) and the spaghetti(w/ lobster ,zucchini and basil). Both were excellent, portions were adequate and full of flavor. The meal was topped off with a little chocolate cake and gelato and the satiated twosome were off to the next locale. Definitley would go back to try other things in the future. Service was great and with Shadys ALWAYS generous tip the meal set back Shady 220$.",,,1

We liked the service because so many people served us. Everyone had their assignments and it worked beautifully. It wasn't overbearing at all. Their timing of service from water, clearing each course and cleaning the table each time, to asking if we needed anything else was perfectly timed.   Now for the food. We had numerous appetizers that were outstanding.  Perfect portions. The main courses were also appealing. Its a great menu. Nice choices and prepared to your liking. Oh, and dessert was excellent. The four of us went through so much of the menu with a good pace and great service. Can't wit to come back to NYC to get here again.",,,

We had a little table tucked in a corner that was just up some stairs. It had a great view of the restaurant but also felt private. I hate when I feel like people can hear your entire conversation. Service was great. Drinks came out timely and our waters never empty yet didn't feel constantly interrupted.Oysters were delicious. I also loved the spaghetti and broccoli rabe. I will def be back :),,,

For apps we had the diver scallops, razor clams, chicken liver, and burrata. All excellent but everyone especially loved the clams and, not surprisingly based on reviews, the chicken liver. Not sure all 5 of us would have agreed to order that one if not for the reviews.As my entree I had the pasta special which was bucatini (I think!) with lobster and I forget what else. It was enjoyable, just not overly inspired. I tasted my friend's cappelletti and it was also solid. But judging by the reviews and the chicken liver app, maybe the chicken entree really is the way to go! I just have trouble ordering chicken as an entree, but I realize that can occasionally be a mistake. None of us ordered it :(Liked the atmosphere too. Fun and playing some hip hop.

Server was a nice gent, he took our order speedily and drinks were out shortly. Apps took over 30 min to get to table and our meal took a bloody hour. Thats normal for a rush at 6-7pm but it was 1030 res and Restuarant wasn't packed. I was looking at 2 stars until my pasta pappardelle came out. It was so incredibly rich and Ribbons perfectly ""al dente"". The truffles were actually abundant; truly couldn't ask for a better tasting plate. Presentation was mediocre and portion was large.

I enjoyed the frittata and the waiter noticed the lack of chives (as indicated on the menu) and had someone bring some. - delicious.  Inside and outside seating in the west village.

In contrast with other reviewers, I think this place is actually a little bit bigger than an average restaurant in this area of the city. I really enjoyed the burrata appetizer, the flavors were very clean and fresh. I also had the Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe which was tasty but I wouldn't say was the best pasta I've ever had. When I went, the restaurant was pretty dead but the service was super slow. Maybe they thought I wanted to linger? I'm not sure. I would also say that the hip-hop themed menus and music, while awesome, just seem so disconnected from the Italian style food and decor of the place. If you're going to put Run DMC in your menu, then do it right and go in 100% and make the food and decor match the attitude of the menu/music.",,,

The food here was very yummy, though on the same level as most of the places in the surrounding area. The stars are low because the service was just not good. Charlie Bird is a very European style dining spot, which means slow, but we didn't receive our first course for 30 minutes after ordering (a dish that should've taken two minutes to make), and the other two course were slow to follow. On top of that the waiter got the order wrong. The place wasn't crowded so I'm not sure what was going on. Maybe the dinner crew is better, but I don't think the food was good enough to come back.",,,

For the price, the octopus was really expensive. A small piece mixed with green peppers, potatoes, and mint. The flavor was great, meat not over cooked, but it went quickly. Maybe four bites of actual octopus. The pasta was well done. A generous amount of cheese and pepper applied, the dish was hearty and light at the same time. The portion again small though. One random thing; I tried the house made lemonade and it was so sour. Maybe it's the whole sugar free kick, but it tasted like three lemons in water.",,,

The first time, I stopped by with a few friends for a midday glass of wine and a crostini snack following a movie at the Film Forum. I loved the waitress's wine suggestion, a really nice Borgo del Tiglio that reminded me of a light chardonnay, and my toast was delicious too.I returned for a Friday night date, and enjoyed the sultry atmosphere and hip hop playing quietly in the background. We started with the raw scallops, which were delicate and perfect, served in their shells in a refreshing pool of citrus. I also really loved the warm herb laden bread, which was complimentary, and brushed with plenty of olive oil.For my main course, I chose the cavatelli with suckling pig ragu. It sounded the most interesting, but it was a pretty standard ragu, with nice chunks of meat. The cavatelli was nice and chewy, absolutely homemade. At my husband's insistence, we split a dessert as well: the chocolate cake with olive oil gelato. I can't resist olive oil gelato, honestly. For someone who lacks a huge sweet tooth, I really enjoyed this dessert, and was so sad when it was rapidly gobbled up.Our waiter was attentive and helpful, and the hostess was friendly too. Overall, Charlie Bird is a really solid spot.",3,,4

You may be thinking to yourself hmmm this all sounds cool!!! Of course each of those things would be cool...in a restaurant with a cooler vibe! I didn't get a hip/trendy/urban vibe from the restaurant or the staff...so all the hip-hop undertones came off as pure comedy.  I didn't even see one patron beside myself and my friend who seemed to know the songs or had been enjoying it lol. The layout: very awkward dining space with no standing room for waiting. We were told to wait about 20 minutes. However, to the left of the entrance was the hostess' counter, directly in front of the entrance is the bathroom, to the right is the bar (no standing room) and dining room .Food: *rolls eyes again* before choosing this restaurant I saw some cool pasta dishes online...none of which were on the menu when I arrived. I decided to go with the tortelli with sweet peas and parmigiano reggiano. My friend had the crispy suckling pig shoulder. Both dishes were luke warm and mine was simply bland! I sent my meal back to the kitchen and opted for an entirely different entree altogether. This time I ordered the grilled black bass. Boy oh boy was I annoyed! When the fish arrived to the table it was the most rank, smelly bass I've ever had. At this point I was totally over the restaurant. I quickly asked for the bill and dipped out. I will note that the staff felt really bad and removed both meals from the bill. Ohh I forgot to mention we had a side of French fries, which were YUMMY! Needless to say I left the restaurant and got pizza. Final thought...Give the restaurant a try, this could have just been one gals poor experience. No one is perfect all the time.

Again - never rushed.For appetizers we enjoyed the fluke crudo, with some kind of bright, spicy petals, the refreshing peach and prosciutto salad, and the charred octopus.The latter I wish had been pre-cut or served with a sharper knife; using a butter knife to cut the coil was a bit tough.For mains we had the cacio e pepe - all the rage these days. The tagliatelle with ragu, and the sea bream. This was definitely too little to share between 3 hungry people.

Updated review","I haven't written about CBird in a while and it occurred to me to update my review. 1. Staff: whole crew is just lovely.  But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my friends, Brandon and Chelsea. Brandon helps run what is unquestionably one of the coolest wine programs around, both in terms of selection and value.  Chelsea runs the bar and is straight lovely. 2. Food: consistently delicious. Simple, clean, easy and tasty. Only place I'll eat Roman pastas outside of Rome. 3. Vibe: I don't even love hip hop, but I somehow love sitting at the bar and hearing blackstar; it takes me back.  The place is light and airy. 4. Wine: as mentioned above and in my previous review, the access isn't matched but for a handful of places that charge far more and that have a much different feel. From low end to full on burg geek, the provenance is there.  And as long as you're respectful, they don't mind if you bring a bottle here and there for special occasions. CBird remains one of my fav places in NYC.",,,

We sat at the bar for brunch and never felt rushed. Atmosphere is relaxed and lovely, especially for catching up with old friends. We ordered the broccoli di rape, octopus, rigatoni with pork and frittata. The broccoli was delicious, perfectly seasoned and a generous portion for two. The octopus was very tender but lacking acid or heat to give it a kick. Unfortunately the same was true of the pasta. It was very bland. I added a lot of chili oil but it didn't have any flavor. Again it needed acid or heat or even swirls of Parmesan. The pasta tasted as if it hadn't been cooked in salted water. I'd give this place another shot but the first impression wasn't as great as I hoped.",,,

We went to order appetizers and the server said, ""chef doesn't like people to order those early so you need to either decide on dinner now or order everything once you've made a decision.""

While waiting for the other two people to show up, we waited at the bar. I got the Two One Two drink which had tequila, aperol, and grapefruit ($14) and my boyfriend got some kind of beer he really liked. Both were good and we really enjoyed the breadsticks at the bar.  We sat outside under the heaters which was really nice. We ordered the ramps and arugula ($10) starter which had only two ramps and some arugula in a really small container (think of what you would serve creme brûlée in).We also shared the porcini tagliatelle ($21) which was good but very simple. It was not that large which I think if I wanted pasta there are many places nearby that are much more authentic. I also got the grilled octopus ($19) which is listed under appetizers but is a good portion. It wasn't the best octopus dish I have had but definitely one of the more expensive ones. The other dishes that we got were the pork shoulder ($32), the wild ocean trout ($32) and the farro salad ($17). Everything was just fine but not outstanding. My biggest issue with the place is that our food took over an hour between the pasta& ramps and the rest. I later found out that there was a famous Instagram person in the restaurant and I am sure they prioritized their table but t was not busy and it was a crazy long wait. The total was on the pricy side and the food was fine but you can find this type of food in so many places for half the price. I would not go back nor recommend it.",10,8,7

64,Lisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,87,10,5.0,6/12/2016,"Last night Mr. F and I finally made our way to Charlie Bird (after setting up a reservation two weeks in advance) - and we are so glad we did. I got nervous seeing all the mixed reviews here, even knowing that it has received acclaim elsewhere from the very beginning. But after our visit last night, we are so confused about why this is anything less than 4-5 stars. It's excellent in every way.Despite the humid/hot evening, we wanted to enjoy their awesome patio, so we sat outside. It's a really nice space, where you have room between tables and umbrellas to shade (and protect from some rain, in our case). The soundtrack, which can also be heard outside, is amazing - lots of really catchy hip hop (Beastie Boys!) and at just the right decibel level so you can hear your dining partners talk.They bring you an awesome rosemary focaccia bread, which is one of the best breads I've ever had at a restaurant. We started with the spring pecorino, ceci (green chickpea), and mint salad, which was really light and summery. Mr. F had the pork shoulder entree, which came with a side plate of pickled something or other and a slice of thick bread with a creamy sauce. I had the famous roasted chicken, which was as delicious as promised. Both entrees were perfectly cooked, beautifully plated, and the perfect portion size. Maybe we've been in NYC too long, but given these facts we didn't feel it was overpriced -- though the menu is slightly expensive for this category of dining, even for Manhattan.Service was also on point - we were seated immediately, the waiter was there exactly when we needed him to be, and our water bottle was replaced frequently with ice cold water (key for outdoor summer dining)!It's rare we find a place in NYC that we want to return to - there are just too many options to try that there's no reason to return somewhere unless it's exceptional.

Ever had a green chickpea (cici) salad with Pecorino, mint and a sunny lemon vinaigrette? Now, I have and it left me wanting more. The bar man suggested I try the chicken. Really? I make that at home! Not this good. CB's roast chicken was boneless, VERY crispy on the outside. Because the breast is typically a touch dryer they cleverly sided that half with a pate that added the right amount of snap to the blander white meat. Wonderful croutons were scattered around the richer thigh meat. My only issue was their heavy touch  on the salt. Dessert was a Budino but really reminded me of a dense warm brownie surrounded by chocolate paired with gelato over caramelized Rice Krispies (really!)I'd go back here in a flash.

78,Kirsten H.,"Denver, CO",169,910,757,3.0,2/26/2016,"I went here on the recommendation of a friend on a Thursday night. The two of us arrived at 6:30 and the bar was already pretty full.  By the time we left around 8, most of the tables were full. Food: the complimentary focaccia bread was way too oily. After eating a piece, I had to go wash my hands. I ordered the roasted chicken as my meal, which I really enjoyed. I didn't touch the chicken liver pate that came along with it. My friend ordered the mezze paccheri (rigatoni with suckling pig ragu), which was ok. We also ordered the brussels sprouts as a side dish, which were fine as well. Overall, I'd give the food a 3 out of 5 stars.  Service: Very friendly, especially the hostess. Atmosphere: Perfect date spot. Loud but not too loud, trendy, dark-ish, large wine list. The bathroom had mints, candies, and floss, which is was an unexpectedly nice touch! I'm glad I tried the restaurant, and would most likely go back. Not my favorite place, but I liked the atmosphere.",1,1,
79,C B.,"Ferriday, LA",0,1,0,1.0,6/5/2017,"Gluten-Free/Celiac Review... Not Safewe had emailed in advance asking if the restaurant was safe for someone with celiac disease (actual allergy to gluten, not just on a GF diet). we were assured by management and wait staff that the food and kitchen were safe for allergies. shortly after the meal, my celiac girlfriend became violently ill. from past experiences, it's clear it was from Charlie Bird's food because of how quickly the reaction came about.following that, management denied responsibility and blamed us. very disappointing and rude.",4,2,
80,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,2.0,10/31/2015,"Sorry, Charlie. I've given this spot a few chances and I remain unimpressed.The food is good - I won't tell you it's not. But the portions are so laughably small, and so head-scratchingly overpriced, I'd feel like a fool for telling you this place is worth it. The Smoked Cod Salad, for example, was a brushstroke shape of lentils that took up maybe 10% of the plate's real estate, with minuscule pieces of fish that together probably added up to one regular bite of a bigger fish dish at any other restaurant. It was $15. Which seems to be the going rate for the majority of their shareable items here. Which are, again, shareable items with very little to share. The Farro Salad, a bowl of grains, pumpkin, pistachio, mint, and Parmigiano, is probably the most popular dish, and the sole recommendation I'd side with should you still decide to eat here.I've only come for lunch, but every group I'm with seems to complain about the menu. One section is just called Small & Large, with no delineation between which, except to maybe infer size based on price tag, which at a place like this, is no given. Between the other sections - Raw, Salads, and Pasta - no one seems to know how much or what to order (hint: it's not the Smoked Cod Salad). The servers will help map our your meal in that respect, but catch them while you can - the place gets packed and they seem a bit short-staffed.The space is tight, and I'm always seated at their half-floor, bird's nest-style back section. It's adorned with trendy yellow booths and boombox artwork that matches the hip-hop soundtrack spinning in the background. And I wish that music and motif worked here, but they should just cater to their true demographic - senior citizen women of Manhattan whose small plate appetites and old money pair well with Charlie Bird's business model.In other words, not me.",4,4,2
81,Jon S.,"Hoboken, NJ",55,53,0,5.0,8/23/2017,"Went there with my wife, bro, and sis in law.  From beginning to end this was a great meal.  The atmosphere is great for a fun night out, the service was very good, and every dish was delicious.   The octopus and ossobuco were top notch - get it!",,,
82,Maria O.,"Easton, PA",0,9,14,3.0,10/8/2016,"This hip yet cosy West Village restaurant lives up to its name of being a place quintessentially ""New York."" From the trendy interior to the menu, Charlie Bird offers the perfect taste of the city. But that's just the thing - all you get is a taste. Considering the relatively small dishes, you'll have to order quite a few to satisfy your New York appetite and so, expect to receive a sizable check at the end - but that's kind of New York too, isn't it?Aside from the slightly disappointing size, the menu at Charlie Bird is anything but disappointing. From the razor clams, the diver scallops, the fries, to the farro salad... truly one is better than the other! As for main dishes, the restaurant's classic cacio e pepe is an absolute treat. Ignore the prize tag and instead savor each bite of this charming NYC delight.",,,
83,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,1053,63,4.0,3/22/2016,"I can't say I enjoyed every dish at Charlie Bird, but overall I get it- I understand the chef's point of view and I can appreciate that. So went here with five other people which was a stretch since the place isn't overly large. But we fit (had reservations) and I think the old school, hip-hop music and upscale, dark and trendy ambiance set the right tone.We had a million starters. Honestly none of them were my favorite, but folks loved the sea food varieties. Yada, yada, yada, let's just talk about my pork chop. Huge, heavenly, and divine. For that reason alone I give them the nod.Would we come back? The drinks were OK, service was good, and a few of their dishes just really stood out (and it wasn't ""that"" pricey). Sure we might do it again. Why not...",,,
84,Vincent Y.,"New York, NY",32,53,139,4.0,11/15/2015,"I came here one day by myself for lunch because I wanted to try their razor clams, but ended up getting so much more. They had a lunch pre-fixe for $25 that came with a small plate and a pasta, so I got the razor clams as my small and the chitarra nero pasta as my main. Looking through the rest of the menu, I couldn't help but get the bay scallops as well.Bay scallops - served raw in it's shell, with meyer lemon and pistachio. This was delicious - sweet, tart, briny, and earthy. It worked very well.Razor clams - also served raw in it's shell, with fennel and chiles paste. This wasn't as notable on the palette as the scallops, but also very good. A little bit of heat with the brininess, and lightened with fennel.Chitarra nero - squid ink noodles tossed with crab and garlic - tasted like the sea. It was a good plate, but I was expecting something more/better after the two starters. Oh well, can't win them all.Buttermilk panna cotta - rounded off the meal with some dessert. It was okay. The blueberry meringue pieces were a little big and difficult to break apart - a little unwieldy for a delicate dessert.There were certainly other items on the menu that I'd like to try so I'll be back.",2,,
85,Lisa X.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",223,60,48,3.0,7/19/2017,"Didn't meet my expectations. Everything we got was a bit on the salty side, and service was nothing special. Seats were cramped as well (our table was literally touching the other tables on both sides). The appetizers were pretty good, pastas were fine. Again, nothing special. Be warned that noise levels are very high and you'll have to raise your voice to be heard",,,
86,Brent P.,"New York, NY",4,2,0,5.0,8/3/2017,"Charlie Bird is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The variety in the menu is exceptional, but one of my hands down favorite things is the farrow salad.  The porter house is delicious and the special we had, one large ravioli, which I have been back four times and always ask about it, is amazing.  The cocktails and drink selection is great as well and the ambiance is great for a date or going with friends.",,,
87,Jeffrey J.,"Brooklyn, NY",377,12,2,5.0,8/11/2017,This place is a great neighborhood establishment. It's a summer Friday in August and it's the perfect place to have a glass of wine and a few 'small bites'. Jose S. was our server. Jose had great recommendations and he was spot ON! ... octopus and the burrata were awesome.  I will definitely recommend this place to friends and my clients. Check it out for yourself.,,,
88,Mike E.,"Arlington, VA",102,12,0,5.0,11/7/2016,"As a former Chef/Bartender/Restaurant Manager, I was blown away. In no small part due to the quality of service. From the second my party walked in the manager Kristen, made us feel at home like only the best Italian Nonna could. She skillfully guided us through to our first glass of sparkling, which was a brilliant balance of sweet and sparkling.Our Sommelier/Server, Brittany was equally as memorable and amazing, not to mention proficient at wine. She guided our persnickety group of 6 through the wine list and menu, and everyone was just blown away at the end of the meal. After she watched our group try the first bottle of wine, and our (very positive) reactions, she suggested a Super Tuscan )that was not on our radar), and I could confidently say was one of the best wines I have had in recent memory, especially as paired with our main courses.You can imagine my pleasure when the food lived up to the standards of service.It is an all-too-rare pleasure to have perfectly cooked pasta. The Pappardelle with Rabbit Ragu did not last long on our table, with the rabbit perfectly cooked and tender, not to mention the perfect al dente. The last time I had pasta anywhere near this good was in a place with 2 Michelin stars. The Razor Clams from the raw menu were also amazing.I could go on about the service, food, and wine for much longer, but Charlie Bird is very clearly a heavy hitter. I cannot wait to go back, and try the rest of this delicious menu.",1,,1
89,Kelly N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,20,0,4.0,2/19/2018,"Quite good! We ordered a lot and the only complaints were that a lot of the food was too salty, and the octopus was over cooked. Other than that - service was good, wine was good, burrata was great, focaccia was AMAZING, chicken liver was good, Brussels good, and pasta was good (but not particularly memorable). And the vibe of the restaurant was cool as well. I would def recommend this establishment, but wouldn't refer to it was the ""best""pasta, etc",,,
90,Tiffany M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",162,2,7,4.0,3/9/2017,The only reason I don't give this restaurant 5 stars is because I didn't like the octopus as much. The burrata is one of the best burratas I have ever had. The caccio e pepe is very good if you like spicy food and the tagliatelle was the best part.,,,
91,Paul A.,"New York, NY",256,402,462,5.0,5/18/2014,"Flawless food, flawless service, and an absolutely incomparable atmosphere make Charlie Bird certainly my favorite restaurant in all of NYC.I do not drop the ""this is my favorite restaurant in NYC"" card lightly. Over three or four courses I can literally get each of my favorite dishes in the city over and over. You can also listen to boss music in a pretty chill setting. Note: we are talking loud 90s rap here, so I suppose it depends on your preference.The Tuscan Chicken Liver mousse served here is probably my favorite version of one of my favorite dishes. It is perfect, as is the buttery bread they serve alongside it. The Grilled Octopus Saltimbocca is wildly good, not burnt like at many other spots and brought to the next level by the crispy proscuttio on top.When it comes to salads, I would be lying if, again, I did not say the Farro Salad is probably my favorite salad in the city. It is just wonderfully nutty, and filling, and full of unlikely flavors that just work so well. For the record, the Roasted Carrot Salad here is absolutely amazing as well.Ok, so mains. I have to admit here that I have never had any of the pasta dishes but that is because the Black Bass and the Roasted Chicken are both superb. I think I like the Black Bass more of the two, but the chicken is super excellent.And, finally, for dessert they have really one of the best I have had anywhere in NYC. The warm chocolate budino. I am a sucker for molten lava chocolate cakes and this is definitely one of the better manifestations in the city. The crunch of caramelized rice crispies, the perfect consistency of the ice cream, and the intensity of the chocolate take this dish over the top.So yeah, Charlie Bird is utterly amazing. One problem: They are only open for lunch Friday, Sat, and Sun. If anyone from the staff is reading this, can you guys pretty please open for lunch all week? With a cherry on top?Note Feb, 2015: Charlie Bird is now open all days of the week for lunch. It's not really my favorite restaurant in the city anymore but jesus should this place have a higher rating on yelp. Like yeah, it is loud and super hipster in there but it is a lot of fun and the food is so sick.",4,1,2
92,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64808,5.0,4/11/2014,"I can't believe it took me almost a year to eat here. After an amazing dinner, I now see why several people hailed this as the best new restaurant of 2013.I finally tried getting a reservation after hearing so much hype, and as expected, it was tough. I couldn't find anything after 5:30 PM or before 10 PM on any weekends for several weeks out, so I settled for a 6 PM on a Wednesday. They did start serving brunch a few weeks ago, which seemed to have plenty of tables available, but there are some items only available at dinner which made me stick to trying for one of the tough to get tables.The place is pretty small, with a bar and a few tables up front, and a very narrow space up a few steps in the back with more tables. The close quarters combined with the excellent selection of mostly early 2000's bumping hip hop music creates a really loud and energetic atmosphere.The great music and hip environment is just a bonus though, as the amazing food is the real draw here. Everything is quite pricey, and most items are pretty small portions, so we ended up ordering a huge bill of food, but the meal was so good it was worth it:- Housemade FocacciaIndicative of things to come, this complimentary bread to start was smaller than any bread you've seen, but also incredibly delicious and much better than most cold pieces of bread you get. There were two very small slivers, good enough for two bites, but it was so rich and delicious that it was enough. It was intensely buttery with a nice crunch to it. Off to a very good start.- Grilled Ramp Toast ($11)Though this was just as delicious as everything else we tried, it's the one thing I probably wouldn't recommend, based on the fact that it's very similar to the complimentary bread both in taste and its small size (the $11 for these two pieces of bread stung the most of any of the dishes). The crunchy bread was again very rich and buttery, only much better this time due to the strip of pancetta on top.- Farro Salad ($15)This is definitely the best thing to order in terms of value, satisfaction and taste. It's a very generous bowl of farro with pistachios, mint, pumpkin and parmigiano. The flavors are really strong and delicious and make you just keep going back for more and more spoonfuls. This is a must to start with.- Cappallacci ($19)This was an excellent dish of pasta. I've never seen this type before, which was somewhat similar to tortellini. There were plenty of peas and bacon, with a very delicious, rich green sauce to soak everything up in. There were just two little hunks of rabbit, which were so soft and delicious that I wish there were more scattered throughout.- Duck Egg Spaghetti ($24)This is the one everybody gets here, since uni is of course everybody's favorite food. There is a large piece of uni placed on top of a bed of spaghetti with a really rich, creamy sauce. There was also a ton of bits of guanciale peppered throughout, which made the dish even saltier and richer. If you like uni and great al dente spaghetti, you will be in heaven with this dish.- Black Bass ($28)We went with just one entree since we were already dropping so much money, so I passed on the popular roasted chicken (which I usually find to be underwhelming, especially for ~$30), and instead had this great piece of bass. Beautifully presented with sausage and cauliflower around and underneath the buttery soft piece of fish, there were also some pine nuts on top of it that added even more richness.- French Fried Potatoes ($8)These fries were great, though ironically, the one item of the meal that did not have enough salt. Still, the crispy skin made them extremely addictive.- Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($8)This was one of those rare times in which I liked a vegetable side more than the potato side. These were some of the brussels I've had, made even more incredible by the little spoonful of spicy garlic on the side. If you get just one side, get these over the fries.- Winesap Apple Olive Oil Cake ($12)Dessert continued on the theme of beautifully plated and delicious food. This one was cooler looking but not as good as the other dessert. I often find olive oil cake to be quite bland, but this one had a ton of flavor. The mascarpone helped that too. But just the cake alone was great.- Warm Chocolate Budino ($12)This one was really amazing. Again, it is tiny for $12, but each little bite is so incredible. Once you get a bite of every component, it's perfection: hot, rich chocolatey cake, cool, refreshing gelato and crunchy, salty Rice Krispie clusters. This is a perfect way to end the meal.Service was excellent as well. The fleet of Mexican busboys was very attentive and polite. I wouldn't eat here often given the prices, but if you are looking for one of the best overall dining experiences that epitomizes the current NY dining scene, you must book a reservation now and come here in a few weeks.",18,7,10

He prefers to call it ""Charlie Baby"" though, which, it seems only natural considering the portions are for small birds.  My babe ordered a pasta dish and we were somewhat concerned about where the other half was.

I gave my boyfriend a kiss and by the time we opened our eyes, someone had already brought back the credit card. I'll just assume that they have a unicorn on duty. Anyway, they did not want us lingering as long as we would have liked. Fortunately,  the oysters worked, so we were ready to get out of there and head back to the pitched tent on our balcony.

Knowing, he's not a food snob and that he enjoys good quality, I used this opportunity to finally check out the infamous Charlie Bird.I heard that the food is really delicious and most of the time, it's not impossible to make reservations.  When I called them, a lovely sounding and vibrant lady informed me that, unfortunately, there were no openings until way later in the evening.  However she suggested with certainty that if we dropped by that early evening, we could quite possibly snag an unassigned open table or a seat at the bar.  We did just that.  Fast forward: Everything was excellent from service, quality of food to overall vibe.  I went with a roasted chicken dish which tasted heavenly.  My friend ordered a pasta dish and a nice big bottle of white wine for the summer heat.  We had dessert too.Sorry I'm not getting too technical with the food description.  But everything overall was excellent, if not great.  The vibe.  The music.  Nothing was overbearing, just well balanced.  I'll be back again but only with good friends, family or business partners.

Buratta way too runny and tasteless. One dozen oysters, poor- when do you not finish all the oysters? We had a bottle of Italian red wine and 3 cocktails. Total came to about 500.00.

Let me start by saying that the hostess was very friendly and accommodating, especially when we confused the time of our reservation (oops!). Although we arrived a half hour late on a Thursday night, our party of four was quickly led to seats at the bar and a table was provided for us within ten minutes. Our waiter was very helpful with recommendations, but not pushy at all. For appetizers, we ordered the farro salad, burrata, razor clams and grilled octopus. The first three are not to be missed (especially the burrata!) however the grilled octopus was a bit average. For mains, all of us decided to go with the pasta options, which turned out to be a great decision as this was some of the best pasta that I have ever enjoyed.

After trying and trying to get a reservation we finally got one. The night started off to a great, since we had a reservation they came over with a complimentary glass of champagne. That's when things started to go slightly downhill. Since we only get together once a month, we had a lot to catch up on. The waitress came over twice and we still hadn't looked at the menu and she started to give us some real attitude. The next time she came over, we were ready but had some questions and we could tell she wasn't happy. We ordered a few things between 3 girls, nothing crazy. (Grilled Octopus, Farro Salad, Tuscan Chicken Liver Crostini's, Roasted Chicken and Broccoli Rabe)They brought out the most amazing focaccia bread so that had to be a good sign for the rest of the food. Then they brought over another bottle of champagne which we didn't order and didn't explain it. When we asked, they said oh the table over there sent this to you girls. Okay, fine by us, but maybe let us know before pouring it?The crostini's, chicken and farro salad were amazing. But the octopus was chewy and just not very good at all. So disappointing as people had told us it was amazing. The broccoli rabe was well, broccoli rabe. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. All in all, I'd give it another shot but with the difficulty in getting a reservation and the little bit of tude we received I have my doubts that I'll go back.",1,,

Updated review","KenScale: 8.0/10I recently went on a spur-of-the-moment brunch to Charlie Bird after wandering around SoHo. It was my second visit since I had first visited this place back in August. The restaurant has been one of the hottest tickets this year, but it was definitely more relaxing during the brunch time when I stepped in shortly after 11 a.m. (although it quickly started filling up around noon). The quality of food was simple yet well executed.I started the meal with farro salad, a tasty dish that worked pretty well with the crunchy pistachio. Then came pappardelle with braised duck ragu and roasted chicken with 7 herb salad. Pappardelle was flavorful, and gave that extra kick with the chili pepper sauce that the restaurant suggested I add. Roasted chicken was incredibly tender and seasoned just right. The meal finished with delightful winesap apple olive oil cake with mascarpone and salty oat crumble. I think Charlie Bird holds a lot of promise as a weekend brunch destination. With the kind of casual, youthful New York downtown vibe that offers delicious dishes, I highly recommend it for a brunch followed by casual stroll around West Village and/or SoHo.",1,,
111,Willa B.,"Chester, NJ",5,19,0,5.0,6/18/2017,"In my opinion, this place is absolutely fantastic. Yes, the food is slightly expensive but it's New York City and Charlie Bird is known for serving high quality food. The atmosphere is definitely trendy and chic. It can get a bit loud sometimes but it's not terribly difficult to have a conversation with the people sitting right near you. I've eaten here several times over the past few years and the food has always been delicious and the service exemplary. My mother loves the Farro Salad. The squash bulbs are a favorite of mine. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who has money to spend and wants a delicious meal at a trendy, upscale restaurant.",,,

Former inhabitants of the space have quickly turned over (not unlike many restaurants in this general area), however, I think and hope that we've found a keeper with Charlie Bird. Expect clean and modern takes on Italian classics, with plenty of seafood specialties. My favorites include the razorfish clams, scallop crudo with browned butter, any of the pastas and warm fig focaccia bread. Servers are attentive, knowledgeable and provide great recommendations. Ask for wine pairings if you don't know what to wash your meal down with. In the summer, the patio is open for outdoor dining and the windows open up for an extra burst of fresh air.",3,,2
115,Maeve M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",316,539,111,5.0,12/26/2016,"I've been wanting to go to Charlie Bird pretty much since it opened and finally had the chance recently. I was almost nervous that it wouldn't live up to the expectations but it was even better than anticipated. I wasn't able to get a reservation but we took our chances and showed up at 6 on the dot, and were able to walk right in. Hospitality is 100% on point but the vibe is the opposite of stuffy: hip-hop lyrics on the menu, lifesavers in the bathroom. We had some questions about the wine list and the sommelier was able to suggest a great wine that was exactly what we wanted in the right price range. The hardest part of the night was figuring out what to order but we eventually decided on the burrata, grilled octopus, radicchio and pumpkin salad with hazelnuts and the escarole and lemon salad. Surprise knockout was the radicchio salad - hazelnuts and pumpkin are a killer combination and the barolo vinaigrette and parmesan tied it together very well. I could have just eaten a bowl of that and been happy, but the other dishes were also fantastic - light but substantive and complex. It was a very ""fall"" meal (this was in October) but not in the obvious, pumpkin-spice way - flavors were a celebration of the best parts of gourd season, a mix of fresh produce with hearty heat and spice. Obviously we scrutinized the wine list closely (and they deserve major accolades for having such a generous range of price and regions - there's truly something for everyone) and ended with a lovely Italian white from Campagnia with citrus and floral notes. The meal was truly a special one and this has now leaped to the top of my list of favorite spots in New York - I am already planning my next visit.",4,1,2

The white asparagus themselves were good but the sauce was a bit heavy and the sausage very salty. The crispy chicken was fine. The liver mouse that came with it was great. But the chicken, especially the breast piece, was a tad dry. The dark meat was good.",,,

The ambiance was very pleasant, and the food came out in perfect timing. We started with the scallops, which were fresh and citrus-y sweet - definitely some of the best we'd ever had. Next was the Gnocchi Rosa, which was lighter than we expected, but delicious (and a tiny bit spicy, which we loved). For dinner we split the Roasted Chicken. It was good, but I think the pate really made the dish (the chicken was a little drier than expected). Some great wine recommendations by the server rounded off a great experience.",,,
120,Justin H.,"Manhattan, NY",143,113,1634,2.0,12/23/2014,"I don't get it. I was reading all about the hype of this place so I decided to try it out for brunch, but unfortunately it was the most underwhelming brunch I've ever had. The restaurant was practically empty when we arrived around noon, so I was a little skeptical. It began to fill up a little throughout our meal, but not that much. To my surprise, there were a lot of families eating here, which I thought was weird considering the not so kid friendly old school hip hop blasting in the background. Anyways....we were seated next to a family with screaming kids that were walking around. Normally, I wouldn't put the restaurant at fault for something like that but the restaurant was completely empty, yet they decided to pack everyone next to each other. Aside from the crappy atmosphere, which is minimal to me when reviewing a place, the food was just underwhelming. First off, I should say that this place isn't really a true brunch place. The menu was mostly lunch items with a few breakfast items such as eggs and the special of the day which was pancakes. With little to choose from in the breakfast food area, my friend and I both decided on the poached egg dish. When we ordered the dish, our waitress told us that it only came with one egg and that she recommended adding another. At $16, the thought of only serving one poached egg when it's the main part of the dish, completely blows my mind. We went with the upgrade because we were hungry guys and decided to share a side of their french fries too.Once our egg dishes came out, I was a little confused. The menu said poached egg with brussel sprouts, so I was expecting a decent portion of brussels along with my poached eggs. Instead, there was a skimpy portion of shaved brussels on top of the dish. The dish consisted of the poached egg (2 since we upgraded) sitting in a pool of some sort of broth, with macadamia nuts, and small duck crackling pieces. The macadamia nuts added a weird sweetness to the dish and the broth kind of ruined the taste of the runny yolk from the egg once cut into it. The dish lacked different levels of flavors and had me longing for more of something. We hoped that the french fries would save the day, but they were just regular french fries with salt and rosemary and no ketchup was brought out, so there was no saving grace with those.All the hype I read about this place was for their dinner service, so maybe I'm missing something but after having brunch here, there would be a lot of convincing to do to get me back here for another meal!",9,2,2

122,Sarah P.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,45,18,5.0,2/24/2016,"I came here with a couple girl friends for dinner one weekday night and was so impressed! The service was so smooth and professional it made the bill worth every penny. The dishes were not cheap, but not over priced for what you got. The food portions were very decent and every bite was as good as the first. I ordered a glass of red wine to start and it came in a mini carafe that was poured in my glass at the table. I'm a little bit of glass snob...I hate it too... but the wine glasses were perfect. I love thin rimmed glass, especially for wine, and the stems were so dainty and great for holding. The wine tasted so much better just because of the glass, I swear!Then we ordered a couple appetizers to share- grilled octopus and rigatoni pasta. Octopus was great, not rubbery and hard but smooth and chewy. Pasta was coated in sauce nicely, and had great flavor. There was also bread at the table and with all the food we had I was starting to feel full. So instead of getting a full plate, I ordered a side of cauliflower. Now, I'm a big eater, and I love meat! I've been told by strangers that they can't believe I'm still eating.. so for me to say I passed a full plate of food and went straight for the veggies is saying something. The menu made it sound so intriguing I had to try it! A full plate of caramelized cauliflower with hazelnuts, and I didn't regret one second of my choice. This is the best tasting cauliflower i've ever had. I think I'd just go back for this, and a glass of wine with their great glasses.",1,,1

125,Rory M.,"New York, NY",223,26,10,4.0,5/25/2015,"I had eaten at Charlie Bird with a group of coworkers, arriving approximately around noon hoping that we could get there before the crowd. When we arrived and told the hostess we were 6 and we did not have a reservation. She suggested we sit at the bar because there was no space for us. She didn't seem thrilled that we were there and didn't appear to want to try and accommodate our party. Looking at the bar it seemed there wasn't space there, but a slew of open tables that I was assuming we're booked for reservations. As we were attempting to think of other places to go nearby a gentleman who I assume was the manager/owner came to the hostess stand and asked how he could help us and immediately was looking for ways to seat us. After dealing with a very unenthusiastic hostess this was much appreciated. After several minutes we were seated. For the group we ordered the Farro Salad, Tuna salad, artichokes, octopus and cauliflower. The only thing that wasn't superb was the tuna salad. The artichokes had to be my favorite! They seemed to have been flash fried so weren't incredibly oily and were perfectly crispy! For the main meal I had ordered the black bass, which was out of this world! It was served with asparagus and small onions in what tasted like a sherry vinegar. Sweet and light...perfect lunch meal! Right as we were about to ask for the check we were offered dessert and had to give in after seeing the menu. We ordered the chocolate budino and the cheese plate. The cheese was so creamy and delicious and there aren't even words to describe the chocolate budino with olive oil gelato. It was sweet with a salty aftertaste and I was so tempted to lick the plate. One of the best desserts I've ever had!  I will be back again, but will remember to make a reservation next time!",,,
126,Debra D.,"Manhattan, NY",41,20,1,4.0,2/19/2016,"Charlie Bird is exactly as the other reviews have said. Lively, great for big parties or a fun date. I really wanted to give it 5 stars (I am a naturally positive person), but there were a few pretty major missteps that should be mentioned. The Pros (there were many):- The food had some serious highlights. The farro was truly the standout. Each bite brought another surprise of flavor and texture. - The music was fantastic. I agree w the other reviews here definitely.- The service was similarly fantastic. We didn't wait for anything. - Many wonderful options for carnivores and vegetarians alike.The Cons- If a dish has chicken liver in it, I feel like that should be listed on the menu. We ordered the Farfalle with oxtail Ragu, and didn't know about the chicken liver until the server mentioned it while placing the plate. We had specifically avoided the other dish with chicken liver, so that plate went right back. They were awesome about it though--no fuss whatsoever. The gnocchi that replaced it was solid albeit a bit plain.- The porkchop was a nice dish. It was very nicely cooked, and the flavors were nice, but the presentation and overall execution were uninspiring. If you are going to put a porkchop on the menu, you gotta nail it.",1,,

I said something to the waiter and he told me that the manager said because they remade my food, they had to charge me for it.In a correctly-run restaurant, the manager himself would have walked over, apologized and immediately told me that they would remove the pasta from our bill and/or take care of our drinks.Instead, they barely apologized and told me we had to pay for everything.

It is a lot of pressure because...well...it's a special night and you want everything to go perfectly. I promise you take the risk for something new and come to Charlie Bird.STAFF - The staff from the door...to our table to our spectacular server were friendly, fun and professional while also making us feel ""Special"". Excited about food and wine our servers helped create a perfect menu with great pacing.FOOD - The food was also amazing. While I saw some of the larger plates which looked great, we chose to combine smaller plates and pasta. Every bite was better than the next. The Cacio e Pepe and Grilled Octopus were the stars and should not be missed. So simple but so awesome with great ingredients.COCKTAILS - The cocktails were pitch perfect and made with care.WINE - Maybe even better than the food. This is not the usual wine list...and everything is chosen with care. What I absolutely loved is each wine represented the character of the restaurant providing great flavor with a little edge. These aren't the massive wineries, but instead small boutique wineries doing something special and doing it their own way. The Priorat was an amazing value for very memorable wine.OVERALL - Charlie Bird is now one of our favorite spots in the city. It's not for everyone, which is great because it is a cozy spot...but if great food, 90's R&B / Hip Hop and amazing service sounds like the perfect evening...then this place is for you.",1,,

The menu has decent choices but is very seasonal so the recommendations may not help. The liver was amazing, burrata always a good choice (except they gave 1 small piece of grilled bread for two large heaping servings of burrata. Naturally, we had to request more), the rabbit Ragu tagliatelle was good but the noodles were a little...wet(?) and not so al dente like pasta should be, the honey roasted duckling was great as well. However, with the duck - the meat itself was cooked to perfection (crispy and charred on the outside but nice and tender on the inside). BUT the presentation on the plate - oh my god - it looked like they took soggy lettuce and dumped the duck on top of it. Very disappointing for such a delicious game meat. Poorly plated. Everything tastes good but the presentation and plating could have been much better. The only other complaint I have is that the tables in the front room are in a row and you are basically on top of the stranger next to you. Otherwise the music was good and upbeat.

It was actually perfect as we sat outside on a sunny Saturday afternoon drinking wine and enjoying our meal.  We ordered a $45 bottle of chianti - was fabulous. I was surprised at the price tag which I didn't know until after I tasted it.  Can I just mention that I love the wine glasses used at this restaurant? haha. Random sidenote for those that care. Start with the faro salad and octopus - both great dishes. The faro salad is a must try - not because its the best dish ever, but it was such an interesting blend of flavors that just worked.  Next we tried the Spaghetti Nero and Duck Egg Pasta. I preferred the Nero but everyone else loved the Duck pasta (which had uni on top). I found it a little heavy but I think its more of a personal preference than the dish actually being too heavy. The others were more than happy to finish up my remains.  We finished with the chicken (really solid - moist with crispy skin) and the sea bass which had the best tomatoes (which must be great because I never thought I'd mention tomatoes as a highlight ever).  I honestly don't remember what we had for dessert so it was probably satistying but not memorable.All in all - I say this is a solid place for food. What makes it work though is also the small details in making this place feel like a fine dining restaurant (wine glasses, attentive service) but in a laid back setting with the best 90s hip hop music track playing in the background. I'd come back in a flash anytime I wanted to relax with friends over a good meal. Paid $75 - not bad considering we had 3 bottles of wine. :)",3,,

The cauliflower was WAY too salty--I've said it before and I'll say it again, If I find something salty then there is a problem because I love salt and would gladly add soy sauce to just about anything!

The waiter was not at all attentive and never once; not ONCE checked in to ask how our meal was. The portions were so small it was absolutely offensive. We were a party of two and we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 main courses and left hungry. It's not like I was expecting Olive Garden portions, I actually prefer places that serve great quality food in modest portions as I love leaving a restaurant feeling light and satisfied as opposed to feeling sluggish/heavy with the urge to undo the top button of my pants but this place did not serve modest portions. They didn't even serve small portions. They served portions that made me realize exactly why they named the place Charlie Bird...its because the portions were small enough to only satisfy a bird.I gave it two stars because the food was decent. Not amazing but decent.",,,

The hip hop music and pictures of boom boxes you've probably already heard about is old school but it pops out fresh.  Service was friendly and relaxed, present when needed.  The use of herbs was abundant.  They elevated every dish from the grilled Langoustines, to the Calamari, the Cauliflower and that Farro salad, which was crazy good.  Bucatini pasta in a light creamy carbonara sauce was heaven in a pasta bowl. The ginger beet drink made me sit up at attention with the first sip.  I loved it.  I loved this restaurant.  This is a first for me but the sleek bathroom bares mention.

The 90's hip hop threw me off but I was impressed by the menu.Starters- grilled octopus, heirloom tomato salad and corn. I was extremely surprised. The octopus has this purée with a lemony kick which was just delightful. The heirloom salad had these buttery greasy delicious croutons and pancetta crisps that were a great combination with the strawberries. The corn was crack. Buttery crack. Entrees- chittarra Nero and the rabbit for me. The place does use a lot of pancetta and bacon which add to the salt factor.

The wine, a rose we normally wouldn't try but did due to the weather and the waitress suggestion, was fantastic and perfect on a steamy sunny day outside.

Had reservations Friday night for three and we were seated immediately. We had to order our meal all once so we placed an order for the octopus, burrata pasta and the pheasant pasta. For our large plates we ordered the veal chop and the black bass. For veggies we order Brussels sprouts and the cauliflower. The octopus was okay. The potatoes in the dish were great. The burrata pasta dish was pretty good. If were given more than three raviolis it would have been better. There is a running theme thus far, tiny a$$ portions for high dollars.  The pheasant pasta dish w truffles was unappetizing. Can barely taste the truffles and really taste anything. It was such a bland dish. Next up were the entrees. Black bass came out dish. It was alright. Nothing to write home about. Then the veal chop came out. Breaded. Pounded. And topped with prosciutto. Which is something that is not explained by any means anywhere on the menu!!! Needless to say this wasn't good. Their saving grace was the side vegetables. Both were great but really were only two tablespoons worth of vegetables. Which is such a joke. Oh, desserts were two god awful cakes. Tiny TINY portions at $16 each. Save your money.

Its a salad. The grilled octopus that received so much praise in reviews, and something I almost always eat at other restaurants, really fell flat for me. It had little flavor - other than being SUPER fishy. I had the taste in my mouth all night. My friend had the pasta dish with black truffle and suckling pig. It was very good, buuuut nothing extraordinary. I've had better pasta dishes at many other restaurants. The staff, i will say, were great. Super attentive, friendly and gracious.  Also, while the atmosphere was lovely, from all the reviews I expected it to have a bit more of a cool edge. Is it the hip hop music playing in the background that afforded it all the ""hip"" and ""trendy"" critiques? I mean i love hip hop. But hip hop alone does notmake for cool. Not quite for me anyway. Oh, and I guess the squad of rats we encountered circling outside the restaurant didn't help the experience. Yes, I'm a New Yorker and know from our rats but this was a rat sighting like no other.

173,T T.,"Cambridge, MA",0,297,327,2.0,9/25/2013,"While our dinner at Charlie Bird started off well, it quickly went downhill with several over-salted and imbalanced dishes.We started with the grilled peach and prosciutto salad with onions and walnuts; the peaches were fresh and juicy, and the prosciutto was surprisingly light yet flavorful.  The dish was the perfect size and nicely paired sweet and savory.  We also had the tripe ""lovely style"" on toast; I'm used to eating tripe in large pieces where the consistency is chewy, but this tripe was cooked down and was unexpectedly soft.  The dish was quite good, and the portion was generous.  The flavor profile could be described as a tripe bolognese of sorts.The Chitarra nero, a black pasta with crab and zucchini, was pretty good; the pasta had a good bite to it, and the crab was fresh (although there wasn't much of it).  Bread crumbs added a nice texture to the dish.  The duck egg spaghetti was overly rich and lacked the textural contrast the Chitarra nero had.  The spaghetti was a bit overcooked, and the lemon in the sauce overpowered the dish.  The uni was not bad, though.We ended up sampling four large plates.  We heard rave reviews of the roasted chicken, but we found it to be slightly dry, and parts of it (particularly the skin) were extremely salty.  The suckling pig was moist but did not have a particularly special flavor; the kimchi pairing was odd and unpleasant.  The grilled black bass was hearty, but the broth it came in was very salty.  The skate on the wing was a bit on the dry side, and the skin was very salty; its accompanying sweet corn added a nice brightness, though.For dessert, we shared the panna cotta with summer blueberry jam.  For a $12 dessert, the portion was notably measly, although it wasn't a good dessert, so we were happy not to have to eat more.  The panna cotta had a very strange taste reminiscent of birthday-cake-flavored cream, and the blueberry jam reminded me of the acai berry accompaniment you can get with Fage yogurt cups.  The blueberries did not taste fresh and many oddly had stems still attached to them.The dining room is comfortable and lively with a constant soundtrack of hip-hop tunes (although I found the music to be too loud and not to my taste).  While it's currently difficult to get a reservation, they do take walk-ins, and we were seated right away after showing up when they opened for dinner service.  Based on the dishes we tasted, though, we won't be coming back.",3,1,

I think I may have dipped my finger in it to make sure. For dinner, the majority of us had the Chitarra Nero, but I also got to try the suckling piglet and the Cappellacci which were all delicious and will not disappoint.  My friend who got the skate inhaled it without offering, so I'll assume she liked her dish too.  We also ordered artichokes and zucchini which were nice to have on the table, but honestly were not that memorable.  Oh and how can I forget.... They make this in house roasted olive oil chili sauce that they bring out with the focaccia; we kept this and added it to EVERYTHING we ate.  Super spicy and highly addictive!  The cocktail list is concise and while better than most restaurant cocktails, I'd suggest sticking to their wines (212 cocktail was my favorite of the ones we tried).  The sommelier recommended an Italian red to have with our dinner, and while I don't normally like Italian wines, this $40 Nero d'Avola definitely hit the spot.And since it was a gluttonous evening, we tried three equally sinful desserts.  The highlight for me was the olive oil ice cream that accompanied a salty chocolate cake. I could not stop eating it.  The panna cotta was well executed and the pistachio butter on the lemon cake was divine. Too bad it was just a spot on the plate, because I could eat a whole jar of that alone.  Thank you Charlie Bird for an excellent meal!",6,,4

Food: 4 stars (need to comeback and try more!)Service: 5 starsVibe: 4.5I have been planing to try out CB for couple weeks now. A spontaneous drink invite from a good friend bought me to CB. Once seated, the bar tender offered me the menu and water. He made excellent recommendation on my glass of wine and later, the bottle of rose from Loire Valley.  I really appreciate that he had been very patient and politely asked our food order while me and my friend were too exciting to catch up and forgot ordering :) For the service alone, I would give 5 stars.Onto the food. We ordered 3 small plates and an entree to share: grilled octopus salad, grilled peaches and prosciutto, fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and anchovy and Gnocchi rosa. All fantastic. My personal favorite is the octopus - great texture, not too soft not chewy and nicely charred. The gnocchi rosa was tomato base sauce with a spicy kick. I usually don't eat pasta but I love this one! The bottle of rose recommended for us paired perfectly with out food - dried and fruity. Another thing makes me coming back here would be the decor - airy and trendy. it is good for date night but probably not first date ;POverall, CB does not disappoint. it lives up to the hype. Will be back soon!",1,,1
184,Cara H.,"New York, NY",0,44,0,3.0,6/7/2015,"found it so odd that there was no brunch menu on a deserted saturday around 12:00. but i pressed bravely forth into a dinner-esque order. Ordered the farro salad, the cauliflower with hazelnuts, and the grilled sardines. the food was good, but not as remarkable as I would have hoped. felt like something a creative friend might put together at a dinner party. bathroom has got to be one of the tiniest ive seen, but impressively efficient in how it was laid out. i was amused by how the indicator on the door turned to ""engaged"" when it was locked. made me feel like i was stepping into a spaceship.",,1,
185,Pauline C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",126,107,362,3.0,9/28/2013,"I like the ambience of Charlie Bird. They played hip hop music and the waiters were attentive. We started with the razor clams and the scallop crudo. These two appetizers were very good. The seafood was really fresh and the flavored were great! The scallop crudo topped with warm butter was my favorite of the evening. We also ordered the fries potatoes, which were just French fries. I had the pasta special. It had broccoli rabe, sausage, and razor clams. My dish was so incredibly salty that I only are half if it. One of my friends had the rigatoni, which was just as salty. My friends who ordered the chicken and the piglet enjoyed their dishes. The consensus for the uni pasta was that it was overpoweringly lemony. Overall I give Charlie Bird 3 stars. Not sure if I would eat here again. Maybe I'll go back for the appetizers.",1,,
186,Zhana K.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,30,44,1.0,5/22/2014,"I am very easy to please, but the food here is SALTY!!!!!! I eat salt, but my salad was so salty I couldn't finish it and the portions are small!!!! If you would like to have a sodium overload, come here!!!! Otherwise, stay away!!!! And the waiter had an attitude the entire time and came to our table only to bring out the food!!! We had to ask another waiter for the check because she would walk past out table and ignore us! Meanwhile we were sitting outside and the tables are parallel to each other!!! Never coming here again!!!!!",,,
187,Olivia E.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,2.0,3/24/2015,"Charlie Bird is a great atmosphere for date night so I was really looking forward to a great meal with my boyfriend.  We went last week and I'm really sad to have to write such a bad review for what I thought was going to be a great dinner.  Almost everything, down to the bread was so salty that I left with an immediate upset stomach.  We were advised to order one thing from each part of the menu so we stayed relatively close to that suggestion. I'd say we could have made do without one of the smaller dishes had everything been good enough to finish.  What we ordered:1. Burrata Toast - salty but since it's cheese I'll give it a pass2. Grilled Octopus - this wasn't bad, a little salty but the octopus was cooked nicely and the accompaniments complemented it well, if we had just stopped with this dish, I could have walked away feeling ok3. Carbonara - the saltiest pasta I've ever had, pasta is probably my favorite food group but this was so bad that I couldn't finish it, doesn't appear to be on the menu on their website (for good reason)4. Pork Shoulder - this was just not appetizing, it was really fatty and had very few beans accompanying it5. Crispy Brussel Sprouts - they were surely crispy, I'd say they tasted OK but were pretty greasy, and salty but at this point I was just used to everything being saltyFor such an expensive dinner, you would hope to walk away happy.  Maybe a drink or two would have dampened my upset but the wine list was so marked up, I couldn't justify the purchase.  This wasn't my first visit to Charlie Bird but I think it might have to be my last.  Despite it's cuteness, I just can't risk paying so much money to feel so crappy.",1,,1
188,Lynn L.,"Las Vegas, NV",99,53,27,3.0,9/28/2016,"Service is slow, food is ok. The waiter never checked on us, not even once. He asked if we wanted dessert, while we were thinking about it, he took over 10 minutes before he came back.  We wanted dessert, but we were over it. The octopus was good, but too spicy for me. The squash blossoms were very good. The tripe toast was ok. The tagliatelle was really good. I wouldn't recommend or come back.",,,
189,Stacey F.,"Tampa, FL",12,129,5,3.0,2/15/2015,"Mixed bag. Took me awhile to eat here and the hype didn't live up the billing for me. The burrata and faro salad were my favorites...they were both fantastic. The chicken liver pate was a nice portion, but I didn't love it. My dining companion did devour it, though, so if this is your thing, I guess it's really good here. Pork shoulder was too salty. The rabbit pappardelle was overcooked (pasta not al dente) and tasted a bit bland. Maybe some of that salt from the pork dish should be added to this one.  We didn't get dessert but had a lovely bottle of an Italian red.   Service left a mixed taste in our mouths...couldn't wait to take our order or clear our plates, but totally disappeared in between. It also seemed like a bit of a chore for our server to get the sommelier to our table to help pick a bottle of wine.  Atmosphere/vibe was really enjoyable, which definitely helped our dining experience, but as mentioned already, just an overall mixed bag for us.",2,,
190,Jimmy C.,"Bensonhurst, NY",87,25,32,2.0,1/9/2015,I found this place off people's pictures on Instagram and it isn't as amazing as it looks. Went here twice and it was both mediocre. Opened a bottle of wine and had to constantly ask for a refill and the food was slightly disappointing. Best thing I had all night was their scallops with pistachio/ brown butter and this was an appetizer.i,4,1,
191,Irene S.,"New York, NY",15,78,26,5.0,1/4/2015,"I'm always skeptical of hyped places, especially ones with weird or vague concepts. Charlie Bird? Is that a chicken place? Does it have a jazz theme? No, wait, it's Italian. What is that nonsensical rhetoric on the website? And if the address is King Street, why is the entrance on 6th Ave?The confusion ends abruptly when the food arrives. On a recent Saturday afternoon, each dish was sharply focused, perfectly cooked and wondrous to eat. The first to arrive was octopus saltimbocca, which had only a tenuous relationship with the original. There were just two poached baby tentacles on a handful of chickpeas and topped with a crispy wafer of prosciutto. The portion was tiny but the flavors grand.Next came the Tuscan chicken liver, a smear of deeply savory puree with hints of sweet and sour. It was served with lightly toasted bread and garnished with micro radish slices and I think hazelnuts. We gobbled it so fast I can't be sure.The spaghetini nero with crab was bright and acidic, just on the edge of my comfort zone. But the richly flavored slippery noodles counteracted the lemony sauce. A handful of cherry tomatoes popped in the mouth and provided a nice textural contrast. Frankly the tiny flakes of crab were superfluous.Desserts were also exceptional. The olive oil and apple cake had both apple puree and fresh apple slices. My favorite part of the dish was the oat crumble that provided a bed for mascarpone gelato. The chocolate budino had a similarly crackly accompaniment, a kind of sticky, crunchy Rice Krispie confection with adult flavors.I wouldn't choose this restaurant after a day of working on the farm. You would go broke before your appetite was satisfied. But it's just the ticket to awaken a jaded urban palate.",3,1,1
192,Daniel D.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",2,59,1,2.0,10/25/2016,"Have been here twice now and was very underwhelmed both times. Dine at Charlie Bird and you'll undoubtedly have some yummy things, but also likely have some very bleh things. The octopus was solid, but good octopus has become pretty commonplace in NYC. Pasta is definitely overpriced for the portions and quality. Why go here when you can go to L'Artusi??",,,
193,Adam S.,"Manhattan, NY",27,120,3,4.0,2/15/2015,"I think this is a good choice for a interesting date spot or a group of great friends, with a creative sensibility. Its good food, trendy, cool decor, outside seating, West Village, and has a smattering of celebs. In all honesty there is better food to be had else where for the prices but the overall combination makes for a good Manhattan meal out.",1,,1

196,M L.,"Manhattan, NY",9,121,49,3.0,4/28/2015,"I had heard very good things about Charlie Bird. I thought it would be a great place for me and some old college roommates to get together. I booked a table for 3 at 6:30pm on a Friday evening through opentable.com. My friends arrived first and had a drink at the bar. The hostess asked if they wanted to sit outside. They said that seemed like a good idea, but when I arrived about 5-10 minutes later she said that she didn't have a table outside for us anymore. Hmm... OK. So we sat upstairs at an oddly shaped booth/table. We ordered a bunch of things and shared. We got the burrata toast, Roman artichokes, grilled octopus, asparagus, cauliflower, chitarra nero, and the black bass. Everything was very good and there are definitely other dishes that I would like to try. I think sharing is a good way to go among like-minded friends. The only slight disappointment was that the fish was a little undercooked. I suppose we could have sent it back, but it was fine. Our waiter was personable and seemed to know the menu pretty well. He was very attentive with our bottle of white wine that is kept on ice a the waiter's station. So, why only 3 stars? Well, first--I hardly ever give 5 stars. I really feel like any place probably has room for improvement and 5 stars should really be for the perfect place--or a near perfect place that has gone above and beyond. And definitely a penalty for that weird business with the hostess and the outside table. There's also something lacking in the atmosphere. I don't know what. I loved that there was old school rap playing in the background, but something it lacked some character. That's sort of all it takes, I guess.In the end, we had a very good meal and I would go back. I actually hope that subsequent visits will push this up to 4 stars.",,,
197,Mira L.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,82,11,2.0,11/11/2014,"We had to leave. The hostess was really nice but the waiter and sommelier acted as if they were doing us a favor by letting us eat there. I'm good, I'll take my food with friendly service. Thank you.",5,1,
198,Ben S.,"Centreville, VA",0,2,0,3.0,9/21/2016,"Doesn't live up to the hype for the price point. We had the oysters and octopus as appetizers, which were both very mediocre (and fishy). As entrees we had the chicken (which the waiter described as ""must have"") and the rigatoni. Both were about as average as I can remember. Not the worst meal I've ever had, but definitely nothing special. I honestly wouldn't go back - although there was a bulldog sitting next to me who may have made the experience worth it. Sometimes better to be lucky than good.",,,
199,James L.,"New York, NY",8,63,0,4.0,2/7/2015,"So I read somewhere that this is Jerry Seinfeld's favorite restaurant, which means it has plenty of chocolate babka but no mutton....okay maybe not.And don't bother, I have yet to run into anyone donning a pirate shirt during my more than ten visits to this establishment.  Weekend brunch is the best bet, when reservation is not necessary, and the two stars of the menu, Tuscan Chicken Liver and Roasted Chicken, are available.  I'd skip the often recommended farro salad unless you are on some strange grain diet.Oh, I have relatively little street cred when it comes to rap music, but even I know the music played here is dope?!  I, however, am an authority on roast chicken dishes in the city, since I order them all the time, even when it's not restaurant week!  Charlie's bird is even better Barbuto's in my opinion.",,3,
