0,Rashi B.,"Great Neck, NY",48,4,0.0,4.0,6/8/2018,"Hosted my birthday party here a couple of years ago. We did bottle service and the set up was on point. I had a group of about 15 people and we were given ample space and none of my guests had any issues at the door. The staff was really attentive and truly made it a great night. I ended up going back here a couple of weeks ago and still liked the place. It has a chill vibe, and good music. The crowd is a little on the young side, but other than that definitely would go back!",,,
1,Bryan P.,"Cranbury Township, NJ",0,4,0.0,1.0,9/15/2018,"This is my second time coming and it had a horrible experience... I had my 33rd birthday here and they had a private event and kicked everyone out.  I had 15 people there and spent over 1,000 there and to be kicked out was a horrible experience.  I will never spend a penny at this place and none of my friends will either.The manager lied and said he wasn't in charge which is completely ridiculous and I walked up to him and he said he was not in charge....  I have no respect for someone who cannot stand behind their decisionsWhoever you are manager, grow a back bone and learn how to be honest with people.",3,,1
2,Nora K.,"New York, NY",194,50,43,5.0,8/7/2018,"Libation is lit! I go here weekly. They host our kickball league flip cup. We always have a good time. At any time with the teams there, there can be 50-100 people in the bar. Even though it's very crowded the staff does a great job of keeping up with everyone. The dj does decent, could use some new bangers but it's enjoyable. Great options for drinks, i don't drink beer but people seems to enjoy the beers available. I would for sure bring friends here on the weekend for a fun bar atmosphere!",,,
3,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,4.0,1/21/2018,"The place is a total blast if you're twenty something, wanting to party, do shots, make-out with a random or two, and wake up on a bench somewhere, OR people watch that crowd.Libation is totally different whether you show up earlier on a weeknight evening, or late night Friday.If you go early enough, it has a sports bar feel. However if you come on a Friday night, expect a shit-show.I know I usually go to places with an older crowd, but I'd consider Libation a guilty pleasure, I guess you could say it brings me back to my youth just for a little bit.",3,1,1
4,Andrew G.,"New York, NY",172,5,0,1.0,9/10/2018,Walked in on a Sunday to a lively party. Sadly the bouncer was creepy and blatantly assaulted several women. When he groped a woman in our party and was confronted he asked 'what are you gonna do about it?' We along with others saw this happen and management did nothing about it.,2,,
5,Charlotte C.,"Queens, NY",193,6,0,5.0,10/6/2018,Called with a gang for brunch a few Sundays ago and cannot recommend the place enough. We sat upstairs and had the best brunch of our lives. The bartender was an absolute sweetheart and I cannot fault one single thing. Great vibe for a boozy brunch. We have been before and we will definetly be back,,,
6,Joseph S.,"Chicago, IL",172,182,235,4.0,12/4/2017,"Nice bar/club in the lower east side.Good dancing music usually. Good variety of drinks.The staff is friendly. The DJ plays some old and new songs and make sure people are dancing and moving. If you want to grab a drink, enjoy your time with friends and dance, that's a good spot. The drinks are not very expensive also.",,,
7,Anthony V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,65,3,4.0,8/12/2018,"We went here mid-day on a Saturday for drinks. Service was good, drinks were decently priced. They were doing brunch and the music was a throwback set with a fun atmosphere.",,,
8,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,4.0,6/5/2017,"I've been going to Libation for many years now and I always have a good time whether it's for brunch, happy hour or the weekend, it never disappoints. There's 3 floors, the 3rd usually has it's own dj as the 1st and 2nd share the same one since the 2nd floor overlooks the 1st. I was recently here for brunch, it was my third at Libation, so I'm just going to review brunch. It was a little different than I remembered, they've changed up the way they do their unlimited brunch for large groups. For large parties, I believe over 8 or 10 you'll have to leave a credit card, copy of your id, and brunch is served family style; you choose 3 entrees, 2 sides, and of course unlimited bloodys and mimosas. I was a little nervous about this new style, but it worked out fine. We had scrambled eggs, eggs benny, pancakes (entrees) and bacon and garlic herb french fries for the sides. The scrambled eggs, bacon, and fries were placed in large bowls on the table and the pancakes and eggs benny were passed. I had everything but the pancakes, it was all very good. The scrambled eggs weren't runny, the eggs benny were cooked through served on a english muffin, the bacon was crispy, and the fries were crunchy and super tasty not too garlicky at all. I thought toast would be included with the meal, but it wasn't, my sister asked for toast and they gave it to her free of charge. If you want toast with your brunch you'll have to ask, I'm not sure it that's additional. The servers kept our carafes full for the full 2 hours, the manager Ryan is hospitable, friendly, and will do whatever he can to make your brunch experience a great one! The brunch was for my cousin's bday so we asked our waitress if they do anything like cake or something, she said they had something a little better- a sparkler and shot of tequilla! It was super cute my cousin wasn't expecting it and the sparkler was a great touch for pics! The bill for 9 people which included tax and tip was $520; $57 a person. The dj plays the whole time, it's pretty loud, unless you opt to sit on the 2nd floor where you can dance and chat with your friends; the 1st floor is way louder since the dj booth is there. Great food, good service, and good music!",6,1,3
9,Chi A.,"New Haven, CT",7,105,87,4.0,2/20/2018,"My friend had her birthday brunch at Libations this past Sunday which I attended. My review is focused on the service not even the food. The staff here is amazing. I say that because it is so important especially out in NY where service can be lack luster. Everyone from the waitress, the bouncer (which is rare), to the manager were amazing. I had a issue and the manager William swiftly rectified with and his approach was A1. That is how a manager should react. I was and I am still very much impressed. All in all, I'll be back!!",,,
10,Jenna L.,"Syracuse, NY",314,379,1567,2.0,5/22/2017,"The bartenders are nice here but drinks were crazy expensive. Spent almost $100 on one round of drinks. The place is extremely packed and you can't even move around. Music is good but the DJ won't play a song if you request one. I went up twice and requested the same song he said he would play it but didn't. I even tipped him and he still didn't play the song. Annoyingggg. This isn't even on my top 20 bars to visit in the city. Not worth it at all. There was a $10 dollar cover for guys on Saturday, free for girls. The bar is 2 floors, but for some reason the top floor wasn't open. After a few hours I was getting annoyed Bc I literally COULD NOT BREATH because the place was so packed, people just plow through the crowd and bump into you with no care in the world. Overall, We had a good time with our friends but TBH I wouldn't come back to this bar. They provide bottle service also but why pay $200+ dollars for a bottle + a booth when it's A TINY CRAMPED SPACE?? Dumb.",2,1,1
11,Linda M.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,180,484,3.0,6/26/2017,This was an ok spot.  Service was great and very attentive.  Food was just ok.  We both had the Brunch special which came with unlimited mimosas. I had the grilled cheese sandwich with French fries. My friend had the pesto pasta with chicken. The grilled cheese sandwich was OK. Fries were a bit bland. Pasta had flavor but way too many sun dried tomatoes which tasted undercooked and tough. The music was incredible and was one of the reasons we had a good time.,1,,
12,Dumond A.,"Manhattan, NY",7,87,5,4.0,8/2/2017,"If you want a chill bar with plenty of room for beer games, decent music and friendly staff, this is the place for you.Prices are a tad high, but doable.  Food is OK, service is always prompt, and the place never gets too crowded during weeknights unless a bar-crawl or something is going on.The bartender is always generous with giving us plastic cups and beerpong balls every time we go in, which is surprisingly not that common in NYC sports bars.Definitely recommend if you're interested in relaxing and having a good time with a group of friends.",,,
13,Alanna P.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",0,4,1,3.0,5/7/2018,"Went for brunch for a friend's birthday- service was great and our waitress was attentive, great with bringing refills, and so so sweet (i wish i got her name)! Our group of 7 and paid roughly $70/person after gratuity was included. Overall way too expensive for mimosas made with cheap champagne and a mediocre meal.  Definitely not worth it. Save your $$!!",2,,
14,Laura C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",753,759,1634,4.0,3/28/2017,"You know what, I came into this place thinking I wasn't going to have a good time as it wasn't really my 'scene.' And, I had only come in here because my best friend was hosting her birthday here. Libation really took care of our group for a Saturday brunch. Bottomless mimosas (definitely not strong), Bloody Mary's and a complimentary round of Tequila shots and a bottle of champagne... not too shabby for a celebration!Also, the buffet brunch. Also... not bad! I did enjoy the fried chicken. I also heard the crab cakes were good but I wasn't in the mood. A lot of people went up for seconds. Another perk is that we had our own little space to host the event which meant we didn't get too much bar traffic. I know when I left the bar I was peeved about how cramped and loud it was on the first floor.Also to note, the bathroom are in the basement, so I did have to hitch down three flights of stairs each time. Some of the locks on the doors didn't work, so try and bring a friend to stand guard.",1,1,
15,Abby Y.,"Corona, NY",32,119,64,2.0,10/22/2017,"Bar? Sports bar? Club? Dance club? I'm not sure what this place is but the DJ loves his sports ball and stopped the music to cuss his displeasure, loudly. His transitions were choppy and he shouts out birthday well-wishes in between asking people to clear the couches of clothes and bags. Lacked seating, cramped, and way too loud. On AT&T and had reception issues. Overall experience was meh at best.",,,

Place is always jumping even on the weekdays so I was so happy my job decided to have it here,They shutdown the entire place just for us, both floors! Very spacious on the first floor with a fully stocked bar comfortable seating area and the food was absolutely delicious! I didn't try the pasta but the chicken was wonderfully marinated and the steak was delicious! They had a couple different kinds of rice I went for the rice with black beans and it was incredibly tasty! The entire staff were extremely gracious to us including management, The second floor is smaller but very cool overlooking the first,Nice little seating area once again with a smaller bar but also fully stocked with great bartenders, The DJ was awesome and I look forward to coming back here on a day off!",2,1,1
17,Racheal D.,"Brooklyn, NY",625,217,447,3.0,3/13/2017,"This review is for their brunch only.  My friend made a reservation for a birthday brunch this past Saturday.  Once you have a minimum of 15 people, they require you to do their prefix menu with drinks (bottomless mimosa and bloody mary) which is a whooping $45.00 per person (not including gratuity and tax of course).  Myself and one of my other friend do not drink alcohol and the waitress was nice enough to let us slide costing us only $22.00 per person (includes bottomless coffee).   Food wise - very average.. we had the eggs benedict, tator tots with red hot sauce, french toast with fruits, and bacon mac and cheese.  The bacon mac and cheese was probably the best dish they had.  Service here is really slow too - there are times where I had to ask for a refill for coffee TWICE before she brought me a new cup and also I had to wait at least 10 minutes for a refill of sugar.  The waitress was also VERY busy talking to a friend of ours on the table while I handed her the check - please be a bit more professional.FYI - you need a 21+ ID to enter Libation since its considered a bar.  I don't think I would come back.",,,

She ""fixed"" the check and we literally still kept the amount of money we were originally putting down before we realized the issue (we work in service and we know how to tip). We triple counted our total and then the waitress came back stating the bill was over a $100 short... which was pure b.s. overall, we had to pay over $100 for a brunch.",2,,
20,Christine H.,"New York, NY",108,215,224,5.0,10/1/2016,I celebrated my birthday at Libations it was a great time in September. The brunch is really good the dishes were tasty and clean. The mimosas could be a little sweeter but other than that it was an awesome time. Service and music were on point everyone was super nice and educated. I bought in small favors for my guest and they didn't have an issue or anything we felt right at home. I definitely recommend this place if you want to have a boozy brunch and party on a Sunday afternoon! Bad part of all of this is the parking in the area. Beware!!! Brunch is only until 5pm so make sure you are there before 3pm so you can get your 2 hours worth of drinks.,3,,
21,Caitlin O.,"Edison, NJ",3,10,1,3.0,3/5/2018,"Went for brunch for a friend's bday.  They were good about refilling mimosas, but they were of cheap quality and the food was less to be desired for.  The food was served ""family style"" because of the large group, but there wasn't really enough food for everyone.  And rather than leave the dishes on the table like family style usually is, the server would just come to the table and put one small piece on your plate if you want, but then walk away with the rest of the food on the platter, without asking if anyone wanted more, and without ever bringing that dish back to the table again at any point.  The food was bland and not very good.  Overall it was a letdown and expensive for what it was.",,,
22,Taylor J.,"Queens, NY",0,7,0,1.0,12/16/2017,"Great atmosphere, but 20% for a waitress who Stated she was the manager was ridiculous. She tended to our needs when she felt like it.

I recommend the orchard burger and the egg/cheese/bacon wontons . Negatives is because of the type of place it is , it smells like a college bar : wet , damp, beer soaked floors.

However they didn't leave any platters on the table. They came around and served us and the Birthday girl had to get up to alert staff to bring more food to the table several times. I only had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was realllly good. Definitely a pleasant surprise. Good music. Service is decent as well. Only problem was the glasses that were placed on our table had lipstick stains. They were immediately replaced. MIGHT be back.,,,

I had an old fashioned - which was fine but who muddles fruit anymore?  Bartender was nice enough.Great for the younger crowd, but too loud for me Friday evening.

The waiter and bartender were amazing. The unlimited mimosas were creeping up on us.

The drinks are on the steep side and the people here were kind of pretentious. It's a younger crowd than expected, like early to mid 20s (at least it seemed that way). Lots of fratty looking guys and sorority girls. No true dance floor that I saw on the floor I was on. The narrow hallways that leads you up the stairs to the bar area can get congested, especially since the coat check is also here!",6,3,4

It was pretty slow that day but she made sure we were all always having fun! It's definitely decently priced for brunch in the city, not cheap though. 50$ comes to 65$ with gratuity and tax. They have a wide range of food choices and the mimosas were actually pretty good and I'm not usually a fan!  I definitely recommend for a girls day in the city!!",,,

Then of course only half the party arrived on time and he was able to help not only push it back an Hour but also extend the end time.

I would have given this place 3 stars had it not been for the horrible service. Maybe they were short-staffed that day or maybe they just don't care. The busboy kicked out our party of 10 off the table and we had to chase the waitress down for the check.(We also chased her down for coffee, milk, dessert and a spoon.) We were all well aware of the 2 hour max per table but didn't have a chance to close out the check at the table. The busboys literally bumped us off our seats and began clearing out full glasses of already paid for drinks. Try closing out the check and handing it to your customers as a reminder that the two hours is up. A little more finesse would go a long way.

40,Alyssa A.,"Smyrna, GA",63,91,22,3.0,6/26/2015,"Went here for my birthday last weekend (6/20) for the first time and I had a great time! I came in on a Saturday for brunch for my girls and I. We got seated in the corner and the round of mimosas started.The DJ is great. He plays an awesome mix of music that will suit EVERYONE in the group that you're with. No matter what each person may like, they will all jam to the music at some point. I thoroughly enjoyed the food. I had the french toast with fruit on top (the fruit was fresh which was awesome) and I also had a side of bacon mac and cheese. MAN. The BMC is delicious. I was trying to take some home for later on that day but I just couldn't help myself and finished it all. The rest of the girls in my party also enjoyed their food. I tasted my sister's breakfast burrito and home fries and they were yummy! Towards the end, I had received happy birthday sparklers and a round of shots for everyone (cheesecake for me).  But, I know you're wondering why this place only got 3 stars right? Well, let me explain.I didn't enjoy the mimosas. I liked that the pitchers kept coming but I had about 7 of them and I wasn't even drunk, which meanssss the mimosas are watered down pitchers of something. Now, if we're playing $39+ per each person, you gotta come with stronger drinks than that. At the end of our bottomless brunch fun, the bill arrives and it was WAY more than what we expected (like in the $300 range for 5 people). Now, thank God we all have good jobs so we didn't mind paying this bill. But what we later realized was, there were two fat charges on our bill: one charge of $51 for gratuity and one charge of $51 for service. So then we thought... aren't these along the lines of the same thing? Why were we charged twice? Unfortunately we couldn't question this because we were long gone... So I say all of this to say, this place is a good time, but be aware!",5,,1

I tried the buffalo tater tots while we waited for the whole party to get there and I'm very happy I did. They were really good and had a little kick but not too spicy.

It wasn't even 12 yet and it was dead inside so why did we get charged $10?!? Eventually I just dropped it and tried to enjoy the rest of my night, but it was hard with the terrible tasting drinks... The only reason I gave two stars was because of the music. They played a lot of throwback music that we all enjoyed. Will NOT be back...",2,,
43,Denzyl A.,"Plainfield, NJ",489,119,131,3.0,3/25/2016,"I've heard so much about this place in the past, and I was excited when I was able to participate in the grand turn better known as brunch, this past Sunday, at Libations. Unfortunately, I have to say that the experience fell short of my initial expectations as I was hoping for a 5 star experience.Ambiance is decent. Libations has a very sports bar feel to it and while lighting is low, you can see the high turn up potential when you walk in. I was with a party of 10 and my first complaint came at the seating arrangement. While being upstairs was pretty dope, the seating felt pretty squeezed together as if somebody said ""yea y'all can sit with us we can make room at this table that's meant for 8"". Waiters were very cool and accommodating, but they were very clear on the strict time limit for brunch as they had another party immediately following us. The bartender that was by our table was dope as well as he made sure our carafe's bottomless function was fully functioning (there was a brief moment when the bottom was actually visible before he came, but he corrected that immediately).Now for the food, a key organ of the brunch body. I ordered the chicken & waffles which came with gravy and a Tabasco maple syrup. While the chicken itself was beautiful the rest of the components to the dish weren't. The waffles were sub-par, the maple syrup was more sticky Tabasco sauce than maple anything, and the gravy........no thanks. Other dishes that the rest of my party had seemed like it had potential however. I heard great things about the burger and the huevos rancheros looked and smelled amazing. I'll just chalk it to the fact that maybe this place isn't meant for chicken and waffles and keep hope alive.As for the overall turn up, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The downstairs area was packed with people with carafes of mimosas, and other drinks, partying up a storm. The music was bumping, people were dancing, and i'll give myself a proud pat on the back for starting an electric slide or two.All-in-all, while the food was disappointing, Libations left enough of an impression on me to not turn my head at it in the future.",5,1,
44,Shakira W.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,208,243,3.0,4/4/2015,"Compared to all the brunches I have been to in NYC, Libations is simply one I do not recommend. You can choose their all you can drink for two hours option ($40) which includes mimosas or Bloody Mary's. I went today and chose the mimosas and because it was disgustingly watered down I then opted to upgrade to well drinks (+$20). This too was not worth it at all. The only plus was the very nice bartender Thais (love that name). She made sure my table was taken care of and even poured in more alcohol when we asked. If you are however into watered down drinks they seem like a great option for large groups. This place was just not for me.",3,,

Last night's drinking venture my girlfriend and I decided to pop into this place. Surprisingly the LINE was non existent. I thought since it took us like 5 minutes to get in the place would be dead. Sure enough as we got inside the place was packed from back to back. We managed to weave our way to the bar grab a few drinks / shots. Super sweet bartender btw! This place has been consistently fun and never an issue minus the nuisance of desperate guys trying to start a conversation with you in the club. Yet you can't and don't hear a damn thing due to excessive loud crowd and music. & all you want to do is just dance, dance, dance!",3,1,

Drinks are good, service was great but music was horrible. Remixes were too short, not enough time to realize what song is playing. We were about to leave around 2:30(we got there so late) when the music actually became better. DJ mixed English and some spanish and I don't mean the typical PitBull song. Come here for the pregame but don't except stellar music until two hrs before closing.",,,
48,Cynthia G.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",7,15,49,3.0,4/7/2016,"Brunch was good. Went for a bday. It's $45 a person. They only use 2 cards towards the bill.. SO BRING CASH... Save yourself the headache. They add a service charge along with the gratuity and taxes, which really makes brunch $62 a person.... You have to choose between bloody Mary's or mimosas. Drinks were good. The booth they gave us was a bit dirty ...I just took a napkin and wiped it down and picked up the dirty straw and bottle cap. They gave us shots with sparklers  for my friends birthday which was really nice. Our waitress was really nice and friendly. The fries were really good. Music was okay. It was mostly hot 100 type of music a lot of pop and main stream. The space was pretty small but beautiful. The bathrooms were clean",1,,

Get here early so you can take full advantage of the unlimited mimosas.  They stop around 4pm. For $20-25 extra you can upgrade to top shelf.  That's great! The menu had great choices to pick from and I had a hard decision to make.  I went with the scrambled eggs and steak.  I asked my for steak  to be cooked medium and it was a bit well done. That was my only complaint.  The fruit was fresh and I enjoyed my meal. The atmosphere was great. Music was pumping and I felt like just getting up and dancing.  I definitely will be back.",,1,3

53,Catherine W.,"New York, NY",371,4,5,1.0,1/2/2018,"Went here on New Years Eve, a brutally cold night. Paid about $120 dollars for a ""VIP"" ticket that was meant to provide access to the whole place, but at the door they said it didn't matter and no one gave us a VIP wristband or anything, meaning that you gained nothing by paying extra for the VIP ticket. The worst part was that the front door was left open the entire time, filling the downstairs area (where the bathrooms and coat check are) with freezing cold air, so you froze while checking / picking up your coat or waiting for the bathroom. Really unsafe / stupid, especially since the women's bathroom only had three stalls so there was always a line extending out into the freezing cold hallway, leaving many women (most of whom were wearing dresses) shivering as they waited. Coat check moved slowly and had a whopping $6 fee (cash required,) which felt exploitative given how cold it was outside. Drinks (part of a ""premium open bar"" included in the ticket price) were mediocre and watered-down, and the music was nothing to write home about. All in all, a real disappointment, especially given how expensive the tickets were.",1,,
54,Lisa A.,"Lodi, NJ",446,371,543,4.0,11/6/2014,"I was surprised to see such poor review of the place but I guess it's mainly restaurant related.  My review is strictly for the night time lounge.  I came here last winter on a Friday or Saturday night and stumbled here after having a weird experience at Piano's next door.  Libation, in my opinion, is the perfect type of lounge.  The DJ was playing awesome music to dance to (and also taking requests... it's Britney B*tch :P) and  I really liked the fact that the dance area was large enough for everyone to dance but there were also small tables and seats around the dance floor to sit at.  So when you're tired of dancing you can actually find a place to rest without fighting for a place to sit.  It's always nice to have the option to just sit and chill or dance the night away!   Maybe there are less seats during summer time, I went during winter but the place was still pretty packed.  There is also an upstairs area but that was closed off due to a private party (not sure if it's normally open or not.) I think the drinks were normally priced for the NYC area and the decor/ambiance was cool... it was nice and open, not too cramped like some other NYC places.  Also, the crowd seemed to be pretty good!  I didn't see too many hipsters like Piano's and no one that seemed too pretentious.All in all I had a great time there!  I'm definitely planning on going back soon!",1,,2

57,Ashley S.,"Ridgefield, NJ",11,17,10,2.0,2/19/2017,"Went here for Sunday brunch and ate on the 3rd floor. I would say our experience here was just okay. Nothing too exciting. The DJ wasn't even there on time. Then when he did get there, he was horrible. Had a horrible playlist. The drinks were always flowing which was a good thing. The food was okay. But I'm not sure it was worth the money. We had a 12:00 reservation, and we were almost the only ones there. It didn't get crowded until we were leaving around 2:30/3:00. Also, the bathroom is unisex and the doors don't lock. When we walked in, my friend said she felt like we were at a VFW hall because they had folding chairs and tables set up for us to sit at with plastic tablecloths. We probably won't return here.",,,
58,Michelle W.,"New York, NY",520,1155,48,4.0,5/5/2014,"I had my doubts about this place with all the awful reviews, but I must say, I had a great time at this place. Aside from the fact that the guys in our group had to pay a $15 cover, the girls got in free and our hectic night turned into a pretty great one. The music was good. Lots of oldies, but goodies, but the music was awesome. Our bartender was fantastic and we literally stood at the bar and kept the shots flowing for about 3 hours straight. It was crowded, of course, but compared to some other places in the area, we had room to dance. The people here are a little odd. This one girl was rubbing her ass all over my bf, so we switched places and I started to dance with her. When she realized we had switched places, she gave me a stank face and moved away. Um, you started it first and really, we're at a bar, you're bound to end up dancing with someone else, guy or girl, so relax. You might need a few more shots. All in all, great night and would definitely come back again. I will say though, Nathan L. has it right. Every two seconds my hands were in the air...",3,3,2

Our table was a folding table with folding chairs and a table cloth. The food was good, the 2 hour champagne brunch was okay. I had about 10 mimosas and I didn't even leave with a buzz. My friend did the 2 hour open bar and they just kept bringing her beers non-stop (I would suggest that over the $25 for endless brunch cocktails). The music was good. It's very dark in there, no windows. Probably wouldn't go again, feels like a one and done place.",1,1,1

My friend selected which items she wanted off the menu beforehand and there were four dishes served family style for our group of 18. The bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches were delicious, as was the French toast. The fries were also a big hit at the table. The staff was very attentive to refilling the dishes as they emptied which was also a nice bonus. The mimosas were bottomless for two hours included with the brunch for $45 (little more per person with tax and tip). They also surprised us with free fireball shots for the entire group at the end of our reservation. Environment was not super clubby for a Sunday brunch time. They had the football game on which gave it a more relaxed vibe.",,,1
62,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",877,406,479,4.0,2/19/2016,"Came to libation to celebrate 2 parties, and I'm a fan!The lines for Libation move really fast compared to other places in the LES, so for the polar vortex this already made me love the place. The bouncers were nice, not d-bags, the entrance fee for men was 50 for open bar or 20 without open bar [which is optional] and ladies have no entrance fee if they do not do open bar from 10-1. They also pop in randomly inside just to see how the tables are doing, I have never met people as nice as the staff. The dress code in here is not too strict either, you could probably get away with jeans and dressy sneakers, you don't have to wear slacks and a lot of girls were dressed casual too. As long as you don't have sweatpants and running shoes on your good.Once you enter you have to go down the stairs for coat check which is across from the bathroom, and then upstairs is the main floor with a bar and VIP tables for bottle service and the top floor has additional VIP tables with plenty of space. Each floor did not have as much space as I hoped but there was just enough to dance, I never felt squished, but the tables are decent in size so I would rather have more room at the table then the dancefloor. The open bar deal was a bargain , since they did not let you have straight shots, they would just pour a huge shot into a 16 oz glass with soda or whatever mixed drink you wanted them to make. The male bartender was super friendly and actually poured my lemon drop drink into a martini glass so after 3 of them it really hit me. I also see the bartenders genuinely care for their customers because after my boyfriends bff got wasted he lost of track of how much $$ he was tipping, and the bartender realized he was drunk so she really did not want to accept his 20 dollar tip per drink. Majority of bartenders in NYC are money hungry and don't care for your integrity really.Also when people spilled their drinks all over the floor the mess was mopped up right away and our tables were always cleaned, its nice to find a club that doesn't look like a dump.The music itself did not have much variety and that's why I took off one star, top 40s hits and old rap is fine don't get me wrong, but they could of played some other things like EDM dance tracks and reggaeton. I felt like I got bored with the music at one point. The DJ also didn't really interact with the crowd too much and not much shout outs were made.I also don't like the people themselves here, the women in particular here are prissy , stuck up or just thots. A lot of the men here were pervs that were drunk and high that would literally grind up on anything. Oh and did I mention the bathroom was actually clean with a really friendly bathroom attendant? In the city they usually grill you for a dollar.The place closes around 4 so you do have plenty of time to party which is most important, I recommend this place for girls nights out or birthdays. I do plan on returning someday for a brunch so stay tuned for my next review :)",8,3,6
63,Nina P.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,214,53,4.0,3/2/2014,"Libation, you won me over! I was incredibly impressed with their Saturday brunch. The food was delicious and of great quality, and I loved the bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys. It wasn't your average brunch, the DJ played music, the lights were dimmed down low, and we were given glow necklaces. If it was your birthday, they gave a cake with sparkers. Great way to celebrate a birthday brunch. The service was great and we rarely had to wonder where our waitor/waitress was. They warned us right away to order ASAP because the food may take a while to come out, but thankfully we came early and even when our friends were trickling in their food did not take a long time to come out.There are only 3 reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars: 1. at times the music was TOO loud, to the point that it was hard to hear the people next to me 2. the mimosas were definitley watered down 3. (Most importantly) The bathroom stalls could have been cleaner. I dreaded going in there",1,,

Let's be clear, libation is a club, but I guess they make a few extra bucks by pulling in some plastic tables and chairs on Sunday morning and offering drinks and food. But we had a great time regardless. We didn't have a reservations, but we were still able to be seated without any hassle or wait.Just a warning: this is not the place to come for a quiet cocktail brunch. The music and loud and the people are certainly louder. My friend and I happened to be sitting across from a birthday group who was a little rowdy, but it didn't bother us much.The food was good. It's definitely not the best brunch I've ever had, but it did do the job. The job being to line my stomach enough to keep downing mimosas, which I happily did.Lastly, the music was on point! I was surprised to see that they had a live DJ for a regular Sunday afternoon, but he was very good. Played a good mix of pop, hip hop, edm.

This was one of the more reasonably priced parties at the time that we purchased. It included 5 hour premium open bar and hors d'oeuvres. We got there early, around 8:30 because we were afraid of a line. We got right in and went all the way upstairs where there was music, some NYE party favors and a few VIP tables. We hung around until 9:00 for the open bar and enjoyed mini crab cakes which were awesome, Mac and cheese balls, chicken skewers and meatballs. Everything was great. The bartender, Ryan was so attentive and we did not have to fight our way to get a drink at any point in the night. He was also very nice and relaxed which is a standout trait for a bartender on NYE. Ryan also came to my aid when bouncers kicked out a crazy guy for throwing a drink on me. (So random, still a fun time). The drinks were great for it being an open bar, the space was really nice. (I think the Dj might've been downstairs because we had 2013 hits playing upstairs) and the location was free of any Times Square madness. I should also mention that the ladies room bathroom attendant was one of the most patient people I've ever seen in action.

So many jalapeno peppers, I was on fire, and in a good way!Your waiters will always do you a solid and make sure to pour your glasses before the brunch hour ends.

The night I went, it wasn't too crowded but it seemed like it attracted a younger college crowd. Some points worth mentioning:- $20 minimum to use card. I normally carry cash on me but I didn't have any at the time. So I just paid for my friend's beer. Even though my tab didn't even add up to $20 in the end, the bartender just let me go and let me use my card. - they have a beer pong table. Not sure when's out, but that particular night, I saw a few guys messing around with that. - Their beer selection included more mainstream selections like Corona and craft beer selections like Sweet Action (my personal fav).",,,

80,Neesha C.,"New York, NY",1,15,3,5.0,3/14/2017,So called here to make a reservation for Sunday 03/12/17 they said they don't make reservations for groups less than 3 people.So we took a chance and went best decision ever! Got there around 2:45 remember there brunch is only until 5:00 pm!They seated us on the third floor right in front of the DJ it was such nice music. Not the typical normal songs this DJ spun throwbacks and mixed it into new songs too he was good! They kept re filling our pitchers of Mimosa's (limitless brunch)  without us even asking and the food came out so fast everyone loved the food I got steak and eggs the sauce they used was amazing my friend did chicken and waffles and my other friend had the french toast! The waitress was awesome it def gets packed for a Sunday but she was on point! Music was awesome def a great time!  Everyone was LIT dancing and having a good time! Ask to be seated on the third floor will DEF come back again :)! SO overall great time! I even called them asking if they would have that cool robot dancer they have some days I noticed in there pictures they told me they wouldn't but it was still a fun time!!,,,
81,Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,255,104,5.0,3/30/2013,"BRUNCHBoozy Brunch (Saturday) was amazing. I ordered an omelet that came with potatoes, bacon, toast, and fruit. My boyfriend had the burger, which he described as ""the best burger I've had this year."" Everything was delicious and the portion size was not skimpy. The bartenders make the mimosa's themselves and they were a bit sweeter than regular mimosas (more of a mix btw a mimosa and a bellini). My glass was never empty and their mixture was strong. Service was great: everyone was friendly and we did not feel rushed to leave. No complaints. I'll definitely be coming back.",1,,
82,Julia L.,"New York, NY",315,315,19,4.0,11/14/2014,"I have been to Libation numerous times and each time it's a different experience.The first time I came here was for a Alumni Wisconsin thing. (I'm an adopted badger;]) which was super fun. They had drinks, dancing, talking, appetizers, the works. The second time I went here was at night for a friend's birthday. It was a TOTALLY different experience. It was definitely club like on every floor which was super fun, but super different. The third time I came here was to watch a football game and drink some beer. My friend Kadie has written a review of our experience. It was the day after Halloween so I understand the slowness, but it was REALLY slow and the waiter and bartender weren't communicating and it was a mess. However, the manager made up for the slowness and we ended up getting treated VERY well by the end of our stay. All in all I really like Libation - Would I come here every weekend? Mmmm probably not. It is a great spot to go to when you want to have a good time and the fact that management is on top of their stuff is really comforting if you're having a poor experience.Keep up the good work Libation. I'll see you soon :] Go Badgers!",2,,
83,Alexa I.,"Kings Park, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/29/2015,"I went to bottomless brunch for my birthday this Sunday.  HORRIBLE. We saw how much champagne was in the mimosas poured at the bar which was close to nothing.  Drank 3 pitchers of mimosa by myself didn't even have a buzz.  Bad food was expected for a bottomless brunch, but it was more like bottomless orange juice mixed with club soda and a splash of champagne. I will never go back.",1,,1
84,Ashley C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",280,59,339,4.0,1/9/2016,"Your slightly above average birthday brunch place. Came here to celebrate two of my girlfriend's birthdays on a Saturday afternoon and had a great time. With the juices flowing, groovy tunes (90's hits- you can never go wrong with this theme), and amazing company, I enjoyed myself. The food is actually really tasty and this isn't my drunk self babbling. The bacon, pesto pasta, chicken sandwiches, savory fries, pancakes, and much more were delicious. I had 5 plates and probably could've kept going if it wasn't for the time limit (2 hours)  womp womp. I think they could benefit from telling you ahead of time what alcohol is included (beers and mixed drinks such as pineapple/rum, whiskey/gingers) because they are not part of the deal unless you choose to tack on $20/pp for the upgrade. In addition to being more clear about the packages, they should probably hire some more staff/assign two people per a party. Our poor waitress did her best to keep up but we alone had 20 people in our group and she was tending to more than one party. This affected how often she came by to replenish the carafes aka wasted drinking time on a 2hr limit...people get thirsty when they know it's ""all you can drink"". Final thoughts...Would I come back? Yes. Is this a suuuuuuper amazing place? No. However, if you come with a group, an appetite, and you're not super snobby about ambiance, this is a great place to get your brunch on.",1,,

Even Goose Island and Gun Hill IPA's are included in the happy hour offer.Food is just your regular pub food and nothing to brag about.Place is more like a night club than a pub.

The regular brunch fare was on the menu...steak and eggs, pancakes, french toast, eggs benedict, sandwich, and burger. All were ordered at our table and by the empty plates I would say it was definitely enjoyable. While this was happening.. whenever the pitcher of mimosa was down to the last drop it was quickly scooped up and we were given another full pitcher. Never truly happens at all you can drink brunch spots.The staff was friendly, and the price was definitely great... brunch w/ unlimited drinks... $19... Sweet!For all those who didn't have a good experience the last time, I say try it now... you may be surprised.",7,1,
87,Lillian C.,"Palo Alto, CA",812,717,51,3.0,11/12/2012,"We came here the Friday of Halloween weekend around 11 and I guess it was pretty early because it wasn't too crowded and there wasn't a line to get in. Also, there wasn't really anyone dressed up for some reason! We ended up just getting bottles for our group since it was such a good deal. We got Three Olives vodka. I've never had this vodka before, but I actually like how it tasted! We got a table in the corner to ourselves and we just hung out until we finished the bottle and went to another club.I don't really like the set up of the club too much because there really isn't a dance floor. And we had to walk through a whole crowd of people in order to get from the girls restroom (downstairs) to our table. Plus, everyone standing waiting for drinks just blocked the way... just not the best design for flow of traffic at a club. Also, they played hip hop at first and didn't play house and more upbeat stuff until after 12. I can tell that after 12 everyone started to get into the music more, but we were ready to move on to another venue.Come here and get a bottle and chill for the first stop of the night!",1,,

89,Sophie F.,"Maplewood, NJ",194,233,15,3.0,1/4/2014,"After reading the reviews, I was a bit hesitant about coming here and had the lowest of expectations. Hubby insisted that the food was good and that I would enjoy myself. I did not quite believe him since he came here for brunch after a night of heavy drinking but still, I decided to give it a try. From appearance, there's no mistaking that Libation is a bar. TVs all around showing sports, music playing, and of course, the bar that runs the length of the place. We arrived right at opening. I'm not sure if this is an every weekend occurrence, but there was a scavenger group congregating by the hostess' station the day we went. The hostess might assume you are with the group if you arrive early so make sure you seek her out so you don't end up waiting. The hostess who seated us was very nice and asked us immediately, ""Mimosa or Bloody Mary?"" We went with the mimosa. Not the best mimosa but definitely not the worst. For our meals, I went with the Brunch Burrito and he went with steak and eggs. I assumed the bacon came on the side, but nope. Everything mentioned (minus seasoned potatoes and fruit) was rolled up in a delicious, well made burrito. The pico de gallo added a a nice kick and some crunch. They could have added more guac but still good overall. The seasoned potatoes where crisp, hot, and nicely seasoned. The fresh fruit were as advertised: fresh. Hubby also enjoyed his medium steak and over-medium eggs. I tried a bit of the steak. It was an okay cut of steak and flavorful. I don't really think the meal and mimosa was worth $29/person. I think I can get a equal or better meal, with a better beverage option, for the same amount. Realistically, 2 people can comfortable finish a carafe of mimosa. More than that and you're looking for trouble. So while enjoyable, I don't think I will be returning.",6,3,4

91,Rita G.,"New York, NY",20,24,6,1.0,6/23/2014,"If I could give this place 0, I would. This is the worst possible place to have a party.  I threw a bachelorette party here- the set-up process was easy, bouncers were great, and the waitress was extremely polite and nice.  But, there were other serious issues. First, the music was subpar. My party wanted to leave after countless overplayed singles mixed with a few standard dance hits (pitbull, generally).  Second, the manager was the most unaccomodating and rude person I have dealt with at a club in NYC. The bachelorette (who was visiting from out of town) lost her purse and his response was to be very rude about our party's makeup and demeanor- not to mention that we had been told we'd have ""security"" at the table.  Do not get bottle service here, it's not worth it.",2,,
92,Anjali M.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",249,2,0,1.0,4/19/2016,"Drinks were pretty weak. The music was way too loud, and made talking pretty difficult.

Not the best place to break out into dance nor talk because you can't hear anyone. I saw you go to a bar to talk or dance, you can do neither here. I guess you can go and let all the weird guys stare at you and once in a while approach you.

94,Devon W.,"Sunnyside, NY",94,75,12,4.0,7/8/2014,"I gotta hand it to Libation. My friends and I threw a brunch bachelorette party here, and everyone had a great time.We had a 1:00 PM reservation. The waitress allowed early arrivals for the party take a seat at the table, and she also took our drink orders. I tried both the mimosa and Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary had a great kick to it, and the mimosa just needed some mixing (the champagne was lying on top of the orange juice).Everyone's food came out hot. I ordered the breakfast burrito; my only wish is that there was more! Fresh eggs and none of the flavors overpowered the others, but small amount of food on the plate. However, the waitress did bring out sparklers and a bottle of Fireball for our party, which had about two rounds of shots leftover in it. Very sweet!We stayed until 4:00 PM and made most of the $29 bottomless drinks. Not many people were dancing (and Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande definitely seemed to be the DJ's favorites), and the environment was laid back. I'm glad we gave Libation a try!",1,1,1

Let's just say we were on one. The DJ did a great job of playing dance and house music followed my by favorite hip hop/rap.  We sat at the bar because we didn't have reservations, which was totally fine because the bartender made sure our glasses were always filled. But did I mention the $29 for unlimited mimosas and an entree?  Girl yes! I was like wait a minute what? $29 for drinks and good sign me up ASAP.

The lights! ahh the lights!!! A thousand points of delicious light sparkling like diamonds in my brain!  Get a load of this air bro!Don't make the mistake of exiting the place before you are ready to leave without a stamp, one time i forgot to get a stamp and i stood outside crying for 3.5 hours while my friends kept dancing near the windows.  I knew how much fun they were having, so I just awkwardly stood in the corner watching them while the bouncers made fun of me telling me to go elsewhere.  I stood my ground with pizza grease dripping down my chin, diluted with the tears of Molly, because....

I wouldn't call getting constantly shoved and pushed around every 2 to 3 seconds a fun night, but if you could deal with the crowd, its actually not that bad of a place.Drinks were ok priced for NYC, but they were definitely very strong which is good. Bartenders were quick and attentive. That night it was 50 dollars for open bar for the majority of the night, which is a steal in the city. However, general admission is $15 which is kind of lame for a place that is more of a bar/lounge than a club.Music was average / so-so.

99,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",270,122,1,3.0,5/9/2014,"It is so strange for me to see that most reviews for Libation are for brunch, as I only come post-kickball for drunken debauchery. This is the throw-back-to-college-days type of bar - you know, the one that has tables set up for beer-pong/flip-cup with raging music and lots of dancing. But you know what? I come here just for that experience, so I have a fun night out each time (it helps to have lots of booze + a fun group of friends who are just as into dancing/flip-cupping as you are for the night). Would I come here if the post-kickball socials weren't hosted here? Probably not, but while the season lasts I'll be here.I will say that the bathrooms get pretty gross on Thursday nights. Half the stalls in the top floor bathroom don't have a lock, which becomes a problem when (a) the bathrooms are co-ed and (b) everyone's drunk out of their minds.

After what seemed like drinking an entire pitcher (and maybe then some) to myself, I still felt like I barely had any alcohol. Switched over to bloody marys and that did the trick. Down side, they serve brunch on the top floor club area and everyone was seated at plastic tables with fold out chairs. They crammed as many tables/chairs in the room as possible so we were literally sitting on top of people next to us and had to climb over people to go to the bathroom. They also only had 2 waiters for the entire brunch section, so service was a little slow. Plus side, we got sparklers and champagne because it was my birthday. Only costs $29/person, which is a great deal for bottomless. They also didn't rush us out - we were there for about 3 hours.

I walked in and was greeted by a blonde guy and women I'm assuming owners or managers but soon as they spoke to me all tension went away they was soooooo NICE!!!! welcomed us with open arms even with my friend having dreads and a hoodie on!!! I was surprised and happy we came in! this place isn't douchey at all!!! and they have late happy hour whoop whoop!!!! The star of the show was the DJ he was jamming! OMG I love that DJ back to back just flowing with all the right music every time I went to sit in my seat I had to stand back up to shake that azz again smh! He plays every Saturday and if this place knows better they better keep him up in there! We came late so we missed the brunch crowd it was a couple of bdays still going on but I think brunch gets packed here and I wanna see what Libation brunch life is looking like.I ordered a blueberry something and my friend ordered a beer she's such a a boygirl! My drink was good costing about 9 bucks on HH.... After I finished I wanted another drink but didn't want to spend 9 bucks on it so I ordered the dreaded well drink on HH.... I hate ordering well drinks on HH it makes me sad :( stupid bland unexciting well drinks! at least get some well flavored liquor make well fun too!!!! I had a bay breeze it was mainly pineapple juice but I didn't complain cause I was sooo lost in the music.... we also ordered 2 chicken tacos, these tacos was bomb! full with flavor I was like daaammmnnn this taco is good! the salsa tasted fresh and the taco wasn't some little shrimp azz skinny taco.... this taco was big and full!!!! I'm getting that taco again in this lifetime!Overall I had a blast even thinking about doing a bday brunch here in July but yes sadly theres a but..... this but stopped me from giving them 4 stars..... There was two bartenders we ordered drinks with one and while the other went somewhere else we ordered our food with another. We sat at the bar so there should have been no issue... I felt like something shady was trying to transpire because I gave my card for a tab and when it was all said and done I asked for the bill, our original bartender instead of bringing me my bill says oh it's 48 bucks want me to put it on the card? I tell her no I want the bill... she rushingly tries to explain the bill saying oh it's 2 checks because you ordered the food with the other girl so she shows me the bill and say this is for your food and this is for your drinks.... after looking at the bill 1 bill had just drinks on it and the other bill had the same drinks and food on it as well... I pointed out that our bill was only suppose to be 28 bucks not 48 she then takes the bill and make it one bill saying oh I didn't know how much food you had but I'm just thinking didn't you ask us how many tacos we ordered? we told you two and how didn't you see that both bill had drinks on it when the bill clearly states DRINKS..... This got me a lil annoyed because I didn't know if I was trying to be ripped off... I would say when dining anywhere make sure you see the print out of your bill before paying because you never know! If I was slow or really inebriated I would have been like mmhmm okay swipe it and would of been ripped off....",1,,1

I was so drunk by the time party started, i forgot my doggy bag : (..The dance floor was fun though.Overall, I would come back here again...most likely for bruch from the reviews",,,
118,Austin G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,13,2,3.0,1/19/2014,"Libation offers a stellar brunch option for those who enjoy a mimosa...or ten. The all you can drink mimosas or Bloody Marys is great, but after a while can get a bit too citrus, or pepper. That being said, they really took care of our party of 20--handing us some free vodka and fireball.The food was pretty good. The ""Huevos Antonio"" had a strange tortilla substitute (or just poorly cooked tortilla), but was good otherwise, featuring perfectly runny eggs and fresh avocado. Way too many black beans as a side, overwhelming.",1,,1
119,Destiny M.,"New Rochelle, NY",8,44,104,2.0,11/5/2014,"Was here on Nov 1st. I made a reservation for Saturday boozy brunch for my husband surprise b day party. I made reservation for 18-20 people. When they called to confirm that afternoon I told them keep it for 20 to be safe. When we got there 1/2 our party was there. They stuck us at a small table by the door. The whole party wasn't there yet and I explained to them even though we were only 16 so far there was no where near enough room since 4 ppl were still standing. They said there was nothing they could do since it was all booked! We took turns sitting and tried to make the best of it. Took forever after asking to get the order in so we could start drinking. At least that would compensate for the lack of accommodation and customer service. After several people  from our party complaining and asking for manager to make things right they asked a party of 4 next to us to move after they ate. So an hour or so later our entire party was able to sit and eat. We did have to keep reminding the waitress to keep the mimosas flowing. (Understaffed)That after paying in advance and adding 20% gratuity and an additional tip on top of that and my husband told me he tipped as well! We should have had a fresh pitcher at every table when they were finished for the inconvenience. PLUS SIDE. EVERYONE said how good their food was for being a boozy brunch. If they didn't try to cram as many people as that could into the place the service and experience might be better. I never even got to see upstairs. They advertised that party keeps going after 4 pm, but the dj stopped playing and the place cleared out completely by 5pm. I thought the price was good. We got a bottle of wodka vodka for $150! Tasted much better then belvedere or grey goose. The staff was nic friendly, but I needed service..that's what I made the reservation for. I would recommend NOT going with a large party. Even though you specify the large group in advance. On the website they say how they can accommodate...but they fell short. Overall good value for small party boozy brunch. Make a reservation! Do yourself a favor and park in the lot across the street instead of hourly meter. It ended up being cheaper!",,,
120,Grace M.,"New York, NY",16,47,47,3.0,3/15/2014,"Came here for brunch for a friend's brithday! After reading reviews on Yelp, I was a little nervous to check this place out. However, we were looking for a cheaper brunch that still had good food. For $29 we had unlimited mimosas or bloody marys and an entree each. For my entree I got the crab cakes with poached eggs. Food wise, it was alright. Nothing too fancy or mouth watering, but it was good. Drinks wise, we ordered mimosas, and they definitely kept them coming! I forget our waitresses name but she was awesome! She would bring out another carafe before ours was even finished. She was super friendly too! They also brought us fireball shots on the house! The music was really random and didn't flow too well together, but it was all songs that we liked! No one was really dancing or anything like that. I wouldn't mind going back :)",1,,
121,Rach K.,"New York, NY",240,1037,852,3.0,5/21/2012,"Not bad...My friend decided to come here for her birthday and get a table, as we were staying at the Hotel on Rivington, just around the corner. The bar/dancing area is slightly awkward, as it's just a long strip that makes it difficult to maneuver through the crowd but I guess having a long bar makes it easier to get a drink. The table service was really good; our water was consistently refilled, we got what we asked for right away, and empty cups were cleared on a regular basis and replaced with new clean cups. I made friends with the bartender who was serving our table as well as the bouncer guy who was guarding the area hear us. In general, all of the employees were all really nice and friendly and helpful.The DJ was kind of weird and didn't really suit my taste. He'd play two mismatched songs back to back so you'd be dancing to a fast song and all of a sudden get slapped in the face with some slower song. It made for some awkward dancing. The crowd was mostly girls who think they're hot and dance well but do NOT and boys who just stand on the side and watch. But I was with my own group in our own little area so I didn't mind. It did make for some fun people watching though.The bathrooms are downstairs and each time I went, there was either a line of 10 girls or it would be empty; it was really just luck. They were reasonably well maintained but there was a useless bathroom attendant sitting in there blocking one of the two sinks. She was nice but I'd rather have access to that second sink and get my own paper towels.Overall, it was a fun night, but based on the DJ and the crowd, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.",,,1

Solid bar food, watered down drinks and top 40 music.Full Review: Libation is decent if you're not expecting much. Their menu has standard wings, burgers, beer etc. I didn't like the doorman for this place at all, seriously just an average, run of the mill establishment but for some reason they are strict at the door. Also, the music and DJ was weak the night I went. I definitely won't be back and I'd suggest you look for a better option as well.",1,,1
123,Stephen W.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,63,8,1.0,4/28/2014,"Had a birthday to go to on a Saturday night. $15 for guys, $10 for girls...fine (the bouncer actually collects the money, think about how often does that happen). We go in, there's no hostess, no one to stamp you.We went out for a cigarette, asked if it's ok that we didn't get a stamp, the bouncer said yes. We come back from the cigarette (mind you we are a few feet away), miraculously the bouncer doesn't recognize us anymore...that was a quick night.Long story short, this place is terrible, drinks are terrible, the people are terrible, it's dark and dingy.

I've been here a couple times in the past and have always had a fun time. They have a DJ downstairs and dancing and flip cup upstairs with plenty of bar room.Last night the staff was fantastic! Our server was Lauren and she was very attentive and friendly. We were also so impressed with how accommodating the staff was. There were several flip cup games taking place upstairs and since there was no more room for my friends and I to play, they set up tables downstairs for us. It was one of the most fun times I have had at a bar in NYC. The bouncer was also very friendly, remembering me every time I came in and out. Quick tip: we ordered the chicken tender appetizer and the chicken wings. The spicy sauce was great. I would recommend ordering the wings over tenders- I added photos of both and the wings have a much better portion size, both are priced at $9.This is the designated bar for our kickball post game celebrations, so I will gladly be back!",,,

133,Courtney D.,"West Sayville, NY",0,8,0,4.0,10/11/2016,"I just had my birthday here and it was made absolutely amazing by the wonderful planner and servers. I had a 19 person family-style brunch. The person I planned my event with made it very easy and stress free and the servers were on top of everything. Everytime we needed a refill on anything, they were on top of it and more food came out within minutes. The main server was constantly checking that everyone who upgraded to the open bar had a full glass. And the food was out.standing. Usually when you go for a bottomless brunch, you sacrifice the quality of the food which is to be expected, but there was no quality lacking here - the food was incredible. We could not get enough of the garlic herb fries and French toast. Everything was incredibly delicious. At the end of my brunch, the main waitress gave my entire party a round of shots on the house which was amazing! Libation really outdid themselves.The only reason I gave the review 4 stars instead of 5 was because I was under the impression that there would be bumping music that we could dance to which sadly, there wasn't. The dj didn't really play party music and when me and my friend asked for a couple of different genres to play so we could dance, he didn't really listen. This could be because it was a 12-2 block, but I was definitely expecting more of a club vibe.Everything else was amazing though and I am so glad I chose this place to have my brunch. I'll definitely be back!",,,

135,Kadie Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,6,0,3.0,11/1/2014,"By far the worst service I have ever had in nyc. Not sure why it takes over 15 minutes to make a screw driver, (and counting... I still haven't gotten it) or why the bar back (the bartender was gone for extensive periods) snapped ""we'll get you your drink!"" when I went to the bar when the drink didn't arrive after 15 minutes...If you're going to order, order from the female bartender. She has her shit together. The waiters do not and they apparently will snap at you if you ask where your order is after 20 minutesEdit: I do commend the manager William and the awesome bartender for trying to make our experience better.

But, I think the service sucks. We were here for a birthday brunch with about 14 people in our party. I get it, it's a large party but the food took entirely too long to get to the table. Pretty sure it was close to an hour which to me, is beyond unacceptable. To make matters worse, when we tried to check up on the order, all we got was ""the kitchen is backed up"" and they never once quantified how long the order would take. Maybe I am being a bit harsh, but the waitresses there are just rude and incompetent. When the food finally came, it did beat my expectations. I mean, it better have.... it took so long to get there! I had the three egg omelette with bacon, cheese and broccoli and it hit every spot (yes, yes I even ate the potatoes!). Other folks in the party had the burger, the crab cake benedict which smelled delicious, and french toast.

147,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0,1.0,4/28/2014,"Ah Libation. The Jon Snow bastard child of the Stark family of clubs which includes Lilium, The DL, and Bounce. Despite being a bastard, it lives up to its half family members in all the important qualities which include terrible clientele, even worse service, ear splitting music stolen from top 40 radio and a lack of appreciation for conversation. Some of these reviews are hilarious. Read these reviews and tell me if anything you read there you particularly enjoy such as sitting on plastic chairs and eating at plastic tables. Somebody mentioned that the mimosas were watered down, the bathrooms were filthy, and that (at times???) the music was too loud to have a conversation during brunch. Aren't mimosas meant to water down the champagne? Now we are watering down the watered down drink to begin with? Amazing. Now maybe I am mistaken but usually when I go to brunch and I get shitty drinks, cant use the bathroom due to hygiene, and can't TALK to the person next to me it will get 1 star and 1 star only because those are 3 things that happen at brunch quite regularly. However if you are interested in exploring a career as an extra in a Steve Aoki music video you will love this place. If you regularly ask people Turn Down For What? then you will love this place. If the color scheme of your sunglasses/shoes/shirts can induce epilepsy in those susceptible to it....you will love this place. If you enjoy paying double the price for a drink, with half the alcohol content, and double the wait at the bar for it....you will love this place. If you enjoy the company of drunk, uncouth bridge and tunnel crowd that show up and throw up and leave your neighborhood....you will LOVE this place. If you like brunch, or any meal that involves food remember you are in the LES and close to East Village. These neighborhoods are chock full of restaurants with actual quality food (with a much higher yelp rating) with a much cheaper price tag, where you can talk to your friends that you are eating with. However if your idea of an awesome dinner is being served a plate of french fries while holding sticks and dancing on the couch to the latest greatest Swedish House Mafia song, while your friends bump lines in the bathroom at 2 pm in the afternoon this could possibly be your Mecca. For the rest of us, we should create a petition that limits places like this to Murray Hill or Midtown so that the garbage and filth that this place attracts can stay there, near Penn Station or Grand Central that will shuttle their useless carcasses back to whence they came. Why are there bouncers present for a brunch meal?

Until last night.When in need of a cheap drink along with a cheap meal, my group of friends and I hit normally Pianos for the $3 well drinks, $5 burgers, wings, nachos etc. By 7PM, when happy hour ends, we are shit faced. Oh yes back to Libation... Last night I left work late so I didn't get to pick our destination. I suggested Verlaine but my friend insisted we meet at Libation. Really?! Okay fine. Guess I can give it another shot.It wasn't as terrible as I remembered it to be.  The drink specials were actually comparable to Pianos and their happy hour deal lasts until 9PM. There was 2 for 1 burger special which we took advantage of. Sadly, all of our burgers were overcooked. The last person that joined our party normally likes her meat more on the cooked side. Just to test it out, I asked her to order medium rare for fear of another dry patty. She received her burger and yea it was definitely not med rare. It was more medium well.  So yes, definitely just stick with the drinks. The food is MEH.  But it seems like recent reviews raved about brunch. Hmmmmmmm...The service was awesome.  Hector was friendly and eager to please.  He even announced they've extended happy hour til 10 and that tomorrow (Thursday) night is ladies night - cosmo and champagne specials. Hector also allowed us to bring in crepe from next door. Again, stick with the happy hour drinks that lasts until 9PM.",2,3,3
153,Arthur L.,"Chinatown, Manhattan, NY",165,121,63,2.0,7/30/2012,"Overall I like the variety of music (a mix of hip-hop, top 40s, and edm) and the type of people that go (mixed crowd, less emphasis on Asian ppl). Drink prices are kinda average. But I take away stars because of the waitress and how they handled bottle service this past Friday night. A buddy and me decided to celebrate our birthdays so we bought a bottle (For 5 ppl). 4 of us were there already and my friend was arriving late so we went in first. Even though his name is on the bottle had had to pay a cover because ""10 people"" already came in under the party...hmm no I don't think so. 4 people (including me) came in on the bottle and the others came in on their own. So....wth??Now the waitress (I wish I remembered her name) but when it came time to for the bill she was just overall b*tchy. She was holding my credit card already but I told her my friends wanted to pay with cash. She gave me the bill and I went to the bar where my friends were (we had finished the bottle already). She then comes over and b*tches about how shes not gunna chase me around if we're gunna hang around at the bar and etc etc. (mind you the 2nd floor is like the size of a linen closet).First off...you have my credit card so chill the f*** out! Its not like we're skipping out on the bill. Second, her bouncer buddy, was mad douche (which is a common bouncer characteristic) mean mugging ppl when like I said before we're obviously going to pay. (btw the bouncer, Dominic was pretty chill) The thing about my friend having to pay cover cuz of guest list issue wasn't THAT unexpected. But the waitress + bouncer really bothered me cuz its not like they're losing money or something by letting ppl in or whatever. They were just being rude. I used to be a waiter and you don't rush people to pay. Thats how you get minus points.this experience makes me think twice about getting bottle service from here.",2,,
154,Valentina H.,"Brooklyn, NY",196,181,82,2.0,2/11/2012,"I was wondering why my arms were so sore when I woke up this morning. Raising the roof at Libation is not for the faint of heart. I'll start with the good- No cover for girls! Great dirty martini for a lounge, but my expectations weren't high. Its an Red Bull/Vodka type of clientele. Cool venue. Not too crowded for Friday night on the LES. Ok, no more Ms. Nice Girl.The DJ is absolutely horrendous. Horrendous doesn't even describe it, but its the most suitable word I can think of. First of all, he was quite demanding. Yelling into the mic to ""put your hands up in the air"" every 2 minutes, for ridiculous things. I felt like I was in an aerobics class. Have you ever tried to enjoy a martini with your hands in the air? Its a challenge, trust me. Aside from being verbally assaulted all night, his DJ skills sucked. He played a few seconds of each song, without a smooth transition between tracks. He would go from ""all the other kids with the pumped up kicks"" to ""ya'll gonna make me loose my mind up in here, up in here"". WTF, man? How can I bust a move to that?  And you want me to keep my hands up? I can't, and I won't ever again.",4,8,4

When I was booking my husbands birthday brunch, I obviously chose Libation. Living in CT, it is often hard to find nice and friendly customer service in NYC (I guess we're too ""B&T""). Nancy, who I was in contact with during the reservation process, was super nice and very responsive. I did not know how many people were coming until the last minute and she was super flexible. When we arrived with the CT crew, we were the first ones there but they brought us right up to our space. Jillian, our bartender and waitress, was SO friendly. Everyone was late and I was freaking out and she was telling me its all good, no worries! My husband and I love it here as we are treated like family instead of commuters like other brunch spots around Manhattan. We will definitely be coming back and again, and huge thanks to Nancy and Jillian!",,,
159,Jennifer S.,"ASTORIA, NY",37,60,16,4.0,5/7/2012,"Ok I had to right a review to defend this establishment as I had my birthday here this year and had a GREAT time.  I should admit I only remember half of the night, but the pictures tell a good story!  It was a Saturday night, I refused to get bottle service to reserve a table, so my friends and I just showed up around 10pm.  I got there right before 10pm so I didn't have to pay a cover (i think it might be like $10 after that).  Suprisingly there was a large table on the first floor open that we were able to occupy for the rest of the night.  There was good music and 3 floors of dancing!  On the first floor we had plenty of room to bust a move and get low.  I will admit the 2nd and 3rd floor levels were packed and a little sweaty. I was taking shots and ordering vodka cranberries (which were strong) - so I don't know if this place has quality drinks.  I went here once before and a friend ordered a blueberry lemonade drink that was overpriced.  So I don't recommend coming here for fancy cocktails. If you are looking for dancing and good music, a diverse crowd, and a decent atmosphere I recommend this bar.  Everytime I've been here I've had a good time.",2,,
160,Mike Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,190,62,4.0,5/2/2012,"I mean haters gonna hate, right?This place is a swanked up, clubby, dress up lounge/bar. Dress code is club sexy: meaning tight skirts, button down shirts and overall try-hard-get-pretty deal.There is a certain crowd that frequents this kind of place. Not that there's anything wrong with that 'kind of crowd' it's just for me that phase came and went years ago. Like 10 years ago. Have to dress up to go to work; dont want to dress to impress to go to a bar.We ended up at Libation as we were stumbling around the LES looking for a bar to get drunk at. They had a sign out that listed great happy hour specials - i think it was $3/drafts and well-mix drinks. That's pretty damn good considering drafts are Blue Moons, Yeunglings, Stellas and such - across the street at Iggy's Keltic (definitely a dive) you were paying $3/PBR. So we went in - staff was nice - pretty hostesses, big bartenders, typical fare. It was around 8 or 9, on a Thursday/Friday, I forget which. But it was between the dinner crowd and the fist pumping one. We didn't have to pay a cover which was good as later on I understand they instate one. As we were looking for a place to sit - they told us that they would be removing the tables but they would keep the ones by the window so we could hang there. Cool - no problem.Notable is that the bartenders were really responsive and courteous. No standing around, no waiting, no 'airs'. just good customer service.The DJ is a top 40 DJ with decent mixing, smooth transitions and is effective at what he does. Track selection was good.The bartender did line the bar and set some shots on fire as I recall he also did some juggling. The shots that he lit, he gave out for free which was nice. The bathroom is downstairs and moderately clean. They have a guy handing out paper towels/gum/candy/cologne.Overall it was a decent place. I mean if you're into that scene where you want a meatpacking district experience but want to be around the LES, this is it. Not that I would go back for anything other than happy hour but I really can't knock it. Do you Libation!",2,,

It was pretty good. The mimosas were flowing and service was awesome. I guess I took off a star because of the dark lighting and despite having been there for 2+ hours - I was still sober.

Is he gonna light that girl's hair on fire?""  But...he's good at what he does and makes everyone's jaw drop.2nd Floor: We were on this one for the most part due to a fundraiser for my friend's friend.  It has a balcony that overlooks the 1st floor (which is where I watched the daredevil bartender ""ooo"" and ""ahh"" the crowd).3rd Floor:  Big dance party with a good size bar.  Got my freak on for awhile and did the Bernie when appropriate (when is it NOT appropriate??) Prices aren't too bad for a NYC club, so guys, expect to pay some cash.  If you're a girl...work on that smile, wear something revealing, and you'll be set for the evening.Will I go back?  Sure.  Here's a bigger plus: next to Libation is a place that sells amazing crepes.  These things are life changing.  I was in a search for pizza...but this was right next door.  Forget pizza.  Get a crepe.",4,4,4
163,Andrew B.,"Manhattan, NY",83,1,0,1.0,11/20/2016,"In the past we have had good experience with this place but after our last visit I'm wondering if they are under new management. We made a reservation for 230 and received a confirmation email for that time. Libation called us the day of to confirm our 12:30 reservation and were very rude when we told them it was 230 until we informed them we had it in writing via email. We had the family style brunch for a large group. They brought out breakfast sandwiches, but not enough for everyone, said they would  bring more out but never did. Family style portions of the other items were not enough to share for the entire group we had. Several drink requests were never filled. Several of us also asked if one of the televisions playing a documentary nobody was watching could be changed to a game we were interested in. We asked several staff several times if they could put the game on. Each time they said yes but it never happened. I wouldn't have had a problem if they just said no. Expected much better service when you bring a group spending well over a grand but we were just ignored. We were polite and did nothing that deserved the poor service.",1,,

165,Peggy N.,"Newark, NJ",210,12,33,4.0,2/22/2016,"We pretty much chose Libation for NYE because of the price and that it was a five hour open bar. The open bar started at 9 but we got there at about 8:20 in case there was a line, which there was not. You had to go up one flight of stairs to get to the bigger bar on the first floor then up more stairs to get to the second smaller bar. We stayed at the top bar which made going to the bathroom a bit of a chore since it was all the way at the bottom. Since we go there early we got to try all of the appetizers, but if you had gotten there at 9:30-10 you would have not gotten anything. Drinks were very strong which is better than the latter. Bartender was very nice and fast. Just before midnight they passed out champagne. Music definitely could have been better. Wasn't great music to dance to.",,,

Ok, the place itself is not bad but what the fuck is wrong with the bouncer and restroom attendants's pretentious fucking attitude? I'm no racist (come on, I'm Korean+American+Hispanic, that's three continents already) but I like to be straightforward and be honest.BOUNCER PROBLEM: (White guy, he worked night of 3/23/12 around 9-11pm-ish)I head out to have a cigarette and try to re-enter, and he wants to see my ID and I told him I have my wallet inside my bag, which happens to be with my friend inside. It's retarded how you see someone coming out from the bar and try to re-enter after a cigarette and they want to see my ID. Let me tell you one thing you sick bastard: NOT ALL ASIANS LOOK THE SAME and are you RETARDED enough to not remember someone coming through the door from the establishment?? Please quietly FUCK OFF. Then, I head out again for another cig with some friends and I try to re-enter to use the restroom and tell the other friends inside to lets head to another place, the bouncer is like 'WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?"" I told him ""I AM GOING TO USE THE RESTROOM!"" He shut up. RESTROOM ATTENDANT PROBLEM:I enter the bathroom and another problem. After using the restroom and try to wash my hands, I see this Black guy (restroom attendant I suppose?) unloading grooming products from a bag something (Acqua di Gio cologne, Jean Paul, etc) and when I used some of it, he's like HEY YOU GOTTA PAY FOR IT!! I said ""YEAH?? I DON'T HAVE CASH WITH ME RIGHT NOW, I""LL BRING IT TO YOU!"" He kept yelling and bitching about the fact that I have to pay for using/spraying some of the cologne. I refused and completely ignored him since I've been to zillions of bars/clubs where restroom attendants sprayed you cologne and I wasn't forced to give a tip. But in this case, why would I fucking leave a tip for using my own hands to spray some cologne and why do I need to cope with his nasty attitude?? To make it worse, the colognes were probably all FAKE cuz I know how Acqua Di Gio and Jean Paul G colognes look like and the font and design were a bit off and this comes from someone who worked near 29-31st street on Broadway where Wholesale Fake/Real Colognes are being sold.SKIP THIS PLACE",1,2,1

I'm pretty sure when the lights are down at night, and you've had a few drinks, you don't notice all the rips in the couch, the blemishes on the walls, and the way the floor looks worn. Having to use the typical nightclub bathroom (complete with tissue randomly strewn about, and unknown wetness on the floor) when it's still daylight outside is not charming by any definition.

I can't comment on whether or not you'd receive the same quality of service when they're really busy.Overall:The look is what really messed up the experience for me. I'd have no problem hanging out there, and having drinks there, but it just didn't look well kept and clean enough for me to be able to justify going back there to eat.",3,1,

Management was very accommodating and the service was great. Music was fun, great space for dancing. Definitely one of the better spots on the lower east side - one of the few clubs without pretentious people. Plenty of room to dance, good music too.  Can't wait to celebrate here again!",1,,1
189,Lisa H.,"Bayonne, NJ",35,86,15,4.0,7/30/2014,"I came with a good friend of mine on a Sunday for boozy brunch and it was all that! I had unlimited Bloody Mary's and she did the Mimosas. It was awesome! I am very picky about my Bloody Mary's, so to say that is good is a huge complement coming from me.  I ordered the steak and eggs (which was fantastic) and it was made perfectly. The service was excellent. I am not sure why the review is so low, maybe I went on a great day, but I will be back.",,,
190,Jasti S.,"Bethesda, MD",89,113,5,5.0,10/31/2011,"Came on a Friday night (Oct. 28) and had a great time with my friends.We showed up kinda early for NYC standards (midnight or so?) and there wasn't a line. Girls get in free, guys pay $15. Still not bad. My one friend took this on the chin. In DC, EVERYONE would pay $30 admission for a holiday weekend (if not more) so this was fair to me.When we got inside and walked up the flight of stairs, the club felt small and narrow. But I loved that we were able to sit at a table without buying out the bar. The music was great--they played everything from the Ting Tings to David Guetta to Biggie and Junior M.A.F.I.A. Now that's what I'm talking about! And the DJ actually showed his/her skills with professional mixing, not just aimlessly going from one crappy top-40 song to the next.And my drinks?!!? Yum, yum, YUM! Drinks were only $9 and were delicious and strong. Trust me, you have to try Three olives cherry vodka, cranberry and Sprite mix. Sooo good! Will is one of the best bartenders I ever had. I love his personality and drink-making skills.I will definitely be a return customer. Hope I get Will next time so he can make my drinks again :)",1,,1
191,Rachel B.,"Detroit, MI",240,636,63,4.0,5/18/2011,"I am giving this four stars instead of three simply because I had my first ""We're on the list"" experience at this place. I couldn't believe it! We saw the line and the guy actually unclipped the velvet rope and let us in. I thought that only happened in the movies and on Entourage.So once we got in (and mind you, I was there for a friend's bachelorette party, so we were all acting a little nuts) my friends started talking up one of the bouncers, who advised us on which floor to start on. We heard Jackson 5 from one level, Biggie from another, and some dance freestyle from another. All good, in my opinion. We did start at the top. There was a bathroom and plenty of room to dance and get drinks without sitting on top of someone else at the bar.There was nothing really going on on the dance floor, but we chose to make it happen. (Who am I? No, really, WHO?!) It felt great to be 31 and at a club. And then it felt gross the next morning. But whatever.Also, I'm looking at the other reviews and I see that my yelp buds Amy T., Jillian N., and Peter D. have all graced Libation with their presence. Cool. We were all dancing underneath the same electric blue light and deafening music at one point!I'd recommend this place for a night of fun when you don't care about being really cheesy. Music was great. And only a $10 cover.",2,2,2
192,Gamal H.,"Manhattan, NY",453,312,0,2.0,3/5/2012,"We ducked into Libation at random in the middle of the day to have a drink before going to a baby shower (Note: A pre-baby shower drink makes the actual baby shower much more tolerable). I liked the space because it was all dark wood and high ceilings. I liked the service because it was relaxed and friendly. But I wouldn't go back there unless I was trying to escape a monsoon or some other natural disaster.Libation isn't really sure what it wants to be. It has cozy intimate seating for dinner like a romantic restaurant, but it also has a dozen big screen TV's like a sports bar. It has a specialty cocktail list, but the cocktails we had were truly horrible (avoid the mojito at all costs). It was set up like a lounge, but it had a menu about as big as a diner. I'm not suggesting that the space needs to be pigeon holed or that it can't try to serve different groups, but if venues that try to do everything well usually wind up doing nothing well (see the gastropub). And to top it off, a bunch of drunken Jersey Shore stunt doubles stumbled in as we were walking out. I was happy to be heading to a baby shower.The staff and space are nice enough to try, but once you try you probably won't go back.Have fun.G",,2,
193,Liz S.,"Farmingdale, NY",3,22,0,5.0,10/6/2014,"I had my birthday brunch here and couldn't be more satisfied. Our waitress, Maureen (MO) was SO AWESOME. She took extremely good care of us and never had to ask for refills or anything. Awesome beats, awesome food. Overall a great time!!",,,
194,Kendra C.,"Queens, NY",168,376,286,3.0,6/19/2009,"So it was an evening in the LES. Bars aplenty, most of which were crowded. Honestly? We just wanted some place to sit and sip a drink. We walked into Libation primarily because it was empty (which already speaks volumes) and everywhere else was packed. The crowd was reminiscent of the mentioned ""weekend crowd"" - I'm fairly certain I saw a guy who dropped out of my high school in Brooklyn doing shots. Because of my ability to draw the weirdest tangents, when I reflect on Libation, I think about when Mark Wahlberg (and to add insult to injury, the Funky Bunch) sang ""Good Vibrations."" It's something that makes your skin slightly crawl, and you actively want that memory to just go away.Space-wise, it was nice, and so was our really cool bartender. Our bill came out to $6; so these were the only redeeming qualities.",1,2,1
195,James F.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,295,280,1.0,2/1/2009,"Going through my reviews, I notice I rarely review bars. strange i spend a lot of time in bars why so few reviews?  probably because with the right group of people i can have a good time almost anywhere. AlmostAnywhere.the staff and/ or clientele have to be exceptionally douche-y for me not to enjoy myself...welcome to Libation.",4,4,3
196,Aditi S.,"Manhattan, NY",12,60,1,2.0,1/20/2011,"I give libation two stars for the decor, its pretty. Unfortunately my experience at libation was far from pretty. My friend arranged for her 21st birthday party here - she was pretty excited. We had reserved a table upstairs with some bottle service for her. A few members of our party arrived early, around 930-10 pm and they all got in fine. I was enjoying myself. The problem began at around 1045 pm and onwards when the rest of the party began to arrive - the guy at the door simply wouldn't let them in. I don't understand why, we had already bought a bunch of bottles. First he made them wait on line, then when they would ask how much longer - he would either totally ignore them or try to convince them to buy bottles or flat out refuse them entry. It doesn't make sense to me, everyone was dressed well, and each group had more girls then guys - I never wanna play the race card, but... It was pretty upsetting to my friends whose birthday it was. I don't think I've ever experienced a more rude doorman. There was barely anyone inside, no reason to have a line outside just so your club looks popular. I am definitely not going back here again. I'll just take my business else where.",6,,1
197,Howard R.,"Manhattan, NY",459,78,9,2.0,6/25/2013,Went to Libation tonight  after kickball for the first time in ages. We had some surprisingly solid food that included Nachos and Artichoke dip but otherwise this place is just average. There's many other places on Ludlow that I would choose over this especially since they have the nasty habit of charging a cover on Fr/Sa nights which I think is absurd and caused me to minus a star. On weekend nights they seem to also fit in with the DYWIA crowd since they pull out a phony list to a place that's poppin so much that even Shaq could have elbow room!,2,,
198,Tom F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/6/2014,"Was at libation this past Saturday to watch college football w/ some friends.We made reservation for 10, although a few members of our party were late, the wait staff/management were great and let us sit down w/out them.They had us set up w/ perfect size table and never had any issues getting drinks. Waitress and bar tender were both very attentive to our needs. Food was surprisingly delicious!! Amazing DJ for a Saturday afternoon As we were one of the smaller parties of the group i was surprised that the manager, believe his name was Vincent, came to personally great us and to come to him w/ any issues. Overall, would say this is one of the better brunch spots in NY for Saturday football. FOOD: 4 starsMUSIC: 5 Stars Service: 5 stars",,,
199,Joel D.,"NY, NY",22,126,6,4.0,1/25/2012,"Been here NUMEROUS times for years and always a good time here. The staff is friendly, there's 3 or 4 floors, good music, good VARIETY of music, and Happy Hour is cool. Lots of TV's and seating. Libation is *Joel-Approved*",,,1
