The library is a relatively calm oasis amongst a sea of overcrowded clubs and bars with lines halfway down the block. We didn't have to wait to get in and we easily found a seat. The Library definitely has a more low-key atmosphere than most other bars in the neighborhood--its walls are covered in shelves of old books and they were even playing a movie on Saturday night. It has a great vibe if you're more in the mood to talk with friends than to dance in a crowded club. The bouncer was also super friendly which was a plus!",1,,1
1,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,3.0,8/14/2018,"This is exactly what a dive bar should be.I'm not typically a dive bar person at all, but if you are looking for a place with cheap drinks in the area late at night, this is where to go. If you are lucky you can get a table and sit away from the crowd. Just don't go to the bathroom.Service is fast, and might or might not be friendly depending on who you get. But that's just the price you pay at a dive bar. It's definitely a great place to hang out if you are in to that sort of atmosphere and want strong drinks without any kind of fancy affairs.They only really have the minimal basics as far as drinks go... but what did you expect?",,1,1

Great way to start off a date. The bar itself is huge and has some seating rooms in the back as well. Come after 9:30pm and there will definitely be a crowd. Bartenders are super sweet and takes the time to tell you what's good, and aways around when you need a refill.Sadly they don't make any old fashions but I settled with a gin and tonic. My date had a beer. Great selection of music! Fun crowd and a great bar for pregaming on drinks.",1,,
4,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1212,6241,4.0,5/1/2018,"This bar is a complete piece of sh*t, and that's why I love it. Give me a spot where the locals and the bartender bust chops, half the seats are ripped/broken, there's an unidentifiable smell and the drinks are cheap and I'm a happy man. Sure, I'll come in looking like an insurance salesman compared to the rest of the crowd, but this is the vibe I like for sure. Enough about me... Library is a solid spot to hang. Grab a drink, a seat, and no one will bother you here. For real, you're in park and you can stay as long as you like. It's not for everyone here and it's not a 'destination' spot, but if you're in the area or day drinking and bar hopping, come on in! Another lovely EV dive. Bonus: the jukebox is aggressive",20,14,17
5,Julie C.,"Queens, NY",37,94,173,1.0,3/29/2018,"Upon arriving there was an unsettling smell that lingered in the bar. Was tempted to leave but since I came with a group of friends, I decided to stay. We sat in the back where it was dim and we barely saw each other (because it was just that dark in there). The buy one get one is tempting but the bartender who was working was unwelcoming and inattentive. Who wants to wait 10 minutes before getting a drink? Not me. After paying for the drink (and tipping..) she proceeded to tell me that I didn't pay and that the drink I ordered was my free drink... um what?? When I brought it to her attention she gave me an attitude threw the dinosaur chip for the free drink at me. What a joke. Bad vibes & bad service = unhappy customer. Will not be returning.",5,1,1

The vhs projecting at the back, the sparsely populated library along the walls and the no-nonesense service made it feel just right. Granted, I'm an easy sucker for a dimly lit post-punk bar with a happy hour, but I get why this spot is a favorite. There's something inevitably special about a place like this that's been able to survive. Long live the library.",1,1,3

Happy Hour. You get a BOGO with cute figurines. The bartenders are not the best. They're not even really nice, they spend a lot of time ignoring you and talking to the regulars. But once you're nice to them the first couple of drinks, you get better service.Grab a booth in the back, watch the projected film, put some punk on the jukebox. Maybe see what books are on the shelves. It gets packed on Friday and Saturday. So avoid unless it's around 12-1am. Don't come here for cocktails.

20,B A.,"Camden, NJ",0,11,0,1.0,8/1/2018,"This place is disgusting--the best part about it is that the lighting is so awful that you can't see the eyesore that the interior is.It took the bartender 15 minutes to acknowledge us on an almost-empty weekday evening; we could see them having a presumably very important conversation on matters of global importance while we waited for them to take our order. Decided to ditch the place, so don't know what the quality of the drinks is, but the happy hour offers looked mediocre--there are much better places around the corner. Also, having a dozen dusty books lying around hardly warrants being named ""The Library"". One of you regular patrons please donate a vacuum cleaner.",,3,

24,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,7/13/2017,"The Library is not exactly my usual haunt. It's a definite dive, with the sticky tables to match. There's no cocktail list. Beers are more draught than craft. Well drinks are weirdly expensive for the ambiance-- I think the last time I got a margarita here it was $12. Bathroom are, er, authentic.But I've got fond feelings for this place. When I signed on my first apartment a few blocks over, my roommate and I came here for a celebratory drink at 4 pm. The rest of my visits have been post-games where I've had deep, immediately forgotten conversations. They're always playing something weird and cool on the wall; the last time, it was '70s softcore. Somehow I always manage to get a table even when it's packed. And the massive Tecate cans are the best deal around.Go with appropriate expectations, but it's a fun and lovable place.",2,1,

26,A. J.,"New York, NY",87,185,21,4.0,4/16/2018,"Fun little divey place in the East Village, very much keeping the 70s/80s punk/rock vibe alive, one of the best periods in NYC culture. Thankfully it's not 1978 when this city was in the $hitter in every other respect.  But the late 70s were a terrific time for the NYC music scene. So it's great to hear Blondie, The Ramones and such and no modern pop. You will have to get used to large crowds in all NYC places on the weekends after 1000pm or so.  That is why I love partying it up during the week! :D",,,

One of the bartenders is rude as hell. She was nasty and condescending to every female member of my party. Nice to the guys, though. Seems to be one of those women who has a PROBLEM with women. Yikes! It's 2017, lady. Guess she never got the memo that that kind of thing isn't cool anymore?Two stars instead of one because the other bartenders I've encountered here are nice and professional, and the layout of the bar makes it easy for me to see who's tending bar, so I can pop in the door and immediately leave if Phyllis Schlafly's on shift.",3,,

34,Nancy K.,"Bennington, VT",196,515,263,4.0,3/5/2017,"To be fair, I am staring my 40th birthday in the eye as it approaches far too quickly for my taste. So, if you're in your 30's add a star. And if you're in your 20's, stop reading and just go now. I came here a few times in my 20's when I lived in the city and loved that they had decent beer on tap, projected movies on the wall and had a kick ass juke box. Do you really need anything else when you're shit faced in Alphabet city at 1 in the morning? The answer you're looking for is no, you do not. Loud, crowded and hip The Library is easy to get to from the F and a few busses and is definitely a good place to meet up with friends if you want a raucous night of drinks and laughs. It is tough to get to the bar to order drinks and it is also tough to get a seat. There are booths, large rounds, and small cafe tables with a bench running along the wall and a chair on the opposite side. Here's what I don't like:People will pretty much fight you for a table and this is issue #1 I have: if you get there after someone and that person is waiting for a table, just let them have it. Don't turn it into Thunderdome. Good manners are good manners at any age and if you're old enough to drink you're old enough to know that -- so fuck off and sit down when it's your turn.Issue #2 is that this place has always seemed to be a hangout for post-date drinks. I will never understand this since it is insanely loud but it is dark and the tables have candles and yeah, I'd be impressed if I didn't know this place and you took me here. The problem is that these people somehow feel the need to take up larger tables and booths when the bar is literally bursting at the scenes.They need more books. The current collection is abysmal. There are not many books but rather huge gaps in the bookcases and books lying every which way included pages out. Here's what I like:They id pretty much everyone, including me. And I'm nowhere near 21. I like this because it makes me feel young AND because I know there's no risk of underage kiddos... thank Buddha.The jukebox is, as noted, pretty amazing. Check out the staff mixes for some real treasures. The bathrooms are genderless. There is a pretty wide span of ages and while we were probably the oldest people there last night, it was a good jaunt down memory lane and there were other people around our age. This is the kind of place that attracts people who like good beer and good music.",8,,4

The night my friends and I showed up, this place was projecting what I can only ascertain to be artsy historical porn featuring Roman gladiators. It was... I don't even know what it was. There was also loud music playing in the background, intermittently rock but also pop and hip hop. The whiskey sour I got was excellent and it seems like the bar service was relatively quick on a Wednesday night at 10PM.Basically, come here and form your own opinion of this place?

There's also a jukebox filled with mostly classic rock and grunge music so even though you're at the mercy of the crowd, the music is always a good vibe.

It's super dark; they have B-Movies projected on the wall at the far end of the bar, it's dirty, and the bathroom is covered from floor to ceiling in graffiti. There are bookcases on the wall housing a few decorative books, giving the bar's name some relevance. There are a couple of tables and booths in the back in the pitch black where you can catch some of the movie and chat amongst friends over candlelight.They had a decent selection of beers, and their 2 for 1 happy hour is M-F but starts at 5pm.

44,Jennifer K.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,3,1.0,5/11/2017,"From the great reviews, my friend and I decided to stop by to get some drinks. I ordered my 2 draft beers, and she filled both of them 2/3 of the way. Then, she proceeded to take care of 5 customers ahead of me while she let my 2 drinks sit there for quite a while. She made some mixed drinks for 3 of them and took care of 2 tabs. I'm standing there for the longest just for her to fill up the rest, that takes what? 2 seconds? Which is extremely stupid lol. She gets back to me and takes a look at us two. She's laughing and says, ""Why do you guys look so serious? You need to loosen up cause you look really tense."" That makes my head tilt like okay? That's a weird thing to say, was I supposed to smile at the wall and crack jokes with the cups in front of me? I laugh it off giving her the benefit of the doubt that you know what, maybe that's her way of talking with customers.What really pissed me off was when she proceeded to say, ""Are you looking for your personality? These are your personality drinks huh?""That was pretty insulting and also kind of ignorant in her choice of words. You're a bartender and you can't think of anything else to say? Yikes. I get that you're blonde but come on. Besides the fake enthusiastic smile that I appreciated at least, think before you speak lmao.I still enjoyed my time since I was with my friend but asking multiple people of what had occurred, they said I shouldn't have tipped her. But of course, being in the service industry myself, tipping should still be done generously. Just go to the bar across the street, the vibes better and the chick over there knows how to treat females not ignore them.",8,4,1
45,Victoria A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,35,41,3.0,2/4/2018,"Stopped in to The Library after dinner at Root + Bone a few weeks ago. If I'm being honest, it was a last resort (because I typically prefer places with cute decor... like Root + Bone). Every other place we tried going to was packed with a waiting list or equally as sketchy as The Library. So Library it was. I noticed that this place is characterized as a dive bar on Yelp, and it really lives up to the description. The bar is pretty long and right in front of you when you first walk in. We didn't have to wait very long for drinks because it wasn't hard to get the bartender's attention. Beware... if you are like me and you don't drink beer under any circumstances, and only drink wine when you know it's the good stuff, you might not have many options here. You won't find a cocktail menu-- they just have just your standard selection of beer. They might have some hard cider too. After we got our drinks, we headed to the back of the bar where there were tables and a few booths. In typical dive bar fashion, the tables were sticky which was a little gross, but par for the course. Let's just say I wouldn't want to use the bathroom in this place. This back area was dimly lit, and had some pretty interesting paintings on the wall that went along with the punk rock dive bar theme. The most interesting thing about the experience, though, was the softcore porn that was being projected on loop on the back wall. It was one of those moments where we looked at each other and asked, ""Is this what we think it is? ...Yup, that's definitely what we think it is.""

47,Dipika P.,"Jersey City, NJ",194,53,25,4.0,12/26/2017,Came here when the bar we were planning on going to was having a private party and was surprisingly pleased with this place.They have a great happy hour (2 for 1 per person) and the bartender was very friendly. They even had mulled apple cider which is perfect for the cold NY winters. Getting 2 drinks for $11 is amazing especially in a city where the drinks are expensive.,,,1
48,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,9/30/2016,"Longstanding dive bar with an extremely chill vibe and books galore (hence the name). A few old tables in the back, basic bar seating, and old school movies playing on a projector (Scarface at my most recent trip).Your basic beer list with old standbys. Full bar to the back and friendly bartenders to chat up with. One of the specials they had for the day was a root beer float with a crazy amount of hard liquor inside. Asked the bartender to switch up the root beer with hard root beer and she obliged ($8 altogether); amazing.Again, interior is nothing to write home about, but the place is great for chilling with friends.",2,,
49,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,326,593,4.0,10/4/2016,"First dive bar I've visited that has a library theme. They have a bunch of bookshelves along the walls with some old hardbound books on them. There's also a few caricatures of authors as murals on the walls, and a large screen in the back showing movies on silent (Sin city was playing when we visited). Otherwise an overall dive bar-esque atmosphere with tons of graffiti in the bathrooms and a large functional bar with cool bartenders.We came here late on a Saturday night (post midnight) and it was not too packed. We got a table to sit at almost when we walked in. Good selection of beer on tap, and all reasonably priced drinks. Will be back here again.",1,1,
50,Diana G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/28/2018,"The bartenders with tattoos  black long hair, one with short hair and the supposedly fake as manager with no experience in hospitality are so freakin rude. We went in for a couple of shots and the bartender let us know about a promotion they had buy one get one free. The trick was that we had to pay first not have a open tap. We paid and waited 30minutes for the free shot. When we asked about our free shot they said we had to wait and I asked how long. Their respond was that we are not wanted in here and we can get the F*** out. Idk if it's because we were women or Hispanic but we all tipped 20 percent for what. I work in the restaurant business and that was just rude, unprofessional even if it just a no class sports  bar. First they shouldn't never offered their promotion if they didn't want to serve us. Never go there !!!!!!",1,1,
51,Robert S.,"NY, NY",133,18,1,1.0,1/14/2018,"Very rude bartender: asked for more tips VERY aggressively after charging full price for happy hour specials. I do not feel comfortable going in there ever again, and would deter anyone from doing so unless you're into that, I guess.",,,
52,Esther L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,2,1.0,1/17/2017,"Over the past 6 years I frequented The Library Bar because the jukebox had the most amazing selection of 70s-90s punk, alternative and grunge on rotation, the drink specials were great, there was always some obscure b-movie flickering on the screen in the back, one could meet the most interesting people on any given night (once there was a dude in full ""evil faun"" makeup and prosthetics -- and it wasn't even Halloween), and the bartenders were warm welcoming and friendly. WERE.Well while most of that assessment still holds weight, I have to agree with another reviewer who recently witnessed the rudeness and smug superiority of the latest breed of bartender: Enter the Millennial Judgmental Overseer. Be warned: Your lips need not touch nay even stray so much as a millimeter near a bottle of alcohol before he deems you unworthy of patronizing the establishment. You might have gone to another bar prior. But you are neither raucous, disruptive nor impaired (to which witnesses can attest). You may cry ""a bit tiddly"" in defense but know that ""tiddly"" to this despotic barkeep could mean anything from falling down drink puking to just standing a wee bit too long at the ATM machine.Fine. We get it. You have to play both bartender and bouncer and you believe it's in the best interests of the bar to keep the patrons only so liquored up as to line your tip jar and keep the status quo. Perhaps you just want to get the f***k home earlier than usual and don't particularly relish even the slightest chance your night / your job could be extended due to preventable undesirable circumstances.But that being said, how sad. It seemed -- but how mistakenly -- that this was an echo, however faint, of one of the last true dive bars that had made New York so legendary. Places like CBGB and Trash Bar staked their territory on inclusiveness, on welcoming the frustrated, the weary, the spent, the blowing-off-of-steam and the desire to cast off normalcy and obedient herd behavior in favor of sheer expression.Or at least drunken inhibitions. Maybe back in the day they just didn't give two sh*ts.I am not touting all-out anarchy or condoning aggressively contrary drunken shenanigans. But when you cross the line between acting upon the mere anticipation of the possibility of ""bad behavior"" as opposed to acting upon bad behavior when it actually comes to pass, you carve a path to unsettling precedents of domination and quite frankly controlling how you think others should behave. This is known in sociopolitical jargon as the Preemptive Strike.Sorry to the absolutely fantastic bartenders who work other shifts and who've always made everyone feel welcome. For them, I wanted to continue to patronize The Library, but this incident left a very bad taste in my mouth. I ordered a beer from one bartender, and the next thing I know a second bartender -- the Millennial Judgmental Overseer -- refuses to serve me. For taking too long at their ATM. Yes I was tiddly from having had a few shots and beers at Double Down Saloon earlier. But no -- I was not throwing up, harassing anyone, or starting fist fights. I was able to stand without support and speak without slurring.So...at a supposed dive bar in the East Village no less, may I ask how the drunkenness of any given patron is measured? How drunk is too drunk (especially when you have not given said supposed ""guilty party"" the slightest chance to prove their innocence)?So that I might warn friends and out-of-town visitors how to appropriately conduct themselves to avoid being kicked out without having had even a single drink? Or simply tell them to steer clear altogether?Perhaps give The Library a spiffy paint job, you know to get rid of all the nasty dirty misleading graffiti, and clean up the disgusting bathrooms and change the old school jukebox to one of those new-fangled digital jukeboxes that spin all the popular chart-topping hits on demand, and put a red velvet rope out front so folks understand it's THAT kind of Establishment.",5,9,2
53,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1723,604,7753,4.0,5/9/2015,"This is a definite locals bar. The people who hang out here have been hanging out for a very long time. They know each other well. They know what the other likes to drinks. What's new in their lives. But most importantly, if they want whiskey in their coffee? And where is the latest He-Man VHS to start the morning off on a Saturday. Nothing says morning like whiskey and 80's cartoons. One of the regulars travels an hour and half every Saturday just to spend his day here. Lucky for us we live a block away and we can roll in and out as we please. The happy hour is a total steal. You can buy one and get one free. They give you little toys for your second beer. If you drink $3 beers then you are really getting more bang for your buck. In the wee evenings on weekend warrior time, there is an extreme mixed crowd from, a 44 year old divorcée, bike riding hipsters, regulars and people who are completely obliterated. I am a little too old for all that and I prefer day drinking myself. This place is also great for groups. But good luck finding a spot at the bar.",1,3,1

Cheap beers can get you drunk quick.I've read many negative reviews on the bartenders but I can't say that. I was immediately greeted and served lighting fast. If you tip normally you get good extra service and they get generous on pouring those shots and will join you for one or two!The jukebox selection is perfect, anything from Smiths to AC/DC. More than punk they were playing post-punk, which was great: the wire, joydiv ...In the back they have a darkened area with tables where you can do whatever you want and they also project random 80s movies.Do go and try it for yourself!",1,,

They give you little plastic toys to catch in for your second drink, which is both efficient and fun!It loses a star only because of the bathrooms. They are unbearable.

Once you're done with your drink, you bring the action figure back to the bar to get a second one FOR FREE. Pretty cool deal! The bar is adorable, and definitely on the divey side. The decor was pretty awesome, it reminded me of some bars in SF. We ordered multiple drinks, including but not limited to- vodka tonic, gin tonic, and multiple shots of tequila and fireball. All the drinks were very reasonably priced, considering the special offer they were doing for happy hour! Major kudos for the bar playing a movie during happy hour!

It's like she wanted to kill you."" It was very strange and honestly pissed me off. Didn't even give me a buy one get one, which I ordered 2 beers at the time during the happy hour special.

She's an absolute queen and is the bartender to which all other bartenders should aspire. She's super professional and speedy and thanks you for waiting if it's super crowded. I've become a regular at this bar because of her. I have never met another bartender who can make up delicious drinks on the spot like she can or make well gin taste just as good as Bombay Sapphire. I can't say enough great things about this bar.",1,,

We used to go to double down across the street but that bar is just a little too dirty and bothy/biker for me. We still wanted something really low key and this place is perfect. There's an old movie projected on the back wall, little booths for couples or small groups (mostly men standing up in the front). And 2 for 1's with little plastic planes as your free drink token. Extra credit for Edgar Allan Poe's Raven painting on the wall yet loses a star for drinks that don't seem to be that strong.",3,,2

A shot of whiskey and a busch tallboy.""Aaaand we were sold. Did the combination sound appealing? Nope. But how badly did I want to say, ""Can I please order a round of pubes?"" and then walk over to my friends and say, ""Guys, we got us some pubes!""? Apparently bad enough that the next thing I knew, I was as excited as someone who just turned 21 yesterday and I was making 2 trips from the bar to our table spilling the whiskey left and right trying to navigate around people and excitedly introducing the round of the night to my friends.The feel is a very dive-y college bar.

Seeing as how I've been frequenting this joint since before I even lived in NY, it's pretty unacceptable. Like a choose your own adventure scenario, this bar on the precipse of LES is what you want to make of it. Looking for cheap 2-for-1 hits to the head? They have it. Want to watch a movie on the projector in the back? Have a seat. Feel like meeting a real life hipster, and not an American Apparel shell of one elsewhere? This is your jam.

105,Mark C.,"Philadelphia, PA",41,1,0,1.0,12/14/2015,"This bar is absolutely shameful. For starters, even though it is a dive there is no excuse for the smell and grime.The service was by far the worst I have ever received, and it began immediately upon being greeted by the frumpy bartender dressed as if she were about to attend an MXPX concert and later rob the McCallisters with Harry and Marv from Home Alone.My girlfriend asked for a drink list and was rudely directed to the draft beer list on the chalkboard as if she were a blind kindergartener. We were in for a quick nightcap and just wanted a cocktail in a nice atmosphere - a large request because that is apparently not possible of being offered here. A word of advice - if you do not specialize in cocktails or mixed beverages, then a simple statement as such will suffice rather than shaming your patrons.We then had the pleasure of realizing we were seated next to the two bartenders' friend as he proceeded to drunkenly tell us how stupid people are who walk into a bar and ask for a beverage list when it is clearly on the wall... And he went on and on after having been obviously over-served. A few minutes later a bartender finally returned, and after realizing a cocktail is an impossible task, we settled for a shot and a beer each in glasses that were probably washed a handful of times in the last year.There is a reason, as others have pointed out, there are posters plastered amongst the walls about tipping. Apparently gratuity is obligatory even though the incompetent bar staff refuses to offer any sort of actual service to their bar guests. This is the only time that I have EVER left a $0 tip. I spent over a decade in the service industry and always tip upwards of 25-30%... Except in this instance. But the problem must clearly be me because then the bartender curtly curls her index finger in a come-hither motion, summoning me to the bar; I was more than happy to oblige. I would have loved to tell this laughable excuse for a barkeep and her counterpart how terrible their service was could I have edged in a word as she once again proceeded to shame and berate a patron. Meanwhile the people at the bar right next to us were, unbeknownst to her, leaving as she created an awkward situation - another job well done. Had I ever in a position of employment in any of the establishments in which I have worked acted in such a manner as she did, my employment would have been terminated on the spot.I would stay far away from this shack. As far as recommendations - anywhere will suffice. Try somewhere else, anywhere else. In fact, try a curbside puddle and don't waste your time with this dump.",5,2,

Black Sabbath was playing! Pure awesome!How can you not love a place that is covered in strategically placed graffiti quotes and cartoons everywhere? Even the bathrooms are covered in it. Bookshelves stocked with all kinds of novels and things that I will probably never get around to reading. Lots of seating and booths in the back room. The music was terrific here and ranged from old metal to classic rock to 80's New Wave. Cheap beers that range from Genesee cream ale, Tecate, Blue Moon, Natty, Busch, Kelso, beer & shot deals, kick ass happy hour, etc.The best is that they show old 70's and 80's schlocky B-movies on a large projection screen in the back room. We laughed and giggled at how bad this fantasy movie mess starring Liam Neeson was. Think it was ""Krull the Conqueror"".  So when is Taken 2 coming out?  Love this bar! Cheap beer. Divey. Great tunes. Cool ass crazy tattooed hot bartender chick. Great jukebox. No velvet rope or meat head frat boys. Crappy bathroom. Chill vibe. Perfect.( Gauntlet Inebriation Factor on a scale of 1-5.

At The Library.* And I don't blame them. You think you have it bad? Lock yourself in a room full of screaming kids on the edge of puberty all week long, and then see how badly you need a drink on Friday afternoon. Luckily, The Library runs a solid 2 for 1 happy hour until 7 pm (and Kelso Nut Brown on draft), which gives these lushes that are in charge of your children by day almost four hours of heavy drinking before the special ends. And be warned: they will drink you under the table. The jukebox is solid and the bartender is a sweetheart who is patient with her taps and her customers, even when they're giving her trouble. The bar itself might be pretty filthy, but everything is relative; with the Double Down is across the street, it looks downright immaculate by comparison._________*I think part of the appeal is being able to make plans with each other right in front of the children, thanks to the wholesome name.",13,14,10

I think this is the bar I've been to the most times in the city, and I always find myself coming back, even though I have a tendency to want to try new things.

162,Christina F.,"Chicago, IL",319,280,162,4.0,6/25/2012,"This weekend, I headed over to East Village for some dive bar action at Nice Guy Eddie's with a friend from home. He likes cheap drinks so when I couldn't find it, I was really disappointed. From the looks of it, the Library seemed like a similar place, so we strolled right in. Now, I like unique and different bars, but after living in Chicago, I began to detest dive bars. See, Chicago dive bar crowds are different, the people are usually rude and there's not too much diversity in the cliental that frequents them. I have now learned that NYC is quite the opposite. I've been to a couple dive bars in the city, mostly in East Village and have loved them all.The prices are perfect for 2 young professionals. We both got a 24 oz Techate and a tequila shot (it was on special for $8- not bad at all for a Saturday night). I really enjoyed the neighborhood feel of this place. The patrons were super friendly and I even met some people who I will keep in contact with. The bartenders were also great. Super friendly, funny, and quick. It's open until 4am, which because I live in Harlem, is one of the perks for travelling so far south. The only downfall: I consider myself to a bathroom connoisseur and these ones were gross. They only had 2 single stalls with writing all over the walls and liquid all over the ground. But, hey, when you plan on getting pretty faded, the bathroom situation will soon fade too.",5,5,3

Self-recognition plays a huge role in this, as does my affection for ""real"" people. The Library is an excellent bar to encounter such with the added bonus of a jukebox.Whatever your thoughts are on Williamsburg's counterculture movement, expect The Library to be the East Village embodiment of all of the plaid, ironic facial hair, and scarily masculine shoes that we have grown to know and love thanks to the L Train. People come here because the drinks are cheap, that's pretty much it. Beyond the cheap drinks, rather literally, there is so much graffiti that it is okay to assume the owner suffers from an unhinged fascination with early 90's gang activity. It's not just a little obnoxious. You sort of assume that you're going to see books everywhere but no, instead it's just walls of gigantic illegible scribbly words. The jukebox exists and it works but I for one would rather stuff my dollar bills into magical boxes of juke elsewhere.Grossest bathrooms in the East Village.

Morgan superimposed on a King of Clubs card.Walk toward the cavernous back and on a humid day like yesterday, I expected the area to be a Russian bathhouse (no, not hot Russian girls in swimsuits lounging around giving defiant looks at everyone but old guys with tattoos who will kill you if they think you're part of the FSB).  Fortunately, the back area was pleasantly cool.  Weird early 70s b-movies are projected onto the far back wall.  MST3K fans can knock back a few drinks and add their own irreverent brand of humor while they watch.  There are bookshelves lining the walls but I don't know how anyone can read in the dark unless they are a Morlock.  There's a jukebox that has among others: Iggy and the Stooges's ""Raw Power""; the Stones' ""Exile...""; The Smiths' ""The Queen is Dead""; T.Rex; Joy Division; the Buzzcocks; and more great tunes.If you're with friends and you need a place to get some inexpensive beers, stroll into the Library, grab a brew, and head toward the back.  Enjoy ""Reef Sharks of the Bay"" while you talk about some girl you met at another bar the night before; discuss the difficulty of learning Russian while Morrissey serenades you about how dying by your side is a heavenly way to depart this mortal coil; try to read that old detective novel that's written in Portuguese.You'll be glad you did.",2,2,1

It's still your standard dive--don't let the erudite name and bookcases on the wall confuse you.I'm just writing to say the girl who was bartending during happy hour SUCKS. I got my first drink no problem--but there was last call to redeem the tokens (toys) they give you to get your 2nd happy hour drink. She even called out last call! But as soon as I approached the bar, she was ignoring me, talking to her friends. She literally walked by me a dozen times over a period of ten minutes while I held the token in my hand, watching her hug her friends, talk to other people, do anything but serve me. Finally I loudly called out as she walked by and I was able to close out my tab and get my second drink. I don't know if The Library has a shifty policy where they encourage bartenders to be sneaky and ignore people until 8pm when the happy hour tokens can no longer be reclaimed--or if this girl is just shitty at doing her job. Maybe, with a collared shirt, I don't look as punk as my black t-shirt starving artist days when I hung around this hood like a creeper. I'm not sure. My friend who I met up with also waited 10 minutes and could barely get her 2nd drink either.Anyway, there's much better dives with more attentive weirdos behind the counter in the East Village. Time to close the book on The Library.",3,,
