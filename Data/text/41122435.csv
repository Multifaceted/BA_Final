1,johnny j.,"Bronx, NY",5,8,0,3.0,8/6/2017,"Good food. The prices are too high for this neighborhood but the quality is there. Fast delivery and good restaurant sit-down service.However I NEVER trust or like any business that is cash only, and the ATM inside charges nearly two bucks for withdrawal. Go to 138th and Willis (next door) and get the same great service and food. They take credit, debit, cash and EBT.",,,
2,Aiowa A.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,10,12,4.0,5/23/2018,This Jimbos is on point with all around service!!! Keep up the great service!! The chicken quesadilla was Amazing. The pancakes were made fresh. The bacon was just the way my son likes it. It was too late to post a picture we got right to eating.,,,
3,Primilene C.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,3,3.0,1/14/2018,"So Mario P is right it's NYC and you have to speak up just because its always full of people and the Bronx is a more direct jump in kinda place. I've been going to Jimbo's for over 10 years. The food isn't over price as some reviewers mention. It's more expensive than the surrounding Bodegas but it is a restaurant that is government by NYC health department and carries a different set of Insurance that I am sure will make for items to be up to a $1 or so more but you do get seating and a bathroom option which Bodegas don't offer. The food is ok for MY TASTE the neighborhood is predominately Black and Hispanic. So the cooking caters to their backbone customers. I don't like my bacon crispy but the neighborhood does so that's how it is cooked. That doesn't make the food bad, they are offering what the majority of their customers want. The neighborhood like their burgers and eggs cooked WELL DONE so that's how it is cooked. If you are not sure or require your food a certain way SAY SO! Let's be clear you are not getting an ARTISANAL burger made with WAYGU beef. The food is decent, priced right, the service is fast and accommodating, the place is clean and offers a variety so several different tastes can be accommodated.",1,,1
4,Willie T.,"Carmel Hamlet, NY",2,1,0,4.0,1/1/2018,"Great breakfast,  great burgers! I couldn't believe that they even made great salads. Table space is limited, as it gets full during early morning hours. Bring cash, tho. No credit cards taken. They do have an ATM inside.",,,1

I think this could be my new hood.",,1,
7,Matthew L.,"New Hyde Park, NY",111,75,429,4.0,1/6/2017,"If you ever go sight seeing in the south Bronx on E138 street and Willis Ave, then you must drop into jimbos hamburger. No frills burger joint with amazing burgers and chocolate shakes. Plenty of street parking outside as well. Get the onion rings , what a treat .",,,
8,Mario P.,"Bronx, NY",6,3,0,5.0,3/15/2015,"Ok let me start it off . People that are posting negative reviews about be ignored are so wrong ... It's NEW YORK ! You go and order ur food directly to the people that's taking orders . Don't wait until someone to see u to take ur order cause you will never get it period !Good food if u want something to hold u over for a while ..turkey burgers, french toast, cheese fries, all good there ... cheap prices but all good in general",2,1,
9,Paris A.,"Bronx, NY",53,3,0,5.0,1/16/2016,JIMBO's is one of the best fast food spots ever! The food is cooked with perfection and it's fast and good. You can never go wrong going with JIMBO's. Some of the hardest working Hispanics and best cooks ever!,1,,
10,PJ R.,"Bronx, NY",58,17,0,5.0,3/25/2016,Some of the best burgers I have ever had environment is great and staff make you feel like your part of the family the prices are good everything is fresh just a great place to eat,,,
11,Christopher R.,"Manhattan, NY",84,151,14,3.0,7/16/2014,"I was really hyped to try what so many people called a great burger, but after leaving Jimbo's I was very underwhelmed. You can get the 7oz patty with cheese for a relatively cheap $4.75, but the burger you get is nothing special. Mine was overdone, dry, and kind of just tasted like a griddle that had previously had onions on it. There was none of that beefy flavor that dominates a good burger. The tomato that I got on the burger was also like the mealy tomatoes that places often have in the heart of winter, but it is summertime in NYC, they should be able to get decent tomatoes.Considering they call themselves a burger palace, I wanted much more out of their namesake dish.",,,
12,Lucien V.,"High Bridge, NJ",24,11,6,4.0,9/11/2015,Cheap tasty full sized burgers. Quick nice service. Seating or to go. Can't really go wrong with that!,,,
13,Maximus V.,"Mott Haven, Bronx, NY",0,3,1,5.0,7/29/2013,"One of the best hamburger joints in the neighborhood. It's very clean, service is fast, free delivery, and the food comes out nice and hot. I would highly recommend this place if you want something quick and good.",1,,

Updated review","So, I've been back several times to try breakfast and have not been disappointed at all. Service is good and your food comes out relatively quick. Be careful about parking on Willis Ave early, between 7:30-8:00a.m., even on Saturdays (street cleaning). A lot of people don't realize this. They street clean every day, Mon-Sat, and traffic cops usually buy food in Jimbo's. So be careful. If you can, park off of 137th or 138th. Free parking, no meters on most of these 2 streets. Jimbo's has definitely become my go to place for breakfast. Very cheap too. Myself, wife and daughter's bill usually comes to $12-$13 (that's without a tip included). Definitely worth a trip. Train's near by and bus stop is right in front of this joint, if you're coming in from Harlem (BX15). Cash only and they do have an ATM inside the place.",1,,
16,Lori A.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,86,2,1.0,7/23/2014,Walked in and was ignored. Stood by the counter for 5 minutes as if I were invisible whilst not one staff member greeted me or asked me what I wanted to order. Walked out and took my hunger and money elsewhere.,,2,
17,Liza M.,"Sunnyside, NY",5,48,3,4.0,6/19/2009,"I'm a fan - one of the cleanest looking restaurants near the subway at 138 & Alexander and very busy at lunchtime with local folks sitting at the counter, and lots of delivery orders going out.  $12.90 + tip got my boss and I a cheeseburger, fries, milkshake, BLT and ginger ale.  The burger was no muss no fuss but, according to the boss, mighty tasty.  The BLT was also good and essentially the same sandwich you can get at the Bruckner but for 1/2 the price.This is not a destination by any means but working at the dead end of Alexander Ave, options are limited and I rarely venture to the other side of the Major Deegan for lunch.  So whenever I just want some greasy diner food in SoBro I'll be going to Jimbo's.",4,,4
18,Robert K.,"New York, NY",11,85,88,5.0,9/8/2013,"EUREKA!!!  After scrupulous research to find the ultimate burger experience in all of New York City, I have finally found it.  This is the best all-around burger for the money in all of NYC, PERIOD.  The place is a quintessential burger joint, a crowded lunch counter and one table, with the wood beneath the formica counter wearing through to the wood... but I came for the burger, not the ambiance.  I ordered the Texas Burger, that came with a fried egg on top.  Topped with mozzarella cheese and all the fixin's, it was absolutely AMAZING--the meat thick and juicy, and so large that it overran the bun!  I ordered some fries on the side, plus a very serviceable, handmade New York chocolate egg cream to wash everything down with (I have high blood pressure, but who the hell cares?).  The only negative about the place is it's far East Side location, but if you're a burger connoisseur like me, believe me, it's worth the trip.",,,
19,Luis h.,"Bronx, NY",15,5,8,3.0,7/28/2008,"Let me start off by saying I love Jimbo's.  Espeacially the one on Willis ave due to the fact that it's right around my way!  They deliver, and they serve a great buttermilk pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon which I can eat anytime of the day.  The only thing I recommend is that instead of delivery I say you go straight to them only because of the fact that if you do deliver chances are your food willl look like it came out of the 'spin cycle' by the time it gets to you.  Aside from that they have great milkshakes and the serve great hearty, tasty jumbo cheeseburgers that will hit the spot.   The service is decent.  If you have the time to spare drop in and order a meal...",2,,
