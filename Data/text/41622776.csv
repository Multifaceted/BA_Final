0,Bob Jude F.,"Astoria, NY",286,10,0.0,5.0,9/20/2018,"Sweet place, amazing server and fantastic cuisine of northern France. If you arrive on a lucky night they will have their amazing pork stroganoff. However or not, everything from croque monsieur to frites to crepes are simply TDF. And they do it all with love. In the summer they open their doors to the street. If you can get the little table right on the threshold, that's a fantastic inside/out sort of way to enjoy an evening. Reservations not really needed -- they are small but almost never full.",,,

There was a woman sitting with her partner by the ""window"" area, and she recommended that we try the food. My dad has previously visited this restaurant about 5 years ago but had never been back.I didn't really want crepes, but thought let's give it a try. My dad and I both had the Peach Sangria. I guess it was freshly made and not stirred. It tasted like water at first, and when we got to the bottom we realized all of the alcohol was on the bottom - it was like having a shot when you got to the bottom of the drink.For apps we had the goat cheese salad (delicious), my dad had the french onion soup and seemed very pleased. For main course I had the lamb, chicken, cheese and spinach crepe? My dad had the smoked salmon crepe. He seemed happy.My crepe had a strong taste of curry and was plain and simply not good.Maybe it had tumerin?I had asked the waitress for goat cheese instead of sharp cheddar and noticed that my plate looked super plain while my father's was beautifully decorated.Then I looked up at the decor while talking to my dad and noticed a pic of the chef with the line ""I hate special orders"" something along those lines. I thought: ""whoops, that may be why I got a plain plate!""Anyways, service was exceptional, decor was nice, and set up of the restaurant is very cute. I wish they had non-crepe dessert options.I will be back, but will stay clear of the lamb and chicken crepe. (they should add info about the spice if it contains tumeric or curry so that the next guest is not as surprised as I was)",1,1,1

We all couldn't stop eating despite being already beyond full. The Buckwheat crepes we're perfectly scrumptious and the best we ever had. (Cinnamon, Banana Nutella and the Butter were the 3 different types we tried)Escargot, Pan seared Tuna, Rib Eye, Cordon Bleu, Monsiuer Sandwich... All  delicious!   No need to dress up was a bonus on top of genuinely friendly service. Wishing we lived here to come back for more! Best meal we have had in New York during our week long visit.",,,
3,Katie L.,"New York, NY",251,233,532,4.0,12/16/2017,"The outside is very unassuming, easy to miss if you're not actually seeking it out, or even if you are. We came after dinner for late night desserts, and got the sweet crepes. I went with the Lemon and Sugar crepe with berry compote. It was yummy, thin and just crisp around the edges. The light buckwheat flavor was distinctly noticeable, as was the sweet tang from the lemon. But let's be honest, I could've probably eaten 3 of them, so I'm docking a star for value.Service was very accommodating, with both the waitstaff and cook from behind the bar welcoming us upon arrival. Neither rushed us as we sat alongside the windows, clearly the last patrons in the place. The space is quite dark and cozy, and the warm ambiance perfect to close out a cold winter evening.",,,

We got the Eggs Nordic, which had poached eggs, smoked salmon, and hollandaise sauce served over homemade biscuit. Poached eggs were perfectly made. Smoked Salmon was just okay, there is better quality out there. This was a really good brunch dish.Coffee is really amazing here, grab a cup!",8,4,5

I visited this website and I took a look around, assessing my options before closing in on Cafe Triskell. Well when I get there, I sat down outside with my newspaper and waited for the waitress... and I kept waiting and waiting and waiting! I was sitting there ten minutes without even a hello, or a glass of water, and it wasn't just me! The other table said they hadn't seen much of her the whole time too, so were both at a loss. I can understand the restaurant being busy, but given the size of the dining area, it seemed very strange to be waiting and trying to get someone's attention for so long. As the heat started to get to me, I left and went across the street to the Arepas cafe and got a glass of water and better service.",3,,

8,Jac S.,"East Rockaway, NY",4,32,1,5.0,9/2/2018,"We started with the French onion soup and the escargot. The soup was very tasty. The cheese was amazing! The escargot was wonderfully authentic. As our mains, we each ordered a crepe. The crepe itself was cooked perfectly. The goat cheese was so rich. The place itself is very sweet and quaint. It is small, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are wait times, but fortunately we didn't have one. Our server was a pure sweetheart and service was impeccable. We will most certainly be back.",,,
9,Lais S.,"Astoria, NY",7,43,132,5.0,11/24/2017,"I come here frequently for brunch. The vibe is very cozy and relaxed. It truly feels like home. I usually order the eggs any style and French toast. The eggs are served with sausage, Maplewood bacon, house salad and toast. The dressing on the house salad contains just the right amount of balsamic flavor. The Speciality Homemade French toast is served on a skewer with a berry compote and maple syrup. The berry compote shines; its fruity, sweet, and just brings the whole dish together. The french toast also comes with a choice of a mimosa or a Kir Royale ( I always get the Kir Royale.) The excellent service and delicious food always keeps me coming back. This is definitely one of the best spots for brunch in Astoria. PS: cash only!",,,

My girl ordered seafood paella which is really Spaniard dish and not French and I ordered another day special cod with spinach something something...my girl dish came on this nice mini paella pan and generous topping of shrimps mussels squid...very decorative. Then my dish was one of the truly smallish entree ordered in my life. It was so small that they had to serve it on this mini scallop shaped plate. It felt like I was eating a side to the main entree. This dish cost $18 and I can tell the ingredients cost for the dish was prolly no more than $2 since I buy cod and spinach regularly. It was just ridiculous...after coming back home I pulled up yelp reviews again on this restaurant noticed similar pattern pulled on other patrons where chef wows one dish and then underwhelm or cheat the other..not going back",,,

Honestly, the chef is an artist.This is really an excellent French breakfast/brunch spot.

We came here just for the crepes and they were phenomenal. Lemon and sugar with berry compost was my order and boy oh boy it was everything I wanted. Especially the compost. Perfectly executed. Not too sweet and beautifully fragrant. Seems like it was flavored with lemon zest and/or ginger. The crepe it self was light and crunchy on the edges. I also shared my friend's almond and home made chocolate sauce and it was fantastic as well. I really can't wait to go back to try other dishes.",1,,

We had dinner across the street then wandered over for crepes for dessert. We were fortunate to find a table on this establishment which seats less than 20 people. The room smelled of heavenly spices and butter. We ordered the Lemon crepe and a Banana Nutella whipped cream crepe. The crepes were incredibly thin with a crisp edge. The lemon flavor was full without being overwhelming. The nutella and banana were delicious but paled in comparison to the heavenly lemon crepe.

The first time it was good but the second time it was GREAT. I'm assuming since the first time we went all 6 of us ordered it and it wasn't made with the same love as my ONE was made. But overall it was great. It's nothing fancy or amazing about it, just a original, delicious, yummy crepe. We also tried the Eggs Nordic and it was great.

Updated review",This place is a hole in the wall with little seating and dim lights BUT the food makes up for it.MUST TRY french toast and french onion soup.It will be sure to satisfy everything you love about the two foods.French Toast: perfectly crunchy yet buttery and soft. It was not too sweet but just right and honestly it's the best french toast I've ever had and I have had a lot! French Onion Soup: Soooo cheesy but in a good way. The soup was not too salty and the onions still had some slight texture instead of disintegrating into the soup which I appreciate.The price was decent but it was worth it for how delicious everything was!,1,,
26,Nancy W.,"Queens, NY",173,5,0,5.0,11/25/2017,"Second time here and just as good as before. We had Croque-Monsieur & Zucchini tomato quiche. Staff always wonderful. Chef friendly and quick with service. Quiche had nice aldente pieces of well-seasoned zucchini and super fresh tomato. Egg was like a light custard and the whole dish had a touch of heat. The crust was thin and had just the right crunch. Not soggy like so many others usually are. So satisfying. Salad that comes with it made with mix of young greens and light, refreshing dressing. Croque comes with the best pommes frites ever. Don't put anything on them as they are thin, crunchy on the outside and buttery smooth inside, and perfectly seasoned. Croque was a savory blend of melted cheese, ham, and Bechamel sauce, topped with gently burnished topping of Swiss. All in All, a place to make your taste buds smile.",2,,
27,Marcus C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",813,579,1252,2.0,10/12/2015,"The food is undoubtedly not bad, but the attitude ...*sigh*. Let's begin.Food: it is undeniable that the food here is phenomenal. I had the French Toast brunch and the other people in my party ordered the beautiful corned beef with potatoes. Everything tasted great, but for $20 a pop, it's quite expensive. Our dessert, banana nutella crepe, was tiny, but quite tasty. The coffee was normal - I expected something much better to complement my $20 meal.Service: we walked in at around 11:07 a.m., and there was a Japanese-American customer who was seated at a table waiting for her other guest. Inexplicably, we were told that we had to wait outside before we could be seated. 2 out of 3 were present, though! The place was also empty except for that woman. After we were seated, another woman came in and asked for a table for four, but nobody from her party had shown up yet. This customer was told to be seated at one of the outdoor tables to wait for the rest of her party. I have a feeling that the serve discriminated against me for being a larger male. Hey, fat people matter, too!The server excelled in other areas, however - my coffee cup was constantly being refilled and I was never short on water.Decor: small space, not much to see here.""Cash only,"" in addition to the issues described above, makes this cafe too pretentious for me. I recommend Cafe Henri for a better experience.",9,,2

Hands down, THE BEST Croque Monsieur, Eggs Florentine Benedict, French Toast, and Lemon & Sugar Crepe I have EVER had. Everything was super fresh and flavorful to the taste, and super pleasing to the eye. I felt like I was transformed back to France for a moment. The space is small, humble, and full of warmth. How this place doesn't have a line forming around the corner I don't understand. Maybe the secret isn't fully out yet. Our waitress and drink server couldn't have been nicer. Super friendly and cheerful ladies. The owner/chef came outside to take a break and my friend and I chatted with him for a bit. Such a nice man.

We walked in for brunch on a sat Cus one of our friends really likes French food and decided to try this out with their great reviews. Food were real great and our waitresses were friendly and attentive. We had a great time here. We came hungry so for the 3 of us we got 5 dishes to share. I must rave about their beef hash. So fresh and not your typical one that u get anywhere else. All their crepe dishes seems very well made too. Thin and crispy just the way it should be. We got a savory ham and cheese one + a banana Nutella and whipped cream one as our dessert. No disappointment at all! So overall we got the following French Onion soup -must get! Super yum Croque Madame (the toast with butter and ham + cheese + egg) one of my fave French dish!! Main course we got The savory ham and cheese crepe (it was huge) Some lamb and chicken wrap dish (cool presentation) My fave the beef hash that came with greens. Yummmmmmy!! Only thing is..cash only guys! So come prepared,18,7,13
33,Gloria H.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",249,243,162,5.0,6/13/2015,"Oh, Cafe Triskell, where have you been all my life?This is quickly become our favorite brunch spot in Astoria- cozy and homey with amazing French fare. It helps that we love the staff too.The highlight for us is always the Skewered Brioche French Toast- homemade brioche lightly battered and cooked to perfection, dusted with sugar and served with berry compote, maple syrup, and a choice of Maplewood bacon or sausage. For $11 with a coffee or tea, this is easily one of our favorites. The brioche is crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside. You can eat the whole dish without the sauces and still enjoy it just as much- the homemade brioche really does magic.The Chicken & Lamb Bisteya is my second favorite- Shredded chicken & lamb with spices & almonds wrapped in phyllo dough, served with baby arugula salad. The dough is crispy but chewy, the perfect combination for the crust and the meat is very well spiced and delicious. As someone who doesn't eat that much meat for breakfast/lunch, this is one of my favorites even though it's heavy on the meat. The serving size is perfect to just be satiated and not over-eat.The brunch drink selection is limited but very reasonable at $5.The dessert crepes are exactly as I remember from France- paper thin and both crisp and chewy. The sweet filling was spread thin- exactly how we like it, as any more and it would have been overwhelming. The perfect light dessert to end any meal!",7,3,4
34,Osman J.,"Manhattan, NY",169,257,601,3.0,4/9/2017,"The French onion soup, which was rated one of the best in NYC, was a big disappointment.

It's definitely not anywhere close to ""best"", I would say it's just barely acceptable. Whoever tells you to come here for the FOS, don't believe them.I also had both the savory and sweet crepes, though they weren't too bad, but weren't impressive either.

The crepes are to die for, the French toast is to die for, the croque Monsieur is amazing and they make some of the best Eggs Nordic I've ever tasted.I also have to mention their lattes, because they are absolutely delicious.

The only thing more bothersome might be the marble-sized fly buzzing around our table. Another waitress tried to catch the fly with her hand, but failed - kinda weird approach to the problem if you ask me.We ordered the French onion soup,  and the brioche French toast (over-priced). The  soup is good,  would have been great if it was hot instead of Luke warm.  The French toast was terrific. As good as it was I will not be coming back.

I used to come by here more often since I used to work a few blocks away, but my visit today made me realize how much I miss this place. For me, this is the quintessential neighborhood gem. This place offers non fancy, rustic, well executed French food, I guess it would be considered a cafe rather than a bistro. I have always left this place happy, well done Chef Phillipe.The food:Escargot- sautéed snail, bacon, cherry tomatoes, herb butter served w/ bread. I am such a sucker for snails, they have such a nice texture and flavor, or at least it picks up the flavor it cooks in well. I would say a snail, for those who haven't tried it, is like a chewier mushroom. Ideally a snail that is cooked and served in the shell is the way to go but that is such a rare thing to see now a days, but the snails here are very good none the less. And don't forget to drown the bread in the garlic butter. nom yelp.com/user_local_phot…Triskell Savory Crepes- Button mushrooms, Swiss cheese & herb butter. I really thought this combo worked well. The Swiss cheese they use here was such a high quality cheese with a great chew. The mushroom and herb butter offered a nice earthy note.Croque Madame- hot sandwich with ham, Swiss cheese, and bechamel sauce plus egg served with a side house salad and potato chips. So I was kinda tricked into believing that a ham and cheese sandwich was so boring and plain, oh no, not here it wasn't. I only really ordered it since it seemed like everyone ordered it. And I can soundly say it is the greatest ham and cheese sandwich I ever ate. Period. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Dessert Crepe- homemade banana and chocolate jam. Oh sweet Moses...when the crepe was served, I immediately had the ""I am going to be disappointed' feeling. Shame on me. The crepe looks very basic and the condiment is served on the side. The crepe felt more like a paper thin waffle with a hint of sweetness. The crepe was crunchy yet slightly chewy and the banana and chocolate jam was sweet but not over the top sweet. I am a fan of their sweet and savory crepes. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",6,2,3

48,Ben W.,"New York, NY",514,772,435,4.0,6/16/2014,"Little French cafe in the middle of Little Brazil.Before heading to the movies, a friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite. We were debating between crepes and arepas, but the outdoor seating at Cafe Triskell helped us make our decision.The owners (I'm assuming) were so nice and charming, making sure we felt comfortable and giving recommendations on the menu. We opted to split the escargot and we each got our own crepes to split.The escargot was a nice start to the meal. I've only had it a few times, but it's never been a poor choice. Cafe Triskell's wasn't bad, but it was less buttery than I would've thought. It tasted like it was cooked in olive oil more so than butter. I did however appreciate the tomato and bacon chunks throughout. The starter bread that came out made for a good pairing. The coiled ones reminded me of a crustier, more buttery croissant.Our crepes were unfortunately a little underwhelming. While ordering, we asked our server if they could be made a meal of, to which he confirmed. It was definitely a lot smaller than I expected when it came out. My cream of spinach and chicken crepe, while tasty, was very deflated. My friend's goat cheese and chicken was much more full-looking. We split each others' crepes, and we both agreed the goat cheese was definitely better. Size aside, the goat cheese provided a much creamier, full-body flavor than the cream of spinach. Also, the chicken was much more pronounced and you could actually taste the meat you were eating. With the cream of spinach, it was all chopped and mixed together into a mush.This is definitely a cute little cafe to drop in on. The food is hit or miss, but because it's not unreasonably priced, it's not a bad choice to try on a lazy Saturday afternoon.",1,1,

50,Rose L.,"Queens, NY",75,122,152,5.0,5/25/2017,"For me, this was a restaurant where it was so apparent that the chef took extreme pride in what he was cooking. Every dish I've ordered here over the years has been so perfect, and I really appreciate the attention to detail. For example, I've ordered the corned beef hash off the brunch menu, and unlike many brunch places where some components of the dish are just haphazardly slapped together, at Cafe Triskell, every item on the dish clearly gets some love. The corned beef is obviously delicious, but the small salad component is also dressed and seasoned perfectly. And the all-important poached egg? Not only is it always cooked just right, but it's seasoned with a little salt and pepper on top, too. The entire dish is just so cohesive and delicious and not one ingredient on the plate is there for no reason. Um....and the pear crepe? That's perfect, too. The french onion soup was once a little too salty and burnt for my liking, but the other two times that I've gotten it have been spot on.",,,

56,Lu Y.,"New York, NY",0,8,6,5.0,7/31/2016,"I went to Cafe Triskell in the early evening on a weekday. It was a tiny space, but the atmosphere was great. There was a couple on (maybe) their second date, a group of men in business attire discussing finances, a father and son, and a lone woman reading a book. Plus me, and the kind middle-aged waitress and the dedicated cook, who was visible (!) and working hard on several dishes at once. The waitress escorted me inside and gave me the menu. I chose to go with the French onion soup, since I wasn't very hungry and had seen a sign on the door announcing that it had been voted the best in all of NYC. I had one or two of the rolls while I waited for my soup. The butter was soft, and a deeper, darker yellow than most butter. It didn't taste like most butter, either. Its more complex, satisfying taste went perfectly with the soft bread.My soup came not too long later. ""Enjoy,"" my waitress told me with a genuine smile. Breaking the thick lid of broiled cheese, I took my first spoonful. Delicious! The broth was light but extremely flavorful, and the cheese was great (well, it's cheese). I had a very pleasant half hour eating that yummy soup and reading the colorful postcards covering one entire wall. Thank you, Cafe Triskell, for giving me one of the most pleasant solo dinners I've had in NYC!",,,1

This spot is the place for my cravings! This was the first time to eat here, it's really small and a bit tight inside but it's like a hole in the wall kind of place that's worth it! It's authentic french food and the atmosphere is just a great vibe. Friendly staff and awesome. The French onion soup is so yummy, really fresh and not too strong just perfect for my palate. The onions are nice and sweet and the cheese compliments the soup so well. It's gooey-ness and bits of crunch on the side of the bowl is just heaven in my mouth. A must have here!The Croque Monsieur was yummy too, the bechamel sauce wasn't too strong and I could still taste the ham and cheese. Every bite was OMG delicious!! It also came with a delicious salad and potato chips. I really was satisfied with my meal. I was full and a good full not that feeling greasy and gross full. Also they only accept cash here and don't like substitution on orders, they have a picture of the chef noting how he hates substitution to orders and looks pretty scary on the pic since he has a big knife! I wish I took a picture of it because it was funny at the same time. This place definitely has a laid back and humor vibe which is major brownie points!

64,Helen D.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",75,254,168,5.0,4/12/2015,"Bf and I were craving French, and Cafe Triskell was the perfect solution. This small restaurant definitely had a European feel and probably seats 20 people max. Luckily for us, there was no wait on a Saturday around 1:30PM! Prices were very fair, about $10-15 for an entree. They could easily charge more, but I'm happy they don't! The famous French onion soup was a nice mix of sweet and salty. The cheese was nicely baked and tasted slightly burnt; I wished there was more. I'm not sure if this is the best French onion soup I've ever had, but it's definitely one of the better ones.Escargot was very tender yet had a nice bite. It was very flavorful, not overwhelmingly buttery, but some pieces were saltier than others.The Croque Madame was a very simple ham, egg, and cheese sandwich but done perfectly. The bread could have been soggy with all the cheese, but it wasn't.And finally, the goat cheese vegetable crepe was humongous and had so much delicious goat cheese! I love goat cheese. Yum.I fell in love with this place after 1 visit, and I wish I lived closer so I can come here every week! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.",1,,

We both ordered the French toast and initially laughed at the serving, thinking we would need more. Half way through, with one skewer left, we noticed how foolish our predictions were. The French toast was so delicious that had to finish the second skewer - and we happily did so. I recently ventured here with my family for Saturday brunch and we left with full bellies, cheek-to-cheek smiles, and satisfied wallets. The service was amazing and the staff is extremely friendly. I could write a book describing how delicious each dish was. My family enjoyed their respective dishes and drinks. The coffee was out of this world, fresh and crisp! The sangria was mildly strong, but very refreshing with this heat wave. I had the French toast- buttery and filling and very well paired with the tarty berry compote and the light and sweet maple syrup. I also had escargot for the first time! The escargot was served with butter and spices - was chewy and served with little pieces of toast. Bottom line is...I will be back! This place is awesome and I am so happy that it hasn't changed since I first discovered it. They put the 'gem' in 'hidden gem'. P.S. THE best French toast you'll ever have!",,,
66,Felix S.,"Flushing, NY",223,212,1041,4.0,1/27/2015,"After a wonderful morning sipping some delicious latte at Cafe 1 of a Kind, my adventure took me to the other end of Queens for some awesome brunch.Cafe Triskell is located in Astoria on 36th ave, a few blocks off Broadway.  If you are coming over during the weekend, get ready for some crazy traffic, especially on Broadway.Parking: Not too horrible,  I was able to find a good amount of parking here Saturday afternoon on 36th ave, if 36th ave is packed, try the side streets like 33th street.Decor and Ambiance: First impression: walked in and was fascinated by the painting that's hung on the wall- you know the one with a giant flying pig with a Chinese rice bowl on its back.  I don't know what to think of it but  it makes me feel good and I giggled a bit! The restaurant is not very big (around 18 seats and 3 at the bar in front of the kitchen) BUT it is cozy homey and warm, perfect for the winter days!To be quite honest, I don't think I would ever find and walk into this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  The entrance is small, you'll probably walk by it and never realize that this place is a restaurant.Our group of 6 came on a cold Saturday afternoon at around 1:30pm (yea, that's our brunch hour ha!), we were greeted by a very friendly server that told us that the wait will be around 15-20 mins but feel free to stay warm inside, so nice of her to do that since it was cold that day.We waited for like 10 minutes and got seated, our waitress was super nice and gave us some good suggestions.  In the end we pretty much ordered 1 of each item from their brunch menu (except the Chicken & Lamb Bisteya) and of course their signature French onion soup with aged gruyere & swiss cheese.All food were tasty but our favorites are:FRENCH ONION SOUP WITH AGED GRUYERE & SWISS CHEESE- There's a reason why this was voted best onion soup in NYC Daily News 2013, it was delicious especially on a cold cold day. The cheese was perfectly melted and the soup was flavorful yet NOT SALTY (which is rare because french onion soup tends to be extremely salty for some reason but not here), the onion of course were soft and mushy just the way I like it.  Just be careful with your first few bites or else you'll end up with a burnt tongue just like me.  What a perfect way to start the meal! MUST TRY!!CROQUE MONSIEUR- Who knew ham egg and swiss could be so delicious and pretty to look at??  Ham and cheese sandwich topped with sunny side up egg, so simple yet delicious, I almost pass out watching that egg yolk slowly drip down only to be absorbed by that soft toast.  I'm going to take a wild guess that the egg is farm fresh because you can taste the difference. Eating this is like taking a flavor and texture adventure- you get chewy ham and swiss and then a light crunch from the toast all follow by the milky, creamy egg and yolk... OMG JUST DELICIOUS!!! EAT IT WHILE ITS HOT!!! MUST TRY!!SKEWERED BRIOCHE FRENCH TOAST-  It is not a completed brunch without some french toast at the party. and the french toast definitely hit the spot here! I LOVE FRENCH TOAST MADE WITH BRIOCHE!! People use all different types of bread (challah, sourdough, Hawaiian Sweet Bread) but to me, my favorite has to be from brioche, love how brioche soak up all the eggy goodness like a sponge. Our french toast took a little time to prepare but in the end, when we sank our mouth into it, it was all worth it.. slight crunch on the outside and moist soft eggy inside... perfectly executed, what's not to love about it? Don't forget to add the berry compote- it's money! MUST TRY!!Price: Good! Brunch items ranges from $10- $13 and include a choice of coffee, tea, or a soft drink.  This is really a great deal consider the quality of food they serve!Overall: LOVE CAFE TRISKELL- Their brunch menu is superb!! their prices is great and their service is excellent!  totally a hidden gem in the Astoria.  I will surely return to try their lunch and dinner menu.  Try to get there either early or later on in the day for their brunch to avoid the crowd (brunch ends at 5pm Saturday & Sunday) and bring an empty stomach as well as CASH!!

72,Joe M.,"New York, NY",3,18,0,3.0,10/4/2015,"I agree with the others - the waiter at Cafe Triskell is not very nice, he seems annoyed whenever you ask questions. I have been to this place twice, the second time I went was because it had been a while and I expected the place to have improved  - not so. The second time I went to Cafe Triskell it was practically empty, just me and some friends of the owner sitting at the stools by the kitchen, oh and the angry waiter. 1. Worst thing of all - ventilation - I had to wash my clothes when I left this place and you will too. 2. Service - the waiter handed me the menu with prices. This  menu is just a peace of white copy paper inside of a plastic sleeve. To change the menu you go on a computer, fix the prices and just print , simple as that. However every price on their menu is wrong, steak and fries says $25 but the waiter tells you it's $30. Every item except for the soup and crepes has the wrong price, wrong meaning you have to pay more, never will they tell you it's cheaper. You would think they would correct the menu since there is nothing else to do there. After all, the place is not packed and it costs $.03 cents for a piece of paper. 3. Food is okay but very very expensive, especially the tough steak and overly fried fries. My advice, make sure you double check the prices to every item you order and bring a fan to help with the ventilation. Other than that enjoy your French Meal.",4,2,1

The menu is fabulous, the chef is extremely talented, and the service is attentive, kind, efficient, and accomodating. For such a bustling, high volume, close quartered operation- everything is run so smoothly. Although the place was packed when we arrived, the team kindly accomodated informing us when a table would open and directed us where to wait until it was ready. (Didn't just turn us away or look down their noses at us for thinking we could eventually get a table at a busy brunch like at least one nearby place *ahem, Gastroteca* in particular) Coffee was topped off efficiently and eagerly, the brunch menu is simple but offers drink options that are thrifty. We ordered a veggie meal that came out as it's meat counterpart by accident but it was swiftly carried away and replaced before there was even a second to contemplate inconvenience (that which it was not) and were offered complimentary drinks as a result! not a bad deal at all! So impressed by the charming decor, great music, great ambiance, feels like a romantic european hideaway tucked within queens. And of course the FABULOUS chef and service full of genuine character and eclectic energy rather than the pathetic pretentiousness bubbling all around Astoria lately.

From the absolutely affable, welcoming demeanor of the proprietor to the impeccably prepared French dishes, I am left yearning to come back as soon as possible. As everyone else has indicated, the French onion soup is simply divine, and alongside the escargot it makes you calm down, savor, and feel thankful to be human. The skewered French toast, with its golden, rich syrup and berry compote, thickly sliced and softened through and through, is the forbidden food of the gods.

Updated review","Came back again, and it was even worse. The crepe, yeah it was good. But what good is that when:1) The waitress seats other people before you (most likely because we had a kid).2) They forgot our mussels.3) They said they had a high chair for us, but forced my two year old to sit at a booth (not a good idea).4) The table next to us got their food first, even though they were seated fifteen minutes after us.I can keep going. No straw for my iced coffee, waitress was extremely rude and treated us as if we were an inconvenience.

90,Michael M.,"New York, NY",6,6,0,5.0,7/16/2015,"I have been enjoying dinner (and later, brunch) at Cafe Triskell since it first opened its doors several years ago.  You will likely be impressed by whatever you order, but their french onion soup, PEI mussels, chicken and lamb bisteeya and (for brunch) french toast are particularly outstanding. The crepes are in a class of their own and are made with buckwheat flour. The restaurant also has a very nice wine list and offers interesting beer selections from Breizh. Service here is professional and attentive (although you should not dine here if you are expecting to leave within 30 minutes -- this is not a fast food joint!)Anything Chef Philippe touches turns to gold, and it is because of his artistry that Cafe Triskell has become one of the gems of Astoria's dining scene.",,,1

I came for brunch on a Saturday morning & it was the best way to start my day. It's a little cozy spot with about 5 small tables & a longer one for a larger party. They also have a couple outdoor tables which is nice now that weather is warm. I sat at the counter & was able to watch the chef prepare all the food. I ordered the Croque Monsieur which came with chips & side salad plus a complimentary coffee/tea. Generous portion for a great price ($10)!! It was delicious & he flame torched the cheese on top perfectly! For dessert I had the Cinnamon Sugar crepe. Crepe was a perfect balance of light & crispy with rich flavor. I want another one already haha! My only constructive criticism would be regarding the wait staff. There was only one person working & there was a steady flow of customers so the little details of following up on how the food is tasting or if you'd like a refill on hot water or coffee were missed. At the counter I was able to watch the orders go out & everything looked delicious so I definitely want to come back to try more dishes especially the French onion soup, French toast, and more of the crepes!",1,,1

But I only got a Ham & Swiss Crepe and I got it to go because I unfortunately did not have time to sit and eat in (hopefully next time I could dine in!).Everyone was very nice (two female servers greeted me warmly once I entered) and inviting and wait time was less than 10 minutes. I sat on one of the stools by the kitchen and got to just admire the scenery. I also said ""bon jour"" to the chefs in the kitchen as I did not want to be rude and just sit there without acknowledging them since I was sitting facing them directly (and from what I know about my visits to Paris, I was told that it is considered rude to just enter an establishment without at least saying ""Hello"" to the proprietor and staff or whoever greets you when you enter). I think one of the chefs was Chef Phillippe himself.I could not wait to eat my crepe so I tore right into it as soon as I got home. O M G ... it is seriously THE best crepe I've ever had outside of France thus far!! It was made with organic buckwheat flour (yum!) and everything was perfectly thin the way it should be. Serving size was good as well and before I knew it, it was all gone and I wanted more. Y U M!! C'était délicieux!!Things to know:- Cafe itself is small, but quaint and cozy. They have several tables inside for dining in.- They have a few tables outside for outdoor dining- Cash only- Prices are very reasonable. My crepe was about $7 but since the portion size was generous and it was delicious, totally worth it!- Weekday hours are limited to dinner service (5pm-10pm), but they are open all day on weekends (11am-10pm)- Location is just a few blocks from the N/Q train. After exiting the subway station, look for the Dunkin Donuts. From the corner of Dunkin Donuts, go 2-3 blocks up 36th Ave to 33rd St (if you pass a dive bar called Quijote, then a few bodegas, a 99 Cent store, then on the next block another bodega, a laundromat, Psari seafood restaurant, you're heading in the right direction). The cafe is between 33rd/34th Sts right on 36th Ave., across from the Arepas Cafe.Am hoping to check it out for an actual sit-down meal next time! A friend of mine eats here often and also recommended the Croque Monsieur, will have to try that and maybe the escargots. And maybe a sweet crepe. With some wine. And maybe the quiche of the day.

Definitely my kind of salad! We also got one savory and one sweet crepe to round out the meal. I want to go back for dinner... and for brunch again.

You can pass by it 100 times, since it's not on one of the more popular drags in Astoria and not realize your going by possibly the best French spot in the hood. While a small place with an even smaller awning, once you step foot in here, you feel like your in a cozy little bistro in the middle of France. The chef (who's actually French) and waitress were warm and welcoming and we grab a seat right next to the kitchen, which kept us toasty and warm on a bitterly cold night. Of course, my gf and I both had the french onion soup, which was worth the price of admission. Equal parts oniony, bready and cheesy, their version was one of the best french onion soups I ever had in my life. I had mine as an appetizer while the lady had it as a main course and it went great both ways. The lady had the razor clams, which were really fresh and out of this world. The topper for me was the mussels and fries I had. Super fresh mussels, in a wine sauce that was just heavenly tasting and fresh cut, skinny fries, fried perfectly. Completely unexpected and completely delicious. All food went perfect with this nice, dry white wine we ordered as well. We could of walked out right after the meal and I would of still given the place 5 stars after my experience, but the cherry on top was the crepe we had as a dessert; super thin and tasty, with piping hot berry compote.

One of my favorite neighborhoods for good food, casual bars, and down to earth Greeks. No doubt both the savory and sweet crepes here are delicious but it was just my luck that they also have the best french onion soup in NY! It will burn your tongue and melt your heart. They do not skim on the mussels appetizer either - a huge portion with fries that can be shared or eaten as an entree.

I had the corned beef & potato hash platter and my friend had the Chicken & Lamb Bisteya. I normally don't like corned beef & hash but this place changed my mind about it. It was so good and filling I was set for the rest of the day. The restaurant is located right next to the 36th street stop on the Q/N train so commuting here shouldn't be a problem for those who do not drive. For those who do drive, there's ample amount of parking in the area.

They were the perfect temperature to enjoy it without burning my mouth, which I've done at other places before.  I liked that the cheese in the broth was easy to break through and didn't turn into one giant clump like at other places.I am a huge fan of corned beef hash. I sometimes like the canned version better than the real version and I don't eat anything from cans...'cept for corned beef hash, tuna and chickpeas.  However, this was the best corned beef hash I ever had.  It was a sort of deconstructed version- actual corned beef over hash with a poached egg with a runny yoke and some salad with a hint of mustard in its dressing.  I was very very impressed.By this time, because the service was so great (our server was so sweet and smiley), the restaurant was so cute and the food was out of this world perfectly delicious, I thought, ""I think this is one of my favorite restaurants"".  I was surprised at myself that this stamp of favorite resturant approval could happen so quickly.I originally didn't want to order dessert but because the soup and the meal was so great I had to.  This place is known for their crepes.  I got a simple butter sugar crepe and woah, I've never had a crepe like this (I've made them at home, had them in France, had them at creperies...).  This crepe was crispy, thin and tasty.OK. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants.  I'll be back again and again and again and again...  I live in Manhattan but this just made me LOVE Astoria.A note: two french onion soups, corned beef hash brunch plate that came with coffee, tea or a juice, a tea, and a butter/sugar plate with 20% tip came out to $45.",4,1,

The food was excellent, but my favorite part of the meal was when a patron asked the waitress (who was wearing a t shirt emblazoned with ""cash only"") if the restaurant was cash only. Quiche of the day - awesome that they just give you these massive slices right from the panFrench onion soup - you know when the broth tastes like gravy, but it's still got the broth consistency?

He loves this place and recommended it to us so we decided to check it out. The cafe is tiny and there was a bit of a line that morning but we got a table without having to wait too long. After reviewing the menu I had a hard time choosing what I wanted as everything sounded delicious. My bf and I ended up sharing the lamb bisteya and the corned beef hash. Both were delicious but that morning I was more in the mood for the flavors of the latter dish. The beef was perfectly seasoned and the combination of the greens, warm potatoes and poached egg was just perfect! We also shared a dessert crepe of poached pear. So good! The staff were friendly and service was nice enough so not sure why there are a handful of bad reviews regarding the service. The place is cash only but price point was also reasonable. This is definitely a spot I'd come back to whether for brunch or dinner.",1,,

Some fancier restaurants would not attend to this minor detail.Food was great. It is rare to enjoy food from a chef who has such an amazing taste palate that every dish served up would leave any foodie wanting more. Round soup spoons for the onion soup would easily get six stars from me.Service was great. The waitresses kept the show running by getting the orders correct, and making sure that everything was to our liking. The 2nd waitress stepped in to get our drinks once she realized that the 1st waitress was tied up with another task. Very efficient, and team oriented atmosphere.Bring cash.Try everything.",1,,

I really don't get it. (feels like homestyle food trying to make fancy presentation) Chicken & Lamb Bisteya,  I can see why some people like it, the pastry/dough is good, friable and crunchy, but the minced meat with herb/spices is dry and the flavor is just straightforward. the frisée salad on top with vinaigrette sauce, so very basic and doesn't do anything either.Poached pear, homemade chocolate sauce, toasted almonds & whipped cream crepe.again, it's so straightforward that I can achieve the same level myself at home.  don't like the homemade chocolate sauce at all (probably because I don't like chocolate very much, even those famous chocolatiers e.g. Jean-Paul Hévin in Paris doesn't do much for me) sorry to say that both of the crepe places in soho (one french one  japanese) are much better than this.",,,

Put away your mama's credit card, grab a friend, and join me in an epic adventure of internet review.Cafe Triskell is a tiny cafe in the hear- uh, ass of Astoria (asstoria) that is 36th ave. Like all French restaurants, you should check when it actually opens. Yep. Brunch only available on weekends and completely closed Mon and Tues. So its a very small place with limited seating, limited hours, and limited methods of payments. With me so far?The food is what you will be coming for. The bread service comprises 3 dough balls with a cupfull of butter. I am a tool when it comes to *anything* that's not your traditional bread. The melt in your mouth dough balls had me giggly from the get-go. [insert joke opportunity] Appetizers we shared the escargot. These tiny snails have been picked off their shells and served in heavy sauce and oil. You use a tiny fork thingy and u put the little rascals on top of the bread piece that comes on the side and you indulge. Mmmm. It tastes like fatty pieces of bbq. Highly recommended, especially if you have been shying away from escargot because of how shell-y and snail-y the normal presentation is. There are only four main courses for dinner, plus whatever specials they have for the evening. I tried the chicken cordon bleu ($18) while my friend got some waffle with eggs. Brunchy stuff. Oh man I've never had chicken cordon bleu like this. It's 6 pieces of curled cinnabon-shaped chickens, just replace the dough with chicken and cinnamon with cheeses.  The portion is larger than it looks. It is more white meat than ham and cheese and the flavorful skin, so it might not please everyone. I love white meat.The food is one of the better ones I've had in Astoria. It has a good mix of 'different' and 'delicious' that obnoxious foodies usually look for. The service is average, with the exception of the lady who has the most friendly, aunty-ish sincere smile I've ever seen. That alone makes me feel good. And like other French-y places, it will take a while (30 mins for us) for food to come out. Plan accordingly.",4,2,2

138,Sandy C.,"New York, NY",366,544,1523,5.0,11/25/2011,"My friend wanted crepes, so we've decided to come here for dinner one night. This is indeed a very small cafe with about 5-6 tables. The decor was minimal in the dimmed light setting. I can already tell this is a local place because everyone seems to know the staff. The server was really friendly too.To start my friend and I ordered the french onion soup, which was really really good! The melted cheese and caramelized onion just really hit the spot! We've also shared the scallop and mushrooms, which was amazing! Gosh talking about this appetizer is making my mouth water! Then we also shared the mussels and french fries. The mussels were good, especially the broth that it was in. The fries were fried to perfection.After sampling on the appetizers, my friend and I can either eat an entree or a dessert only. So we've chose a sweet crepe instead of a savory one. My friend ordered the chocolate dulce leche crepe, which was not too sweet. As for me I've gotten the poached pear crepe, which was also done really well. The crepe was light, fluffy and crispy at the same time. When you are there, remember to check out their bathroom. It's quite interesting because it is plaster with menus from other French restaurants around the world. For example I saw a menu from French Laundry. I'm not sure why menus of other French venues were in their bathroom. To look at it in a negative way, they are saying ""our food is the best and the other restaurants are like crap."" Or in a positive attitude, they are saying ""now that everything came out smoothly, you should plan where you want to eat next!""",2,2,2

The dessert lemon and sugar crepe was absolutely the best I've had-- crispy and not too sweet. My 2 issues with the place are 1. Not a lot of options for dairy/ gluten-free. I get it, it's a French place and I do love butter, I just wish there were more options. He kitchen doesn't do substitutions and while I get it-- again for special diets it's tough out there folks. 2. Almost more importantly-- it's not ventilated super well and always smells cheesy. Other restaurants are definitely guilty of this-- queens kickshaw is one-- but it does impede enjoyment in my opinion. Today I just came in for an espresso to go and since they didn't have cups to go they gave it to me in the house (full disclosure). Thanks chef!",,,

If there is a special dish, I'll try to order it since it never let me down before.Escargot - excellent, with bits of bacon and stewed baby tomatoes in herb butter, the flavor combination is amazing; I've had them several times here.

Where, oh where could it be?With a thin crispy exterior and a delicious interiorOh where, oh where can it be?A proper French crepe is a thing of beauty. It's so delicate, translucent almost. Light practically shines through it. I'm not into the American version with a thicker batter and the overstuffed interior. Darling, darling Cafe Triskell saved me from my crepe hell. I love their buckwheat crepes, which achieve that delicate crispiness that I haven't found anywhere else (not even from my beloved Crepes A-Go-Go in Berkeley). I had mine with poached pears, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. The poached pears were a thing of beauty. I had automatically assumed that they would be mushy (because they usually are at other places), but I bow my head in shame at my assumption. Poached, but they still retain their pear dignity. With the chocolate sauce and whipped cream, I was in crepe nirvana.I also love their French onion soup. The broth was hearty and flavorful, and the cheese properly caramelized under the broiler. I could have had a bit more bread, but I'm a carb fiend. Cafe Triskell is a tiny place. I love the warm colors and odd kitschy decorations that they have.

It's made from buckwheat flour so it had a very different and interesting taste compared to other similar crepes I've had, and in addition made the crepe a lot more filling than I expected!

Updated review","I have been a loyal customer to this little gem for years. But it seems like the brightness of this gem is fading. I moved to Brooklyn few years back so I don't come here as often as I used to. This place has killer French onion soup, steak frites, escargots, crepes and muscles. I have always and I mean always, ordered the same thing with my family every time we come and we never left behind any food but this time was different. The french onion soup is still superb but they charred/burned most of the cheese on top ..... Like super burnt. But thankfully half of it is still edible so I still enjoyed it. Next the muscles. Was still done perfectly like usual so no complains there. Now, my long awaited steak frites! It is served in a skillet. Usually comes well seasoned, tender, juicy and only for $25.00. Well, this time, it has all changed. The steak is now $35! Which is a 30% increase which I didn't mind because their food is worth it. But when I sink my teeth into the steak. It was a low quality cut that is no where near as tender and juicy as before, I ordered medium rare and it came medium and it was tougher than the old cuts,  it was very under seasoned, VERY oily and has a somewhat of a ODD STALE taste to it.... The skillet bottom is saturated with about half an inch of oil, butter or what ever it is ...and even those ""meat liquid residue"" (think when you boil meat or chicken in a pot... Those white, brown, foaming stuff and residues on top of the water) is floating on the top of the ""oil soup"" in the bottom of the pan.....my 6 year old can probably cook a steak better than that! But at least the frites were still done perfectly!After the first bite I wanted to give up but I kept on eating hoping it will get better but it didn't. I couldn't finish more than half of my steak and tossed it and I had hoped that's the only bad dish. Unfortunately, the escargot that came late to the table shared the same fate as the steak.... A greasy, odd stale taste, a overpowered green sauce with no real seasoning over saturated the dish.... It was a disaster. Had 3 pieces and even the kids didn't eat it .....(their favorite)I voiced my opinions to the waiter (who is always been nice and courteous over the years) but you could clear tell that he doesn't seem to believe me. I didn't voice my opinion to him for discounts or item removal off the check as I understand sometimes things can happen and no restaurant will taste 100% all the time. I told them so they can probably look into it and if something is wrong they can fix it and not hurt the business. So finally we ordered the crepes ...... My kids favorite! The waiter brought the crepes over and said its ""on him"". I told him don't worry, charge me because I don't need free food to feel happy I just want to give them honest feedback on my food experience!! And when we dig into the crepes.... It was once again soaked in grease and butter!!!!! It was still great tasting but I felt as if I had swallowed a tube of butter afterwards ......(although we ordered sugar and butter crepe it was never so saturated, you roll the crepes up, you bite into it.... Massive amount of butter oozes out ..... Ugh..... Ewwww...)Thankfully my kids didn't mind as it was sweet and they munched it up.  It was Friday but it wasn't that busy and I have been to the restaurant when they were much busier and still presented superb food; so I don't understand what happened this time. With the quality of this visit. We will probably never return again.... Well... Maybe only for the soup and muscles. Hope they read this review, see it as the honest feedback and really step it up and find out what happened to their steak and frites recipe! Remember this, the owner/chef may just had one bad night, but to a customer that came and dined that night, that is all it takes to leave a solid impression in their minds, may it be good or bad!!!!!!In the mean time Avoid the steak escargot and stick with something else!",2,4,
167,Marissa N.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,1/1/2017,"Honestly, my experience at Cafe Triskell has left me so incensed I couldn't even wait until after my movie to write a review. We came in with about an hour to spare before we had to leave for our movie and sat down. When the waitress came over, we asked her if we'd have enough time, because we were willing to go elsewhere, and she assured us that it would not be a problem. Great. We each ordered a soup and a crepe, in the interest of ordering things that would be quick. It took over half an hour to get out soup, and eventually, the waitress told us we should just leave so that we wouldn't have to run to our movie. We were very hungry, so we pushed back. We wanted our food. We were told we'd get it. Crepes are made in minutes on the streets of Paris, so we really couldn't believe it. Especially considering that a couple that sat down fifteen minutes after us was already on their third course. As I pushed back, the chef yelled at me, ""This isn't a diner sweetheart."" So unbelievably condescending, and in hindsight, I think he might have purposely delayed our food because we had a deadline, which offended him for some reason. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect our food after an hour, especially when our food wasn't anything extravagant and we were reassured multiple times that we would have it in time. To their credit, we didn't have to pay for our soup, but I'm currently at the movies eating popcorn for dinner because these people messed up. Their attitude (as well as their preferential treatment for certain customers) is disgusting. We would have happily gone elsewhere if they'd been up front with us.",1,,
168,anindita s.,"Woodside, NY",1,21,3,5.0,8/8/2015,"Love this place. It's always crowded in the morning. The best time to come here is after two. We love their crepes, and french toast. The bread for the French toast is made by the chef himself. I never liked french toast till I tried theirs. One order of it is never enough.  Excellent service. Friendly staffs.",,,
169,Karen P.,"ASTORIA, NY",56,52,0,4.0,1/21/2013,"Hoping to recreate our experience at a creperie in London, my girlfriends and I had a late Sunday brunch at Café Triskell.  Although it's obviously not the same, I have to say that I'm sold on this restaurant and I'll definitely be back again.I had the skewered French toast, which may seem boring out of the other menu items I could have chosen from, but it was out of this world.  A step up from the usual French toast to say the least - but I wasn't a big fan of the turkey bacon that came along with it. My friends had the Croque Madame, a ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg.  Sounds basic too, right?  Nope, hands down the best ham and cheese sandwich.  Although all offered on the regular menu, we ordered off the brunch menu which included coffee, tea or soda.  FYI, the brunch menu is until 5pm.Of course, we had to order the crepes for dessert (the reason why we came in the first place).  The buckwheat flour the chef uses is different from what you'd expect of a typical crepe, but it was great.  Hard to go wrong with any of the sweet crepe options.Place is tiny, but it's sized to what is manageable, so that's understandable.  Cash only like others have said.",2,1,2
170,Hannah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,9,0,5.0,1/18/2013,"This may just be my favorite restaurant in the whole of new york city. That being said, you shouldn't go here. Really, go anywhere else but here.I came here for the first time a year or two ago after a sudden and vicious case of french-onion-soup-craving. I'll admit it, yes I found this place on yelp. And I went because of the overwhelming 5-star ratings. And the french onion soup blew my top off and made me giggle and cry over it's spot-hittingness. Still don't ever go here.I've been back so many times after that french onion excursion and I've tried so many dishes-- including the melt-in-your-mouth skewered french toast, the orgasmic croque madame, and the crepes; I think at this point I've tried all the sweet crepes and jesus, every one is better than the last (and they're all amazing). I think you'll hate this place.Lastly, concerning the ambiance: the place is tiny-- 6 or 7 tables at most--and there's usually one woman server (she's a ball breaker with a heart of gold) and a bus boy running around filling coffee and water, and the chef-- this small, blond French guy stirring soaps and steaming mussels and making every single delectable dish that comes of that steamy little kitchen (speaking of, the ventilation in this place is not the best in the world, so bring a jacket when it's cold because you'll want them to leave the front door open). There's usually some dreamy electro tunes pumping quietly in the background, and the space is so damn cute (but not too cute) and unique and just downright comfortable.  Do not waste your time with this place!Ok, I give up. Go here, it's amazing. I will admit that I strongly fear this place getting too popular, and me not being able to get a table when I arrive every Sunday afternoon. But, alas, that's ok. These guys deserve it. Enjoy and remember to bring your dolla dolla bills-- they only accept cash.",2,2,1

We ordered a Chicken & Lamb Bisteya, a Croque Monsieur, a Corned Beef & Potato Hash Platter and a crepe. Every dish was good but we loved Croque Monsieur the best. We also order its famous onion soups, it tasted really good.  And the refill-free coffee or tea is included in the brunch set which is really a good deal.",,,

Oh my gosh. Words don't do the food here justice. Just, give it a try. It's a super-easy walk from the N at 36th Ave.Warnings:- Cash Only- You will not be seated until your whole party is there.

174,Sam S.,"OR, OR",0,21,4,2.0,8/16/2014,"Last week was our first time dinning at Cafe Triskell. It was amazing there was an older lady serving us. Me and my boyfriend loved it and we went back today. Today, The food was good but surprisingly the service was just awful. It was a different server, her name was Cindy and from the beginning she was rude. I understood that they were busy but we waited quite a bit. I raised my hand and said we are ready to order, which was fine. The problem started when I asked her a question. The brunch menu comes with coffee so I asked her ""Does Ice coffee come with the brunch or is it just hot coffee?"" She responded with a really annoyed tone ""I've already told you that Ice coffee is  three dollars."" Which she did not tell me. She told us that they have ""refreshing lemon aid and Ice tea for three dollars."" I told her she did not mention the Iced coffee and she didn't even say sorry. Then she goes on and said it nice and s~low, enunciating every word for me ""Lemon aid, Iced tea, and Iced coffees are three dollars ma'am."" When the food came she didn't even bother to put it in front of me. When our food came it wasn't even busy maybe five tables. I wasn't going to be picky with that. But looking at how she was attentive to the other tables was what made me realized that we are getting really different treatment. She also didn't bring out our coffees until we asked a different server. After we finished our food we just waited for her as she passed by us five times (she couldn't have missed us because we were sitting in the large table closest to the cash register & kitchen.) I was really fed up so I complained to the chef/manager and she apologized. However, at the end of her apologetic talk she said ""did you get that ma'am"" I felt so embarrassed that I brought my friends here and I told them that food is great and so is the service. But Cindy proved me wrong. Only reason why I give two stars is the good food, the service was zero.",,,

Updated review","It's been a while since I last wrote a review of Café Triskell; however, it's high time I pay tribute to the truly outstanding specials that Philippe has to offer.1. Seared foie gras over a blueberry and pomegranate reduction. This would be my ideal, last meal dish. Lightly crispy on the outside, but creamy, buttery, sweet and just delicious inside. Every savoury bite just melts in your mouth. I could eat this in the bath. It's one of life's sinful pleasures. And you'll find no better than at Café Triskell.2 Lobster, chorizo risotto - unbelievably good. The texture, fluffy, the feel creamy and the punch - just a bit spicy. The lobster cooked to perfection is accompanied by a pinch of thai chili paste that takes this meal to a whole new level. It's the missing link to what French cuisine should have always been. Chefs touting their bland, monotone cheesy excuses will only have hatred for Philippe on this one. I feel for them. Once you've tried the risotto at Triskell - you won't want it anywhere else.3. Whole grilled sardines. Nothing pleases me more than tearing into these. Briny goodness and ingeniously simple. Not a fan of fresh, mediterranean fish? For me, the oiler the better. Philippe's take - simple. They are grilled to perfection with just a hint of fresh herbs. Wash it down with a glass of pinot blanc, sancerre or a muscadet. 4. Monkfish à la provençale with Basmati rice. Maybe it's the Indian in me or rather it's Philippe's fusion of French and asian cuisine. It's simple perfect, lightly spicy, tender and succulently sweet. Who needs anything else? I sure as hell won't be asking.5.Coq au vin - yes, you heard me. A dish I'd normally avoid thinking of those sad images of soggy capon soaking in uncooked wine. Philippe's is truly homestyle genius. It's got that hint of marmalade that sends you over edge. It sits on a small bed of flat noodle pasta that soaks up the the juice.6. Bœuf bourguignon with fettucini - utterly good, douse this with a simple Malbec, and you're on your way home. If you're not a fan of beef stew, you will be converted after trying this. Just like dear old gran's stew if she were maître de cuisine at a two-star Michelin restaurant.7.Sweetbreads with black truffle. Offal and other organ meats are usually sadly ignored; however, with the rise of locavore-like restos, they appearing on almost every menu. Philippe told me that he uses the upper, less veiny gland for this number. The texture of the upper gland is softer and while taste is delicate, with a hint of bacon. Topped off with a black truffle infusion.",3,3,3

Updated review",I love this place.  Their brunch is so good.  I still love the escargot and crepes.  I love the special the chef makes.  The owners are still sweet.  It's worth checking out.  They only take cash.  If you every get a chance to go here in the spring or summer you'll love sitting out front and people watching.,,,
177,Drex H.,"Hollis, NY",155,114,48,5.0,9/10/2013,"This is a great romantic French restaurant in Astoria.  The crepes are phenomenal and come in a variety of sweet and savory flavors.The main courses are are fresh, well portioned and flavorful.  It's great for brunch, which is when I have usually gone.  Because the restaurant is so small, the service is great and they allow you to eat at a leisurely European pace.  As a result I have on more than one occasion sat and ate there for over 2 hours.The menu is small but everything on it is delicious and it changes frequently as the chef is prone to whims and will change it up at a moments notice.This is definitely a gem for any Francophile in Queens.",,,
178,Liliana O.,"ASTORIA, NY",41,26,42,5.0,2/17/2013,"This is a very small place with no more than 7 tables. The chef is from France and it owns the place for years. I find it great when you can watch the chef cooking and this place has 4 tall seats like in a bar, facing the tiny kitchen where the chef cooks. Tres magnique!!!! First thing, dont forget to bring cash. This place does not take credit card.I love how all the salads are big compared to others,  the chef does not economize it, you surely get your money worth it.The carrot ginger soup is perfect! I finished my dinner with their famous crepes. The sugar lemon is my favorite: crispy and tasty. I sometimes crave it so bad that I rush it there to pick up before the kitchen closes. I can wait to go back and try new dishes every week! I know it won't never be disappointing!:)",1,,1
179,Avery L.,"Manhattan, NY",53,5,4,5.0,5/15/2015,Wonderful place. Limited tables. Packed all the time at the weekend. Food is amazing.,,,
180,Katherine S.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",0,14,2,5.0,10/14/2013,"This was the BEST meal I've had in a very, very long time.  The frisee salad was spectacular.  And the herbed goat cheese crepe literally made me close my eyes and savor the flavor (I am sooooooo not the type).  And to add to it.....the staff are great, friendly and accommodating.  Go here.You won't regret it.",,,
181,Lara G.,"Astoria, NY",308,422,252,3.0,6/18/2012,"** 4 stars for the kitchen, 2 stars for front of the house **As with most gorgeous summer mornings, the best recipe for a perfect day invariably includes  is  brunch at a great neighborhood  place.  And ""great place"" by definition of late, seems synonymous with 4 or 5 star Yelp ratings. So, the three of us headed to Cafe Triskell.  It is a petite and charming place where the specials are written on a board by the wall.  I had a Kir Royale with my croque madame while my friends both had the Nordic eggs which consisted of smoked salmon and eggs.  When the lady who took our orders asked if I wanted the eggs, over easy, sunny side-up or well-done, I knew that i had come to a place that does not assume you want the eggs done traditionally.  My croque madame was well-seasoned with a well-done egg, the bread soft and not crunchy, just the way I like it.  My friends offered a taste of the Nordic eggs and it was also perfectly seasoned and generous with the smoked salmon. Both the croque madame and the Nordic eggs came with a respectable side salad.  For dessert, we ordered crepes with strawberry and nutella and another crepe with roasted pears.  Compared to the taste and the presentation of the brunch dishes, the crepes were not as impressive. The reason I cannot be a fan of this place and give four (4) stars to it is because of the service.  To be fair, the kitchen deserves four (4) stars while the front of the house merits two (2) stars. First, our server was insisting to sit us on a table for two when there were three of us.  Second, we repeatedly asked for plates for the dessert and were ignored.  Third, she gave us the check even if we haven't asked for it.  Fourth, and this is downright rude, she  refused to give me water and indicated that there were other people waiting for a table.   We got in at past 11 a.m., were done by 12:20 p.m. as I had a show to catch so we were not taking our own sweet time and were actually rushing. I'd love to give business to local restaurants in the neighborhood except when the staff act as if they are God's gift to humanity.  No one who acts like this should be in the restaurant business or in any business that requires a modicum of customer service.",4,2,2
182,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",779,342,81,3.0,3/23/2013,"I must say that I wasn't as impressed with this place as much as I thought I would be. From the information online and from the Yelp community, I expected a quaint, homey French brunch to enjoy with a friend. When I got there, all the tables were full. I  awkwardly stood near the doorway waiting for a hostess to at least address me, but no one really did so I had to call out to someone over customers who were dining to get somebody's attention. When I asked if I could put my name down (so that I could step outside and wait where it was less hot and uncomfortable), she said that they don't do name write-downs and just left me to continue serving. A couple seconds later three more people came in and because the waiting space is so small, they were positioned so that their conversation was going right through me. I couldn't wait outside because then they would accidentally skip me. So that was a huge strike against them.I ordered a kir breton and a mushroom/spinach crepe. The drink was good, but I found the crepe rather bland and unflavorful. It also wasn't the most elegantly presented dish I have tried. Usually when I think of brunch, I want to be wowed or impressed, but I felt neither with this meal. The buckwheat crepes taste off and the spinach wasn't as creamy as I would have liked it. My friend ordered the chicken and vegetables and goat cheese crepe which tasted okay, but again, not memorable.Perhaps if we order off the brunch menu next time we'll enjoy the meal more. I'm willing to give it another shot considering that there does seem to be a loyal following here. I knew I should have just gone for the escargot...",,,
183,Margaret S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,24,0,2.0,12/13/2014,"This place looked so warm and welcoming on a cold winter night that I had to eat there.  We arrived at around 9:00 pm and had no trouble snagging a table.  Service was solicitous. Our waiter hung our coats up for us, which was nice because space was pretty tight.  I ordered the much-vaunted French Onion soup and the frisee salad w/ lardon; hubby ordered the same soup and the vegetable crepe.  The soup looked perfect, and was rich and flavorful, but way too salty.  I finished all the water in the bottle during the meal and woke up in the middle of the night to drink more.  The frisee salad was an even bigger disappointment.  It was just a gloppy mess  drenched in a sauce that was utterly flavorless.  I ate around the (drier) edges, told the waiter that it was awful, but did not ask that it be replaced.  My husband said his crepe was nothing special, but was edible, so I upped the rating.  Otherwise, I would have given the place a single star.My experience is so at variance with the consensus, that maybe it was an off-night.  Either that or I am spoiled by all the great places in my Prospect Heights/ Crown Heights nabe, where food like this would put you out of business.",,2,

They seemed lost/confused with only a few customers to worry about and kept us waiting a long time, on one occasion forgetting us completely.The difference that we could see was that a lady (French and could be the manager) was here last time, but not on this occasion and the experience was night and day. Purely because of the service experience today we might not return, but if you catch them when the manager is there, then it's a nice experience and worth a visit for the food alone.",,,

It was one of the best I'd ever had, with just the right amount of ham & cheese, crispy bread, and a perfectly cooked egg. After finishing it, along with the small green salad and potato chips it was served with, I was chatting a bit with the chef and owner. When he realized that it was my first visit, he whipped up a simple crepe of butter and sugar for me,  just like he said he enjoyed when he was a child. It was simple, homey, yet somehow elegant. Such a nice gesture, and a welcome surprise. I like to go to Cafe Triskell on rainy days and have a frisee salad with a bowl of French Onion soup. Comfort food, French style. Love this place.",3,,1

It's nice to see the food being made: french onion soup being placed into the oven, crepes being carefully lifted and folded, etc. Those crepes looked amazing, by the way. I'm going to make a point to come back here and try them.I was wondering if Cafe Triskell was cash only, and just as I was about to stop someone to ask, I noticed the t-shirts my server and the chef were wearing: ""CASH ONLY."" Well, there's my answer!It was brunch time and it's pretty much a given that if I have brunch at a French place, my dish is going to be croque madame. I was not disappointed, as I watched a deliciously toasty sandwich get prepared, draped with melted cheese, and topped with an egg, over-easy. It came with a salad and chips, both of which were great.I had some sparkling cider to drink, which was okay--I think this is because I'm so used to the sweeter stuff, and this wasn't really like that. It wasn't bad, though.Service was tentative and pleasant. Remember how I said it's cozy? Well be sure not to come with a large group, because you just won't fit. This place is best visited in pairs.Oh, if you sit at the counter, it will be a bit warmer than the rest of the restaurant, since you're right in front of the kitchen.
