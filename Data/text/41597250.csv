0,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,4.0,11/9/2018,"This was my second visit to Oxbow, and things were definitely better this time around. The first time I visited, the service was among some of the worst I had experienced. This time around, things were much improved--not only were the food and drinks on target, but the service was pretty good as well.For appetizers, we tried the fries, which were the thin kind and reminded me of a higher-end version of McD's fries. These were crispy and tasty, and I would order them again. Another appetizer we tried was the Crispy Rock Shrimp, which was super tasty.As for entrees, three people in our group had the burger. It's expensive at over $20 ($23 to be exact), but it was quite tasty and cooked just right. One person in our group got the Coq Au Vin, which she claimed was yummy (it looked quite tasty).Note that Oxbow has a pretty good Happy Hour as well (at the bar only). Their HH features $5 draft beers, $9 cocktails, $7 wines, and some reduced price appetizers.",5,2,5
1,Sandie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",228,1097,861,4.0,10/22/2018,"My expectations were low given the other reviews, but I rather enjoyed my meal here. It's a cozy place and quieter than many other Manhattan eateries. I had the Coq a Vin which was very tasty, though if you're hungry, it's not a lot of food. It comes with a side of rice which...I don't know what was in this rice, but it was insanely delicious. I didn't really want dessert but my friends talked me into sharing the tarte tatin. It was a highlight. Absolutely delicious.",1,1,1
2,Benjamin K.,"New York, NY",13,338,459,4.0,5/21/2018,"Lovely brunch spot when the sun is out and their glass doors are open.We tried the marinated seafood salad, the pancakes, the benedict eggs with smoked salmon, and of course the excellent cheese gougères.Quality was very good, maybe a tad expensive ($23 for the eggs+smoked salmon).Kids menu available as well !",,,
3,Eli M.,"New York, NY",145,16,7,5.0,11/7/2018,Really enjoyed the food!I think the ratings are doing injustice with the restaurant.,,,
4,Daria M.,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ",3,60,1,5.0,11/12/2018,"Popped in for a drink Saturday before a dinner reservation around the corner. The hostess and manager were very warm and accommodating. They placed us at a high top, and while the bar itself was quiet full, and they were prepping for a fully booked Saturday dinner rush, they were clearly working as a team to ensure the entire bar area, were being taken care of. Their cocktail menu is very inventive, and my husband and I loved our bulleit based creations. I am not surprised they were fully booked for dinner, and am so glad we popped in for a drink!",,,
5,Amelia R.,"Manhattan, NY",20,55,150,1.0,3/9/2018,"I REALLY wanted to love this place. I live in the neighborhood, and was so excited to try this new restaurant. I came in on a Friday at around 530pm (I had made a reservation through Opentable) and my husband and I were seated right away. The menu looked promising, and I was super hungry. The waitress was attentive (although a bit too attentive) and the food arrived quickly.We ordered the Arancini ($16) and Crispy Rock Shrimp ($17) to start, along with the Mezcalita ($16) and Passion de Peche ($15) to drink. The waitress took our order right away, and it didn't take long for the food to arrive. The Arancini was okay, but nothing memorable, but the Crispy Rock Shrimp were not crispy at all. They were rather stale and tasted similarly to leftover fried food. I wouldn't say it was BAD though...but maybe I was just hungry. The Passion de Peche was a tad sour for my taste, and the Mezcalita was incredibly sweet (I couldn't finish it). I'm not a fan of super sweet drinks, so the fact that I didn't like it was probably just my taste/being picky.We ordered the Tavern Burger ($23), cooked medium for the main course. It was completely raw when it arrived and inedible. We notified the waitress, and the manager stopped by the table to apologize. He handed out his business cards if we should return. He offered to have another entree made, but we declined and decided to call it a night. We paid for our drinks and appetizers and left ($80).Perhaps I just had a bad experience, but because there are other restaurants in the area that I find of better value, we won't be returning.",9,2,2
6,Jon N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,69,0,5.0,11/13/2018,"I don't know the guy who runs it but he apparently was at Cesca when it was fantastic and at Ouest....two great west side restaurants. I've eaten at Oxbow Tavern 4 or 5 times and each time it has been excellent. Mushroom tarte, halibut, fries,....everything we've had there has been a winner.",,,
7,Fitsum K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,14,0,4.0,10/30/2018,"Server was ok, not pleasing but the food was amazing, burger was good. Cesar salad with chicken was also delish",,,
8,Nic B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,2.0,9/12/2018,"I live on the block and was excited for a new addition to the neighborhood - especially given the Tom Valenti ""brand."" The space is loud, though it has a cozy feel with a lovely bar.Too bad the food is inconsistent. On 3 separate nights, I've eaten 3 completely different portions of $34 halibut. One night I had a nice thick filet but last night it was a small, thin piece that tasted a little bit of iodine. Additionally, it's too expensive for a neighborhood joint that I would go to once a week if the price points were lower. $15 for 4 little pieces of Little Gem Lettuce? Please...it's insulting to me (though that salad is delicious). $9 sides to accompany $30+ simply grilled meats and fish? Doesn't work for me. Too bad I don't eat meat or maybe I could order the $23 hamburger (i'm serious). It's pretty busy there now...but I'd be surprised if it lasts. And it's too bad, it could be my regular corner bistro if prices came down.",1,,
9,Jake W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,113,1,5.0,9/25/2018,Had dinner at the bar last night with a friend and everything was perfectly prepared with great service from the bartender.   Coq Au Vin was amazing.      Its one of the nicest looking bar / restaurants on the UWS and so much better then the restaurant it used to be.,,,
10,Peter B.,"Chicago, IL",83,166,1149,5.0,9/9/2018,Valenti has outdone himself. He's brought together all of his classic refined dishes in a casual venue. So happy that his signature salmon gravlax dish is still present on his menu. The savory fried chicken sandwich flavor still lingers on my palate and the burger is one of the best in Manhattan. I have been quite pleased with the service and timing of course delivery to the table. Oxbow is a gem on the UWS.,,,
11,Michelle B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,1.0,5/17/2018,"Spent 40 min waiting for a panini, he finally came back and asked what I wanted with my omelette. I asked for the check and he just left, I waited 5 min from him to come back and when he didn't I walked over towards the hostess stand and he came out of the kitchen with the panini. I told him I had to leave and he said "" ok, so you want it to go""  as I didn't have time to wait. As I stood up to go get the and the manager came over and told me that the sandwich was compete.When I went back to my office and mentioned it I was told that the same happened to them the week before.The need to get there act together and expand the menu.",2,,
12,Grace S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,0,1.0,8/5/2018,"Tiny, high-priced portions of tolerable food were served to our party at brunch. Omelettes were mostly adequate and not nearly as good as those at our local diner. Food was plated in whatever way it fell onto the plate. Service was indifferent and ill-informed, with one server achieving outright grumpiness. The atmosphere in the restaurant could be described as ""The owner isn't here today."" A discouraging afternoon for neighborhood locals who were great fans of Ouest. The restaurant needs a thorough tune-up.",2,,
13,Jazz C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,112,370,4.0,4/7/2018,"As a fan of Ouest and Cesca, we had to try Oxbow. They didnt change the deco from Tellulah, the prior restaurant, which is fine since it works for what Valenti is trying to do here.  We started with the arancini. Perfectly fried with a tasty truffle sauce that doesnt overpower.  We then had the french onion soup (very good) and salmon gravlax (excellent). For mains we had the ragout of braised pork (not what we were expecting but good)  and the coq au vin (classically prepared and good). Service was good despite what I read from other reviews. Most new restaurants have to workout the kinks in service.  We are looking forward to coming back to try other dishes. Welcome back Chef Valenti!",,,1
14,Mary R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,0,3.0,6/11/2018,"We live in the neighborhood and had always been fans of Ouest, so we wanted to try it out. First time, we were told there were no tables available so we were happy to snag a high top in the bar area. Service was a bit slow, but, hey, they had just opened. I ordered the coq au vin and my husband had the burger. The coq au vin was just OK, it was swimming in sauce and a bit heavier than I would have liked, but it was OK. The burger, ordered medium rare was medium and the fries were frozen, not fresh. But, hey, they just opened.Second time was last week. Got a table in the open window on a beautiful spring day, no reservations. I ordered the panini and my husband, a burger lover, ordered the burger, medium rare and we were told by the waitress that the fries were now homemade. The panini of the day was good, though not memorable. The burger was well done and the fries were frozen. No-one came back to ask if all was alright until near the end of the meal and our waitress was not to be found. And then when she did show up, she offered to bring him something else. Too little too late. And hey, they are no longer just opened.I should mention, the white wines by the glass were pricey, limited, and in my humble opinion, not a great selection. For the price - and it's pricey for what you get - we won't be back a third time.",2,,1
15,Cono N.,"New York, NY",55,56,42,4.0,4/3/2018,Totally different venue for Valenti. Simple menu focused on bar. Oxbow burger was good a little under cooked and nothing to come back dor. Hopefully menu will expand with some favorites from Valenti's past.,,,
16,Honest R.,"Clifton, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,6/5/2018,Made reservations for 5:30 and was waiting a bit for a friend. While waiting I ordered a Bellini and some fries. It would be nice if somebody learned how to make an actually Bellini once in awhile. Some tasteless peach juice and sparkling wine is not a Bellini. I deserve at least a half decent drink for $14 and proper fries for $8. There is really nothing special about this place. My problem was though when i was asked to leave by 7:30 (may i remind you my friend was running late?) I didn't even bother to finish what I was working on. It didn't taste good anyway I just left. Will not be returning and that was just rude for food I doubt would have been great.,2,,1
17,Sophie C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,7/13/2018,"The food is decent, but the service is uneven and uninformed. The waitress brought over my glass of sparkling wine in a regular wine glass and said ""this is a new bottle of sparkling wine so I left it open to breathe and put it in this regular wine glass so that it breathes."" First, sparkling wine and champagne do not need to ""breathe"" and are not poured into a regular wine glass. Champagne and sparkling wines are poured into flutes so that the bubbles do not dissipate and the drink doesn't go flat in the glass.  And a newly uncorked champagne/sparkling wine bottle should not be left open to ""breathe,""otherwise the whole bottle is quickly rendered flat and undrinkable. I have never had to explain this to a server...ever...in any restaurant anywhere.Second, my friend and I split the check - 50% on each credit card. Pretty simple, never had a problem at any restaurant ever. The waitress billed me the full amount of the check, and my friend was billed 50%. We caught it before paying and leaving, and the waitress had it corrected. But I still got charged the full amount of the check, despite the error being ""fixed"" on the spot at the restaurant, and signing a corrected bill.I know it's an error, but it makes more work for me. I have to dispute the double charge with my credit card company, with the correct receipt as proof. It's just more work than a dinner out in the neighborhood should have to be.",,,

19,Brian R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,2.0,4/2/2018,"Here is my review of Oxbow Tavern.  I live nearby so I stopped in to see what the place would be like for a regular after-work drinks place.  Monday 4/2/18, 7:30pm.* I asked the young hostess, who was very nice, to see a drink menu. * I looked at the beer list and asked if they were bottles or on tap.* She didn't know, and just then the host (or manager) approached, a tallish guy with dark hair, well dressed, European accent.* I asked him and he said the beers on the menu were bottles, and other beers were on tap. [He did not offer to tell me the beers on tap].* I asked, ""What beers are on tap?""* He told me the tap beers.* I asked, ""What are the prices for the tap beers?"" [Yes, prices do matter to me.]* He said, ""I would have to check on the prices. They are somewhere between 7 and 10 dollars. [But made no effort to actually check on the prices.]* STOP MAKING ME PULL EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION OUT OF YOU AND OFFER OR FIND OUT THE INFORMATION INSTEAD OF MAKING ME FEEL LIKE I'M BOTHERING YOU. THAT'S WHY THE INDUSTRY IS CALLED ""HOSPITALITY.""* I guess I will find another spot for our local after work group.",10,1,2
20,Jesse S.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/27/2018,"I really hoped that this would be a great addition to the neighborhood.. So we had a reservation for 7:00pm but did not stay for dinner. When we arrived there were multiple tables for 2 available yet they wanted to seat us at a table right next to the bar when there were tables available in the same area but not as close to the bar. When we complained they offered us a table right next to the initial table while others were available. They told us these tables were reserved for others yet no reserved sign on the table.I recognize that had we walked in without a reservation we might have been limited to the poorest noisiest table in the place. But there treatment of us shows extremely poor patron consideration and courtesy. When they realized we were going to leave they mumbled something about a mistake. Too late.So, if you want to go to this restaurant and risk being treated like this be my guest. As for me I will not go back.BTW, given the owner I was shocked how they handled this.",7,,2
21,S S.,"New York, NY",35,9,0,1.0,8/8/2018,"Warning - restaurant hosts believe that they are better than its patrons - true story: we have 730 reservation - table is literally in back by kitchen in a very uncomfortable  spot - when we asked if we could move - they said ""it's at least 30 minutes"" so sorry - oh and you can have a drink because we don't know when table could be available "" disappointing to a neighbor - no remorse whatsoever -",1,,
22,Jean M.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,22,0,3.0,4/15/2018,The drinks are very good.  The food was also good (the burger and the mushroom flatbread).The reason this doesn't get more stars is that we were handed the check along with our cappucino.  Felt like we were being given the bum's rush!  It was a very quick meal.,2,,
23,Amavi D.,"New York, NY",172,74,7,1.0,3/12/2018,I have been away and someone told me to go check this place out......what a disappointment.....I walked in sat down at the bar.........there are 3 bartenders behind the bar.....I waited to be asked what I needed.....the woman to the right of me ordered....the people to the left of me asked for something...so I just wait......after a while I just got up and walked out....I was looking for a glass of wine...but if there are 3 bartenders and not one of them can ask a new customer what they want....it's just not worth it.....I don't plan on returning.......,6,1,1
24,Dimitri S.,"New York, NY",61,229,333,5.0,3/24/2018,"Went to check out Oxbow Tavern with a friend and sat at the bar. Beautiful, long bar that was pretty busy. Was greeted by the bar staff and ordered some wine. Nice selection of both white and red, as well as sparkling choices. We started with the Deviled Eggs and the Chicken Liver Mousse. Both flavorful and the portion of the mousse was really generous. Excited to have the salmon gravlax, a classic dish from Chef Tom Valenti and it took me right back to the heydays of Ouest. We also had the endive salad, well seasoned and fresh flavors, a little heavy on the dressing, but overall solid. For an entree we shared the simple grilled Double Cut Pork Chop with the creamed spinach and chickpea fries. Everything we had was well prepared , delicious and excited to see several dishes from Valenti's vast repertoire back on the UWS. Is the Sturgeon dish coming back around for another pass in the near future? Please!! The service at the bar was attentive and professional and though the restaurant was pretty crowded it wasn't too noisy. Looking forward to next time at Oxbow Tavern and further exploring the menu.",1,1,2
25,Goldie S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,9/3/2018,"We were 3 adults (~50s) looking for a good casual dinner. Met with a disappointing experience. Food was mediocre at best. For the  ""Simply grilled"" main courses you will need to add side dishes $9 each. We paid for 2 appetizers, 3 entrees + side dishes, a bottle of white wine total $240. If you wish to throw good money over bad food look no further -- this is your place.  Fortunately for us, the UWS has better (!) and cheaper restaurants.",,,
26,Constance O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,4.0,4/22/2018,"Single person, they offered a table bug decided to sit at the bar.  Very attentive bartenders.  Great drinks, had the halibut- it was delicious but just fish, all sides are extra.  Yes I'd go back and yes recommend it.",1,,
27,Deborah H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,14,0,1.0,9/2/2018,"Based on how much I liked Ouest over most of the years it was on Broadway, I expected to like this place since the owner is the same. Oxbow Tavern did not live up to expectation. It was outrageously overpriced and the food was really mediocre at best (maybe worth two stars, but given the price, rated with only one). The presentation of one of the entree dishes (quails) that one of my friends had was actually very unappetizing.  We will not be back.",,,
28,Carol C.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,9/2/2018,"Would give zero stars if possible.  Disgusting chicken sandwich...sinewy dark meat that was tasteless, greasy and inedible.  Sent it back and asked for chicken salad sandwich instead...all liquidy mayonnaise, celery and onion with very little chicken.  Not as terrible as fried chicken but inedible nonetheless.  Go anywhere else on UWS instead.",,,
29,L S.,"New York, NY",0,21,0,5.0,8/31/2018,"Great food, great service -- we missed Tom valenti on the UWS!   Super professional service -- knowledgeable, patient and unstuffy. They let us have a table even though my son was late ! None of that snooty attitude we have become inured to in nyc. The food was inventive, nicely portioned and totally worth the price.  They even saved something we left behind for us to pick up the next day.  Kudos and please stick around as we need nice places on the UWS!",,,
30,Pucci P.,"New York, NY",15,152,135,5.0,4/15/2018,Happening spot!!!    I've always loved the space when it was cafe tallulah but the food was not so great.  That has changed.  The food was excellent and the place was hopping.   Yoko Ono seated on one side of restaurant.   Lesley Stahl on the other!    The only thing missing is a raw bar.  I would love to Share a seafood plateau!!!   If you read this Oxbow....make it happen!,,,
31,Bobby T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,5.0,3/21/2018,"French Onion Soup was off the charts, burger was great.  Ate at the bar stayed longer than we planned.  Bartenders were real New Yorkers, funny.  It's like a real neighborhood, throw back kind of place.",,,1
32,F. J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,3.0,8/10/2018,"Great bar and can be great food depending on the day.  One day the crispy chicken was one of the best ever and later that week, it was just medicore.  Rinse, repeat.  Just head for some consistency and you will be solid just like Ouest was.  Great cocktails, though and what a great classic zinc bar!",,,
33,Angela R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,0,2.0,4/22/2018,"I really want to like Oxbow. As soon as I saw it change from Cafe Tallulah, I thought, ""ooh I hope I love it."" The first visit my Husband and I each ordered the seafood salad.  He loved it. I thought it was good, I wasn't in love, but it was good. We went a second time for lunch and the place was empty (it was a weekday.) I ordered the Cobb salad with the grilled chicken add on, no dressing. The bar tender to,d me chicken can't be added, I pointed out that it said on the menu it could, he said ok, then I repeated ""no dressing.""Salad arrives 20 minutes later covered in dressing. I sent it back. For the prices, I think the food should arrive as it was requested. I'm not going to waste time going back if the order can't get to the kitchen right.",,,

35,Beth W.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/6/2018,This was one of the most disappointing meals I have ever eaten on the upper west side.  I ordered the coq au vin which was described as chicken and root vegetables in wine.  It was dry chicken drowned in a dark tasteless sauce with about 3 thin slices of carrots.  I won't be back.,,,
36,Alex W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,3.0,3/18/2018,"Omelette was a ridiculous pile of steamed spinach and tiny smear of chèvre, side salad was a pile of spring mix with not even a cucumber or a tomato.
