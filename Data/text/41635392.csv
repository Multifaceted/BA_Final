Easy to eat. loved the space..connected to equinox. Reasonably priced!! I took my bowl and ate it at Petrosino Square Park. Very peaceful.,

It's the first day of weekend so you can sleep long but what is more important at same point of the day I will take a walk to Juice Generation. They will welcome me with a smile, I will order mucho mango and gluten free, vegan banana muffin and will start to walk back home. Mucho mango is so good that you just can't no drink it so as soon as I get home there will be almost nothing left. I will sit down and start working on this muffin. You just need to try.It's Thursday today - can't wait to get my weekend treats!",

I went to one of the staff members to ask them about the coconut milk and what brand they used in the drinks or I could see the package to look at the ingredients and see if it met my dietary needs. They told me they weren't allowed to tell me what it was. Really? As a customer I'm not allowed to understand what I am going to put into my body? Hmmm. That feels mighty crazy. They told me it was the policy. Ok, people should be able to know what their food is made out of. I just walked out. Not cool.",2

The storefront itself is pretty small with only a little bit of standing bar area but it's incredibly clean and very cute inside. All of the fruits and vegetables are on display and you know that the drink you're getting is made with real fresh ingredients. The staff there is always very friendly and quick to get orders out. I've never had to wait long for my drink and it's always been correct. My go-to is the Mr. Greengenes. Love the combo of banana, spinach, almond milk, and other ingredients. It's so good as is that I always opt out of adding any additional sweeteners. Definitely doesn't need it!",1

Outside of the Mucho Mango, I've never had another smoothie flavor there I'm that wowed over by but everyone has their preferences and this place has a decent size menu. Overall though, I find a lot of their smoothies to be bland and lacking in flavor. My other complaint is that I feel for a $9-$10 smoothie the cup should be full. Numerous times, the cup looks exactly like it did today, missing about an inch and I haven't even taken a sip. I think today is my last day to visit this place for awhile. There are numerous smoothie places in the UES, I'm going in search of one that gives customers the full amount they paid for.",1

I live less than a block away, so when I'm running late or need something, this is a go-to spot for me that apparently also caters to every gym, yogi, mom, nanny, student and person in the area, as it's always crazy busy. Yet, the staff is great, helpful and they're always kind. I also like the other smoothies and their cold pressed goodies to go in the fridge.",

They have a great selection of juices, smoothies, acai.. basically everything you need for a healthy breakfast.SO many good, delicious, fresh choices that they make in front of you. It was very crowded and there isn't much room, but they were able to make the juices fast. Price was appropriate with other juice places.

Today, I waited for several minutes because the woman at the cash register just stood there while another worker was taking orders. After taking several others before me, I just had to complain and walk out. My previous time at this location, the gentleman at the cash register over charged me by several dollars extra for no reason. I didn't realize until I made it home that this error had happen. Juice vitality, pure green and liquiteria all blow juice generation out of the water. They are also priced lower and have fantastic customer service. They also do not screw up my orders. Ask yourself, why am I paying $14 (the price I was overcharged by) for an acai bowl that has less ingredients than any other similar juice bar? With all the new competition, this location is sure to get phased out. It's apparent that juice generation has become to big to maintain adequate quality control at all locations.",1

Only negative is that it is $12 but I guess for the quality of ingredients and a substitution for a meal, it is worth a try. The almond butter was delicious with the bananas and strawberries. The coconut shavings and hemp granola with the acai blend was amazing. The bowl had a texture of crisp from the coconut and crunch from the hemp. Textures and flavors in this bowl were everywhere and I loved it.",7
13,,8/24/2017,218,,"Queens, NY",Pooja S.,15,4.0,8,Absolutely addicted to this place but why couldn't it be cheaper?!? :( Delicious juices and smoothies and great customer service as well. My go to drink here is the Joyful Almond with almond milk and dates and I add in either spinach or kale - SOOOO DELISH!!! I could have this drink everyday all day. Not only is it good for you but it keeps the tummy full for a bit. Only down side is the cost which was $10.29 just for ONE smoothie. That's ridiculous. That's why I'll only go here when I feel like treating myself. If it was cheaper I'd be here everyday!,1
14,,6/16/2017,3,,"Arlington, VA",Johanna H.,42,2.0,88,"I had my first acai bowl during a trip to Portland and I was instantly hooked. I've been searching for a spot that will live up to that standard, but unfortunately Juice Generation fell short. The selection of available bowl options was a little slim (maybe 4 or 5 options) and only one of them looked good to me. The prices were a little steep, but I felt like it was reasonable when factoring in the adjustment for NY prices. However, when I received the bowl, I was honestly surprised at how small it was! The bowls I had eaten in Portland were HUGE and $8. They were so large I struggled to finish some of them and you were legitimately full after eating it. The bowl from juice generation were tiny in comparison and a little over $12 after tax. This bowl fit in the palm of my hand. It was probably 5 inches across and tapers a lot towards the bottom of the bowl, so all the photos pictured on yelp make you think you're getting more than you actually are.Flavor was also lacking in the bowl. The ""smoothie"" part of the bowl didn't taste that special and the toppings were pretty basic: granola, banana, blueberries, and hemp hearts. Ok flavor, tiny portion, way overpriced. I haven't tried the juice or smoothies, but if you're looking for an acai bowl spot, look elsewhere.",3
15,,7/25/2018,0,,"Flushing, NY",Mike A.,0,5.0,8,This place is amazing! I work around the area. If they had a juice generation by my house I would be there 3 times a day! Love it!,

I've tried almond butter once and didn't like it too much, but since I saw so many photos of it on yelp, I just had to try it. No regrets! It was super delicious! The almond butter made the bowl so creamy and thick. Just out of this world. I've had my fair share of acai bowls back home in SF, but this is the best one I've had thus far.",

20,,5/15/2018,3,,"San Francisco, CA",Maile K.,2,3.0,21,"Pretty typical juice generation chain store. I love their acai bowls compared to some other places nearby.**Two notes about this location to keep in mind:1) they're often out of regular plant protein. I've never had an issue at other locations, yet this has happened multiple times only here.2) they offer whey protein, but you have to ask for it. I got a flavored substitute since they ran out of their regular plant protein powder, and it was disgusting. When I inquired on if they really only had vanilla or chocolate powder, another worker mentioned they carry whey protein. I asked why I wasn't offered that, and he said because they primarily offer vegan-friendly items, they don't mention it to avoid giving an animal product out. You have to ASK for it yourself. So just FYI for your non-vegetarians out there!",
21,,12/20/2017,0,,"Miami, FL",Danny P.,1,1.0,6,I give you One Star because you have a great product and we love the Açai bowl. I wish I could give you more but as a long time consumer I feel as though you are not for the customer and your policies are not consumer friendly. You don't take orders over the phone. That would save time for people who need to get to work on time. You don't deliver (why)? You don't take a $100 bill even though our receipt is over $50 every time. Employees including management are trained to say it's just the way it is. Not a great culture move.Juice press just moved much closer to me I will give them a try. As a consumer making life a bit easier helps more than you know. It takes a life time to gain a customer it takes seconds to lose them.Sorry that this doesn't work for us.,

They don't even scoop out all the acai blend from the blender. It fills up a little less that 3/4 of the bowl. Service is friendly but kind of slow. Would go occasionally but wouldn't say it's my go-to.",
23,,5/14/2018,0,,"Flushing, NY",Fabrice G.,2,5.0,4,Clean place. Friendly staff. The quality of the smoothies are awesome. Why settle for a sugar filled frappucino when you can have something that is nourishing and tastes just as good?,

25,1,6/23/2016,18,1,"Manhattan, NY",Florence K.,192,5.0,80,"My go-to spot for juice, everyday.Joyful Almond- My favorite. I get this almost everyday. Do not need sweetener since it is already slightly sweet. Get it with almond milk OR hemp milk. So so so good, I can drink this every waking minute of every day.Coco acai smoothie- My second fav. Perfect blend of banana, coconut, acai.Cashew Butter Baby- My third. Maybe its bc I really love nut butters. Fruits and cashew butter. Sounds odd, but works well.Peanut butter split- This is definitely a dessert drink. I tried this with almond milk and no sweetener however it was STILL VERY intoxicatingly sweet. The sweet level is equivalent to a peanut butter milkshake that you would get at shake shack. Way too sweet, does not feel healthy at all.Daily Detox- A lot of ginger. A real wake-me up. I feel like I get my week's worth of beta carotene just looking at the drink. Green Guardian- So so good. Esp for a green smoothie. I add a little bit of agave and its perfect. The taste is milder bc of the avocado. I love all the seeds that are mixed in!Mr. Greengenes- For those who want a ""healthy, green smoothie"" but usually opt for sweeter smoothies. The fruitier, sweeter green smoothie. Also good (dont add sweetener, its already a bit sweet) but I prefer the green guardian.Almond Butter Bliss acai bowl- Never tried an acai bowl before this. It is what they say it is- purely amazing. Makes you full, you can either have it for breakfast (or lunch or dinner). Its like a coco acai smoothie topped with coconut shavings, strawberry, bananas, almond butter. If you try this, you will have a glimpse of what Coco Acai smoothie tastes like (bottom of bowl)I LOVE JUICE GEN!!",4

Pop in!Every time I walk through their doors, I feel refreshed and already healthy. Mind you, I didn't even order anything yet (I think the produce in the back might have something to do with it!). My friend introduced me to Hail to Kale and now I'm hooked! I get it every time I'm here! After drinking it, you will be hailing to kale for sure. I have recently been into their acai bowls. I have tried their aloha one and the xo coco ones! They're both so good! Aloha is definitely more fruity than xo coco, which is more sweeter. Their items are pricey, I give you that. But you know what, treat yo'self.",5
27,1,2/22/2016,485,,"Brooklyn, NY",Malcolm R.,219,5.0,165,"Massive fan of this place - they serve larger smoothies than other juice/smoothie shops for around the same price. Juices are all great, though there's not really much difference in juices between this place / Juice Press / Liquiteria, I think.Bowls are a bit expensive for what they are - yogurt, granola, seeds, and fruit, but tasty nonetheless.",2

It was 10pm before...I would rush there from the gym and sometimes they would close before I got there.Smoothies: Joyful Almond is absolutely sinful...cacao nibs, almond milk, coconut icecream...mmmmm. It leaves you full. The multi-V squeeze with Hemp protein gives me energy after a workout.Green Juice: Hale to Kale all the way. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of watermelon, but this drink is refreshing.Shots: Have them all when you need a little immunity boost: They have things in them like tumeric, oregano oil...lemon, orange, etc, I swear by oregano oil...Prepared Foods: Their kale with avocado salad with lemon dressing and raisins is excellent. I usually split it over two lunches it's so big. They have other interesting dishes too like Maki rolls and enchiladas. All good. Everything is raw so it may take you awhile to chew :)The prices could be a little cheaper, but overall this place is a great addition to the neighborhood.",2

30,,12/13/2017,113,,"New York, NY",Lisa X.,213,2.0,53,I've been going to this jg location for years. I always looked forward to ordering smoothies and acai bowls from juice generation. I just had a acai bowl that was not worth it at all. I had the aloh acai bowl. The pineapples were not ripe at all and tasted like it was soaked in sugar water. The granola was stale! Extremely dissatisfied since jg prides itself on all organic produce and the hefty price tag. So make sure to taste your order before you leave the store before you waste your money.,
31,,8/1/2017,0,,"Nutley, NJ",Megan C.,0,4.0,5,Love coming here for a quick acai bowl or smoothie. It is a bit small so during prime hours it can be a little cramped but the staff are always super friendly and quick with the orders. Its not a sit down place its more of a grab and go! Love it!,

Juice Generation tops out the list (with the exception of the bargain Hawa), and this location is the greatest. Incredibly friendly and efficient staff, happy that this JG is my home base! Their peanut butter banana split and protein buzz are my personal favorites, in addition their juice/herb shots are pretty solid. While about a buck or so overpriced they have nice selection of immunity, recovery, and general health boosters that are super fresh. They also sell a lot of their products to-go/pre-packaged in the fridge when you walk in (good if you're in a rush and only need juices or salads). Glad to say that Juice Generation has yet to disappoint and I look forward to continually spending my pretty pennies when I'm in the mood for a health splurge.",2

I pass by Juice Generation daily on my way to the subway, so I figured I would give it a try and oh, am I so, so, so glad I did. Forget Juice Press, it's all about Juice Generation (well, not entirely, I'll still have a soft spot for the sin-o-bun's.)I had the Joyful Almond and it was absolutely delicious, and slightly resembled Juice Press's Black Label, which is why I got it (I love Black Label.) I actually liked it better than Black Label and it was way more filling. Next I want to try the Peanut Butter Split because that seems to be a pretty popular one. Also, they filled it to the brim -- I read a few reviews that they can rip you off and not fill the cup all the way, but this was definitely not the case.The staff was awesome -- friendly and efficient. I went in the morning and it was kind of like a juice bar version of Starbucks -- crowded with everyone waiting for drinks -- but the staff was (visibly) working so hard and there was hardly any wait time.See you tomorrow morning, Juice Generation!Side note: I also can't wait to try the snacks/foods!",4

As for Acai Bowls, my favorite is technically the Almond Butter Bliss but I think the best way to go is order the Amazing Green with Almond Butter on top.If you go to Juice Generation's site you can see the smoothies and acai bowls are both pretty high in sugar but I think people know this when they order Juice Generation. To be honest, I view the almond butter acai bowl as a kind of guilty pleasure. The cold pressed juices, however, do make me feel as if I am doing something good for my body.This place is almost always packed and is pretty small but the guys working here are nice and you can tell they really are trying to do their best to keep up.

It was super hot out, so I was in the mood for some kind of cold beverage or dessert. I'd remembered Juice Generation because one of my friends is a big fan of them, so I did a quick search to see if there were any locations near where I was. This one was just a couple of minutes away, so I dropped by.I had the watermelon smoothie, which is watermelon, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. They asked me what kind of sweetener I wanted, which I decided to go without, because I figured that the fruit would be sweet enough. It wasn't - the taste of the smoothie was kind of neither here nor there, which I was really disappointed by. This isn't Juice Generation's fault per se, but watermelon is pretty sweet on its own, y'know? And when it's blended, it should have about the same flavor. So I don't know if it's because the fruit they were using wasn't ripe, or because you really need the extra sweetener to make it taste good, or what. Either way, it was underwhelming, especially with a $7 price tag.Ugh... I don't know, guys. $7 for fruit in a blender. I just don't get it.",1

Other than the sweetness and extreme banana flavor (the acai base is blended with banana and banana was one of the toppings), which were both choices I made, this was still a poor excuse for an acai bowl. If you want a watery smoothie, or if you want a cold banana soup that feels like you were last in line at the family potluck & your brother took all of the toppings, or if you want to be hungry and dizzy after you eat your supposedly filling lunch, then by all means, get this bowl!

111,,8/27/2012,2,,"New York, NY",Trace M.,0,3.0,62,Overpriced. Cheaper and better to make at home.,

114,,11/11/2012,0,,"Diamond Bar, CA",Tiana V.,0,4.0,1,"I've tried their smoothies several times now, and I've been happy with the quality each time. The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 stars is because some other reviews say that all their ingredients are frozen? I guess I never noticed or paid attention. I appreciate the way the guys who work here actually laugh and talk to each other. I feel weird about getting food from someone who seems like they detest their job...but the guys at Juice Generation actually seem to be enjoying themselves.",

116,,5/5/2014,0,,"East Bronx, NY",S M.,0,1.0,1,I don't know if it's just me but I started getting smoothies here a year ago and I always used to get the multi-v smoothie. It was 24oz for about $8. I stopped going for a few months and when I went back I ordered the same exact smoothie and the cup was a lot smaller even though they claim it is still 24oz and charging the same price. That seems a little strange to me and dishonest.,

118,2,11/13/2012,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Dru K.,0,1.0,5,The food is ok but the service was terrible. I wanted to pick up a quick meal and needed to bring my bicycle inside. But the manager says no can't help me cause I got a bike but mean while there are two ladies with baby carriages in the store getting served so I asked why I'm being discriminated against. It seems to be that carriages would bring in just as much dirt or take up as much room so why do they hate us.  Any way that's why I give them a poor grade.,1
