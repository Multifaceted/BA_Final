0,Kiara D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",221,98,402,5.0,6/7/2018,"When someone asks me where to stop for a break in LES i have 2 recomendations, Spreadhouse is one of them!The set up of the place is absolutely incredible, the big open space makes the spot so cozy in my opinion. I went there for a business meeting with instagrammers today and they all loved it.I also go there to work sometimes since wifi is good and the place is not loud!Can't wait to go back already :)",3,,2
1,Adrián R.,"Brooklyn, NY",134,7,3,3.0,11/10/2018,"If you want a cute cafe in the LES to do work at, this probably wouldn't be your top choice.I've come here a few times already to get drinks with friends, since they have both coffee and alcohol, and my experience was enjoyable each time. It has comfortable seats, plenty of tables, and a hipster atmosphere that you'll enjoy. However, their menu is a bit overpriced ($10 for 6oz of wine!) so I definitely would never get more than one drink here at a time, the music could be better (2000s pop anyone?), and the lighting is fluorescent enough to give me a headache. I wouldn't automatically cross this off your list of cafe's to visit but I would look into some other places before deciding to come here first.",2,,
2,Davis T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",192,48,12,4.0,9/22/2018,Spreadhouse has great seating options if you get there to grab them. Most of the tables have backless bench seating which is unfavorable if you are trying to do work for a long time. The alternative is a bunch of comfy chairs along the wall which are often taken. WiFi is fast and free.Coffee is ok. A bit pricey for what it is.,2,,
3,Eda D.,"Flushing, NY",9,9,9,2.0,8/27/2018,"This cafe is really cute, and has a large open space with tables, couches and even a swinging chair. I love the ambiance, the music isn't too loud, and it's honestly a great place to sit down and get some work done. I came recently to do just that.I ordered a smoked salmon spread, which is essentially just an open faced sandwich, and stood by the bar for my order(including a cappuccino). I ended up sitting because it took around 15 minutes(I only saw two other people order something). I don't mind the wait, since this really isn't a grab and go spot.  I won't come back though. The cappuccino and the spread were subpar and came to a whopping total of $20.  That pricing is outrageous.  There are plenty of other great cafes in the area that aren't overpriced.",,,
4,Toral V.,"New York, NY",247,73,93,5.0,11/17/2018,"hard to find space in the city that is not too small, not too loud, and not too crowded! perfect place to work on a Saturday morning in LES. Plenty of outlets, seating places (both tables, couches, even a hanging swing), and most importantly lots of yummy options to caffeinate. Enjoyed an almond milk cappuccino that ran me $5. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to knock out a few hours of work !",,,
5,Onvara A.,"Cary, NC",30,311,594,4.0,10/19/2018,"Love, love the vibe of this cafe! Had a good atmosphere for chilling or getting some light work done. I got a matcha latte and croissant here. The matcha latte was a bit too watery for my taste - I was hoping for a more creamy taste and more matcha. Beautiful latte art though! Also, my friend's strawberry ricotta was mouth-watering. It was topped with whipped strawberry rhubarb ricotta and fresh mixed berries.",,,
6,Robert H.,"Manhattan, NY",173,4,7,5.0,11/10/2018,"5/5 for finding that cafe with spots to do work, with a chill ambience. The coffee is so tasty too, and wifi isn't garbage like 99% of most cafes.",,,
7,Carrie L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",158,43,54,4.0,11/5/2018,"I absolutely love the vibes! Tribal mismatched carpets, long wooden communal tables, and a swing chair! Perfect spot for meeting up with friends or for business, as well as showing up alone! Cool little spot for getting some alone time in the big city. Whether it's getting work or studying done - the environment is truly inspiring. Love the hip hop tunes, neon lights, and tropical wallpaper. Let's not forget the coffee roasted by Joe's! These baristas know their stuff!",,,
8,Amanda G.,"New York, NY",202,90,75,4.0,9/21/2018,"I've recently been on a coffee shop tour of the LES (perks of being ~funemployed~) and I'm glad I stopped into Spreadhouse along the way! It has one of my favorite coffee shop features--a wide variety of seating. There are big comfy chairs, benches, tables, and even a chair swing thing. The free WiFi is also a plus and I loved how spacious the cafe was, I felt like I had room to sprawl with all my papers and such. The coffee wasn't bad either. I had a cappuccino. The coffee is a bit pricey compared to other places in the area but it did taste like it was pretty good quality. The only thing I wasn't a fan of at Spreadhouse was the temperature--my friend and I ended up leaving because we were so cold! I would definitely suggest bringing extra layers if you get cold easily and plan on staying for a while.",,,
9,Renee C.,"New York, NY",475,106,179,4.0,6/6/2018,"This cafe is pretty hip, cool, and good seating. I like that there is free wifi, and they have the wifi information and password on display on the tables, so you don't have to go and bother the person at the counter.It's really eclectic, kind of dimly lit, so if you wanted to come here for a cute date, this would be great. I also really like the soundtrack, it was great to hear Solange, J. Cole, SZA, et cetera. This also is a great space to just do work, have meetings, eat donuts, or eat their spreads!Yes, so I discovered it's called Spreadhouse Cafe because they have spreads on bread: of course they have guacamole because we are millennial and we sure love our avocado, but they also have ham and cheese, smoked salmon, grilled cheese, cashew butter, strawberry ricotta, and spicy tuna melt.I got the spicy tuna melt and the matcha lemonade: I really loved the matcha lemonade, and the spicy tuna melt was pretty good. It was not that spicy to me, however I'm Jamaican, so I have a different definition of spicy.Def will be coming back.",1,,
10,Kenny C.,"Milwaukee, WI",239,95,170,5.0,9/14/2018,"This is a unique and interesting place, love the atmosphere. It has a retro 60s upscale vibe, with great little treats and amazing coffee. You have to try the  vegan pumpkin loaf is the bomb, along with the cappuccino with soy OMG. l definitely will recommend this place to anyone who's in the lower east side of Manhattan.",3,,2
11,Owie N.,"San Francisco, CA",676,1442,6286,3.0,1/17/2018,"Great space, but could add more seating arrangements with all the space you have. Got myself a matcha latte which tasted typical, nothing special or out of this world. Overpriced. Definitely a hipster coffee joint. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",6,4,4
12,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4794,4.0,1/2/2018,"I'm just here for coffee!Everyone is writing how hipster Spreadhouse Cafe is, how its their favorite cafe to have a glass of wine and finger sandwiches. All that sounds just dandy!I don't want Starbuck$, all I want is a good coffee from a talented barista. Can you hook a soul brother up??I see high powered espresso machine, I ask the ladies to make me a flat white. Less milk than a latte but more than a cappuccino. Are you feeling me Yelper?My drink comes to me, man do they know their way around the espresso machine. My drink was made perfectly.I grab my coffee and jet. No sitting around the cafe, zip in and zap out.Spreadhouse Cafe? Nice job on my coffee the other day.",17,14,12
13,Helen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,438,1260,2.0,9/2/2018,"I had high hopes with the coffee, considering how long I've had bookmarked the establishment in tell yelp. The decor is retro slash grungey plus grimey. The donuts were stale and the coffee was average. I really tried liking here, but I can't spread the love when love wasn't there. What was there instead is a raggedy rug that we keep tripping over whenever we walk to and away from the register. They really need to get rid of that nasty thing, people can get hurt!",2,,
14,Janice K.,"Manhattan, NY",36,53,84,4.0,1/7/2018,"Was kind of busy in there. But layouts really nice and a variety of Seating areas to chill. Got the cashew butter spread. They have a variety. It's actually amazingly good study food. Has all the best fibre and health all packed into one. It's called the ""cashew butter"" essentially smothered in peanut butter with oats, almonds and various nuts and drizzled in honey and topped with aBananas. The toast remains crunchy and it's hell delish. Would want everyone to try at least once...but not sure if I'd pay $8 again for a slice of toast lol. . Knocked off a star for it's Price of toast but atmosphere is very nice.",1,,
15,Malcolm R.,"Brooklyn, NY",485,165,219,5.0,12/6/2017,"Absolute favorite cafe. The inside has swing chairs, couches, and tables. They sell coffee, beer, and wine... With a happy hour. There is wifi, and it stays open until around 11pm!! With people doing work essentially that entire time. I go out of my way to come here and suggest you do the same.",2,,1
16,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,5.0,11/11/2017,"Spreadhouse is technically a cafe on the Lower East Side, but it's really an extended living room for a diverse mix of creative types, students, and people equally looking to hammer away on their laptops or catch up with friends.It's not a particularly quiet atmosphere, but if you like working with a noisy background (I love it), this is a great pick. They have a truly excellent soundtrack with remixes of familiar songs. They also have good wifi considering that 20+ people are actively using it, and easily accessible plugs. The seating is a real mix; there are tables for two, bar seats, communal tables, cozy couches, floor cushions, and that Instagrammable hanging basket chair. It was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon and seats were somewhat hard to come by.Normal NYC prices on drinks; my matcha latte with almond milk was $5.50 with tax. It was good quality matcha, though a little bitter (and couldn't find any sugar set out). Nice classic design on it.I was tempted a few times by their toast menu, which ranges from your classic avocado (here, guacamole), to miso hummus, to cashew butter with banana and ""sichuan honey."" They run from $8 to $13, with most under $10, so not too bad.Though they have a few design touches that seem begged to be Instagrammed, like a t-shirt vending machine, a TV display at the entrance, and a ubiquitous pink neon sign, Spreadhouse didn't come off as pretentious to me. I really liked the crowd; it was such a mix of ages and aesthetics, with a great energy. A real gem!",6,1,2
17,Elise H.,"New York, NY",528,197,839,4.0,9/2/2017,"Spreadhouse Cafe is a comfy, cool, and calming place to study and be merry. We came here on a weekday to crank out some course material. The space is eclectic and hipster, with a pyramid of old TVs showing psychedelic displays, an old motorbike, wooden accents, and hand me down sofas lining the wall opposite the bar. The use of Wi-fi required a purchase of food or drink, thereupon which we received a code to enter their hub for an hour. The staff was friendly, and usually gave us around 3 codes for each item we bought. After 7pm, the lights danced into a mix of colored lights, turning the space into a bar (which means no hot drinks, unfortunately). The space itself is huge in comparison to most coffee joints; there are several long wooden tables and outlets available for use. They have one gender neutral bathroom. Although I didn't get anything this time around, I'm interested in seeing how their coffee and snacks are. This place is a great study space- I'd highly recommend it if you're around Chinatown looking for a place to perch.",4,4,5
18,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",75,143,82,4.0,5/16/2018,"This is definitely a unique coffee shop but be forewarned - they blast the music in this place. Other than that, the staff are all very nice and the cappuccino I had was good (just wish they had oat milk!). Come in the later hours and you can find a nice spot.",,,
19,Stephanie C.,"Queens, NY",346,90,97,5.0,3/28/2018,"Crowded on a Saturday afternoon, almost no seating available but their iced black coffee is strong and I'm all about the ambiance when it comes to cafes.Go on a weekday when there's less people, there's an awesome swing indoors and great futon-like seating. Calming lights and the bathroom has a great colored bulb. Spreadhouse is almost hidden from the outside and you wouldn't notice it as a passerby pedestrian unless you're purposely looking for a cafe.There are communal wooden tables and benches to do work and outlets but this wouldn't be my ""go-to"" cafe for remote work. Spreadhouse is more of a place to read or catch up with friends.They have that kombucha alcohol mixture and donuts, pastries, etc.",1,,
20,Gui Bin Z.,"New York, NY",60,278,8,3.0,1/22/2018,"I came to spreadhouse over the summer after my regular cafe closed. It is very picturesque. From the couch cushions to the bench seats, everything was well thought out.I ordered the matcha latte and it was ok. I didn't get much matcha flavoring, more milky than my usual. The tables are also uncomfortably small, if you plan on working with a friend you really have to sit at down different tables because the tables can not fit two laptops. I'd say it fit a laptop and a small dairy size notebook comfortably. The WiFi situation here was awful, didn't mind the set up of pay per hour but their cheapest menu item was ~$4 from what I could tell and the WiFi apps extension method didn't work, so I gave all my personal information to some app and didn't get anything from it. I also somehow ended up sitting where there was a leak in the ceiling. Told the register and they didn't seem to phased. I was expecting for them to at least put a sign on the table or a bucket so other people didn't sit there.Id come back to have a coffee date with someone but this is not a work spot.",2,1,1
21,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",192,72,4,5.0,9/27/2018,"I love the aesthetic here. I'm usually here on weekday evenings and there's usually a lot of space around then. Cool selection of drinks and food. Definitely on the pricier side, but it's nice to be able to sit in such a relaxing and spacious atmosphere in a place as cramped as Lower East Side.",,,2
22,Alicia W.,"San Francisco, CA",480,64,62,3.0,7/3/2017,"Nice place to get some work done on the weekend, but I have a couple of complaints. I wish it were brighter on the insides, and the music is a little too loud for serious studying. I haven't tried the food here, but the cappuccino is great if overpriced at 4.50. When you order at the counter, they will give you a wifi access code, but note that it only lasts for an hour.",4,,1
23,Crystal Y.,"Flushing, NY",194,428,858,4.0,3/12/2018,"Spreadhouse is hipster and chill. Most people are there by themselves on a laptop, though there are also plenty in there with friends. It was quite packed when I arrived but people do come and go. I got the hot chocolate and I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. You typical cafe but spacious, chill and good hot choco :)",,,
24,Tiffany E.,"Great Neck, NY",4,31,30,5.0,2/19/2018,This is a such a cozy spot! Rugs adorn the floor and you have various types of seating to chose from. I came in the afternoon and they had a lot of business which speaks for itself. I ended up getting jasmine tea and it had a wonderful aroma. I recommend this place if you want to chat up with friends or just come by and bring your laptop to get some work done. Great atmosphere.,,,1
25,Anna N.,"King, Canada",90,46,28,5.0,2/20/2018,"Hipster and cozy coffee shop located on the LES. This is a great place to bring your laptop, grab a caffeinated beverage, and get to work! You will see the glow of apple icons from the computers all over this place. There are plenty of outlets at this place to power up the battery. It is also a nice place to just come here to relax and catch up with friends. Plenty of seating is available. Had the cafe mocha here which was delicious and the lemon poppy seed donut from Dough Donut. There donuts are huge and can be shared, or treat yourself and eat the entire thing! They also offer happy hour, and if you check in on yelp you get a discount, win-win! After a day of work and coffee, comes beer and wine to unwind :)",,,
26,Ann S.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,193,450,4.0,11/28/2017,"If your looking to meet a friend to catch up, this is exactly the place. It is super spacious and very chillax. The decor is on point and you can talk for hour there. As for the food and drinks they have an extensive menu. Between the three of us, we had the matcha latte, the ginger saison ginger infused  farmhouse ale and the purple lemonade. The purple lemonade look super pretty but base on taste, i would pass, nothing special. I really like the ginger saison, it's a pale ale beer with a pretty strong infusion on ginger. As for food, we had the sandwiches which I enjoyed.",1,,2
27,Anna I.,"Staten Island, NY",136,83,60,4.0,9/22/2017,"I love this place! I've been a couple of times now, both to work and for an event. The staff is lovely and the space is super cool (mood lighting and different seating arrangements to suit any type of worker/group). This is among the best coffeeshops in my mind because you can get coffee OR alcohol depending on your mood (or what you're working on, I guess).The drinks here are delicious and the beers offered are awesome (right now they have a pumpkin beer for fall and I highly recommend if it's your thing -- it's definitely mine). I tried one of their sandwiches (egg and chorizo) and it wasn't the best ever, but it hit the spot. There are a couple drawbacks to Spreadhouse: the drinks are pretty expensive (there's happy hour for alcohol, though) and the WiFi password on your receipt is only good for an hour. Despite this, I love Spreadhouse and will continue to come! I know it's hard out here for independent businesses so I can forgive the price of drinks and thus the price of WiFi.If you need a space for your event, need a place for your study group OR need to get some work done by yourself and want a great atmosphere (and great coffee/beer) to get you through, I highly recommend setting up shop at Spreadhouse.",3,,
28,Jennifer G.,"Long Island, NY",153,4,0,4.0,9/20/2018,Cool location did not have 2 of the 3 things i requested. Other wise a nice spot to meet up or get work done.,,,
29,Victoria W.,"New York, NY",498,51,28,4.0,3/15/2018,"Probably the most hipster and bohemian vibing cafe that I have been to in the LES. Great place to get some work done, relax, or chill with your friends. It's all about the vibe of the cafe that really gets my creative juices flowing, and Spreadhouse managed to achieve that. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since they have a time limit on your wifi so you have to constantly go up to the barista for a new code which really disrupts my workflow sometimes. Other than that, great place!",2,,
30,Vi N.,"Austin, TX",0,4,0,5.0,4/15/2018,I just finished eating lunch at a nearby restaurant but had to get some work done. I grabbed a quick snack (banana walnut loaf-not the best but not terrible either) just so I could stay here a bit. I'm extremely picky about cafes that I work out of and one of the biggest things is ambience and the types of chairs. Spreadhouse Cafe is chair heaven for me! There's tons of sofa chairs lined up against the wall and separated out in a way that it's comfortable for individuals with their own personal space and tables but also efficient in that a lot of people can sit everywhere. If only Austin would pick up on this.,1,,
31,Pradyumna K.,"Fullerton, CA",63,15,0,5.0,8/31/2018,Incredible decor... Very comfy and relaxing. The staff is super nice too! I sat here for hours until my flight and they kept the coffee coming :D,,,
32,Jonathan A.,"New York, NY",142,283,113,4.0,2/20/2018,"I'm literally at Spreadhouse right now writing this. Its a great place but I'm going to make it short and sweet and manage your expectations. The space has super cute hipster bohemian vibe. Woodwork everywhere mixed with throw rugs and geo-inspired painted walls and V.A. display in front. Coffee tea is the same like every coffee shop. Definitely a good space to come and get some work done. Outlets everywhere. Spacious seating, benches etc. Staff is meh. But I guess I would be too when everyone just comes here to buy a coffee and be on their laptop forever. Overall a call place, to grab a coffee and chill.",2,,1
33,Ann V.,"Brooklyn, NY",496,91,2,4.0,8/8/2018,"I came here at recommendation of a friend and it has a cool vibe, is in a nice location and the coffee tastes great. I just wish their a/c worked! I met here on a date and it was so so hot and stuffy. Also, those backless stools are not comfy especially when you have little butt meat to cushion yourself. Luckily, my stool was against a wall for some relief. I would come here again, but probably not set up camp.",,,
34,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,3.0,1/11/2017,"I love the open atmosphere and the thoughtful arrangement of the seats and tables. It makes for a very comfortable studying space. They also have free wifi and a decently clean bathroom - which is all anyone needs in a study spot. I docked one star for the lack of food options. Early Saturday morning, they only had a few donuts, bagels, and muffins - nothing that really spoke to me, as I typically don't enjoy sweet breakfasts. They do serve 'spreads', which is basically some type of toast with toppings (avocado toast, anyone?), but I wasn't sure how they were prepared and no one else seemed to be ordering them, so I passed. I ended up ordering a latte, which cost a hefty $5, a little bit pricier than other places in the city. It was nice and strong though, and the whole milk kept me full even without breakfast in my belly. I can imagine that this place gets very crowded on weekends, but I'm glad I missed the weekend rush by getting in and out before noon. I had my choice of seats, and plenty of space to spread out while I studied. I will definitely be recommending this cafe to other friends and will be back to visit when I am in the area!EDIT: Sorry, gotta downgrade to 3.5 stars. I just received some spam email from them courtesy of Square, which I really do not appreciate. I have also never received such emails from any other business that uses Square. I don't like that my personal information was used without my consent, especially for promotional services. Delete.",6,4,5
35,Alida C.,"Purcellville, VA",109,26,25,4.0,9/17/2017,"Love this coffeehouse haven. Exactly the kind of coffee shop you'd expect to walk into on the LES. Coffee by day, drinks by night, this place is perfect to hang with any type of friend at any time of day (and to hang with yourself, too.) 2 things that made me a little less happy - no decaf, and no hot drinks after (I think?) 8 pm. A coffee shop that's open late should serve at least regular hot coffee, or be able to make an espresso. But hey what do I know. Overall great spot and even though I have some minor complaints I will still return again and again.",,,1
36,Ashley S.,"Chicago, IL",743,149,10,4.0,4/3/2018,"I freakin' love this space! There's mild chitter chatter throughout the afternoon and is a great place to do group work or catch up with a cutie. There are a lot of seats and tables and it's just a chill environment to get some work done. I got a matcha latte and a choco cookie. The cookie was sooo gooey and chewey. It was a beautiful experience. The matcha latte thoooooo... it was flavorless and just green more than anything. Definitely wouldn't get it again given its price. There was also no sugar so I didn't know how to continue my day without my sweetness. Overall, love the vibe and love the people.",,,
37,Nati Y.,"New York, NY",0,44,4,5.0,3/17/2018,"Spreadhouse Cafe is the ultimate coffeehouse! They serve wine and beer which is a plus! It has a unique setup with wood chairs and benches. The hipster vibe is welcoming and allows students to study without a noisy atmosphere. At Spreadhouse, you'll see students studying as well as people on coffee dates. If you're looking for a new late night place to study at, look no further Spreadhouse is here! The quality of coffee is fresh brewed and strong! I'd definitely recommend this place.",,,
38,Steph Z.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",128,20,10,5.0,3/5/2018,Such a cute place!

39,Tony P.,"Union City, NJ",35,24,36,1.0,7/26/2018,"I've been coming here for a number of weeks with my crew, and some items (the tea) seem over-priced. But hey, New York. The more pressing problem is the utter rudeness of most of the staff. In the latest incident, they threw us out claiming we hadn't purchased anything when several of us had. When this was pointed out, the staff did not care and said it was management's rule. If they are so inhospitable to customers, we'll take our business to Starbucks.",,,
40,Misha T.,"San Francisco, CA",642,4075,105,5.0,7/11/2017,"As far as layout goes, this might be the platonic ideal of a coffee shop for me. Spreadhouse is huge and has a variety of tables, couches, and futon-y things allowing one to do laptop work stuff at the tables and pleasure reading on other bits. There's a little ergonomical tyranny to the work-space-cum-coffee-shop thing that's going around in that they're kind of terrible places to relax and read. Spreadhouse doesn't need to split the baby because it's big enough for twins.Oh, and I guess my matcha latte was good too.",1,,1
41,Victoria L.,"Bayside, NY",115,103,294,1.0,6/20/2018,"This place has gotten so lame. I used to come here frequently but started noticing over the years how crappy their policies have gotten. First it started with putting limits on the number of hours you could use their wifi. And then today, I came by to get a couple of hours of work done to find that they were closed for what appeared to be a private event. The girl at the door didn't even bother explaining why, she just said it was closed even though I saw a bunch of people inside. Thanks! Wish I had known that before I trekked 25 minutes out of my way to the edge of the city. Taking this place out of my rotation, I don't care how cute the place is. I ended up walking a bit more until I came across Project Cozy. Try that place out. Way more hospitable with the wifi, and nicer staff.",1,,

47,Emily V.,"New York, NY",211,88,29,3.0,3/28/2018,"Honestly was a little disappointed with this place! Maybe I had my expectations too high but it felt a bit too hostel/transient for me.  The space is hard to describe, while it's bohemian, it's also very standard with clusters of cafe tables in teh back and soft chairs in the front. The food/coffee was average, nothing I would return for. I was looking for a creative space to write at and unfortunately didn't feel like I found it here.",,,

It seems like all my go to cafes are jam packed by noon. I decided to check out Spreadhouse and was so happy when I walked in around 11AM. I must've been one of the first few there, by 1PM the cafe started filling up but nowhere near as packed as some of these other places in the city.Good music, nice people, chill ambience.",1,2,1
49,Michelle X.,"New York, NY",407,150,741,4.0,5/14/2017,"I love the decor in this cafe. Their menu contains caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and light noshes. I love that I can have a glass of wine and avocado toast while studying here. There are couches, cushions, chairs, and carpet for customers to sit on. It is relatively quiet in this cafe and you will find a lot of folks working off of their laptops here. One of the downsides is that their wifi is only for 1 hour, but you can extend it through an app or make another purpose.The staff is friendly and more than helpful when I had issues with accessing WIFI on my laptop. I look forward to coming back here, whether I am working or looking for a calm place to destress and run away from the chaos outside.",1,1,2
50,Anthony A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",218,4,0,4.0,7/30/2018,Really chill space to work and get coffee. The food is what you'd expect from a coffee house. It was a tad on the pricier side but worth it for the atmosphere.,,,

52,Bony M.,"New York, NY",178,57,55,4.0,7/16/2017,"a great location. Coffee definitely tastes amazing... right amount of bitterness and flavor. First time here, i can see why this place have good reviews. I could spend most of the day here working! try their Chocolate Cookie along with black coffee. Somehow they taste amazing together. there's plenty of room to sit down here, not congested like some of the other coffee shops in the area. Around 7 PM mood here changes to more of a bar theme. How did I know that? I just got here 20-30 mins ago and the mood changed. I don't mind it honestly. Only Con, Wifi requires an access code per hour. You have to get a new code every hour but it's not a big deal. Barista's here are super nice and they give out plenty of codes. Worth checking out guys!",,,
53,Kathryn S.,"New York, NY",150,98,98,3.0,12/30/2017,"Cool vibe and decor but slow and disinterested staff. They weren't outright rude, but for example seemed very annoyed when I tried to ask pretty simple questions (where is the sugar, etc). Be prepared to wait about 20 minutes for your coffee to be prepared. I've not tried the 'spreads' here, but they seem decent.",,,
54,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,5.0,4/6/2017,"Such an unexpectedly fantastic place that I hope doesn't get TOO famous. My best friend and I wanted a nightcap and possibly dessert after dinner at SOY a few doors down but the ridiculously miserable weather saw us taking a few steps out the door and then ducking into Spreadhouse. And lucky we did, because boy oh boy, what a spacious cafe. I've come to realize how much like shoeboxes NYC cafes resemble, with barely enough space to stand and hoover down your drink. Then there are the cafes where the quiet is so overbearing that any random noise provokes a glare or it gets so loud that you can't do any work or solo reading. To me, the best cafe offers all those choices. As soon as you walk into Spreadhouse, you'll see seats and cushions along the wall and then a beautiful wood communal table and smaller tables in the back. We came there in the evening so I can't speak to the morning coffee drinks. Wine snobs will sniff at how they serve the wine in water glasses instead of wine glasses but I liked how refreshing and casual it all was. My friend got some kind of rose/cider hybrid that was pretty good but the best thing was the chocolate chip cookie - sweet and chewy with a crunchy perimeter. It may or may not have been vegan but I've never let that stop me before in demolishing cookies. I then proceeded to spend the rest of the night wondering aloud to my friend as to whether I should or should not get another cookie. Yes. I am That Person. Anyway, we popped into the cafe on the best night of all - BINGO NITE. And guess who took home the prize for the first round? They originally offered a bucket of five Miller Lite bottles but kindly swapped it out for a bottle of champagne because, horror of all horrors, I don't like beer. Drink prize selection notwithstanding, I love when places throw together interactive events like these. I would come here just for the bingo nights alone. The MC was very funny and because the weather was so piss poor outside, the space was relatively empty. 10/10, would come back again!",5,3,4
55,Kristen T.,"Queens, NY",72,248,752,4.0,9/28/2016,"Although they do not have a great variety of espresso drinks but more alcohol drinks, they have big table space for working on and lots of couches to chill out. There's even a tiny house in the back which I still am not sure what it's for. However, this place captures the essence of the hipster LES scene- very artsy. I find that coming here later at night when it's alcohol served only is the best time to bring in the laptops and work. Coffee is good. Not much to say about that. They also serve Dough doughnuts and a variety of cookies. They take card, no min, and have kombucha tea in a bottle. It can get noisey depending on the music they play that day/night or the crowd can get annoying. Sometimes it's the same people busy on their macs doing their thing. If you're going to sit in the big table, either charge up your laptop or bring a extension cord.",2,,
56,Kyle R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,2.0,5/31/2018,"I came here to get work done. I want to love it here because the space is awesome. The coffee is kinda meh, which would be OK if it's just the price of entry to lay around on their couches or the swing chair. But, my god, the music? I was crawling out of my skin. It's 2018 and they are un-ironically playing Party Rock Anthem, TiK ToK, California Gurls...I could go on. It's like they're a club specializing in music that's not quite old enough to be a throwback and not new enough to make any sense. And the worst part is that the volume fluctuated basically every song. My guess is that someone heard ""their song!"" and blasted it to be cute, then jammed the volume back down when the song ended. The stuffy, sweltering heat of the LES in summertime never felt so crisp on my skin as I walked the fuck out of here.",,1,
57,Jenny N.,"Flushing, NY",7,24,59,1.0,6/27/2017,"WiFi is limited to an hour and didn't even work. They give you a temporary password on your receipt. We showed up around 6pm or 7pm, and they didn't have any cafe beverages to offer us except for iced coffee. The cashier claimed the barista went home for the day. How hard is it to make a hot chocolate, anyway?A tiny glass bottle of vanilla cream soda, a plastic cup of iced coffee, and a can of sparkling alcohol came out to $15.You're basically paying for the ambiance cause there's nothing else worthwhile about this place. You'd be better off at Starbucks.",,,
58,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,6/11/2016,"Came here was really by accident as my original scheduled place was closed...but this was indeed a sweet surprise! Entering into the coffee shop was more like going into a forest, where everything was wood-made and retained its wild nature. Sipping cappuccino inside was more like having a short journey away from Manhattan, something I was always looking for during the weekend.If you are a big fan of dark and strong coffee, spreadhouse might not be your first choice, as the taste was a bit tilted towards light and balanced. But if you are looking for some place for a short break, or prefer to spend sometime alone, definitely drop by and enjoy a cup!",11,6,12
59,Kate S.,"New York, NY",580,277,370,5.0,8/17/2016,"I absolutely love spreadhouse.I like to come here to get work done, bask in their AC, and drink lots and lots of coffee. It's a huge space, especially for LES- a ton of space to sit and chill. It's a great atmosphere too, an organic feel. They sometimes have hanging chairs, which is absolutely adorable. As for food and drinks, they have a wide variety. Drinks, I usually like to get their drip coffee or their matcha lattes. Their matcha lattes are amazingggg. Food, they have baked goods and even salad jars/spreads. I have yet to tried their spreads or salads, only because it came off pricey for what you got. They even have wine and beer! Free wifi, great space, cool vibes- a definite winner in my book. My only remark is that I wish they had a wider variety of food.",1,,2
60,Canny F.,"Knoxville, TN",666,1589,7123,4.0,7/8/2016,"Expensive and not worth it for food and drinks. I had a hot matcha and tried the cold matcha off my friend and tried her salad too. We've had better but this cafe isn't for food. It's for the seating area. It's so pretty! You can't find a cafe like this in the city. There are communal tables as well as individual tables and even seats all along the wall with cushions! There are outlets along the walls. It's a great place to meet up with friends or go on a date (I saw a first date in action here!). It's also dim but I saw a lot of people working on their laptops.FYI: if you ask for your drink to not be sweetened, they will give you a bottle of syrup. We thought it was something for our salad and almost added it! Luckily the bartender/waitress came to our table to get it back.",3,,

I know everyone else is down on the wifi only being free for an hour, but I actually love that. It's enough time to do anything time sensitive and play around before really getting down to work without the whole internet as a distraction. Very helpful for me when it comes to writing. It's a pretty large space, and when i was there on a Thursday afternoon I had no trouble finding a table, I'm sure it gets crowded at peak times, but with my work schedule, I'm rarely anywhere at peak times. There were outlets and a good music selection. The barista was friendly and the iced coffee I got was fantastic! All in all I've had a great time here and will absolutely be returning!",1,,1

I came across this place and we decided to check it out. The ambience is great in here. It was dark and everyone was just hanging out and chatting. My friend and I split a Dulce de Leche donut because we were all still full from dinner and the donuts are so big. It was so good! I'm sure people don't come here just for the donuts, but they should because it was delicious. I think the highlight here, though, is the incredibly chill atmosphere, and they were playing really good music. Plus, the bathroom is really cool and good lighting.

Spreadhouse Cafe was the perfect choice for a cozy cafe that has wifi and spacious seating to post up your laptop. I went on a Sunday evening, it was neither crowded nor busy. They have a wide selection of wines, beers, coffee drinks, and foods-- keep in mind they stop serving hot drinks, like coffee, at night (not sure of the exact time so you may want to double check). The baristas were super friendly and the music was perf. The biggest drawback is probably the hour limit on wifi, but they did tell me that they're planning on extending that to  1.5 hours.

The workers are very friendly too, what a plus!On my first visit here, I got their passion fruit doughnut. It is byfar one of the best doughnuts I've had. The doughy part of the doughnut is gentle and airy with a lightly sweet and colorful coating on one side of the doughnut. There were also these small flavorful seeds that added an excellent addition of sweetness to each bite. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!",2,2,2

I ordered the Pinot Grigio and had some chips and guac, which both were pretty good. I did notice that they did not have many food selections but it's no biggie- I was relaxing on the cool floor cushions (big plus) so I didn't want anything heavy to eat.

Spreadhouse is so cute and trendy! But unlike most other cafes in NYC, it's not overcrowded and noisy. The space is big enough for you to feel comfortable, and quiet enough for you to bring your laptop or a book and get some studying/work done. There's free wifi, printing, lots of seating space, and electric outlets! The coffee is also superb. I had a cappucino with almond milk, and it was the perfect drinking temperature & had the perfect boldness/richness that all espresso beverages should have. I complemented my coffee with a lemon&poppyseed doughnut from Dough (they offer many different varieties of Dough doughnuts). Overall, the atmosphere is very nice and the coffee is great! I only give it 4 stars because the AC was on full blast and mosquitos were flying around me... But I guess that's just inevitable during summer in NYC.",1,,

I still love this place!They have GREAT coffee, and also BEER on tap. What??? Yeah you read right. Beer + coffee + baked goods. What more could you ask for?

This place is like a haven for all the ""work at home"" people that don't actually wanna work at home. The interior is really well done with a calm/ fun vibe throughout the space. Good lighting, plenty of open space, variety of seating options (they took down the swing seats though). Neither professional nor chaotic. Very clean all around. The barista who is also the sandwich maker and cashier is pretty good and actually knows what the menu items taste like. She suggested a cold chai latte with a cashew butter bread slice (as they apparently go great together, and they do).The chai latte had a really nice flavor to it and a silky smooth texture. Perfect coffee to milk ratio with about a quarter of the cup being ice. Has a nice undertone to it I couldn't figure out (very enjoyable). The cashew butter bread comes topped with honey and slices of what I assume to be cashew. The bread itself is a warmed up multigrain loaf slice. Good thickness (less than French toast more that toaster bread). Great flavor and slight crunch. The butter was what you expect but the honey really added an extra layer of depth to it. The cashew? Slices where cute and did help bring it all together. Really a good snack with what seems to be nothing to add on to make it better. The whole experience was awesome. For the cup of milk and ice and a piece of bread with cashews on it the total rang up to 12$. Steep for what I got, yes. But when you factor in the great staff, space and the fact it's absolutely delicious. It's worth it. Casual date spot, good for coffee with a friend or a long talk. Can totally do work here on a laptop (wifi is free). More of a sit down than a take out.",,,

We walked in and was disappointed because it wasn't there but that's okay because it looked really chill and cozy.The girl at the cashier was nice! The drinks here are overpriced and not that great. But I guess no one really comes here for the drinks right? It's just a place to kill time or to study or do work. My friend got the iced matcha. It was pretty bad. I didn't try it but we do have high expectations. Maybe it's because we're Asian and we know what good matcha is LOLI got the iced tea. It was unsweetened and I had no clue what tea it was. It was a whatever tea. They were really hipster looking and Instagram worthy but it wasn't worth the price. We found a spot to sit at one of the cushion seats with a table. The cushions kept sliding off and it was uncomfortable.I love how they have a printer here! You can print stuff for 19 cents a sheet!!! The bathroom was pretty clean.

My friend and I call this place ""Vibes"" because it's simply curated to reflect the laid back, more causally trendy persona of the neighborhood. The seating is of the comfortable variety which no other shop in the vicinity has - some pieces rotate but think big arm chairs, couches, banket seating with cushions, etc. It's actually a good place to both read a book or having a small meeting, of which neither party types seem to disturb each other. Their beans are a special blend of JOE (Joe Coffee, that has locations all over NYC) and packs a punch in both the flavor and caffeination departments. I didn't sample anything off the menu but there's some pastries and toasts, as well. The staff was sort of friendly but nothing too positively or negatively memorable.

The environment here is very laid back. It's also quite spacious compared to many other coffee shops and it makes you feel comfortable to work here for hours. In addition, the friendly staff will make you feel welcome in this hidden spot. The ambiance isn't too loud, but isn't too quiet which is perfect for me. I tried the ham and cheese spread and it was way too salty for me, but the coffee was good. Overall, a very good place to study without having to worry about over crowdedness, just quite expensive.

I went with an iced latte and a passion fruit doughnut and my friends had hot coffee and tea. I thought the latte was good, coffee flavor was strong and the milk gave it a nice texture. Although I liked the doughnut, it was more bread-like in consistency than the doughnuts I prefer. This cafe is cute and you know there was a lot of thought put into the decor to make it a comfortable environment.I love how there isn't a need to use up all available space, but a couple more seats wouldn't hurt. It was our fault for missing the sign at the door, but they had to clear up the space and set up for a vegan event; I was only halfway through my doughnut, womp womp.

Coffee is expensive and wifi is given only after you make a purchase...valid for 1 hour from the time of purchase. And only one device! Will it be your phone or your laptop?! Imagine paying $6-$7 for an iced drink and only 50 minutes of wifi...until you are promoted to make another purchase.

97,Sarah T.,"Midland Beach, Staten Island, NY",209,12,1,5.0,3/26/2018,"One of my favorite cafes in the city for studying in, great coffee and decor. The wifi here here used to be limited based on each item purchased but they recently changed it so there is no limit anymore, ehich is a great move. There are a bunch of benches along the walls with comfy pillows on top of them. If you're lucky, you can snag the swinging wicker seat to sit in while you enjoy your drink. There are regular tables spread out throught the cafe but it does get very crowded and you might have to sit on the floor by their low tables. At night they have happy hour deals on their alcohol and they dim the lights, giving the cafe a different mood. This cafe is one of the few that stay open late, so if you need a place to study at night, definitely go here !",,,

I was slightly disappointed to breeze in with no swinging chair in sight. Nevertheless I decided to stay and try their coffee anyways. First off, this is a huge space with plenty of seating, from tables to benches to cozy pillows. Needless to say, there were plenty of outlets for everyone. In my earlier visits, the wifi has always been free and unlimited. However my recent visit learned that they're now offering 1 hour of free wifi with a purchase. Slight bummer since I like to do work for more than an hour, but I'm not mad either. I get their mentality. Honestly aside from the wifi, it's a perfect place to study. They're open late and do serve alcohol after hours as well.",1,1,1

This is a spacious place for multiple couches and tables for people to sit in and chill. I like the variety of drinks that they offer whether it's coffee or beer. Especially their bottle drinks, I think they're unusual and taste good (like Henry's Hard Ginger Ale). We asked the guy behind the counter if he cook heat up our chocolate fudge cookies.

It seems like the perfect place to camp out and do work, but you only get an hour of free wifi with your purchase. I realize people gotta keep their lights on, but it's kind of absurd and never full.

The downtempo, low volume chill-hop music was relaxing and not distracting. They serve cake thieves donut which look absolutely delicious especially the chocolate pretzel. I had a 16oz Ice Coffee using my Cups App. They served Joe coffee in a pint glass as my to-stay option. The cold draft ice didn't water down the taste. The coffee was light, refreshing, medium to low acid, with pleasant tang. The service was friendly and fast with the four people working there.

115,Amelia A.,"New York, NY",292,151,565,4.0,10/12/2016,"Stopped in during the morning when you would assume a coffee shop might be packed.  It's on somewhat of a side street, so perhaps not super main stream.  It's quite a large place with a great deal of openness.  The seating is interesting.  In the back there are some tables and benches, but along the sides, there are couches and floor seating.  Definitely not your corporate coffee shop, which can be nice and refreshing!  The place is also decorated with some nice tapestry type rugs; but be careful! While they do seem to have those grippy things underneath, they don't reach the borders of the rugs.  I almost tripped over the sliding bunch.Service was good in the sense that the two working at the counter were very very nice and helpful.  My only complaint is that it took a decent amount of time to get the order considering I was first in line to order, and ordered at least a couple mins ahead of the next person that came in.  I ordered an Iced Matcha with an Almond Croissant.  The matcha was fantastic.  I was very happy to see that there was more craft to it than shoveling powder into the milk, mixing, and then having chunks of the matcha everywhere.  The matcha flavor was great; not so delicate that you wonder if you're actually drinking milk with green food coloring, and not so harsh that its unpleasantly bitter.  Very on point!  The croissant was delicious as well!  Perfect little compliment and snack to start the morning.If I'm around the area again, I certainly wouldn't mind stopping in to try some other stuff ^-^",,,

They also have small bites and meals like toast and salads in jars, but I didn't try any.This is great for studying.They don't cram a bunch of tables and chairs in the space (good luck getting a seat in the afternoon) so it's very spacious. One wall is lined with cushioned seats and further down there are just cushions on the ground.

I love the way this place is designed: minimalist, but with different levels of seating: There are couches on platforms, space on these platforms where you can sit down on the floor (or on a cushion), coffee-table style seating, normal cafe-style tables and even a community table. When I was there, the music that was playing was chill hip-hop/R&B. The service was great and the chai latte I had was really good (coming from an Indian person who knows her chai). I was also impressed at how clean the bathroom was. My only complaint is that besides your normal cafe-style pastries and beverages, there aren't many food options: just a limited number of appetizers and salads. Nonetheless, this place has become my favorite place to study. It also helps that there are like a million outlets along the platform area (though they may want to install a few on or around the community table).",2,,1

It's definitely a great place to not only work, but also hang out and unwind. Even during the worst and coldest month in New York City, walking into this place makes me forget that it's even winter time. I was also enamored with the fact that they currently exclusively feature Cake Thieves Bakery's amazing vegan treats. Lauren of Cake Thieves is a sweetheart and I can't wait to try more of her baked goods - it's so hard to decide because everything looks phenomenal. The staff is enthusiastic and helpful. They offer premium oolong tea in addition to the great espresso, so there is definitely something for everyone.

The music isn't too loud and there are a lot of outlets and places for you to bang out work. Coming in the mid to late afternoon means you'll probably end up in a floor cushion as this place can get crowded. Good place to order a drink and settle down with ur laptop or a book.

Once again, our little yelp community hasn't failed us, and this place is pretty much as good as it gets!Spacious, chill, low-key, there are actual lounges areas, and comfy seating while still having larger tables to work off your laptop or sketch or whatever you need to do. Really sweet barista!I ordered a latte and their last shipment of DOUGH donuts for the day... those two together came out to $8 or so. Good prices, good music, and an overall relaxed and productive day spent here!P.S: If you are someone who needs 100% quiet serenity, I don't recommend coming here to do anything than just hang with friends. They kind of (low volume) blast classic hip hop and oldie r&b throwbacks... classic yeezy, 50 cent, Usher, but also Drake and like a random Flume mix I think too... my kind of music, but you need to be able to focus with it... your in-ear headphones might not block it out.

On a Sunday morning, there were a few people in here, but not jam packed (which I like). Soft music overhead playing was soothing and such cute seats and tables. The place is so inviting with lots of room. I just can't believe a coffee shop like this exists in Manhattan!The matcha green latte ($4.75) was well made and oh so pretty. My friend had a cup of chai. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is because they are quite limited on food options. They do have doughnuts and cookies, however, I was looking for something savory and didn't find any such thing in the display case. Super sad. Even a croissant or bagel would've made me happy. They also serve beer on tap here and at 12pm, I did hear a group ordering up beer. Wow, some people get started early.

149,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",232,101,232,4.0,12/26/2015,This cozy cafe is one of the cutest in the lower east side. My friend and I had a project to do for the day and we wanted to sit at a cafe that had the perfect atmosphere. Spread house is the perfect place for you to do work if you need. It also has two swings that plenty of people love to take pictures on and tiny pots filled with plants near the side when you enter. I tried their matcha hot drink and it was perfect. Not too sweet and plenty of matcha taste to my liking - since I'm obsessed with matcha. We stayed for hours and there were plenty of people on their MacBooks just sipping on their drinks. I'd love to come back again for their latte and perhaps try out their pastries!,1,1,1
150,Bren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,45,129,5.0,12/29/2016,"Spreadhouse is definitely the kind of place that I have been desperately looking for this whole time. I've been roaming around LES area trying out the different kinds of cafes that would be great for studying and actually provided wifi (even though it's a little slow). Spreadhouse goes one step above that and even provides printing services for a small fee of course, but the convenience alone is worth it. I wouldn't even know where to find a place to print other than school, offices, and libraries. The ambiance is very suitable for a study/work and chill hangout vibe. There's even a variety of seating options for those who need to move around and change it up with tables and chairs, cushions, couches, barstools, and benches. There's also a plethora of outlets, which is a miracle.The coffee was a little on the pricier side, but the latte art is beautiful and with one drink, my friend and I was able to plant ourselves down and get work done for a few hours. They also offer food, which I didn't get a chance to try, but it sounded delicious. Spreadhouse reflects the image that I have for a laid back work cafe, and I will definitely be coming back!",1,,
151,James N.,"Queens, NY",146,69,205,5.0,1/5/2017,"Great space to get work done. I once forgot my headphones and was going to head out, but because the music selection there was so good, we stayed. Maybe it's because we come in the early evening, but they only serve ice coffee at that time. Works for me tho, and the cookie, well let's just say we don't leave without having one.",,1,1

153,Judy W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",184,49,33,5.0,5/19/2017,"Such a unique place! There are benches, elevated seating and chairs that makes you feel like you're on a boardwalk. The lighting itself is not very bright and a majority of the natural lighting comes in through the front windows and front door. I had a flat white and a donut and both were awesome! This is a great place to do work especially with friends. Would definitely return here.",2,,

155,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",883,399,423,4.0,9/13/2015,"The ambience itself deserves a five star. I love how it looks like a warehouse on the inside. From the outside, you could easily miss this place. Generally a very casual and hip setting with lots of space to sit and work.I got a passionfruit donut, and it was good, but the passionfruit frosting was a bit sweeter than I expected, and the donut itself was a bit dryer than I would have liked. As a donut lover, I definitely find this place to be above average, but I'm not sure it beats Doughnut Plant in Chelsea or my all time favorite Union Square Doughnuts back home in Boston. I also ordered a small ice coffee. I'm someone who enjoys drinking americanos, and I thought this ice coffee + milk + sugar had a great sweetness to bitterness ratio.",4,,
156,Ozzy M.,"New York, NY",147,44,47,4.0,1/7/2017,"This spot can easily become one of your favorite spots to go to for a cup of joe. Me and my girlfriend came here to enjoy a nice cup of iced coffee and it tasted great. The atmosphere is very chilled and the seating area is available literally everywhere. You can either choose to enjoy your coffee on the benches they provide or the small couch or small blanket bed on the floor which are located on the left hand side of the back area of the shop. They also have a cool looking wooden house in the back which I'm assuming it's an office area for the owners or managers. The only reason I am giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because of the tipping system at the cash register. I decided to pay with my debit card and the girl said that I had to sign for the card which is understandable. She then turned the tablet that was facing her to face me so that I may sign and the screen was displaying tip a dollar or no tip. I really don't mind tipping especially at a bar, but in a coffee shop when you're already paying $4.00 for a iced coffee you shouldn't feel forced or guilty to tip. They do have a tipping jar in front of the register which I feel is more appropriate than the actual spinning tablet.Other than that this place is very cool to study at and enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend. Will definitely be returning back!",,,

Pretty big open space, so you don't feel cramped but don't confuse that with excess seating.The drinks took a while, so it may not be the quickest place to go if you are in a rush, but it was a good latte. Cookie was good as well, oatmeal cranberry or something. They have some booze (beer at least on tap), multi-colored lights and music. Didn't feel like the place to chill to get work done, or grab a drink with your friend(s) so not quite sure what they're going for. Don't get me wrong, they had wifi and a bunch of people with laptops but they might get sued for eye damage one of these days...Will come back to chill if I'm ever in the area.",1,,

It is quiet and there are a lot of seats and outlets for everyone to have their own (There is even an outlet on the floor, under the rug). Because this is such a popular study spot, it can get really crowded by 3 in the afternoon. I would recommend to get here earlier so you can secure a seat. Additionally, this place changes into a bar at night, which is pretty cool! I find myself always coming back here to study and do work, so I definitely recommend it to all my friends!",2,,1

170,Jane Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,58,136,5.0,5/31/2015,IN LOVE with everything about this shop! Coffee and lattes are always on point. Great space with a lot of open air and spaciousness. Friendly baristas. Short cushioned benches on the left and a communal table on the right for seating towards the back as well as swinging chairs in the front.  There isn't much more you could possibly ask for out of a coffee shop. The only thing that wasn't up to par was the vegan doughnut. Got it on a whim because of the hype around cake thieves but it was pretty dry. Disappointing. However I purchased the last one at around 3PM so the pastry may have just gone stale.I also appreciate that this place is kind of off the beaten path so it's a lot less crowded than most other shops on the LES. Ideal for popping in on a weekday to get some work done or catch up with a friend. Definitely recommend!,5,,

I was fascinated and thrilled to try this new donut choices but found out that they were not available so this review is just based on their coffee and ambient.Location: suffolk street. It looks like the store was an abandoned garage. Close to soho. The store is simple and well designed and decorated. Pretty unique I would say. and the staffs are generally nice and welcoming even though I just ordered 3 tea pots and stayed there for like two hours. Thank you!Tea & Coffee: I had their herbal tea and green tea. Nothing special. They will give your a pot and you are only allowed to refill hot water for once without extra charges. The only disappointment is due to lack of bakery choices in this place. They sold out pretty fast. So if you were there in the afternoon, there would be a 99% that they ran out of the amazing bakery (Can cake theiv just open their own store so I can buy their donuts 24/7?!)Overall: a 3.5 but I am more prone to give a 3 star due to a small selection of coffee choices and bakeries.I am sad, I am really sad.",3,,

185,Ricky T.,"New York, NY",230,152,31,3.0,6/16/2016,"This Cafe boasts an interesting and unique environment. There is open seating consisting of benches and floor cushions on one side and tables and chairs towards the back of the cafe. The coffee was okay, but the price is a bit on the higher side -- $5.25 for a small late and .$50 to add soy milk. This place is crowded though, especially during peak hours in the afternoon. People are literally stacked on top of each other. The music is also really loud where they are blasting Kanye non-stop, which is disappointing cause it takes away from the chill environment. Consequently, all these factors also make it a place NOT very conducive to studying. Moreover, the wifi seemed a bit slow due to the amount of people all connecting to the same network. I was watching 20 minute videos that kept lagging every few minutes.May be a better place to come if you are a tourist, or if you are out with friends. The prices are steep too.",1,,

Updated review","Favorite cafe in LES.  A large space with an amazing interior. Oriental rugs and modernist art. Plenty of seating and outlets.The coffee is expensive but overall it's excellent. The cappuccino is my go to, the espresso is smooth and well balanced, they also do a mean job frothing almond milk which is a rarity on the east coast. The pastries are decadent and hard to resist. Try the brownie. You won't regret it while it's decadent layers of chocolate dissolve in your mouth but afterwards is a different story..",,,

I can't wait; they do the best brunches, and now they have a real kitchen for it!Since they open at 7:30 AM, they're perfect for stopping by for coffee or tea and a muffin--or OMG donut--on the way to work; it's a cavernous, laid-back space--perfect for hanging out and chilling with your Kindle or laptop.

It's a chill atmosphere and has different places for everyones needs. If you're looking to get some solid work-time in, there is plenty of table space for that, or if you want to relax and read on one of the couches that works as well.The vegan markets on Sunday are really good to stop into and get some grub for the week, although they don't really alternate vendors week to week - so you can't go to often unless you fall in love with one of the vendors.",,,
