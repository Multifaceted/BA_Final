Updated review","We like Hampton Inns, complementary breakfast, location, and great service! Parking is not cheap but not too bad; you have to walk a couple of minutes to drop off or pick up your car! That's not the problem, traffic is a problem so we waited for garbage and busses to drive through a narrow street to be able to load our car and leave! The hotel is small, high, only eight rooms on a floor! We also didn't know that you can leave your luggage before checking in and explore the city and after you check out! Definitely recommend and would stay next time! However reserve way ahead of time!",1,,
1,Valerie P.,"Indianapolis, IN",196,162,50,3.0,11/6/2018,"A true three star experience. The room was fine, and the front desk staff was polite and attentive. However, the business center was down the entire time I was there (3 nights). There are only 2 very slow elevators, and they're often being used my the cleaning staff. The parking they suggest is a $47 self park option on the next block over. And if you use that, be sure to pay at the hotel - they didn't tell me that. The breakfast is typical for a Hampton,But it's in a tight space that is easily crowded. I opted to pass on that each morning because I couldn't even get to the food. Overall, I'd probably choose a different option next time. It'd be worth a few more dollars.",1,,
2,Whitney B.,"Yuma, AZ",53,16,1,5.0,9/28/2018,"Thought the hotel was great and in a great location, we walked to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and the 5th Ave shops. Also Walgreens and CVS close by for snacks, drinks or anything you've forgotten.They had a mix up with our room, we requested a king bed but they said they gave us an upgrade with double bed and a higher room with a view of the Empire State Building. Room was very clean, would definitely stay here again.",,,
3,Bridie S.,"Seattle, WA",54,5,0,5.0,4/17/2018,"After a bumpy entry due to a lost reservation, hotel manager Ashley and her team handled the situation professionally and with kindness. The rest of our stay was great. The staff were friendly and gave our kids cookies every day.The location is perfect - an easy walk to many things without being IN Times Square. Subway station close by too.The rooms are clean and modern. Housekeeping was helpful and did a great job tidying our messy room every day. They even left a card and Sponge Bob treats for the kids after hearing that we went to Sponge Bob Squarepants The Musical. Our view of the Empire State Building was a treat too!The included breakfast helped kickstart our day without having to leave the hotel. It was always busy but had plenty standard choices and hot coffee.We hope to stay here on our next trip to New York City.",1,,
4,Antoinette L.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,123,361,4.0,11/21/2016,Enjoyed our stay! Although it was relatively short. We arrived after midnight and had to be buzzed in since you need your room key after that point. The representative was fast and quickly checked us in. Our room was neat and clean. We were on the 10th floor so the view outside was okay. After returning from the club at 4am we got in relatively easy. The rooms were quiet and we slept like babies. The hot breakfast served in the morning had a good variety. They accommodated our checkout needs and allowed us to stay another hour. I sat in the lobby afterward to charge my phone before heading out. I also took a quick peak at the fitness center although I was too lazy to work out that day and the gym looked great. Location is perfect for attractions around times square. Would definitely stay again.,5,2,3
5,Eagle N.,"Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands",9,156,23,3.0,1/26/2018,Nice location. The staff was so professional and this caused a pleasurable stay.Breakfast was typical Hampton. I found the staff friendly in the serving area.The WiFi was sufficient for my needs.I was not impressed with the business area.They had used the surrounding area for luggage storage.The rooms were a bit smaller than other NYC Hamptons I gave stayed in. I was a bit disappointed no microwave or mini refrigerator. It's NYC some of the best restaurants in the world.  You need to  store your left overs and heat up at 2am.The rooms are ok was clean but due for a renovation soon.The Decor is plain and dated.The lighting is not sufficient.If in area again and I was offered a good rate. I would consider staying at this property,1,,
6,Ronel S.,"Lakeside, CA",0,6,3,4.0,7/9/2018,"After being told we had lost our corner room with a view of the Empire State Building we were surprised to see management made the switch to accommodate our original reservation. Room was small and was lacking certain amenities but, it was clean, quiet and the staff was great. Perfect location for NYC!!!",,,
7,HonestyisKey N.,"Chicago, IL",2,155,9,4.0,2/4/2018,"Probably the best value in all of Manhattan! We booked 2 nights on a weekend (fri/sat nights) just before arriving and received a king bed room away from the elevators (not that you can get far in the narrow building) and paid under $200 total! Before taxes at 85/night the value was incredible.Hilton has a wide range of hotel lines, and Hampton is usually middling: Think of a Holiday Inn but a smidge better. The service here was better than most 4 star hotels I stay at: very polite, knowledgeable and accommodating. The receptionist at midnight was cheery and recognized my membership, giving us the little extras and welcomed holding our bags if we stayed late. The breakfast spread is very big. You can have a large filling breakfast with hot items, and you won't have even tried everything. Typical American fare, but the items rotate each morning. Beware that if you get to breakfast just before the 10am cutoff, it is chaos. I appreciated noticing a hotel manager worked the food area all morning to help his busy crew. Cleaning crew was also fantastic, noticing we were in the room late one morning, but cleaning it within the 4 hour window we were gone.The rooms are small, but more than enough space for a short or medium-stay term. You shouldn't coop yourself up all day in NYC anyway, but creature comforts are there.I have few gripes; the hotel is doing the best it can for such a dense area. The decor is simple and a bit tacky but it's not overdone. The door to our closet was out of alignment, there were some markings from use and the two elevators for 20+ floors and 160 units is limited causing minor waits, but it is unavoidable in the building design. I was close to giving 5 stars, but an exceptional rating would have required something more...exceptional. Hilton's reservation system is outsourced and while not reflective of this location, they made applying some of my membership perks difficult. The receptionist fixed this right away but I wish independent franchises could manage their own reservations in-house if elected. If we received the same rate I'd be back in a heartbeat. Can't beat the location or great employees that run this hotel.",,,
8,Patrick C.,"Sicklerville, NJ",92,231,68,4.0,7/30/2016,"A great location in Midtown with clean, comfortable rooms.  You can walk to Time Square, great restaurants next door and nearby.If you are one for breakfast, it is included and very nice choices to be had.I would definitely stay here when I am in NYC and it is WAY better than many of the 'boutique' hotels that claim so much more an offer so much less in real-word experience.",1,,
9,Kristen P.,"Far North Central, San Antonio, TX",13,15,0,1.0,12/28/2017,"I doubt I stay here again. Although the location was great and the staff friendly, there were too many other problems with the hotel. It was very cramped in the room and we believe we had bed bugs.  Only two elevators and it seemed we waited a long time for them.  Hallways were cramped as the cleaning crew had their carts in front of the elevators most of the time.  It was not quiet either....you could hear your neighbors in the hallways and doors slamming constantly.  Hampton Inn is one of my favorite hotel chains but this one did not measure up to the standard of others",,,
10,Jorge G.,"New Hope, PA",42,91,88,3.0,5/27/2017,Very noisy hotel only two elevators for 20 floors. People slam doors at all hours so no extra sleep here. Bed sheets are to small for bed so get ready to wake up like a burrito,,,
11,Michael W.,"Orlando, FL",158,206,408,3.0,1/23/2017,"The weirdest Hampton inn I have ever stayed.  No fridge of microwave found in the room. This is the first time that I have encountered this issue with a Hampton inn.As a diamond member,  I expect all Hampton inn to be the same just like every Hilton garden inn.  I had to wait over 2 hours for them to find a fridge.  Overall,  the hotel room was clean and bed was comfortable. It was just very tedious to wait for the fridge.",1,,1
12,Alan B.,"Worcester, MA",29,111,36,2.0,3/13/2017,"This seems like a poorly run hotel. There are only 2 elevators, and upon our return from a late lunch, we took the elevator to our room. We had to wait quite a while, as the elevator on the left read ""B"" for basement the entire time. Unfortunately our key didn't work, so I had to go back down to the lobby. The right side elevator finally arrived to take me back to the lobby (that took a while) and showed up, complete with a cleaning crew that was carrying bedding in large bags and distributing them on floors (I guess). When I finally made it down to the lobby and received a new key, guess what I noticed. The left elevator still read ""B"". So I asked the front desk to see if it was working. And shortly thereafter, the elevator arrived with a wet floor sign. Looks like they had been holding the elevator to clean it - bad idea since the elevator #2 was also being used by the cleaners.  And I don't know what they use at this hotel, but the place wreaks of some type of some kind of cheap, scented cleaning mixture.Our room was tired looking, the lamp shades had holes in them and the HVAC just wasn't working well. The thermostat was set on 71 degrees, but it felt like 60. When we turned it up to 72, the room felt like it was 80. Once the heat went off it stayed off until the room was again freezing. The room was so small that when you sat at the tiny desk, the back of the chair touched the bed. Our recommendation is to walk two doors down and try the Marriott Courtyard Herald Square. We checked in there after a couple of tough nights at the Hampton Inn. It has a much nicer lobby and the room we were in was much larger and better appointed. It seems like a very well run hotel, though the Hampton Inn on 35th does make for a ""low bar"".",,,
13,Keith Y.,"San Diego, CA",95,20,92,1.0,10/31/2016,"A decent hotel with a good location, but the elevators make this a must pass. The building has two small elevators and no freight elevator, which means that the staff tie up the elevators hauling linens, trash, and equipment. This creates some terribly long waits. Had I know this in advance, I would have asked for a low floor so I could use the stairs. However, from previous NYC experience I know that low floors equal having to endure incessant honking noise from the street. It's kind of a lose-lose situation.Any positives from this stay are completely outweighed by the image of the elevator opening up with one employee in there with the elevator filled with trash bags up to his waist. It was so disgusting! Don't touch anything in the elevator and wipe your feet when you leave. So gross",1,1,
14,Justine J.,"Philadelphia, PA",221,292,448,2.0,6/28/2013,"I really don't know how I feel about this place.  When I think of something good, there is something bad to counteract it to neutralize it, or worse.  Yet, my heart leans to a 3 star versus the 2 star my brain wants to give.  I have traveled a lot and stayed at numerous hotels, so they are facing some fierce competitors.The hotel lobby is nice.  I enjoyed the fresh, live orchids and the coffee, teas, and cocoa available 24/7 by the breakfast area.Speaking of breakfast, it is complimentary every day from 6-10 am.  The menu changes, from sausage, bacon, muffin with cheese and diced ham, etc.  I did not dare try the sausage.  I am not about to get indigestion before a wedding.  The bacon was probably those microwavable bacon they was thrown in a deep fryer (or so it seems), the muffin cheese was a bit soggy.  My biggest problem was their oatmeal.  I don't know how they screwed up oatmeal but they did.  I have made plain oatmeal with water and it's just tasteless.  I have no clue what special something they added to this, but it was pretty foul.  Maybe a tub of iodized salt.  They also have the worst hotel waffles I have ever had.  But...... food better than no food.The room was so small.  There was gum on the floor.  I did like being able to blast the AC at 70 F.  It's a bit loud, but I am a heavy sleeper so it doesn't bother me.  I did have more than usual frequent episodes of asthma - which means a lotta mites probably.  I do but them a lot of slack because it may be an older building and not everyone has pulmonary dysfunctions.I admit I like to play this sick trick on the housing staff.  I would leave small sums of money by the night stand, with nothing indicating that it is for them (no post-it, no envelope) - just to see what their conscious tells them to do.  This was the first place the only place that presumptuously took it.  It's good they assumed correctly, that yes, it was intended for them - but I despise presumptuous people.  For other places, I end up leaving a smidge more and a note for them.  I know... I know... the REAL test would be to leave Benjamin Franklin behind, but I don't wanna play that badly (and I love him too much).This one here is the pisser offer:  the elevators take eons - so I decided to take the stairs, thinking it would be faster.  From 6th floor down, there were large (filled) trash bags obstructing my path on every floor.  I am in heels, so I am not about to hurdle over them.  I don't care what people are wearing, there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON why there should be anything blocking stairs in the event of an emergency.  And based on crappy breakfast, I would not rule that out as a possibility.  Turns out I should have just waited for the stairs, because apparently the stairs I took doesn't lead to the lobby so I hiked and navigated (around trash bags) my sorry ass back up to floor 2 to wait for an elevator.  For over 200 buckaroos a night, two stars.",1,2,2
15,Alicia M.,"White Hall, AR",0,60,3,5.0,1/8/2017,"We stayed here on it first trip to NYC.Not knowing what to expect and wanting a room with a king bed, we booked this place months in advance online. When we arrived, we had to spend the first night in a room with a view of the Empire State Building that had double beds; our room was temporarily unavailable. However, they moved our luggage to the room we booked the very next day. The rooms had been recently renovated. They had a full breakfast each day and hot chocolate and coffee available 24/7. The staff was very helpful in directing us to places we wanted to see and greeted us every time we entered the hotel. Overall, I was very impressed with this hotel.",1,,
16,Tasha C.,"New York, NY",13,44,1,1.0,4/14/2014,"STAY AWAY!  My folks came to visit and booked this place 4 months in advance.  The day of check-in (when they were flying) Hampton Inn ran their credit card which for some reason didn't go through (user error!) and they cancelled their reservation.  My poor little nieces showed up with their bags and big apple excitement to no hotel room and the rudest hotel manager ever - Ariel Colon, you're an evil man if you make kids cry.  It was raining, 10pm and no hotel.  Luckily we found another hotel and booked with the same card they said ""didn't work"".  Diablo Colon wouldn't pay for our taxi over and blamed my family for this mishap.1) they don't know how to treat customers2) how is it business practice to forfeit someone's hotel room the day they check in?  Don't you know many people need to fly to get there.  Why not try 2 days or 2 weeks before!  3) if you're going to leave people stranded, at least be kind (these are kids!) and have options.  Never again!!!",5,,
17,Joe C.,"Battle Creek, MI",44,165,418,3.0,9/4/2013,"The parking is terrible but for my first visit to NYC I didn't know what to expect.  All the cab drivers and construction workers took up all the parking spots so I had to circle 2 times just to drop my family off.  Once I dropped them off I had to drive to another block to park in a parking garage.They were currently working on the concrete outside of the lobby so there were construction workers all over the place. Once inside it was clean and the staff was very pleasant.   They assisted us with check in and we were up to our room in no time.  We did pay the extra money for a room with a view of the Empire State Building but I dont know if it was worth it as you had to bend your neck up just to see it.  It was not like you could lay on your bed, kick back and look out your window and see it.The beds were comfortable, the bedding seemed crisp and clean and the bathroom was also kept well.There were 2 elevators that were quick to bring you up and down.  Didn't have to wait long to get one to take you.The breakfast was ok.  They offer a small omelet, cereal, sausage, waffle, yogurt or bagels. To drink there was tea, coffee, white milk, apple juice and orange juice. They had one person in charge of maintaining stock of the breakfast items and they kept up well.There is a concierge desk and they helped us out twice.  Very friendly and willing to assist.Location being only a few blocks away from Times Square and a subway terminal at the corner of the block you can easily get to anywhere you need to go from this hotel.  Would stay here again as the price was better then others in the area,",3,,
18,Alexander P.,"Mountain View, CA",42,58,0,2.0,10/14/2016,"Definitely one of the better locations in Manhattan, decent breakfast, and even a nice outside sitting area. The rooms don't have a fridge, and there is no microwave within the hotel that I could find, but, hey, the price is very nice and there are plenty of food options within walking, heck, crawling distance. So why the 2 star review? Here is the thing: the hotel has 20 floors, and two elevators. The two elevators generally work fine and deal with the traffic, however while I was staying at this hotel, on the 18th floor, one elevator would be out for repair at around 4pm through like 6pm EVERY day (Wed, Thu, and Fri). Here is the problem, the heaviest traffic time is around 5pm, when there is still only one elevator, also coupled with the heavy traffic, the hotel staff are finishing up their rounds for the day, and utilizing the only working elevator to move all of the trash, cleaning equipment, meaning that the elevator stops on almost every floor. A trip to the lobby and back to the 18th floor took me literally (and I am not using that word lightly here, because I do have a tendency to exaggerate at times) 34 minutes. Yes, 34 minutes, ok maybe 5 of these minutes where me in the lobby, but still. This pisses me off to no end because the hotel staff could actually do something about this instead of passively staring at the line of people in the lobby: 1. Schedule the stupid elevator repairs during off peak hours, why in the world are you taking the elevator out of service in the middle of rush hour traffic?! 2. Suppose the elevator just broke down, and you have no choice but to deal with it right there and then (which is hard to believe because it happened every day at 4pm), in that case, why don't you leave the cleaning equipment etc until after 6pm when the traffic has died down?If you don't mind taking the stairs, yes, book this hotel, it's great.",,,

20,Ellie B.,"Milwaukee, WI",154,639,357,3.0,6/19/2014,"My stay here was pretty alright. The staff were cool about us stashing our bags when we arrived early and stayed later than our reservation. When we did come back to check in after the appropriate time, it inexplicably took them 30 minutes to get our room ready. The breakfast is your standard freebie - I'd rather go out in NYC.The room was very nice and didn't feel cramped at all. The beds were comfy and our floor was quiet. One of our windows even opened, which was nice.",,,
21,Elizabeth P.,"San Pedro, CA",1,14,8,5.0,6/28/2016,"Couldn't have had a better experience. Staff is so friendly and quick to help. Best part was free breakfast from 6-10am and free cookies everyday in the lobby. Room was spotlessly clean and beds are made everyday. Little known fact, they are kind enough to supply you with complimentary toiletries upon request! Not to mention its kind of in the middle of everything (Times Square, 5th Ave, central Manhattan area) so everything is within walking distance! My only complaint is that the wifi was bad quality unless you paid a greater fee for better service :/ besides that, I'd definitely stay here again!",1,,
22,Paul V.,"Milwaukee, WI",531,465,911,4.0,8/8/2012,"I stayed here on a Sunday night and I was very satisfied with my room and overall hotel experience for the price I paid. They offer a teacher discount which is nice, but they also had good deals on hotels.com.  The hotel was in a great location, about a 10 minute walk from Times Square and a 5 minute walk from the Empire State Building. At check in I requested a room on a high floor facing the Empire State Building and they gave me top floor with the ESB right outside my window. The room was an 4 out of 5 for cleanliness, which is passable. The bed was comfortable and the room had a flat screen TV which is nice when you are staying in a city with not much going on and as boring as New York.My only issue was the breakfast in the morning. It was a madhouse down there and we were kept waiting for a variety of the foods to be refilled. No eggs (not even hard boiled) is a bummer for me. Overall, I would definitely stay here again for the price and the location.",3,1,1
23,William L.,"Meriden, CT",24,41,48,2.0,6/18/2014,"First off, I'll start by saying that I am a big fan of Hampton Inn when it comes to work travel, so why not use them for a NYC weekend? Big mistake. I stayed in a room with a comfy king size bed on the 20th (top) floor. What the hotel has going for it is the location. Right around the corner from the Empire State Building, Macy's and Fifth Ave.  An easy walk to Times Square, Bryant Park, Fashion District, etc.  And the staff was very pleasant and the hotel and room very clean and modern. However, there are some major flaws. First is space, the rooms are depressingly small. So if you're sharing the space with your kids like I did, you'll be stepping over each other. The small space also poses an issue with the air-conditioning which blows right on the bed making for a loud, frigid night sleep.  The tight quarters extends beyond the room to the halls where you have to constantly move maid carts or luggage trolleys all the way down to the lobby where there are only a few seats.Secondly the rooms are very close to each other and can be noisy if your neighbors are. The room next to us kept opening and closing their door early in the morning.  It was so loud I thought it was our door.Thirdly, the included breakfast is sparse compared to other Hampton Inn offerings. Processed egg omelets with cheese wiz was the only hot item besides the waffle makers. The final issue we had was with the elevators. There are only two for the entire 20 story building. So there was always a wait.The prime location and friendly staff might make this a perfect place if you're traveling solo. But if there's more than two of you and you want some space, I suggest looking at other hotels (and there are lots in that price range!)",3,,

The room was very clean and we had a great view of the Empire State building. The room was a bit small though, but what do you expect in NYC. I will say that the building felt very secure! I even accidentally left my room door open one evening and when I returned, my iPad was still there in plain sigh on the bed. I know, I know...more luck than anything else...but it happened here. The location was great; a block away from the largest Macy's in the world, a block from a subway station, and plenty of cabs around. Breakfast was buffet was good (not great, but good and FREE).

29,Ann K.,"Sylvan Beach, NY",48,583,1,3.0,12/5/2011,"This hotel is a typical NYC hotel - rooms are on the small side but that is true of most of the Hamptons in the city (the only one that has big rooms that I have seen is on 8th Ave).      I had two different rooms as my company paid for one night and I used Hilton Honors for the other two.The first room had two double beds and was a tad bigger than the second which had a king bed.   Both were decent rooms - the comforter was a little lumpy in the second room but that's getting pretty common at Hamptons and HGIs as they launder them daily.Breakfast was good - on par with other Hamptons.     As others noted, elevators are slow and crowded in the mornings and I suggest you get a higher floor as those on the middle floors frequently encounter full elevators!The only thing I did not like is they do check luggage but it is not stored in a secure location.    They put it behind a pillar in the lobby and when they run out of room there, it sits out in the open in the breakfast room.   I checked luggage twice and had no problems but I would have preferred to see my stuff go to a room that at least appears to be secure.",,,
30,Ryan B.,"Mountain View, CA",1,33,4,1.0,3/3/2015,"1. Health code violation.  Found curly hairs in the eggs at the breakfast bar. Absolutely Disgusting. The kitchen staff and cleaning staff doesn't wear hair nets.  Front desk manager didn't seem to care after I showed her. 2.  The most annoying part of staying here.  Two days straight, I was stuck waiting for 45 mins on my floor, unable to get down due to housekeeping hogging the two small elevators. Very frustrating, especially when you have business meetings and are on a schedule. I called front desk but they didn't do anything. The elevators will also just bypass your floor due to housekeeping using specific elevator codes/keys. I will never stay here again nor will anyone at my company.  If you stay here, stay on the first 3 floors so you can actually leave when you want -- by taking the stairs. Also, eat next door. Not here. 3. Absolutely no focus on customer service. Front desk staff was blasting music while socializing amongst themselves, instead of helping customers. 4.  This is my second time staying here, and both times my in-room coffee machine didn't work. Luckily they have complimentary coffee downstairs. Overall, I must say shame on you, especially for being a Hilton Honors hotel. P.S. I was a Sr. Front Desk Manager at the Hilton Towers in San Francisco about 10yrs ago. If I worked here, I would have immediately fired several people after seeing such etiquette and management.",1,,
31,Alicia S.,"Racine, WI",224,182,52,4.0,11/8/2012,"Shocked. Absolutely shocked! This was a great stay!One evening we were meeting a friend in the city for dinner - after a few drinks we were sleepy and decided to stay in the city overnight. After doing a quick search of Manhattan hotels - Hampton Inn came up as $109 for the night...$109! Seriously - on so many levels that is insane! We booked the hotel with a voucher so the night was free for us - but I would definitely stay there for $109 any old time.Our room was on the 2nd floor right above the entry way - yes the next day was garbage day and there were the evening ""folk"" milling around yelling and what not - but we could barely hear it.Room was VERY clean - bed linens were fresh (trust me - I check EVERY TIME I get into a hotel bed after my experience at another hotel in this area - yelp.com/biz/flatiron-ho…) and the bathroom was clean with plenty of towels and the usual amenities. And free wi-fi! And I know this is totally totally random - but the free breakfast was actually very nice! We had planned on going out for breakfast - but decided to keep our hard earned dollars and splurge on dinner. So - free breakfast it was. Waffles. Yogurt. You've all eaten breakfast at the Hampton Inn before so I won't elaborate. It was simply wonderful.Great location near the train, close to Times Square if that's your thing, across from Macy's. Excellent all around!",1,,
32,Kevin L.,"Simi Valley, CA",16,27,4,3.0,6/6/2012,"I stayed here on business. The hotel was OK. The room was clean, and a reasonable size. The location is very good. The continental breakfast was subpar; I found myself eating hard boiled eggs and donuts each morning not because it's what I wanted but because the other stuff looked so bad (the looks of the sausage for example nearly turned me into a vegetarian). If I had booked a NYC stay myself I would probably have gone for Hotel Metro which is a few doors down (seemed to have more of an intangible special something about it). Either way you should check out the rooftop bar at hotel metro, where you can hang out, enjoy a beer, and get a great view of the empire state building.",1,2,1
33,Cally A.,"Paradise, CA",144,23,29,5.0,2/14/2015,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Located in Manhattan with views of the empires state building, the locale is ideal.  I stayed here 5 nights for $639, which I booked directly on their website.  This price includes free wifi (fast enough for streaming YouTube and watching movies) and accommodates up to three devices) and free, hot breakfast.  The $639 included all taxes and fees, which were upwards of $20 a day! And the breakfast each day was great, waffles, eggs, omelettes, yogurt and of course all of the continental fare.  If ever in the NYC area and looking for a hotel room, this is it.",,,
34,Coty S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1943,1472,3925,3.0,11/5/2009,"The rooms here are fairly large and the bathrooms are just plain huge for a NY hotel.  I love the location and that the hotel is very quiet and a great place to call a second home on business.  Make sure not to put your room key in your wallet because mine became deactivated quickly and at an inopportune moment.  I had to run back downstairs with my arms full to get it activated again.  Also, if you are here on business- they do not want to check/hold your luggage for you anymore.  So you will be walking around the city with suitcases going to appointments, which can cause some real issues.  This is important to me to have the luggage storage service, so I recommend calling before coming here to make sure that they are still offering it.  If they do not during my next visit, I will be picking another hotel to stay in.  95% of the time your room with not be available until 3:00pm, so if you arrive early you will also be toting luggage.  They reset the internet password every day, so you will need to call downstairs every morning to get the new password in order to check your email.  If you are here on business, this can be an inconvenience.Nothing posh here, but they do have a complimentary breakfast downstairs with a nice solarium to dine in.  My favorite was the warm buttermilk biscuits every morning and a hot tea with cream.",3,1,1
35,Amanda H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,11,0,3.0,2/2/2015,"UPDATE: I changed from one start to three because the hotel did contact me after seeing my review, making gestures for atonement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In addition to the conditions of the hotel itself being less than stellar (in serious need of a fixing up), I had a major issue with the heating unit in my room: I stayed there this past weekend for one night - Saturday to Sunday - which happened to have been one of the coldest nights of the year so far. I was out at a Broadway show and had been waiting out in the freezing cold for an hour, so when I arrived back to my room there was nothing I wanted more than to be cozy and warm. When I checked in I was running late, so didn't take a look around- and when I arrived in my room that night I discovered something was wrong with the thermostat sensor. It was reading the room at a much warmer temperature than it actually was, so the heat wouldn't come on. I had to set the temperature at 80 just to get it to come on at all and when it did kick in, the air coming out was cold. They sent a tech up and he said some wires weren't connected right, so he did something behind the radiator frame and for the moment it seemed to be working. He suggested I make sure to eventually turn the temperature down a few degrees, because 80 is quite warm. After he left it was around 11:30 at night and I turned the temp down as he suggested, so the heat shut off. And then it never came back on again. Now it's 1am and the tech is back in the room- he has to reset the thermostat again and once it reboots the air is warm and toasty, but this time he says to leave the temperature set at 80. So I spent the entire night either roasting in an oven or freezing cold (once the heat shut off). The problem is not that the heat was broken - stuff happens - it's that when I went to check-out in the morning not a single amenity or gesture was made to make up for the horrible night I spent in their hotel. I had asked to change rooms at 1am because I was so fed up, but they were sold out, so I just assumed they would do SOMETHING to make up for the trouble (the front desk has a giant silver plaque that says ""If you aren't satisfied you won't pay""). And yes, I did voice my extreme aggravation at 1am to the front desk too (speaking of which, it didn't help matters that every time I called the front desk the gent on the other end sounded annoyed that he actually had to help someone. No exaggeration). So they knew I was unhappy. I am also a Silver Hilton Honors Member. Big mistake, guys- will NEVER stay at your establishment again.",,,
36,Brian H.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,1.0,12/6/2015,"This location has improperly charged me for a full night when I never stayed in the hotel.  Long story short, I was erroneously double booked, never provided any reservation confirmation, still cannot find any record of this reservation on my Hilton Honors account, yet was invoiced.  When contacted, hotel staff was rude and entirely unhelpful.  I've given up trying to work with this particular location, instead having to fight  with Hilton Honors customer service.  Buyer beware.",,,
37,Laurence L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",247,390,120,3.0,4/1/2011,"Room decor is a notch up from the previous Hampton I was at while in NYC with my family, but our room at this particular  Hampton was very cramped. It was our last night in NYC, so it didn't matter anyways.I really liked the bathroom for some reason...had a very clean feeling, and was definitely more elegant.Okay...the continental breakfast. Nom nom nom. My only disappointment was that there weren't scrambled eggs, but instead, a cheese filled omelette (which I did not like). Also, there was no hot sauce whatsoever.Location wise, there are a few Korean restaurants right next door, so you have some dining options right there. Also speaking of location, my family and I had the hardest time finding this hotel for some reason...it is kind of squeezed in and may be easy to miss if you're not really looking out.Other than all that, I would say this Hampton Inn isn't bad. Although our room was kinda cramped, it was our last night so I personally didn't take it to heart too much. I feel the fact that this location is a lot more decorated boosts the rating. Also, I didn't mention, but the breakfast area is quite spacious too. The concierge staff are polite and helpful with your luggage and all.",2,1,1

39,Janey Y.,"Alhambra, CA",207,604,283,4.0,1/12/2011,"Loved it for the most part!  I booked this hotel via Priceline and got a sweet deal of ~$110.10/night (and it's off season, too!).  The location is right smack in Koreatown and it's nice to have Korean tofu next door.Some Pros:-I arrived about 30 minutes early before check-in and got to check-in early!  Whoo hoo.-They have free wifi/continental breakfast/a weekday paper delivered to your room.  Love it!-Business center/Fitness room.  I had to print a voucher for my shuttle and was pleased to hear they had a business center open 24 hours.   -King sized bed!  More modern look (nice bathroom counter, flat panel TV)-LOVED the location.-Staff was very professional/courteous.  We can leave luggage for storage if we check-out earlier.  They also asked me if I needed a taxi/shuttle.  They have a complimentary subway map downstairs which was SUPER useful!Some Negs:-The fitness center was quite small, but did what it can.  It has some weights, a workout mat, a workout bench, two treadmills, and elliptical.  The elliptical definitely needs to be recalibrated - It took me 20 minutes to burn 63 calories/move 0.63 mile?!?!  Yeah right!! At least their treadmill was right... difficult to trust ""Hotel Fitness"" as a brand.-Hallway smells like smoke so even if I requested a non-smoking room, my hallway was sooooo smelly!-Small room (though it's NYC... so what do you expect?)-Check out can be a hassle.  2 elevators... and 20 floors?  I had to sit out on 2 elevator rides because it was packed.-  Breakfast was 'ok', but not the best.  It fills you up so I guess that's all that matters.  It also ends pretty early (10AM)... but that's because I'm a party animal and i sleep around 4am/5am when I was in NYC.  Please extend the hours until check-out time! (but I might understand why they don't since they'll get complaints that it conflicted with their checkout) HahaIn short, I will stay again.  And besides Hampton Inn is a subsidiary of Hilton anyway. :)",2,1,

I had an awesome view of the empire state building from my 15th floor room. Breakfast was ok but it's a free hotel breakfast so my expectations weren't very high. The hotel had free wifi but it was incredibly slow most of the time but it wasn't too big of an issue. I will definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to a few others.",1,,

43,Tony R.,"Peekskill, NY",0,4,0,4.0,5/17/2015,"This place provided a wonderful stay. It's in a great location, and is very affordable by Manhattan standards.EVERYONE there was super friendly and provided great customer service, I didn't expect to be treated like that at a Hampton Inn. The hot complimentary breakfast was a very nice bonus. But the thing that stuck out most was the service and attitude of all the employees. It began when I called the front desk when I couldn't get to the webpage where u sign in securely onto their complimentary Wi-Fi. My wife couldn't do it on her iPhone and I couldn't on my droid, we were only able to connect without entering the password given to us and felt it was unsafe to use. I called up the desk and they said they'd send someone up. I thought it'd be a while before we saw someone, but the young kid they sent up was there in 1 minute. I barely had put the phone down and he knocks on the door. He was really nice, polite, happy- everything you'd want in an employee. He quickly solved our problem with a smile and wished us well. Everywhere you go in this hotel you are warmly greeted-elevators, hallways, lobby, breakfast area. It kinda stuck in my mind so that's why I'm mentioning it. Maybe it was just a good day? Lol. It's nice, you don't get that much anymore these days. Luis at breakfast was super nice, I saw him notice two little kids fighting over one of their comfy types of chairs (they both were sitting in it), he brought over another one and later gave them each a bag of chocolate chip cookies. Their mom was impressed. The room was a bit small but the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice- granite counter tops and a good sized, spotless tub that I wouldn't hesitate to actually take a bath in. Wish the room had a small fridge but the ice machines aren't far away for when u want to make some beverages. We had a great time in NYC and would certainly stay at this Hampton Inn again.",,,
44,Jonathan B.,"Washington, DC",3,38,0,4.0,7/23/2013,I've stayed here twice now.  Very convenient to both Penn Station and Grand Central so If you want to avoid cabs this is a good place to stay.  This time they let me check in early which is unusual at most hotels in New York.  They seem to always want me to store my luggage and come back later.  The hotel does not have a bar but right next door is a Hilton garden Inn that does.,,,

You can walk there from Penn Station if you come in my train. The hotel is modern, bright, and professional. Despite the number of rooms, the complimentary breakfast is quite good and plenty of room to sit. My room was large - by Manhattan standards - and it was fresh, and comfortable.

46,Gordon B.,"Alameda, CA",11,53,10,4.0,1/18/2010,"OK, I stay here all the time (read: at least 2-3 months a year) on business and the Hampton Inn Empire State Building is a solid hotel.  The location is primo if you're visiting New York City or have business in midtown.  No more than a block to all the major subway lines so getting around on the cheap is easy.  You can walk to the hotel from Penn Station in about 12 minutes so for business travelers like myself it's hard to beat.Addressing Coty's review: I've never had an issue with their room keys but I always get a spare and leave it in my bag just in case.  As for storing bags they will hold you luggage for the day, no charge, and they lock up the bags in the back room.  I've yet to have an issue with this so I'm not sure what was going on when Coty was staying here.  Also, the Internet code only changes once a week (Monday at noon).The hotel itself is clean, quiet, and very well run.  Keep in mind that this is a Hampton Inn so my 4-star review doesn't mean that it's on-par with the Westin or other more luxurious hotels.  Linens are always comfortable, the rooms are spacious (especially by NYC standards), the gym has new but limited equipment, and breakfast is consistently good.  The staff at the Hampton Inn has always been friendly and accommodating - top notch.When it comes to business travel to NYC my choice is the Hampton.  I've had some friends come into town on the weekends and they got good deals on rooms here too.  Sign up for Hilton Rewards first so you can get the best deals.",3,,

I thought it was rather pricey! There's nothing fancy or pretty about this hotel and it was a bit small and ""not as nice"" compared to the Hilton next door. How do I know? Because I went to the Hilton thinking it was the Hampton.... and didn't realize I was at the wrong hotel until well... I couldn't get into the room :( While the lobby and the hotel itself is just average looking.. the room is actually decent. The bathroom while a bit on the small side, was clean and modern. I hate staying at a hotel where the bathroom is old and gross.. makes you not even want to shower. This was not the case though :)Anyway, nice thing about the Hampton Inn is they offer complimentary hot breakfast to guests every morning. I can't tell you if it is any good because I woke up way too late to make it to breakfast. My friends got down just as they were wrapping up but saw that they have a decent selection of food. I believe there's free wi-fi in the hotel and they do have a small business room with two computers for guests' use down in the basement. There's also a vending machine in the basement as well. Overall, for just one night's stay this wasn't a bad experience. I just wish the price would have been better then I'm happy.",1,1,1

Started to search the hotels in TS and they were crazy expensive, then found this one using google for 115$ per night(w/o tax). It suited my budget and i booked it. Its conveniently located near the 35th street . Its 1 minute walk to empire state and you see it from your window, also broadway/TS is hardly 10 minute walk. The rooms were very nice, little smaller on the size but guess what its NYC :D. Restrooms were all updated and clean, this is really what makes or breaks the deal. They have complimentary breakfast which was warm and fresh in the morning. If you have att connection there is no reason to pay 10$ for the wifi as you will get the free att hotspot wifi signal.

Came across this hotel through Expedia under $200 a night. Definitely a steal so I booked it right away. Yet again, the room was on the smaller side but being an avid NYC tourist, it was no shock to me. The only down side is that there were only 2 elevators and they were a bit on the slow side. To top it off, we had some sort of high school music group staying at the same time as my family so at times the elevators took long or were crowded. The moment the group of 50 or so left then things were a bit smoother. The concierge and front desk were awesome and answered all our questions. Free continental breakfast, newspaper, wi-fi, and snacks. Nothing is better then walking into your hotel for nap with fresh baked cookies in the lobby. Yumm. The location is decent. Its no Times Square. Actually Times Square is a bit of a walking distance but so is any other location in the city. The good side is that your right in the Garment District, Madison Sqaure Gardens and The Empire State Building are just a few blocks away.
