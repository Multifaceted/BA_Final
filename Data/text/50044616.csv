1,Meaux L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,25,12,2.0,10/30/2018,"Didn't even get a chance to eat my food yet, but some Mexican guy just gonna throw my food on the counter like I'm some animal smhNever will I be back here due to the unprofessionalism and undertrained staff who only care about their Caucasian people.... girl/boy BYEOff to my midtown apartment I go.Oh and after eating, the rice and beans were horrid and tasted weird and the salad didn't taste fresh. As a hospitality manager, I am disappointed completely. Eat at your own risk ! Chicken was ok tho'... just ok",,,
2,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,3.0,9/21/2018,"I honestly did not find my rice and beans with 2 piece (drumstick and breast) to be quite appetizing. The overall dish was alright and there was nothing really special about it, nor does it really stand out from your typical chicken dish. The flavoring/seasoning on the chicken could've been stronger and the beans tasted as if they just opened a can of beans and poured it over the rice. I haven't tried their other menu items here yet, but I'll be sure to give it a shot the next time I decide to return (if I decide to return). Overall, I'd say take your chances with this place if you're contemplating giving this place a try. The venue was relatively empty when I stopped by at about 5:30 in the evening and people were just loitering here (deliverymen and customers). Even in the Times Square/Theater District neighborhood, you can tell a good chicken place by the amount of people dining there and the aroma of spices that engulfs the whole block and Chirping Chicken does not meet those requirements. The staff working here were pretty friendly, so I'll give them that.",1,,

Updated review","I ordered takeout for work today, the ""large"" chicken shawarma platter with a side salad. The issue isn't with the food, as the plate itself was delicious. My issue is with the pricing. After tax, my meal came out to $21.75. In the platter was maybe a cup of salad (lettuce/tomato), a grilled and sliced chicken breast, maybe a cup and a half or so of yellow rice, and a quartered pita....maybe $6 worth of food if you're buying in bulk. I'm sorry, but I cant in good conscience pay 3x that for a takeout restaurant. I get it, NYC prices because you gotta pay rent, right? But come on, that's just murder. Cutting the price in half might make me a regular, but I wont be coming in anytime soon.",2,,
4,Ken W.,"Forest Hills, NY",20,187,627,3.0,8/10/2018,Had a small order of bbq wings.  Taste was good with a nice sweetness but unfortunately at least half the available skin was inedible because it was burnt to a crisp.,1,,
5,Sonia S.,"Manhattan, NY",173,82,170,4.0,8/16/2018,"While the food quality isn't anything extraordinary, I'm giving it 4 stars due to the unusually nice customer service (a true rarity in New York). It's also a good amount of food, more like 3 meals. I got the chicken shawarma, swapping the rice for baked sweet potatoes-and it came with 2! Sweet potatoes come either baked, mashed, or as fries which aren't on the menu, you just have to know about it (or just scroll through some Yelp photos). All in all it was $11 and some change for a large amount of chicken, real salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, tzatziki sauce, 2 sweet potatoes, 4 large slices of pita bread, and a side of tzatziki sauce. I'm done with it for now, but I'll be eating the rest of this tomorrow and the day after.",,,
6,Petty T.,"Paterson, NJ",31,44,143,5.0,7/20/2018,"First time visiting today and I'm glad I decided to give it a chance. Didn't go in with high expectations but was just looking for a place to grab a quick bite before catching a show nearby. Surprisingly, they surpassed my expectations! My friend and I ordered BBQ grilled chicken breast/thigh burrito bowls and they were delicious! Food was fresh, came out quickly, portion was huge, and prices were great. Right after finishing our meal, the manager walked over and gave us dessert (rice pudding) on the house. I was really impressed by this place and can't wait to try the rest of their menu on my next NYC visit!",1,1,1
7,Damon R.,"Milwaukee, WI",38,317,649,4.0,3/21/2018,"I almost missed this place. From the outside it looks like a Chinese food spot of some sort. So I actually passed over it a couple of times. There weren't a lot of people inside ordering which made us wonder, however we sat down to eat anyway. There were so many options to choose from. We settled in on the chicken and a burger. The woman who took our orders was super friendly and helpful explaining the food and how long it would take to order. The prices were good as well. The food came out about 10 to 12 minutes later. The food was plentiful and delicious. The chicken was actually seasoned! You have no idea how big a pet peeve unseasoned fried chicken is! I was pleased. My daughter ordered the burger and it was almost to big for her to eat.This ducked off location is good and worth the money you would pay for the food. It was surprisingly less then most of the eats we encountered in NYC.",1,,1
8,Julianne G.,"Manhattan, NY",46,257,601,4.0,3/2/2018,"Perfect place to come for lunch!// Service The cashier was super friendly and smiley - the most pleasant service interaction I've had all week! After I ordered, I waited on the bench in front of the counter and 5 minutes later, had my order and was out the door.// AtmosphereThe place has surprisingly a lot of seating. There was good music in the background and a tv playing. Also it wasn't crowded like I expected it to be at lunchtime. Plenty of seats open, so I'd be happy to come with coworkers next time. // FoodThe food was amazing! The sauce they put on the chicken is extremely flavorful and I love chargrilled meat making it absolutely delicious. I'm not a big fan of potato salad, but the green salad is fresh with lots of different greens, tomatoes and simply dressed with olive oil. The pita was also nice.",1,,
9,Melissa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",75,332,485,5.0,6/19/2018,"YUM!  The food here is so so good, the chicken and sides alike!  Favorite sides are the mac&cheese and mashed sweet potatoes.

10,Jess W.,"Manhattan, NY",232,328,278,5.0,6/4/2018,"Chirping Chicken is my go to place when I am near Times Sq (usually for a movie or a broadway show). They really have something for everyone - and are frequented by many locals. This fast casual joint is a great place to grab some grub before or after a show. The menu is extensive and the toughest part is making a decision on what to order. The rotisserie chicken is popular, as are the ribs and chicken nuggets. The roto-chick is flavorful and juicy. The ribs are also super tasty! The combination platters usually come with a side salad, but they are happy to substitute one of the other sides if like. Note that the platters also come with pita.Stop by during happy hour for special deals with beer!",3,,1

14,Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",197,206,3152,5.0,12/7/2017,"This is how fast food should be:Actually fast - took 2 min before I got my food.Tasty!  My 1/4 chicken dark meat was perfectly flavored, juicy, tender.Healthy - comes with a big side of really fresh salad by default, healthy dressing, pita bread not fries, plus one side of your choice.  I went with corn on the cob.  All the hot sides are made to order.Cheap - $10 for a tasty meal.Good service - staff cares and tries to be helpful. While not everything on the menu is necessarily good (found ribs disappointing last time) - the chicken thigh most definitely is.  Once again, 4.5 stars on Yelp did not disappoint!",,,
15,Sylvia A.,"Manhattan, NY",22,39,11,5.0,4/6/2018,"Not all rotisserie chicken are created equal, the best grilled chicken I've ever had. So tender, moist and flavorful throughout the chicken and not just the skin. I was waiting for the bus home around 10:15pm on a Wednesday night and this Hell's Kitchen location is just right by the bus stop. I was hungry but my intention was to find shelter from the cold. I initially ordered the sweet potato fries and changed my mind and upgraded my order to the 1/2 ribs combo which include salad and one side. Portions are huge, I had left over sweet potato fries for next day.Eddie, the guy behind the counter, was extremely energetic and friendly even at almost closing time. He asked me if I would want the chicken as well, and I told him it was my first time here so maybe next time. When my order was ready for take out, Eddie told me he gave me complimentary chicken and extra sides to try. What an excellent customer service and experience. I will definitely be back and fortunately there is one by where I live. Please give some love to this chain!",2,1,2

Updated review","Ditto to my first review.  I was once again in the area, looking for a quick meal before an early show.  The chicken is consistently great.  I had the 1/4 chicken (white meat) with warm pita bread and potato salad.  The price has increased to $6.25 (was $5.75) but it's still a pretty good bargain for a tasty, quick meal.",5,3,4

19,Karen L.,"Dayton, OH",1,66,69,5.0,6/30/2017,"I had bookmarked The Chirping Chicken before coming to New York in hopes that we might get a chance to eat there. Well, tonight (our last night in the city) was that opportunity, and I am so glad we did.  First of all, the chicken is terrific. The flavor is perfect, and it is very juicy, not dry. I had 1/4 white meat chicken. My husband had the ribs, and they were very good also. ( He let me have a rib so I could review it.) The food alone was enough to make me a huge fan of the place, but it was even better when I met Edy, who I assume is the owner or at least manager. He has the nicest personality and he knows how to treat people. And he sure can cook a great chicken. Please try the Chirping Chicken on 9th Ave if you have the opportunity. And don't forget dessert. The tiramisu is amazing! And strike up a conversation with Edy if you can. You will leave the place with a smile on your face.",4,,1

They are enough to share between 2 or 3 people. The arroz con pollo is also very good. Another one of my favorites is the mozzarella sticks. The prices are reasonably priced for the portions that they serve. The staff has always been very friendly. The hours are great. It's especially a good option if I come home late. As someone who has been here a number of times sometimes they give me free food, such as fries or mozzarella sticks. It is also very clean and organized. I look forward to going back!",,,

I choose a side of rice and beans which came out to ~$14 with tax. Im always weary of white meat being over cooked and dry. Mine was just a bit over cooked, but not bad. The nicely grilled skin and the dark meat made up for it. Also, dousing their BBQ & hot sauce masked the dryness. The side of rice and beans was just ok.

I think it was like $5 which is a no no but I was craving for Maduro. The portion of the ribs and wing wasn't bad. Pretty fulfilling. The 1/2 avocado size was disappointing.. it must've been a small avocado.  I took a picture of what I got.  Prices are a bit higher, I guess because it's in midtown. I heard mediocre things about the other locations but this location delivered on Time, and the food was good. They also have a lot of different things to choose from on their menu.I would order again if around area. But probably not the sides.

My friend and I were starving when we went in and ordered half a chicken with mozz sticks and a small spicy wing.The wings were decent, but a bit too salty (and I love salt). They were just your standard wing, nothing special. The mozz sticks were barely warm and the cheese instead wasn't melted. When you bite into a cheese stick you're expecting that cheese to be ooey and gooey. This was a disappointment.The chicken was dry and not exactly flavorful. It had some flavor from the grill but the chicken itself didn't seem seasoned.

Chicken strips meal is the bomb!  Comes with small side salad and your choice of a side - I always get mixed vegetables (which may/may not be frozen) - but they must sautee or cook them in butter cuz they are DELISH!  Wasn't too thrilled about the brown rice side (was a bit dry).  Nevertheless, dry brown rice won't stop me from giving the place the highest rating and keep coming back for what works well for the place - which is nearly everything.I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate cake/tiramasu for dessert.  They're spectacularly large pieces too!",,,

The stuffed grape leaves were just ok, kind of tasted like the ones you can buy in the cans at the store. The spinach pie wasn't bad, it is not as good as mom used to make but it's not bad. The chicken meal though by far was the winner. The chicken combo being tasty along with the staff being friendly and the prices being good. I'll be going here again.",,,

Fresh tasting food at great prices. They offer something for everyone from healthy grilled food to chicken fingers from Vegetarian and Gluten free. Tonight I had grilled tilapia, over a Greek salad with stuffed grape leaves and the largest sweet potato.  The dressing on the salad was so good. We had grilled chicken wings.  Others in my group had 1/2 grilled whole chicken, fried wings, grilled shrimp and roasted vegetables with salad.  The grilled shrimp are large and delicious.  Everything was perfectly cooked.  This place isn't fancy but it's clean and a great value for a good meal. You go up and place your order and then they bring to your table. Perfect place for the family as they truly have something for every type of appetite and it won't break the bank.

Every other place makes the chicken too dry, but here they allow you to specify a temperature so it turns out perfect.The only problem I have with this place is that the sides suck, especially for healthy options. The steamed veggies is the corn/string bean/carrot medley you expect out of a frozen bag, and tastes like it.

However, What amazed me recently is their service to please the customer. Amazed by Yenifer and Elsa. These are ladies treat everyone with welcoming grace. When ordering, they work with you if you want just something a little different instead of what is on the menu and give you the substitute. They take your food to the table. They are so polite. While you eat, if you take notice, they are always busy. Restocking the shelves, cleaning the tables, sweeping the floors. They are looking to keep busy...a rare character trait that makes them endearing. They keep the store clean and inviting. My daughter recently had knee surgery. We tried to not inconvenience anyone but needed to use the six seat table. Not one request to move or complaint was given. Instead, they were so amenable to all requests make sure we enjoyed our meal. Thank you again Yenifer and Elsa.",,,

My order was not yet ready, but once I got it the owner apologized and said he gave me a 1/2 chicken instead and said I could grab a free drink. Score!The 1/2 chicken was delicious. So juicy and well seasoned. It was a massive portion and it lasted me for two days. The dinner came with a very small salad, pita and a choice of side. Although I wanted mashed potatoes, they were out so I got the mac and cheese instead. I would skip the mac and cheese next time. It was just too watery and tasted a bit like those Kraft mac packages, but the chicken more than made up for the meh side. I'd suggest choosing something aside from the mac and cheese, but the chicken is solid and delicious.",8,3,5

70,Te T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,3,5.0,10/3/2016,"Where to start...So my sis and I are new to the area and were walking around starving. She made me walk 10 blocks to a place serving waffle dogs (to remain anonymous until I review later) all because the Papaya Dog was closed down on 42nd and 9th. We decided to head back home when we saw across the street The Chirping Chicken. I checked Yelp and saw that they had everything we liked, so before she could say lets go, she had already power walked half way across the street. When we walked in, it reminded us a place from our home town in Evanston, IL called Hubs. (Best Greek Ribs in all of the Chi.) So in a bit of nostalgia we leaned against the counter ledge for several long moments pondering the menu in a state of pure hunger anxiety. Eventually one of the cashiers, Wildy, walks over and gives us the best run down of how to make the most of our experience. She spoke highly of everything on the menu, but really caught our attention with the 1/4 Chicken 1/4 Rib combo that comes with a salad, pita and a side. My sis and I are pretty indecisive, so we like to sample all the options. Little did we know, today would be our luckiest day! Wildy and Eddie HOOKED IT UP!!! (With Allllllll the PPPPPPs lol)Now what you're about to read is not for everyone, but favor was evident tonight. Wildy saw how indecisive we were making a side choice because my sister wanted a baked potato and they sold out so she offered to throw in an extra side with our second choice of fries. Clutch!Upon paying my sis asked for some water and Eddie motioned that the water bottles in the cooler were on him tonight. My sis was startled and asked if he was sure and he said of course no problem. She thanked him kindly and we took our seats in the restaurant. While waiting I found out from my sis we had gotten free water bottles. While discussing this, one of the other smiley cashiers headed over to our table with a plate of fried mozzarella sticks and told us these are on the house for while you wait. Immediately we looked puzzled, like what's going on, they're so nice here! Excited we took a bite into the mozzarella sticks and they were just like back home! Before we could take the next bite the friendly server returned with our mountainous plate of fries, salad, ribs, chicken, pita and our comp'd Mac and cheese. What wait was she referring to?! Overjoyed we dug into our tasty meal. All charred everything! The fries were hot and crispy the salad was light with vinaigrette and the meat was flavored well. And the best part, all the BBQ sauce you want! My sis and I are are sauce snobs, usually into the the dark and tangy with a kick for our BBQ taste buds, but this place pairs well with a thinner light and tangy sauce that gives more punch than it appears. Not spicy at all but flavorfully compliments the food. We were very pleased. Not to mention our meal cost us $16.34 after tax and we ate so much that we didn't even make it around to our mac n cheese. Go figure. Overall, we'll definitely be returning to The Chirping Chicken. Great service to end a peculiar night really goes a long way. Thanks Eddie, Wildy, and the smiling cashier/server girl. Y'all lit! P.s. This review was written by my sis in third person. P.p.s. This is still her writing as me but doesn't find it weird that she doesn't start speaking in 1st person now. Signing off -Terry Twins",3,3,1

Everyone literally went above and beyond to make sure that our first experience would be a memorable one. I ordered the grilled wings and a small salad. I must say that the wings were really delicious. I don't know what type of seasoning or sauce that was used but it definitely paired well.

Snapple, soda, and water. That's means lunch for just $10 and change. They change the lunch special menu to a horrible burrito bowl that now costs more. I am very disappointed.  I will not be back for lunch anymore. Why change it to something no one wants or expects you to have? Please change your name to Chirpin Burrito.",1,,

Here's how it went:Came in and stood on the line; I believe I got here as the rush was just ending. Started looking at the menu and since it was my first time here, I didn't know where to start. However, Hernan (the manager) was standing around and - I guess he saw my confused face - he approached me and my friend and helped me with the menu options. I ended up ordering a quarter chicken with yellow rice and salad. I sat down at a table and he brought the food within a few minutes. Started eating and HOLY COW the chicken was sooooo tender and juicy. It was AMAZING!!! Same goes for the rice and salad. Can't believe how much I enjoyed eating such a simple dish. The flavors were deliciousssss.The rest of the employees here are very friendly and attentive. A young lady came to my table and asked me how my food was (that was nice.)

94,Benjamin L.,"San Francisco, CA",5,4,1,5.0,12/28/2016,"THE BEST grilled chicken I've had it was soooo tender (I know all the reviews say it but however tender you're imagining it right now, it's more!) and flavourful!! I got the $5.50 quarter chicken with a side of potato salad (average) and a pita (great with the white sauce!). If you're around Times Square, this is less than half the price of anything else you're gonna find. They also have it at $8 for any choice of side, and $7.50 for quarter ribs, coleslaw and pita! And if you're willing to spend more, you can try even more of this goodness!!! Service was EXCELLENT and they made me feel right at home!So I thought I was just gonna have an entirely enjoyable meal with this melt-in-your-mouth dark meat, so soft it seemed they'd massaged her - indeed, I felt an intensely emotional connection with the dead bird - before killing her, but then why WHY did you give me a HUGE side of mashed sweet potatoes for free??? I'm not falling for this ""this is also on the house"" nonsense, there's no such thing as free mashed sweet potatoes... So now I have to write my third Yelp! review telling everyone else about this delicious dining spot... If this place erupts (as it rightfully should) and the prices go up I'm gonna be so angry at those mashed sweet potatoes and each juicy raisin, but then again how could one stay angry at that creamy side, full of texture and personality? Now I'm gonna aim to work in NYC so I can come to Chirping Chicken daily and try out everything on the menu!~",2,2,

The best part is the food is outstanding and for a very reasonable price. If you want great food without hurting your wallet in Manhattan you have to try this restaurant. I noticed there are other locations however this location is the one to go to 4 excellent service. They open till midnight but they don't rush you out if you're still eating so you can take your time to enjoy one of the most delicious food in New York. We ordered grilled chicken wings with french fries and barbecue chicken with salad and it came with sides. I really love the fact that for the price you pay you get pretty good portions enough to share with two people very generous amounts. I noticed they also do delivery. Coming back to New York this is definitely a place to revisit. The food is mix with influence of mediterrian Mexican and American. It's perfect to cover a wide range of favorites. The location was only a few blocks away from Times Square. Don't leave New York without giving this restaurant a try it will complete your NY  experience.,,,

Updated review","I have been to this restaurant many times since they have open and have brought friends to experience the amazing food they serve. I have had chicken (quarters, grilled tenders and wings), ribs and fish.   One better than the next.  Salads freshly done every day.   The sweat potato is wrapped in foil and is very large and like a desert.   The staff goes out of their way to help you.  Prices are very reasonable if not really cheap.  Check out this great restaurant and you not be disappointed.",,,

131,Bree V.,"Nottingham, MD",0,39,8,3.0,11/25/2016,"The lamb gyro was pretty good, and the spicy wings were great. However I ordered the large portion of wings for $10 and added fries for $3. What I received were 7 wings and an ungodly amount of fries. That and a watery tasteless hot sauce really ruined it for me. Wondering if it was a mistake or if 7 wings is their ""large"" order.",2,,
132,Made In N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0,2.0,4/16/2018,"To salt brine or not to salt brine. That is the question. Me? I fall on the not side. The chicken is way to salty and has clearly been salt brined. This is a major mistake for a roast chicken place or if you are going to do so you must really be on top of how much salt you are using and go as lightly as possible while still getting the desired effect. The salt level is pervasive and the rice and beans etc are also very salty but the chicken is the worst. Chirping Chicken has been around for many, many years in one incarnation or another. I remember them from the 90s but I do not remember there chicken being like a salt lick back then. In addition, the salad i ordered was not fresh. Put it in the fridge and it browned over night and overall was nothing like the exact same salad I had ordered a week prior. Consistency is everything in the restaurant biz. For the prices (too high) and the overall quality (poor), just not worth it.",,,

145,Bruce H.,"New York, NY",4,25,12,4.0,4/13/2017,"Chirping Chicken has a somewhat confusing menu, but the charcoal broiled chicken is delicious and a bargain.  I came during mid-afternoon and had no wait, at all. My order was 1/4  dark chicken, which comes with good pita bread and a choice of potato salad or cole slaw for $6.50. The potato salad is likely not made in house, and I would give it a B- grade, but one does not come to Chirping Chicken for the potato salad. The star is the chicken and it is flavorful, moist, tender, and juicy. The amount of chicken is on the small side, but for $6.50, I can't complain and next time, I will order a 1/2 chicken, which would be the appropriate amount per person. Confusing is that a 1/4 chicken MEAL is $10.50. My sense is that if you use that magic word MEAL, you get the same thing and also a salad. Since I did not get the MEAL, I will not judge if the salad is worth the extra $4.00 or not, nor can I say if anything else comes with the MEAL. I seem to remember seeing a hand written sign which indicated that as a special the meal came with a soda, as well, making that a reasonable price. I would recommend this place for the excellent dark meat chicken (suggest 1/2 per person). The rest of the items that come with the chicken are ""gravy"", and are ""good enough"" side shows to the main act, which is terrific!",,,

157,Chris K.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,323,8,3.0,6/1/2016,"The delivery is really prompt, but the whole chicken is somewhat disappointing, the crime here being under-seasoning without any good sauce to pick up the slack, making this taste like your average gas grilled cookout fare. Lacing this with pepper and some salt definitely helps. The chicken quality is just OK.  Given this, it's not especially cheap by any means (whole chicken as of now is $16 + tax and $2.50 delivery fee and tip if you're going that route).  That said, it was fresh and not dried out.  Pita was good, could see the sandwiches being a better play.  .

We were staying in Midtown and yelped places nearby.  Chirping Chicken had good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  We were not disappointed.Our group of 8 came in (4 adults, 4 kids) and there was ample seating which was hard to find in NYC.  We ordered the family 1/2 chicken meal for my family.  It was plenty of food for the 4 of us. It came with a small salad, chicken, a side (we picked mac n cheese) and pita bread.  We ordered an extra mac n cheese for the kids. It was the perfect amount of food for us.While we were waiting for our food, the manager or owner brought our table mozzarella sticks. We informed him we did not order these, he said no for the kids while they wait. Let me tell you, the kids devoured the mozzarella sticks. Once we got our food, everything was amazing. My son is a picky eater and said he loved everything which was one of the only times I heard this on our 2 week trip.  The staff were all friendly, personable and accommodating.

I went to get my food and was told the disc would pulsate when my food was ready-I told them it had-they seemed to be having difficulty with this new system at that time. My food was finally ready and was delicious. The ribs were gone in no time and the steamed vegetables with butter were great. Suprisingly, because I had waited for my food for a while and the mix up with the disc pulsating-the manager brought me another quarter rack of ribs and more pita-enough for another meal. I took it as take out since I had an appointment and could not finish them then, but had them for lunch the next day. It was a very nice gesture and much appreciated. I would recommend highly and return since the food was so good.",,,

It was kinda hard to place my order with the guy responding too quick for me to even make my mind up but none the less that's not a big deal. I ordered 1/4 spicy chicken wings, Ceasar salad and a gyro plate. Took no more than 20-25mins for me to get my order delivered to my hotel at the iberostar next to grand central station. Usually when I order food to be delivered I tend to get room temp food and the food portions are lower. But not this place, The food was hot and for the price I payed they really gave me my money's worth. The chicken was very good and they gave me more then enough dipping sauce. I got 2 Ceasar dressings and the salad was a good size. A little too much tomato on top for my liking and it made the lettuce taste like tomatoes. The gyro plate was very well portioned with a salad on the side with a bed of rice and 4 gyro strips. The gyro strips were pretty salty but went well with the combination of rice. The gyro plate also came with 4 pieces of PETA bread and the cucumber sauce to go with it. I would order this again but without the Ceasar salad",,1,1

After a long day of walking around the city, we were hungry and tired. The manager and employees were so warm and welcoming. We ordered appetizers, wings, chicken, shrimp...wow, the portions were generous and the food was so fresh and tasty. The place was clean, well lit, had a constant stream of customers but even then, the manager came over to our table and checked on us asking how the food was. I definitely recommend this place for a relatively inexpensive, tasty meal with great healthy options (in addition to the fried stuff we love like wings and mozzarella sticks!).",,,
169,Mel C.,"Irvine, CA",0,24,3,4.0,2/28/2017,"We went there late, around 10pm. The place was clean and service was fast. We ordered two chicken items and my son ordered the 1/2 baby ribs. Food was good but the sides are more to the grown up tastes.",,,
170,Alex G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,9/2/2016,"Chirping Chicken is fabulous and a great addition to the Hell's Kitchen food scene. Delicious food (best Chicken in midtown as far as I'm concerned), great value, incredible service - manager + staff are so, so nice. Highly recommended.",,,
171,Ryan R.,"Hoboken, NJ",8,23,31,5.0,4/4/2016,Had the delicious chicken thighs special with fries so so tasty and a great deal for $7.50! I'll be back to explore another dish. It's a clean place and the staff were very nice and attentive.,,,

174,I. V.,"San Francisco, CA",154,264,1,5.0,4/2/2016,On why home I passed the Chirping Chicken. Was not hungry but the aroma was far too intoxicating. The cheerful and spotless dining room was full of people clearly loving their beautiful and generous meals. The long and short of it... greek salad and 1/2 chicken - both AMAZING. And this girl has had some chicken cooked every way you can imagine. Chirping Chicken is one of the best I've ever had. It's so flavorful and moist and with the perfect char. PERFECT. A side note - the staff is extremely and genuinely friendly. Really good vibe. Thankfully I live on 38th and 9th. After the first bite I knew I found my neighborhood go-to. Now I just have to get my office to change caterers!,,,
175,Terry D.,"Walton, KY",41,12,0,5.0,1/24/2017,"WOW!!  Fast on-time delivery, fresh, hot--doesn't get much better...OH YEAH!!  Delicious chicken, ribs, and desserts.",,,

I could not be more pleased by the food and the service. I have been going back to this place at least four times a week because I can't get enough. Great location. Delicious food. Super friendly staff.",,,
177,S L.,"Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, NY",4,1,56,5.0,3/28/2016,"The chicken is definitely chirping at this new location! Came in on Sunday night with some friends for a quick bite and were more than satisfied with the delicious food and the excellent service! We all had the famous grilled chicken, which was juicy and cooked to perfection. The sides (sweet potato mash and salad) were equally tasty and freshly made!

179,Naniwea d.,"Manhattan, NY",106,42,0,2.0,2/20/2017,"I agree the grilled Chicken is tender ,and delicious ,but the sides: cole slaw,potato salad are strictly deli fare,if they would make home made salads the line would be out the door!! Last night I tried the Chicken soap,hoping it was like delicious Dominican Chicken soaps that I've had,instead what i got was yellow brine with white chicken pieces,and carrots...yuk what a waste of money...not to mention how unhealthy.I ve tried the spinach pie...don't waste your money.Cmon guys with a little extra effort you could be the neighborhood bomb!!",,,

Not only that, these aren't wings. its only the drumstick part of a chicken that was killed a very long time ago, frozen, then thawed out, covered in batter and kinda fried. I called to ask them what's going on with this dish and was told flat out that they never have full wings. They don't make them fresh. They only have frozen drumsticks that are shipped to them. That was an expensive frozen dinner.",,,
183,eaglerock m.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,3,5.0,10/11/2016,"perfect place to go after the theatre!  came here after waiting for signatures outside the stage door and we were hungry!Wildy and Eddie were ready for us - chicken wings, greek salad, grilled chicken with pita, fried mozzerella, chicken gyros and chicken shwarma with rice and tsaziki - everything was fresh and hot and delicious. service is great, friendly, fast and efficient. plenty of cold drinks and available seating.  we'll definitely be back!",,,

190,Humberto S.,"New York, NY",2,24,1,5.0,7/7/2016,"Chirping Chicken is in our neighborhood and they deliver...yeeesssssssss!!! Just found it on Saturday and sat with the family to eat there and it is all of our all time favorites places now. They have an establishment that was located on 77th street which is to die for but it was too far so only able to eat there a few times every few months but now they in midtown - oh yeah...the burgers are tender, well cooked and juicy. The bread the burgers are on fluffy and crisp at the same time. The grill chicken is really grilled and seasoned with mouth watering flavors. The pita bread - what can I say - omg!!! I can just go there and eat the pita bread with all of its sauces only and be very happy. And you know a restaurant is good that as you wait for your food, you smell the dishes other people are having and you mouth is salivating for what they have since it looks and smells so good - almost forcing you to reorder or just order an additional dish because you have to have it. I recommend this for yourself for lunch or dinner and for your family. The owner/ manager is very friendly and helpful and kind and so his his staff that was there the many times we go. 5 stars goes to you chirping chicken.",,,
191,Alex S.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,4/22/2016,Love the food here! Fast delivery too. Don't forget to order a side of mozzarella sticks with your chicken!,,,

193,Blanca D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/6/2016,"This review is LONG overdue but I was beyond excited to find that a Chripping Chicken opened on West 106th Street and Columbus Avenue!  I too would have to get out on 79th and Broadway to get CC to take with me to West 109th Street.  They have such a variety of meals with chicken, fish or steak (I love all three so have to decide what I want to eat before getting there).  The corn on the cob is delicious and the staff is friendly and helpful in this location like the one on 77th and Amsterdam.  All I can say is THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!!!",,,
194,Julia D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,4/14/2016,"I tried Chirping Chicken a few weeks ago and now I'm addicted! It's my go-to spot after a long day. First of all, the food is amazing and affordable. I love the chicken combo (so delicious and juicy) with brown rice, Greek salad and pita bread. I can't wait to try other meals there! I love that the restaurant offers various options of food from different cultures too. The best part about Chirping Chicken is that the service is so friendly and fast. I feel at home there which is a relief working and studying in NYC. The owner is amazing and kind which is probably why the staff is so wonderful. Delicious fresh food, great prices, and great service. What more could you ask for? Sound too good to be true? Try it! I guarantee you'll love it.",,,
195,jon s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,4/8/2016,"I haven't used my oven since about 1991. Being a single guy(and lousy cook) I either eat out or order in most days when i'm not invited to someones house.  Having Chirping Chicken just around the corner is like a ""one stop shop"" for me. The variety and value as well as the portion sizes will stop me from roaming around to some of the more unhealthy spots i used to go to. I ventured to their place on the UWS occasionally, but now i'm enjoying trying ALL the items i never had the chance to try: the grilled vegetables are my fav and when u add the sliced rib eye, i think i've found my thrill!! The other day i tried the yogurt stuffed kebob....OMG!!!! it was a sausage with yogurt inside! What a treat!! The grilled chicken is ALWAYS juicy and the ribs are ALWAYS tender and succulent with just the right amount of that very tasty BBQ sauce. EVERYTHING i've tried is a surprise! I'm looking forward to going through ALL the items, though i keep coming back to the basics they are that good...A clean restaurant, happy staff, value in EVERYTHING i've had....I've been there many days a week since they opened and know I won't tire of the food because of the variety. So very good!!!I've had take out a few times and it was always delivered fast and fresh! I've also brought large varied orders to friends who are now also fans.....the great sturdy take out containers really make a difference when i'm traveling a distance!!As Jan said, it really has improved the quality of my life and i'm eating so much healthier than ever before. A big THANK YOU for coming into my hood Chirping Chicken!!!!Jon S.",,,
196,Paul P.,"New York, NY",0,56,0,4.0,3/25/2016,"Having been a fan of the location on Amsterdam Avenue I was happy to see that they opened one on 9th Avenue and for the price the chicken is delicious. 1/2 white, salad, sweet potato and bread for 12 dollars and plenty of food to eat a lighter second meal. Great spot for the nights when running late, don't feel like cooking or want something quick and good.",,,
