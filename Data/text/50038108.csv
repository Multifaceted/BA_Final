1,Henry H.,"Loudon, NH",6,1,0,5.0,8/31/2018,This is a cool place that my so and I found on yelp and reaffirmed my faith that yelpIs worth the trust. Will is a gentleman and a true and honest representation of what a bartender could and should be. Not only that he fed us cheesecake.,,,
2,Phil G.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",91,604,218,2.0,9/13/2018,"I must have been at 142 Sullivan on an off night. Unfortunately, I arranged to meet friends here without knowing much about the place. It is unbelievably tiny and unable to accommodate a group. The bartender was very nice, but his bar was not stocked with any liquor. He had one bottle of lousy vodka. It was a sad",,,
3,Daniel S.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,62,31,2.0,3/11/2018,"Such a weird combination of styles. Exposed brick, but it is painted white, then there is stainless steel counters, the floor is concrete, it is too well lit, so there's not warmth to it, yet there are candles. There are those wood thickets, but they're painted white, yet there is a like ivy on the outside, but it is left green.The hell is going on. It is too tight in there as it is oddly laid out.",1,5,

5,Nick M.,"Stony Brook, NY",1,8,10,5.0,12/30/2017,Great little bar with awesome bartenders. The negroni is my favorite. You won't be able to stop staring at the old soul train dancers on the TV. If you're looking for a cool soho vibe and atmosphere..check this place out.,,,

11,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",828,471,120,3.0,1/21/2017,Homey. Small. One bartender. Make this your local digs. A good assortment of beverages and seriously solid tunes. What else do you really need? Just hope you can grab a seat and enjoy the vibes before it gets too packed.,,,
12,Jennifer S.,"Phoenix, AZ",998,4190,50,5.0,11/9/2016,"We were looking for a cool bar to grab a drink before our dinner at Carbone and Yelp led us to 142 Sullivan.  Such a fun wine bar with a unique, hip atmosphere, throwback music and nice wine list all with a Parisian bartender - ooh la la!",1,1,2
13,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",2,11,1,3.0,1/6/2017,"This place is cute, but is in a compact space, so seating is limited. Also, the pours were pretty conservative for a $13 glass of wine. I would like to come back on another night and see if the vibe gets any warmer. For such an intimate space, I assumed the atmosphere would be more inviting.",,,
14,Reggie M.,"Manhattan, NY",273,315,2690,5.0,8/25/2015,"A new cocktail bar in the Soho/West Village area,  great for after work gathering. Awesome variety of Lab142 local brew, small selection of wine and a speciality house cocktail. The place is cozy but badly needed an air conditioner for a hot night like tonight! Will definitely come back soon!!",6,4,4
15,Najat K.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,2,0,5.0,1/22/2018,"Great wine / cocktail spot. Super intimate, cozy, and  creative drinks. And to top it off, a really friendly bartender / owner (Mils). Definitely a go-to spot :)",,,

18,Megan F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,32,0,1.0,5/3/2016,"Nothing about my experience was nice. The wine was fine but a small serving and overpriced. The bartender was kinda a jackass who pretty much ignored us, except when he winked when we asked for the check. The music was weird. There were slate trays with prosciutto and cheese on the bar, but we were given no direction on whether those were ""help yourself"" ""order me!"" Definitely will not be back.I also feel like they don't know how high end they want to be. The place was cute, there was the above-mentioned prosciutto on the bar, but they wanted us to start a tab--- most high end wine bars I've been to just give you the check at the end.",1,,
19,Paul S.,"New York, NY",184,27,100,5.0,5/20/2016,Love this bar. Super intimate and chill. Just down the street from my office on prince & elizabeth. bartender pete is very knowledgeable about the wine and helped my girlfriend pick out a great red. I like to drink red but only while listening to tom petty. Awesome spot to wind down at after a long day while enjoying some wine.,,,

21,Robby D.,"New York, NY",5,44,11,4.0,3/4/2017,"Loved this little bar but the only reason i removed a star was the amount of space. Like most of the city, you felt cramped and with 20 people this place would be packed. We were walking by and through the windows we could see people staring at us waving us in. We decided to join and when we opened the door, we were treated with a unanimous ""Hey!"" I felt like we were walking into a modern cheers where everyone knows your name (feel not look). The drinks are a little pricey ($11-$15 for your glass of wine) but I really liked the Cabernet I was drinking. The music was on point!",,,
22,Daniyar T.,"Manhattan, NY",32,20,4,5.0,8/25/2015,"Very cozy and romantic neighborhood bar with their own 142 beer featuring lager, IPA, cider, light beer and Kolsch.",1,,1
23,P C.,"New York, NY",6,141,11,5.0,8/17/2016,"142 sully. lab142. the room. the old room. Whatever they call themselves now, I love this place. It is my official neighborhood bar, and perhaps the only one left. Only fits about 20 heads maximum and doesn't serve hard alcohol. The music is always great and either eclectic or perfectly old school pop. It is very relaxed. One bartender who is as much hanging out with you as serving you. That means he may be outside smoking when you want to order another drink. Just chill and enjoy the setting. He'll get at you in a minute.",1,,1
24,Eliza M.,"New York, NY",486,3,1,5.0,1/7/2017,"This is the best little bar in New York. The bartender is super hot and makes you feel like you're in his in home in a dope ass house party. Amazing place. Super tiny, lovely, local and tiny. Just great.",,,
25,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",191,33,8,5.0,9/19/2016,"I am in love with the ambiance of this quaint little gem! One of my old coworkers called for a ladies night and I almost didn't make it out because it was one hell of a long week. So happy I reconsidered! The owners have one hell of a palette for wine. I have to find the proprietor and thank them for introducing me to my new fave brand of Chardonnay (lioco). I cannot remember the bartender's name (John I think?) was such great company we had a really good time chatting and playing DJ. He was super attentive with our whole group and noticed whenever we needed another drink or water. Super chill, super fun and relaxing spot to get away from the 9-5 hustle and bustle. I think another ladies night is in order soon. Thanks John!",,,
