It's a freakin airport man. Why is an airport on here for review? Every airport has a delay at some point. Everyone has a canceled flight every now n then. It's not the airports fault, it's the airlines fault. let's just be real here. Are we on the same page? Good! Now lemme actually lay a few suggestions here though. TSA. Throw a little smile on for me. I'm not tryin to hurt you. As a matter of fact I wish you were going wherever I was going lolThose guys on the golf karts really need some type of horn. I feel bad that they had to work a shift n make crappy tips n too that off by going ""beep beep""Terminal B has a Wendy's. You're welcome",,,
1,Kim B.,"Lodi, NJ",167,79,127,1.0,11/19/2018,Let me start by saying that Newark is always delaying flights! It seems like there seems to be a time management problem or they over book how many flights leave or land. I've been coming here for years and there always seems to be a delay. Especially in the late morning or afternoon! I suggest you book your flight in the morning or a red eye to avoid a delay and wasting your time.Also the airport is not the cleanest!,1,,

4,Michael R.,"Honolulu, HI",21,282,1686,4.0,11/15/2018,"This is where pilots relax. Of all the times I flew into the East coast, this is my first visit here to EWR. It's very very big compared to HNL but unlike LAX not too confusing.  Don't have to tell me, I know you read both reviews. First thing I noticed is the fully stocked restaurant bars were open and I landed at 0700. And people were drinking.  I saw a couple of UA pilots giving a toast.  Ok I'm joking about that. And the place ..... tech savvy.  It looked like all the self seating tables had iPad devices to order food or drinks. And next to them were the payment machines where you just slide your card and sign using your finger on the iPad. Some of the food stop store have self checkout like at a grocery store. And for people that didn't want to sit at a restaurant the food stands had the same iPad device.  Just tap what you want and the server makes it right there after you pay. Overall four stars. The easy of getting food and paying way easy. Not quite five because well I'm West Coast and not a NY anything fan. Now excuse me, I gotta figure out which way to swipe my card. M",2,1,1
5,Cassie M.,"Minneapolis, MN",22,176,735,4.0,10/31/2018,"Clean and bright with wide corridors. Restrooms could use some updates and improvements. There were some construction barriers by the security checkpoint, but didn't seem to impact the lines. Concourse C has a decent selection of shops and food options. But if you are running short on time, definitely avoid the ""Global Bazaar"" trap which is overpriced (even more than most airports) and impossible to get in and out of efficiently. Disappointed at the lack of lounges at this airport other than United Club. Come on, American Express Platinum, work with me here. :)",,,
6,Nabila I.,"Toronto, Canada",42,258,239,3.0,11/14/2018,"I've used this airport twice now and I find that it could be far better. Imagine getting to the airport at 4:30 am for a 6am flight and not a single thing is open. There's no one at duty-free, there's no where to get coffee or a snack. There is a convenience store, but who wants junk food and gum or magazines at that time of the morning?? I really feel they could have more amenities, especially because Porter is always cancelling flights and then people are stuck in the airport for longer, without anything to do.Also clearing security takes forever. First, a flight is usually cancelled, prompting more passengers to be bottle-necked through security and second, they ask for all devices to be out of bags, and all coats and shoes off. This of course raises anxiety levels amongst passengers because everyone just wants to get on their plane on time but it always feels like you're gonna miss your flight.Overall, this airport is okay. But it could definitely be improved upon. I always come to this airport earlier, knowing the mess with the security checks. But the downside is I'll have nothing good to eat or nothing to eat at all, depending on when my flight is.",1,,

You can get a shuttle from Newark to JFK ( $30 app) and vice versa. while boarding flight from terminal B, I did not find much restaurants and shops, unlike terminal C where you can find plenty of options in food, drink, and shop. I personally like T-C. While exiting, signs are very clear which terminal you need to go as per your airline carriers. Returning rental car, parking signs are easily visible and you can't miss those boards.I have boarded United-Spirit-Etihad-Air India and their check-in was not very painful. Some have kiosks where self-check-in is available. gift shops are there and easy to find. Immigration line can be a bit frustrating at times but I never faced that big line. 30 minutes to 1 hour and its done for me. Parking is $4 per 30 minutes and $8/hour.

Holy crap this airport's layout is so garbage! You have entry and exit mixed on the 1st and 2nd floor which makes it very annoying, while the road to EWR seems like it is ALWAYS a long drive. So many chokepoints and no easing of lines here. I got run around in a circle with the security and the TSA yell a crap ton about it, sheesh.Inside the layout seems off, everything feels small, cramped, and there seems to be no seating anywhere. I didn't use the tablets which are everywhere since all the spots are overcrowded. Lines were super long to get in the waiting area and security just sit around going extra slow through my bags.

13,Lulu P.,"Fairfax, VA",87,69,498,4.0,9/8/2018,"Had a 3 hour layover yesterday from DC to Tel Aviv. We flew United so was only in concourse C. It was clean, updated and had a plethora of food selection. Gates have tables and chairs with outlet plugs to charge devices. Tables had tablet from which you can order from different restaurants and have it delivered to your table. We were assigned to Gate 138 but was kicked out from the whole section. Apparently they close that side of the concourse for a secondary security check for all flights to Tel Aviv. Our church group was more than happy to comply and had a good time chatting up with other passengers heading to Lima hanging out at gate 128. I also needed to pump and asked a United costumer service rep if there is a place for me to use. She said either in the bathroom (REALLY?) or head down to gate 103 to the one and only momma pod they have in concourse C. I have an hour before boarding, to walk down to gate 103 and back, plus 30 min pump time, taking the risk of waiting if the pod is occupied then going through security again before boarding... I said nay and opted to wait to pump in the plane. I was miserable for a couple of hours before I can finally pump but it all worked out fine. Nursing in public is already stressful as it is, having to scramble for a place to nurse your baby or pump can be even more taxing. I wish they have more momma pods readily available for breastfeeding moms, having someplace quite and private makes traveling a world of difference for mamas like me.",,,1

Good communication if you have google maps or if you go on the ewk airport website you can check the status of your flight immediately. Major snowstorm last night this morning the airport was already cleaned. Spirit airlines: the bag check is $52. Which i think is high for one dam suitcase.

15,Violet P.,"Edmonton, Canada",111,1090,580,2.0,10/10/2018,"It was pretty quick to check in with our luggage and the Air Canada representative was good to seat us beside each other as we didn't do online check in prior.  For the second flight, we were seated in the Emergency Exit and didn't have to pay extra.  Maybe it's because we checked in very early from our flight times.  After unloading our luggage in Terminal A, we checked out the food places and logged in to the wifi.  The wifi didn't seem very reliable in the lower level where the food court was so we found some seating upstairs.  The lower level had a variety of food choices but it was earlier in the day so I settled for a muffin from Dunkin' Donuts as I was told there wasn't very many food options past security.  We waited before going through security and it looked like there wasn't much of a line when we went through 2 hours before our flight.  It was deceiving as once we went past our first check point, there was a single line to the security and body scanner.  I expect lines for airport security but it's not so pleasant when I could smell strong BO.  The security bins were to the left and I loaded it up and then went through the body scanner.  Staff weren't really friendly but at least my interaction with them was limited and quick.Once we got past the security on the lower level, I noticed there were portable toilets and thought, oh no, is this the only option during their renovation.  Luckily, there was one washroom but it had a line up.  There was enough seating but I didn't notice any outlets to charge up my phone.  There was one store that sold snacks and reading material.  Our flight was delayed and even sitting close to the gate, we couldn't hear the updates very well.",2,2,2
16,Lauren B.,"Washington, DC",202,340,941,2.0,10/25/2018,"We spent a lot of time in this airport (1.5 days) because our original flight was cancelled and we had to stay overnight in a nearby hotel and then return to the airport the next day where we sat until our flight left the next evening. First, the airport does not have enough space/seating in the gate areas for the number of passengers on international flights. Additionally, the seats are bolted to the ground. Compared to the typical airport seating, the arrangement here is food vendors in the middle and then tables with really high chairs bolted to the ground so you can't move the chair closer or pull it further away from the table and then a couple spots with slightly lower seating. One kid almost fell through the gap between the chair and the table. The tables have chargers which is the one nice part, but again, the chargers are not worth the claustrophobic seating because more likely than not, you'll find the chairs too close to the table (unless of course you're a kid and then the chairs will be too far away).Also, the food is expensive. One person near me ordered a fruit cup. The fruit cost more than $10 and all she got were a couple of slices of melon. You'll be hard pressed to find any food for under $15. We had to pool all of our meal vouchers for four people for multiple meals to eat at one restaurant in the airport and it's not as if we picked a fancy restaurant, we picked a diner and didn't order anything extravagant. It's just the mediocre food is so overpriced that the airline vouchers don't even cover the high cost of food at this airport.The airport doesn't have water bottle filling stations either, so you have to try to fill your water bottle using the water fountain, but the water on multiple fountains didn't go up high enough to actually fit your water bottle under the fountain to fill it up. This definitely isn't an airport to write home about and I would definitely try to avoid flying through it in the future!",,,

Updated review","Terminal A is terrible. Really needs a make-over.  It looks like something that belongs in 1953.  Restrooms are dirty and it's very crowded in waiting and seating areas.  If you're taking a United regional flight, you often must take a shuttle from terminal C to A, which is a hassle and requires additional time.      Terminal C is pretty good ... plenty of restaurants , all on-line ordering. I suppose the isolation of travel is mirrored in the choice of eating. Sit alone. Eat alone. Order through a computer. No human contact.  Finish your food, now go away!       There is plentiful seating and a good United Club, which, of course, requires membership.  Additionally, there is a separate Polaris club for first class international flights       Baggage is a hassle, though, especially with United.  It often takes over half an hour from landing to retrieving your bag, even if it's marked ""priority"".  Actually, I get the feeling that if your bag is marked priority, they consciously wait to put it on the conveyor last.        Lots of parking.  Numerous coffee shops, news stands and boikstores",,,

20,Brandon P.,"Maryville, TN",149,226,754,5.0,10/14/2018,They are making big strides at this airport and I really appreciate the technology and many shops and food there are to not become underwhelmed as this is becoming a much bigger connecting airport.

22,Kici C.,"Richmond, VA",534,179,191,1.0,9/25/2018,"I travel often for business and I absolutely hate flying to, connecting through, or having any dealings with this airport. Every time I go, I have an unpleasant experience. It's always FREEZING cold in every terminal and there aren't any good food options. I understand that it is a large airport but in my opinion, the efficiency of their air trains and inter terminal shuttles aren't effective enough. The employees are typically rude and curt. Is that a northern thing? If it's raining, 8/10 the jet bridge will be leaking. The hotel shuttles (which I'll also be writing a review on the hotels lol) only come every 30 minutes. So God forbid you get to the pickup at 11:04. Gotta wait an additional 26 minutes before you get picked up I ca terminal station that is cold and has no food options. The bathrooms are DISGUSTING. Comparative to a prison. This airport truly needs a makeover. Truly. If you can afford to connect elsewhere or fly to another airport please do so. I never write bad reviews but this is so warranted. Do better EWR.",4,1,
23,Janet D.,"Denver, CO",2294,2394,17898,3.0,9/18/2018,"Probably the most pathetic looking/feeling airport. Signage are non existent almost. Drab looking. Corridors are way smaller than most. I don't know if the location influences those  who work under this roof or they're just like that. Dead inside. Bored to  death? The good thing here? The bins that the TSA utilize for passengers to unload their iPads, belts  etc is the biggest I've seen. Fits a pair of shoes, an iPad, purse, and a couple of large empty water bottle plus a jacket and there's space for more!One other thing that stands out more than this big bin is the amount of good restaurants in this Airport. Two United First Class Lounges too! A Las Vegas like vibe courtesy of the tablet like thing on all tables. Yeah! You can play, surf the internet or place an order of food.

24,Stephanie H.,"Trinity, NC",90,355,366,1.0,10/4/2018,"Umm...the word scary comes to mind when I rethink my experience at Newark Liberty International Airport. Scary and maddening. Our arrival was frustrating. We tried getting an uber/lyft for almost a whole hour. They kept trying to pick us up from the lower level and we were a floor up.  We picked the correct location on the map... arrivals pickup. We decided to make the trek to the area where hotel shuttles pick you up from.  I agree with other Yelpers in that the signage in this airport is lacking. We waited another hour for the hotel shuttle to show up.  Not really the airport's fault but there was no indoor seating, access to vending machines, water, or restrooms in this area.  It was blazing hot outside.  If you went inside to cool off for a little while you risked your hotel shuttle blowing right by without even stopping. Many people missed their shuttle within seconds.Departure for return home trip was delayed 2.5 hours for weather...it was slightly overcast outside with absolutely no precipitation or wind. I call BS...almost every flight before ours since 5am was delayed for ""weather"" too. Ours was an 11am flight.",,3,

Went to the bathroom and there were no paper towels and for some reason the mirrors werent there anymore. You can see where there were once mirrors. Strange airport. Meh.,,,
26,Maureen F.,"Wilmington, NC",173,124,161,4.0,11/10/2018,"This review is specifically for Terminal C- the United Airlines terminal. Note that top level check in is for Premier Customers. All the rest of us have to check in on the second level. It pays to have a TSA Pass here- the line is much shorter. However, you still have to remove your boots - unlike other airports. While the bathrooms still need to be updated, the other terminal amenities are first class. Lots of comfortable seating, full of tables that are equipped with tablets and charging stations. You can sit anywhere in the terminal and order cocktails from the tablets, swipe your card and food/drinks will be delivered to you. We decided we wanted to go to one of the many restaurants in the terminal. There are a ton of food choices- raw bar, dumplings, steak house, mexican, sushi, charcuterie, tapas and more. We sat at the bar of a restaurant that offered wood fired pizzas. We were figuring out the ordering on the tablet when one of the servers asked if we needed help. We told her that we were good and ordered two Brooklyn lagers and a margherita pizza and salad to share. The beer was awesome (what is in that NY water???). The salad came first- it was filled with romaine lettuce, avocado, edaname and was really fresh. The dressing was a Dijon vinaigrette and complemented the salad well. The 14"" pizza was charred on the bottom, topped with fresh mozzarella and full basil leaves. It was delish and not at all what we expected from airport food. We kept our tab open and ordered another round of local draft beers before closing out. An email with total (including an 18% tip) was sent immediately after. There are also several little marketplaces where you can purchase almost anything you need to make your flight comfortable. I am not a fan of airports- but if you have to spend time in one, EWR isn't a bad place to be.",,,
27,Morris P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,51,0,1.0,11/8/2018,"I've flown out of and in to EWR more times than I can count for 35+ years. The whole place is aging and fraying beyond the edges. The terminal/parking airtrain was cool when it opened in 1996, but the experience is pretty much what one would expect of a 22-year-old light rail line that has never been modernized. And who designed those rail cars? Each one is 3/4 rail car sheet metal with maybe 1/4 of the car as space for actual people and their bags.The experience at Newark depends heavily on the terminal your flight is departing from. I remember the major expansion/renovation of terminal C when it was Continental's hub, and I assume there have been further upgrades and modernization since then as it became a United - dedicated terminal.HOWEVER-if you fly Southwest, JetBlue or any other airline from Terminal A, it is a different story. Cramped, not even remotely adequate food options, tiny bathrooms-not a place to be while waiting to board a long-delayed flight, which I've experienced my share of. Heaven help you if you don't have TSA-pre clearance. You can wait for literally an hour to get through security.Another baffling aspect of EWR is the signage for the different parking garages and lots. I have parked at P4 for 3-4 day trips a gazillion times for many years, and still regularly miss whatever path I need to find the entrance. It is as if access to this garage was designed by Hash House Harriers as part of a run.The best thing one can say about EWR is that it is easy to reach from many major highways, and is not the traffic nightmare that is part of both LaGuardia's and JFK's DNA.Another facility colossally mismanaged by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Perhaps putting the PA's corporate headquarters in terminal A at EWR might prompt some improvements, although I seriously doubt that the Port Authority is capable of ever doing anything good with the billions of dollars it receives from local taxpayers.",,1,

29,Jerome T.,"New York, NY",99,372,3046,1.0,9/2/2018,"There's a reason why Newark tends to be the cheaper airport: it sucks. On many levels. Level 1- food options. Sucks. Level 2- good luck trying to take a train back into the city when your flight arrives at 5am or closer to midnight. Just sucks. Level 3- too tired to take public transportation home to NY, so you want to ball out and cab it back ? That's gonna cost you a months rent, Ringo. Fucking sucks. Level 4- all the employees who work here. Well, they suck at all 3 airports, but the ones here are the worst of the worst. I'm not a betting man, but I'd bet your entire life savings that these people were working at McDonald's prior to getting this job. Suck Deeznuts, you a-holes! Level 5- airline options. United. Sucks. Continental. Sucks. Sun Country. Yes, that's a real airline. Dumb  sucks. Every 3 to 4 years, I forget how terrible this shit show is and I press, "" buy ticket "", after carefully hunting for a bargain.

Once you arrive at your gate, you will be pleasantly surprised to find an iPad at each seat. It will take your order and you can pay right there and then the order gets delivered to you. Amazing! You just scan your ticket so they get an idea of how much time you got for the dine in experience. There are also iPad games that my son played with which are cool.

First off they have mobil entry which vastly simplifies getting back into the states from overseas.  Only issue was folks at passport control were talking amongst themselves for 10 minutes while the queue was building and not helping a single passenger. But the process itself is cool- no more paper and fewer lines. There are many shops and restaurants all seem to have ipad ordering which is fast and fun. No waiting around to order or pay which is great when you have a quick connection but want to grab a bite. The variety of food choices was impressive. I found a raman joint.

Near the gates there are sorts of food and drink to grab before your departure. If you want to grab some NYC or NJ souvenirs they have that available as well.On arrival for domestic flight it's pretty simple and quick to get out about. But going through customs gets a bit tedious. You'll have to fill out a paper form on flight before you land. Then you wait in line to use a scanner which will print out your Identification. Through random selection you might have to stand in another for further ""screening"" which will consist of them asking you where you went and for how long. Baggage claim comes next, but grab a pillow because you'll have some time before your bags arrive. When you finally get your bags, have those paper you filled out the plane ready because they'll collect them right before you're exit.

Down the jetway we went - and lo and behold - right back out onto the tarmac to board another shuttle bus - to take us to yet another United Express regional jet parked somewhere out on the tarmac.We boarded, and then waited for the next shuttle bus to arrive with the remaining travelers.On the return trip through EWR - we landed and deplaned at Terminal A - which meant we actually deplaned directly into a Terminal. I then took a another shuttle bus ride - again over to Terminal C.The flight home was on a larger United jet - so we actually boarded from Terminal C directly - no shuttle bus. The gate area was way to small to accommodate everyone in line and the lines for the adjacent gate.Terminal C felt like being in a large shopping mall at Christmas time - packed with to many people, shoulder to shoulder, people not watching where they are going.Newark needs to be torn down, and rebuilt with a lot more terminal space for gate seating and lines, and a lot more physical gates.I will attempt to avoid using this airport in the future.#NewarkLibertyInternationalAirport",4,1,1

36,Hoa L.,"San Antonio, TX",160,461,889,4.0,9/7/2018,"This airport is shaped like a star with many wings for each airline. That can lead to smaller lines for security upon entrance to each airline. At the same time, it's also a little inconvenient for someone who wants different food or store options because you have to walk in and back out of security to be able to reach the other airlines say for lounges. Each wing is also pretty small, so options are few. I know they said there were recent renovations going on, so I'm assuming the airport used to be either dirtier, less organized or some mix of both.  Access to this airport from Manhattan is very convenient as there is a bus that will take you directly to Newark from Manhattan. It's a pretty inexpensive $20 trip and takes about 30-45 or so minutes depending on traffic.",1,1,1
37,Samantha M.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",335,75,75,4.0,10/27/2018,Newark airport has always been a very high volume airport.

There are many good options and the new tablets in the terminals are a great time passer and tool for passengers while waiting for your devices to charge up.,1,,1
38,Richard A.,"Branford, CT",20,353,657,4.0,7/6/2018,This is a great airport that has numerous flights to choose from.

They installed electronic pads at the United gates that you could play games for free or order food and drinks with your United charge card.  The area is huge and it's a nice way to wait for your flight. The best feature about this airport is that they have a train stop for both the New Jersey Transit system and Amtrak . It also has a lot of eating options.,,,

You see, they provide lots of space for passengers to get around. It feels cavernous when compared to LGA and easier to get from one terminal to another than JFK. Now outside the airport, I have no idea what's it like. But inside, it's not bad. Food options are m'eh at best and I really miss their pizza option near Gate 93, but ...  it is what it is.

Because it's not perfect, but it's a pretty nice airport.   ---   ---   ---Pros: Walking through terminal C, it just feels like a pleasant place to be. It has a pretty unique look for an airport, in that, there are a lot of upper/middle tiered restaurants all throughout the terminal. Just about all of them have iPads at every seat, which allow you to order at your own pace. I've definitely never seen another airport quite like it.Meh: The wife has flown here more often than I have and she says that as nice as it all looks, there's a lack of cheaper, quick-service options. She also had a pretty bad experience last time she was here in terms of ordering a sandwich that turned out to be pretty inedible. Cons: The train that takes you from the main concourse to the other terminals is painfully slow. It moves at a snail's pace and spends way too much time stopped at each terminal. This would drive me crazy if I regularly flew in and out of Newark. I haven't spent a ton of time at LGA or JFK, but from what I remember and what I hear, they are basically a couple of human wasteland's. I'll opt for Newark on any future NYC trip if I can swing it!",6,1,2

In fact it has great restaurants and all kinds of well groomed shops. All I'm going to say is this if the owners, handlers, designers, or bean counters of this airport were to get the checkpoint area in order this airport might have a chance to be considered a go to airport.I give this airport a 3 star rating because it's only saving grace are actually the restaurants and various shops!",4,3,1

Updated review","Not a fan of Newark Liberty Airport. Some things to improve;Baggage pickup - there is a reason why airlines put a priority tag on some bags. People with priority tags on their checked luggage usually get off first. The baggage handlers here, offloaded the non priority bags first. So the people who got off first watched as their bags piled onto the first bags on the carousel which were non priority.Shuttle trains - the trains have small compartments for the passengers. Many other airports have a big car to pile into quickly. These smaller compartments filled up quickly due to inefficient passengers.TSA Precheck line - the line split into two separate lines. One line was serviced by three agents, the other by one. So one line went three times faster.Update: I just landed at terminal A and caught the shuttle to C. My bag got caught in the door of the shuttle (see picture lol) no worries, the shuttle must go on.In my opinion, this place is not managed very wel",20,9,11
43,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3652,952,2095,3.0,4/18/2018,The airport is conveniently located and usually easy to get to. We fly out of here very often and havent had a issue.Security line moves quickly but I would recommend getting the tsa precheck if you can. Baggage claim is solid too and you can get off your flight and grab your bag pretty quickly. Another great part is that uber's can you pick you up right at the terminal rather than having to be at a designated area. Convenience is huge when at an airport and newark has a lot of that.This airport is much better than the jfk or laguardia. Those airports are TERRIBLE.,16,7,12
44,John D.,"Bronx, NY",11,91,7,4.0,9/11/2018,"I flew out of EWR Newark on my most recent trip overseas and it was overall a pleasant experience. Note that I can't speak for the parking and I didn't have any checked luggage, but the air train came pretty often, and was easy to make connections to NJ Transit to get to/from the NYC area pretty quickly. $13 for a one way ticket to NY Penn Station (includes air train fare). Because you have to cross a bridge or go through a tunnel ($15-$18 toll cash), any cab going to the NY side is going to be a less economical option.I didn't have any issues with getting through security (long lines, backlog, slow moving, etc), and the CBP personnel coming back in were surprisingly pleasant, and smooth overall process. I'd prefer JFK due to my location, but Newark isn't too bad. LGA, due to the construction, is congested and super busy, although most conveniently located for Manhattan/Queens/the Bronx. My main complaint was that many of the outlets to charge your phone didn't work. The wifi was spotty throughout the airport, but I've experienced that at most of the airports I've been to. This is a convenient airport if you're coming from NJ, particularly central or southern NJ, Staten Island, downtown Manhattan, and some parts of Brooklyn. I wouldn't want to spend a ton of time in any airport, but this doesn't seem to be a horrible option if necessary.",,,

As I walked toward my gate in terminal C  you could see that they don't take care of this place. From the overflowing trash bins, the water leaks from the roof ( with no buckets or wet signs)  The bathrooms were no better, messy and out of supplies. Maybe it was a really off day.... but  2 weeks later when I traveled through here again it was the same story. There are a lot of food choices here, but most are expensive. Be prepared to pay a lot for mediocre food. Each terminal has a bunch of options but the lines were long. Service seems super slow and unorganized.

It is a typical airport and staff we interacted with were helpful and directed us the right way. I really love there is a ton of seating in the baggage claim area along with food eateries as you wait for those arriving. There is also a USO at this airport which is nice for our military families.

If you're expecting Club Med, this ain't your place.But Newark -is- an airport where everyone seems to know his/her job. And, in my experience, they do it well. Let's be honest ... It's not the security guy's fault when some imbecile shows up at the check-in with a bottled water and multi-tool. And when you start acting like a horse's ass because of your mistake, it just ruins it for the rest of us. It's true: New Jersey people aren't the best in the world when it comes to PR. That's a good thing. I married a Jersey Girl, after all, because she was quick to tell me of my shortcomings. Same thing with the folks at this airport, and I prefer it that way. You should too.Everything else here -- restaurants, bathrooms, kiosks and so on -- are on par with pretty much every other airport. Wanna get wasted before you hop on a plane? There's a place for that near your gate. Looking for a slice, a sandwich or a periodical? You can find those too.

Despite not being upgraded as often as I think I should be, this was a delightful customer experience.I don't come to NY/NJ too often, but I'd consider a layover here instead of Dulles in the future.

It may be the best one because it's not as busy. The only bad thing is you're farther away from the city. It looks pretty kept up for an airport. Bathrooms were clean. The airport has three terminals. It has a train to get you around. There are New Jersey Transit busses that stop out the front. It's pretty easy to get a shuttle or taxi, which you will probably need if you aren't familiar with the local transportation.

Once we got through the long lines in US Customs, we thought (and were told) that we had plenty of time to make our flight.  We didn't realize that we, coming from a secure, international flight, after going thru Customs, would be dumped out into the un-secure area with the masses.   It would take 50 min to go though security at our destination gate.   Why must we go thru security again after coming in from an international flight when we are just trying to make a domestic connection? TSA at this ill-placed security confiscated orange juice that I got on the international flight!  We barely made our flight and were the last ones to board the plane.  We didn't have time to eat or use the restroom.

I (in no way a runner, lacking any conditioning to make running anything but painful) ran a bit of the way, passing some gates and plenty of shops. There with how large of an airport (or at least for just the one terminal I was in), I was shocked they did not have any moving walkways. Or trams, or other ways connecting you from one place to another. I made it to my gate 7 minutes before my phone app and the screen on the wall said it was supposed to take off, the door was closed and there was no one at the desk. Out of breath and panting I asked the gate agent directly next to my gate, if this plane had boarded/left/was further delayed than the screen showed.

I moved out to the West Coast via Newark Liberty in 2013, and my parents have used this airport the most throughout my childhood for trips to Asia because they simply like the traffic surrounding the airport the most, in comparison to JFK and LaGuardia. As a longtime Queens resident, I barely blink at the traffic around JFK or LaGuardia, it's nothing special and nothing specially scary. Overall, I dislike Newark Liberty since it hasn't been updated, is waaaay out of the way of NYC public transit (if you live in Jersey City, Hoboken, or anywhere hitting the PATH train, this airport totally makes sense), and TSA is always a shade worse than anywhere else and the agents are especially antagonistic. Or maybe just frazzled from the procedure being a little unusual (see below).  Pros: spacious, less congested than the other 2 in the NYC trifectaSome parts are renovated and look nicer than JFK or LaGuardia, which have been largely relics of the 70s. Cons: If you're in a wheelchair or carrying kids in strollers, bless your soul, you will hate your life for the next hour or more. We took Alaska air and had a rental car at gate p3 (p2 and p3 are car rentals) and there 3 elevators (+monorail) you'll need to wait for that appear to be chaperoned (not sure why, they're transparent so it's not like I'd be in there smoking crack). Clearly the architect loved split levels because each is like a half floor but a lot of up and down hassle for a short distance. TSA was a gargantuan bitch here. I feel like the line is always long AND inefficient (in contrast to JFK where the line is often indeed long but it seems to just move) and I'm always getting shouted at. The corridor is long, narrow, single file and hosts 2 way traffic of ppl outgoing and inbound. The last time I was here in June 2018 they ran the TSA line slightly differently from most other airports I've been to, which didn't really help with efficiency b/c everyone gets confused once you get to the scanning part. They had every 2-3 parties up in line load their stuff onto the belt at the same time, which makes for a mess getting everyone's stuff sequentially onto the belt. It was the first time I've seen this kind of format for TSA and clearly this was also the case for everyone else. Petty crime (in the past -- not sure about now)",1,,

The landside lounge and the airtrain. Sounds a bit fussy, I know but anything to take away from the bordem of airport life. I am an Airport Lounge Lush and majority of lounges are airside so just knowing that EWR offers a landside lounge in Terminal B is incredible.

There are insufficient power outlets near the main gates, the international terminal (B) is incredibly slow (with polite services), and the food offering is sparse and unfortunately, very rude. Furthermore, the priority pass may get you into a few lounges, but they are terminal specific and there are no ways of getting to them after checking in.",1,1,
75,Mandy K.,"Green Hills, Nashville, TN",389,152,219,1.0,9/10/2018,"It's no secret New Jersey has some things they are not proud of. They need to add Newark Liberty Airport to that list. This was the consummate one star experience.  They've been at this a long time. There is simply no excuse for complete ineptitude. I should not have to wait for TWO HOURS after landing for my luggage. Laughable. If only I could laugh about it. The luggage alarm would sound. Belt would start. Belt would stop. (With no bags)This went on for over an hour. Not an airport representative in sight. (PS there were no weather issues this day, and there was only one other flight awaiting bags)Newark is one of the busiest international airports in the country. I'm ashamed that this is how we welcome our international travelers (let alone domestic). Passport control had only 2 agents on duty (At Newark airport... just to reiterate!) Each kiosk had a haphazardly placed, handwritten number that was hardly legible, but officials got huffy with travelers who couldn't determine which kiosk they were being sent to. (Many of whom were just arriving in this country with limited English skills... again, INTERNATIONAL airport) The bathrooms... Ew. I could go on and on. But I've given this airport enough of my time. There are 2 things I hope to gain by writing this review. 1. Newark Liberty powers that be read their feedback and take better pride in ownership in the airport experience 2. Travelers read this review and route elsewhere. Tampa is a fabulous international airport. Also I would suggest using a mid sized US city as your international entry point. It will likely be a friendlier, more streamlined and cleaner experience.",8,5,4
76,Donna R.,"Warren, NJ",510,476,5069,3.0,6/22/2018,"I have found it really depends on who your flying on when it comes to Newark Airport. United is the biggest carrier at this airport.They are located in Terminal C. We arrived 3hrs early for our domestic flight because I was traveling with a handicapped person who needed wheelchair assistance.( FYI it's best to call UNITED's Assessability desk . You can pre-arranged to have a wheelchair at the airport when you arrive to bring you  to your plane, and also meet you at the plane to bring you back to your gate when you arrive.) You must arrive at the airport at least 2-1/2 hours ahead because there are so many people using wheelchairs that It's on a first come first serve basis even with a reservation. There are not enough helpers to assist all the travelers at once,  So you have to be patient and wait until each person can be done. Newark airport uses an outside company to handle all wheelchair assistance. I highly recommend getting TSA approved check-in...It can be really difficult having to go through the main TSA check in. The person in the wheelchair still has to go through security and the wheelchair is taken away and it was put through the security-screening process with an agent. I was separated from my family member and patted down so I could not assist them when they were going through security check in. This person wound up sitting on the floor waiting for me and holding up the conveyor belt because the wheelchair wasn't put through with the agent first The TSA check in is much better, it's much faster and you don't have to take your shoes off. I wasn't separated from my family member. Once at the terminal you can sit at tables next to gate and  order your food through their iPad listings The food Will be delivered right to where you're sitting.( FYI - the prices here are pretty steep. Good thing I wasn't paying.)  Make sure when you have a wheelchair that you do not give it up until you board the plane. Getting another wheelchair to take you to the plane will take time and if you have to go to the bathroom, or want food it will be very difficult.There are quite a few bars and restaurants to choose from while waiting to board. There are also places to shop for souvenirs or T-shirts,  magazines, and purchase food to take on the plane. Most flights only give you a two oz bag of pretzels, and a soda even on a six hour domestic flight. There is very little leg room on the domestic flights flying economy. I would highly recommend using frequent flyer miles or paying to upgrade if you're a big person. The seats are very narrow, and very cramped.( Another tip is to make sure you Download the United Airlines app on your phone iPad, or computer before boarding the plane. You no longer get a movie on board unless you're traveling in first class. If you download the app on the ground it's free to watch on your device. Once the plane takes off you Can not upload the app unless you pay $23. That will get you Internet service for a short time. The first six rows of economy have electrical plug-ins to charge your phone or computer. The rest of the plane does not. If you want to sit in bulkhead it's an extra fee. I highly suggest checking your bags at the curb with a skycap. I found it to be extremely convenient and our bags were one of the first off the plane. if you're having someone meet you at the airport it's best to have them meet you at departures versus arrivals. It's much easier to get in and out this way.  There is also a designated area where you can have the person meeting you pull over and wait until it's closer to the time to pick you up. Overall my experience at Newark airport was a good one. Just make sure he you arrive early, you have your seats and you checkin at the curb. The lines can get really long with United airlines.",5,3,6

Updated review",Update needed but rating unchanged at three stars. My fellow local yelpers what's the story this is the only Airport in the United States that hasn't been renovated. The terminals look exactly like they did forty years ago albeit change in retail and food concessionaires which is about it. Even the restrooms need expansion to accommodate the millions of passengers visiting this airport. The positives are plenty of flights and airlines. To get a rental car is far easier just get on the tram. Years ago this was off site and you would have to take a shuttle bus. Plenty of rental car companies as well as choices of transportation. Food could be better options are sparse. Grab something to carry you over to next stop. Yesterday I brought food with me so only needed to purchase a refreshment and snack at the terminal before boarding. I am hopeful that one day my hometown airport will get a much needed re-do until than it is just a missed opportunity and disservice to everyone that uses this airport.,19,9,14

Newark is pretty easy to get to from the city quick train ride to Penn station then u pop onto NJ transit 3 stops & u are at the airport. I agree with some of the past reviews in that no one seems to know what's going on, It took us 3 different people to figure out where the security check was for our airline. Getting through security check was easy enough but man oh man they practically stripped search me no clue the last time I went through all that.There are a few shops & places to keep u busy while you wait, we ended up getting some drinks at the bar right before take off. our flight ended up being delayed by 45 minutes in the end not terrible considering it can always be worse overall travel wise not bad if you have no other choice.",8,,4

I was expecting to do a little bit of duty-free shopping on my way back to Copenhagen since my checked-in luggage had no more capacity. Relax, I said to myself, there should be plenty of big duty-free shops in the airport since this airport is serving New York City. Right? WRONG.EWR terminal B where SAS (Scandinavian Airlines) is is very small. There is a minuscule duty-free shop staffed by two people (one at the cashier, one roaming around that eventually went to the ""toilet"" for over 15 minutes). I couldn't even find the stuff I need from Clinique that is usually available in duty-free shops around the world. Apart from this, they apparently have a duty-free shelf near the common terminal where there's a small selection of liquor and spirits.Don't get me started on the dining section, there were probably two cafes and one small kiosk that was crowded up to the point of ""Forget about getting a bottled water before the flight"".Ugh. Please upgrade this terminal a little bit better. I heard the other terminal is slightly bearable, but I'm also used to the glitzy big airports like Schiphol or even my home city Copenhagen with lots of shops, and I wish I had done my shopping in the city instead.",,,

88,Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",73,261,402,1.0,12/16/2017,"*sigh* This f*cking place. -_-I hate this airport. So much. Like, it actually makes LESS sense than the Fort Lauderdale airport. But in order to describe just how much of a clusterf*ck this place is, I have to mention each and every idiosyncrasy which you would otherwise never find in any other airport. Well, maybe a few. For example..Here, we have possibly the only other airport I've been to since Miami where TSA Precheck means nothing and there is no such thing as expedited security checks. I mean, yeah...I get to keep my shoes on. But the laptop, belt and all pocket items still come out. So, who gives a shit about expedited check in? Really.Next, this airport's layout is a complete train wreck! Have you ever been to an airport that had SEPARATE security checkpoints for each range of gates? Well, neither have I. Until EWR, that is. And this really brings my piss to a boil because I wanted to go have a seafood dinner at Phillips; but it was behind a different series of gates I wasn't flying out from. And I wasn't about to walk thru security checks 3 times. So..Another factor that just adds to the Tomfoolery that is this layout is the mind boggling fact this airport doesn't have a skytrain. So, to get from one terminal to another, you walk up to what ostensibly looks like an airplane gate...only to take a ramp that leads outside...to a bus. The bus drives you to your next terminal and it's slower than snails porking. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!So, if you should happen to have a less than one hour layover, just...just hang it up. You're probably gonna miss your connecting flight.But thankfully I had about a 5 hour layover, only to also discover that EWR hosts one of the worst United Club lounges I've ever had the disappointment of visiting. See my review for that if you haven't already.And there you have it. A first account review of why this abomination aptly deserves its #2 spot on the top ten list for worst airports in America. Seriously. Look it up. It's a thing.EWR: truly worthy of 1 long ass line of vexed frequent flyers at the security checkpoint out of 5. What the f*ck, Newark?!",8,5,2

My preferred airline is United and I am forever finding great deals and cheap flights leaving and coming from Newark airport. Usually TSA line goes by pretty fast so I haven't encountered any issues with that yet. If you want to drive and park your car by the airport, there are many parking spots around that you pay daily.

Updated review","We flew twice from San Jose to Newark airport instead of JFK as no direct daytime flights from San Jose to JFK.  $380 round trip Alaska Airlines daytime direct to Newark.  No west coast flights to/from LaGuardia. Tiny bathrooms.  Every time we arrive, wife has to sprint to beat the line at the women's bathroom.  No lines at the men's room but you got to watch where you stand in front of urinal, as they don't mop the floor  often!As we leave the airport, pass by a huge TSA screening line going the opposite way.Circular design, so short walk from the terminal to train or ridesharing area.  A minimum of three trains to get to midtown Manhattan.  Easy to get an Uber pickup, with fares of $45 and $52 going to West 57th by Hilton in mid Manhattan on a Sunday evening. Coming back twice on Friday afternoons, the Uber fares were $74 and $90, even though the Lincoln Tunnel EZ pass fee of $12.50 is only for entering NYC, not leaving.   $25 surcharge for NYC cabs discharging passengers at Newark.  Pricey driving the 17 miles from Manhattan, compared to the $52 fixed yellow cab fee to JFK, also 17 miles, before $8 toll.Friday afternoon, long delay getting through the shorter TSA preferred line.  10 minute wait at the luggage conveyer belt through x-ray.  TSA personnel here lackluster and inefficient.After getting to the terminals, no drinking fountains to fill up your empty water bottles.  They want you to fork over $2 for water!Circular design means a limited number of seats in gate area, so a lot of people left standing around.  No electrical outlets for recharging in the sitting areas.  One plug in the wall next to the line of standing passengers waiting to board.  I pay $1.25 for each of two apples to get me through the 6 hour flight home.  There is also a restaurant which serves lobster sandwiches.   I could not write this review using the free but extremely weak airport wifi.   I could not even get into Yelp to read airport reviews!  Other reviews had nothing memorable to say.",26,16,19

That being said the only positive thing about the airport is its location. Other than that your experience will definitely not be a good one. I don't think I've ever had a flight that left on time or that was able to pull right up to the gate. I fly in and out about 5 times a year. In addition you won't find friendly staff at the airport and you will most definitely need to hunt for your baggage claim (although this has gotten slightly better in the last decade). It's sad that the airport suffers this sever mismanagement as it does provide a nice alternative to the much more efficient although more distant airports in NYC.

She still removes her shoes and goes through the detector yet it's done with explanation and pleasure. Once inside the gates are easy to travel through and easy to find.

Now this airport is very boring specifically with Terminal A. The security check here is not in sync and very unorganized. There was not many passengers going through security but somehow the process took long (29 minutes) and 13 people in front of me. This is pretty ridiculous waiting that long. I been at busier airports and can move through the line faster. After the bad and annoying security line process, I knew I had to endure boredom. EWR have few food choices with a Boar's Head sandwich shop, Ben & Jerrys, and a small Hudson News gift shop.

Compared to there, this was a pleasure!I hadn't been in quite a few years since I flew to Israel. I remember it being a lot bigger and a tad more chaotic. I was surprised to find on our recent trip to Iceland it wasn't how I remembered it at all....We really had no issues ....with finding gates, going through security, checking passports and border control. We did leave and arrive at off times I suppose, so maybe that had something to do with it? Not sure. Everything was clean including the restrooms. Starbucks and booze were easily accessible. Perfect. The shops were actually quite higher end and included La Mer. Ok now, I see you Newark. Adequate charging stations. The only complaint would be the prices of the food but that's going to be at any airport so I can't really fault this particular one, it's standard. Plan ahead. *We did however encounter something here we hadn't before which was a K-9 check. At the baggage carousel after we landed back in the states we were all instructed to step away from our bags and let this oh so adorable pup (definitely NOT the kind I've seen used for this) sniff around. It was just for training purposes and I of course had to be told not to play with him. It was exciting and he was delicious! We didn't mind the little wait at all, but some may. So heads up. He did actually pee on a someone's bag so guys, if he's fired, please feel free to message me!! I'll take him :) Oh, and if you have your pup with you, there's a Astro-turf doggy run and bath station outside near the human restrooms near border control. Our experience was easy breezy.

To start off, the drive to the terminals were super confusing and lanes are not clearly labeled. I took a Lyft to the airport and even though I was not driving, I was feeling stressed because of how crowded and confusing the lanes were. EWR is a big airport with a bunch of terminals. I don't mind that it was crowded, I just did not like how everything was so unorganized. I have TSA pre check and the TSA pre check line was not clearly labeled. On top of that, TSA agents were rudely screaming at everyone. A passenger was asking if the TSA pre check line was on the left or the right and he got yelled at by the TSA agent, which was super uncalled for.  I was shocked by how long the TSA pre check line was. I have flew out of JFK multiple times and even the TSA pre check lines there were not as bad. I also hated the luggage scanning process. You have to put everything, even your carry on luggage in a tray and push the tray to another lane for it to move forward. It was very inefficient and disorganized. On top of all of that, bathrooms seem to be very limited here. You have to walk quite a while to find one. I took a flight out of this airport instead of JFK or LGA because of the cheaper airfare.

There are not many airport terminals anywhere I've been that have the set up that was built here. In fact if I ever would have a flight delay I hope it would be in an airport terminal like this.  The whole terminal is set up with comfortable seating areas that surround a restaurant and bar set up that has your own I Pad and charging  station as well as electrical outlets. If you want to order drinks or food, track your flight, read news or sports and even use Facebook you just access the I Pad while you have a couple drinks, snacks or a meal.  If you eat at the restaurant areas which also have big screen TV's, there are servers who are friendly and helpful to still add the personal touch as you order wines , beers, drinks or food, and even explain the selections even though you can access that on the I Pad.   The  menu sections on the I Pad let you scroll through the different menus, you place the order and the items are just added to the bill section as well and there is even a ""Bill"" section to track it. The servers set your place settings and bring you the drinks and food. It was really a nice experience and you can sit with other passengers to share the experience with or go to a space by yourself to get work done on your laptop. At each of the gates they have the seating areas with the I Pad to order drinks and food there as well and the service is a delivery service right to where you are sitting.  What a great way to stay close to your gate and still get the same service. I found out that all the employees in Terminal C work for the company that set this up called OTG Restaurants.  They really made this a great way for passengers to travel. The areas are clean and you get a great deal of personal service. I sat down right in front of the big screen and watched the football game I did not want to miss, ordered a great wine from Washington State that was recommended and I even got to taste first. Had a wonderful Caeser Salad and kept track of my flight. Although you swipe your card to start the ordering, they close the bill out after a half hour to avoid people walking away.  Just had to start a new tab and could continue to add to the bill right on the I Pad. I must mention unrelated to the new set up, that I was extremely pleased with the choice of fares in and out of Newark as opposed to the other two airports in the NY area.  The terminal is smaller, pick up and drop off easy and the Air Tran makes it quick and convenient to get around as I used that on my last trip. It is not like one has a choice what to fly most of the time but when I come back it is going to be through Newark and United Airlines in Terminal C.",9,2,8

After checking in and making my way through security (where praise the TSA Gods of Airline Travel they didn't make me take off my shoes!!) I wandered towards my gate. As I wandered, I noticed a lot of tables with iPads and charging stations. I had work to do and wanted to plug up my computer, so I sat down at one. Low and behold, the iPads are for ordering food and bev. I told the magic iPad to bring me a cappuccino with soy milk and 5-minutes later, here comes my caffeine. God bless technology! I got so comfortable at my little make-shift work station that I was almost late for my flight. After I shut down and packed up, I tried to stop by the restroom on the way to the gate but there was a line at least 20-women deep. Weird. I just held it until I got on the plane.

154,Kristian D.,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",369,1304,3330,2.0,2/2/2018,"It is somewhat depressing to experience the state of airports in the New York area. I chose the Newark Liberty International Airport since it was closest to my destination on the west side of lower Manhattan. The airport is part of the Port Authority's three main airports serving the region. It is located in New Jersey and has connections to Amtrak and regional trains.The airport was part of the jet age design for airports in which travelers would arrive by car, buy a ticket in cash, grab a pack of Lucky Strikes, and board a plane headed for anywhere. Reality has set in with modern security and operational delays forcing travelers to spend a lot more time in the airport. Newark is a bit better than LaGuardia, but it still suffers from many of the concerns.The interior of the main ticketing hall is open and bright, but the baggage area is starkly cramped and weird directly underneath. Security is tight, both in terms of searches and delays and the space allowed for inspections. My checked baggage was checked by TSA twice, so pack a thank you note inside for the random agents stuck searching your dirty underwear.The terminal area for Southwest reminds me of San Diego, but not in a good way. The facilities were never designed to handle hundreds of delayed passengers with little concession or restroom capacity. Seating is tight, although the wraparound windows do provide a nice open feel.I am glad to hear that New York is finally improving their airports, but the delays at Newark are just unacceptable. We spent nearly an hour waiting on the ground to take off. Even the airlines now schedule for the delays, meaning I lost an hour of precious sleep and comfort just because people cannot get their act together. I do not recommend flying into New York. For such a large city, there are really too few runways and airports. International flights have no choice, but domestic flights are annoying, especially using Newark. Take the train to New York instead. It is better than LaGuardia, but that is not the most useful comparison. Work on the delays, upgrade the terminals with better connections and services, add lots of room for security to make the process faster and safer, and also work on the delays!",17,7,11

She was flying United. The airport terminals are broken down into 3 sections - A, B, and C. When you see the sign for terminal A, it says ""United Express."" So to me (and my friends), that's United. Cool. Let's wait here. Well something told me to go inside because I didn't see any bags on the belt inside. Me and one of my road trip pals went inside and there was a welcome kiosk. I explained to the gentleman there that we needed to pick someone up, but they had to go through customs and asked where they'd come out of. He explained to me that terminal A was for United domestic only, not international. The signs for terminals B and C outside didn't say anything about United international. In fact, they didn't say United at all. The man told me to take the escalator up a level and look at the flight board for United, and we could then tell if she'd be at terminal B or C. So we did that, I went to the bathroom really quick, and then headed to terminal B.Terminal B had 3 levels. 2 of them (levels 1 and 3) said ""arrivals,"" whereas level 2 said ""departures."" So to us, obviously she'll be in level 1 or 3, right? Wrong. She was in fact let out at level 2 for departures. The layout and the signs at this airport are wonky to say the least.

Gone are the McDonald's and Subways (though there are still Starbucks kiosks for your caffeine fix). I fly with United normally out of Terminal C, which looks way more modern than it used to look (though Gates 95 and 97 are kind of still dinky looking - you take an elevator down to a small waiting area with not much in terms of seating). Going through security is orderly and doesn't take too long for domestic flights. Departing from and arriving to Newark International usually always goes smoothly. I haven't waited a long time at baggage claim. The ground transportation area is OK, though it can get packed. Also, transportation options to get to the airport are varied. Aside from driving there (or taking a ride-share), I've taken NJ Transit to EWR a few times. It's cool to have the option, but it can be confusing if you are taking it for the first-time. You take the Northeast Corridor line to the Airport stop, then an airtrain to your terminal (there are also stops at airport parking garages). Then you have to walk a long while to get to security.

This airport is a relic of pre-9/11 design where security screening was an afterthought and making airports a comfortable place that reflect a city's identity was unheard of. Three terminals are connected by a train system that is prior to security screening. This means changing terminals requires rescreening.  But it gets worse.  Each security checkpoint only services about ten gates.  So even changing gates may mean repeated screening.   And, most food, drinks and restrooms are at the pre-security section of the terminal. So you got it, going out for food means screening again too. Fortunately screening lines were short onour visit and we have TSA pre-check. That helped.  Regional transit is nice in that both Amtrak and NJTransit service the airport directly. Hopefully with renovation will come improvement.  A final issue is food and shopping are all national chains.  There is no effort to recognize local businesses in the airport.  Room for improvement.",,,

We waited for so long the other day until we finally boarded the plane towards Myrtle Beach, SC to find out that the pilot ran away because her wife was giving birth. We had to get off the plane and waited for announcements and then they cancelled the flight. The airline said there was another flight departing from LaGuardia a few hours later and that they will provide a free shuttle bus from Newark. We did take it, but it was the longest day of my life. So annoying dealing with customer service and the traffic to get to the next airport. We arrived safely, but like 12 hours later than expected. This doesn't have anything to do with the actual airport, but the airline. So, I would say that this airport is very clean, and nice and not too far from the city if the traffic is good. I would definitely travel from here again.",4,,2
190,Holly K.,"Raleigh, NC",2285,1209,3807,4.0,6/21/2018,"I don't mind Newark airport as long as you don't get stuck in the desolate delta terminal, with literally one food option. Otherwise the United terminal is huge and very nice. We fly in here to go to my in laws and for us it is easier than going to Laguardia or JFK because although miles wise it's similar the traffic is always just a mess leaving either of the other two airports. The United terminal is updated and has about a million food options and around 200 gates. Give yourself a bit of extra time as you may be trekking a bit to get to your gate. I also dislike the Delta terminal since they don't really care about TSA pre-check, you still have to take your liquids out and go through the same screen lines as everyone else once you pass the initial checkpoint. Overall we will continue to fly through here due to the connivence of coming and going!",,2,3

Terminal C is the best terminal in this airport because they have tons of bars, modern restaurants, local foods, a spa and the Bazaar where you can get amazing food and snacks. Terminal A is much smaller and older looking with only a couple of food options. I haven't been to terminal B. There's a shuttle to get to and from the different terminals. They're doing construction so there are tons of detours. I saw that some folks who were already in terminal C how to go thru security a second time to get to terminal B. I'd personally come early to the terminal just to check out the food options. There are a ton of fun snacks and drinks you can get.",2,,2
192,Charlie C.,"Manhattan, NY",201,46,9,1.0,10/3/2018,"I thought LaGuardia was bad. A disorganized mess from the poorly design AirTrain to the lack of usable internet (hey management, it's not 1998 and dial up) to departure. Airports don't have to be a disaster. Aim higher.",,,

194,Angie M.,"Iron Junction, MN",0,9,0,3.0,11/12/2018,"Flew to this airport when going to New York from Minneapolis on business. This airport was alright. It took over an hour of sitting on the plane before it had even attempted to take off, found this to be extremely bothersome. Also took forever for our bags to come out. Seems they were really busy or just behind, not sure. I e been to this airport twice now and it's just not the best of you get my drift!",,,
195,Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",134,686,304,1.0,6/26/2018,"Newark is a garbage airport and I will never forget a United Airlines employee refusing to give us a ride on his empty cart because the connection was so far away. Instead, he pointed in the direction of the gate and said ""it's right over there."" Well, it wasn't. It was a few blocks of running far down the terminal. If I ever come through here again it will be too soon.",1,,

There are clearly marked areas for arrivals and departures. I typically fly out of B Gate and always able to get in and out easily. For pick up, the lower levels have 5 different pick up zones so scheduling pick up is easy. Get up, get out and explore.",,,
198,Bethany E.,"Henderson, NV",990,1037,4280,4.0,5/21/2017,"Being married to a pilot, he made a very strong suggestion to fly into EWR instead of the other larger NY airports.   When he's right, he's right.  Newark Airport is very easy to navigate upon arrival.   We knew we were taking the train into NY Penn Station.  The signage was clear and well marked.   The train access into NYC is definitely adding to my positive review.  Rather than spending an insane amount on a cab or Uber especially during a peak time, taking a 25 minute ride on a train was painless.  Departing was just as easy.  We had no issue going back through security.  Having an early morning flight I didn't know what to expect.  There were barely any passengers in line so it went fast.  I was happy with my efficient service here.  Happy Travels!",11,6,5
199,Lisa H.,"Atlanta, GA",171,812,381,3.0,12/25/2017,"EWR, aka Newark Liberty International Airport, was fine. Upon landing, it was pretty easy to saunter out and find the rideshare space to meet the Uber driver. I was flying Delta. The terminal looked a little old and not modern, but oh well, wasn't spending much time there.It's worth taking a few minutes to look up where your airline is at EWR since there are different terminals (A, B, and C) and levels. Going to the departing flight, the Uber driver asked about the terminal and was met with blank looks and ""Uhhhh""s. The food options at the terminal were pretty lame and scanty. Thank goodness for eating beforehand. The flight was delayed, and there were no amusing stores to pop into either.Fun facts about EWR from the official website:*This airport opened in 1928, making it the USA's oldest airfield.*It's also the location of the country's first commercial airline terminal.*Amelia Earhart helped dedicate the terminal building in 1935.*Newark Liberty is actually located both in Newark and Elizabeth.*In 2014, EWR hosted 395,525 ""plane movements"" and 35,610,759 passengers.",1,1,1
