0,Liz K.,"New York, NY",301,217,809,4.0,6/13/2018,"Cocktails here are $14-15, but they sound better than they taste. The Perfect G&T tasted like a G&T and wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't anything to write home about or drop $15 (plus tax and tip) on. ""Perfect"" it was not. The Strictly Prickly was similarly good-not-amazing. The real draw here is the wood-paneled loungey ambiance, not the cocktails. Maybe stick to beer or well drinks, and nurse them while you and your friend or date soak it in. While the front rooms and bar area were poppin', with every seat taken, the restaurant was spacious and mostly empty. Not ghostly-empty, but nice and intimate. We didn't have to raise our voices to be heard, which is a rarity in restaurants downtown. The food was, on the whole, really tasty. The tagliatelle wasn't anything special, but my friend loved her steak and both desserts were tasty. The coffee was surprisingly good, and I really appreciated that they not only had nondairy milk but didn't charge extra for it! Our server was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and really sweet. All the waitstaff were really helpful, from clearing dishes to keeping our water glasses full to showing us where the restroom is. We were easily there for two hours, and never felt rushed to leave, even after we'd finished eating.",,,1

I loved eating here - the waitstaff was extremely kind and professional. I had the spaghetti, which was delicious, although a surprisingly small portion size. And you absolutely cannot find scenery as beautiful as this just anywhere. I highly recommend sitting in the greenshouse area. I came alone, which was extremely pleasant, and many others were alone as well, with some working on laptops. If you can't get a spot in the greenhouse, the indoor seating is VERY soft and comfortable.",,,

(Luckily it was comped because I would not have paid for this). My friends steak was over cooked and served on a dirty cutting board. Dirty utensils were given to us as well. I can only imagine what the kitchen is like. Do not recommend!Communication is bad here and fridge was ""not working"". I feel sick.",,,1

If so choose from the three or four selections which are great. Highly recommend the avacado toast which is two fabulous slices of bread with avacado and tomato on one, shredded kale saluted in olive oil and two hard boiled eggs sliced. The fruit granola and Greek yogurt are also really a good choice.You get juice coffee tea. Remember to tip the servers! Service is a bit slow. Atmosphere quaint with cool music and plants. There are other things on menu if just having breakfast and not staying at The Marlton Hotel. Cons: slow service, coffee not hot enough and staff doesn't seem too excited or happy. Idk why not.",,,

Updated review","Just an update to note that I had to go back, and the staffing and drink issues have gotten worse.  The waiter was arguing with me because I had the audacity to ask for a drink to be filled to the lip; he said, ""You're not actually asking for more vodka, right?""  Actually, shockingly, for a drink in a small glass with giant ice cubes:  Yes!  So I was stuck in this very  Oliver moment (""Please Sir, may I have some more?"") but soon realized that I was lucky that he had actually graced us with his presence at the table.  At one point I had to chase him down and ask, if he could take some time away from his busy texting schedule, it would be nice to get another drink.  Incidentally, there is a ratio of about one really sweet person to five surly jackasses every time I've been there.  I'm sorry, Nice Guy!  It's not you!",,,
6,jed k.,"Trenton, NJ",39,143,275,3.0,11/13/2016,"My wife and I came with my daughter for brunch. My daughter recommended this place. It's in the Marlton Hotel. Our reservations were for 1:00 pm. We were seated immediately. Our waiter Leonard quickly came to the table to take our order.We started with s plank of quinoa, sweet potato spread, guacamole and a one more.  It was served with some flat crackers. I was sure if you were supposed to mix the quinoa snd one if the spreads together on your cracker. The quinoa seemed an odd mix with the other spreads. I had a turkey sandwich with the trimmings on focaccia bread. It was a good sandwich.  I daughter ordered the soup of the day and I'm not sure what my wife had other than she enjoyed it. When you enter the hotel from the street you go to the right to go to the front desk. You turn to the left to go to the restaurant and pass through a sitting area with couches and chairs. This area was pretty empty when we arrived  however, when we left it was packed.   I understand they the hotels chic place  to stay. The",1,,

We both had burgers from the lunch menu.The service is sloooooooooooooow. Super slow. Our server and busser were really nice, but it seemed like they were understaffed. I never noticed anybody just hanging out -- but there simply were too few people working to attend to the lunch crowd.  Again, once we were able to flag them down, they were lovely and friendly, but it was tough to flag them down.",1,,

9,Steven G.,"Staten Island, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/10/2018,"Tonight I must write about one of the worst dining experiences that I have ever had in New York City.I was catching up with a friend as we have not seen each other since long before the holidays.We wanted somewhere with a cozy, intimate atmosphere, and we thought Margaux was going to be just the spot.Upon arrival, it was very busy in the front by the fireplace, so we took to the back for a private dining table. When we approached the host stand, there was nobody to be found for a good 5mins before we noticed a bartender run to the back and grab someone.A gentleman approached the stand and proceeded to take us to a table. We requested a table situated in the back room and were met with the response that they (the staff) were currently eating and it wasn't open yet but we could be moved after. Fine, we sat at the nice oversized booth closer to the front.After sitting and getting comfortable we ordered two hot toddy's, which were lukewarm and not necessarily ""hot.""Still trying to be optimistic, our very inattentive Server came over and took our food order.We proceeded to receive our meal, which was incorrect. Instead of our Server apologizing, we were told he thought we ordered the ""other chicken sandwich.""We decided to split our meals at this point so we could start eating, not once ever being met with an apology or asked how we were, or if we needed another drink.Our meal arrived and our Server was nowhere to be found until all of our plates removed and dessert was offered. After declining dessert, we were again not asked about our meal and never brought the check until asking almost 25mins later.When we received our bill, we asked to kindly split it and we were told that ""you don't do that.""I had to explain that X amount was to be placed on the card and the rest would be placed in cash.A very confused Server left and never brought any change back.We sat waiting.....again, until we flagged the very kind Runner down to call for our Server.After he came over, we again explained what we were trying to do, only to be met with more confusion.We finally settled the bill and received the proper change after the 3rd attempt.I am 100% understanding of mishaps, but in a non-busy restaurant, when half the staff is on their phones at the host stand and serving station, it's unacceptable.Hands down one the most frustrating and disappointing experiences I have had dining in a long time for what was supposed to be a simple and quick meal.",2,,
10,Sylvia L.,"Forest Hills, NY",146,436,647,2.0,7/17/2017,"We came here for drinks after dinner nearby. It looked like a cute cool spot in the Marlton Hotel in Greenwich Village so we decided to pop in with our party of 6. You basically can take up any of the couches or seating areas when you are grabbing a drink there. We ordered cocktails. Cocktails were average at best. Our group ordered two Manhattans and when they came, it wasn't as we expected. We asked the server to come over and told him that it wasn't made the way we expected. We told him how we wanted it which is pretty standard for Manhattan cocktail. He brought it back and the guys said it tasted the same as the first one. It just didn't taste right. Seemed like they were missing an ingredient and decided to substitute it for something else but that something else was way off from what our expectations were fora Manhattan! The other drinks were meh. I ordered a drink that was herbal with elder flower and it was not that good. Too much ice. Hubster ordered a whiskey on the rocks and it was too much ice. Too watered down. Would we come back? Absolutely not. It doesn't take a lot to make good drinks but if you can't even make it right then, that's a different and bugger problem!",1,,
11,Pitita L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/26/2017,"I cannot remember when was the last time I had such lousy service in a restaurant!Four friends and myself went for Christmas dinner last night and what was supposed to be a fun evening with great food and service ended up been a miserable one.It started with warm white wine. After my friend told the waiter it was warm his response was ""they must have just put this bottle in the wine fridge"". Wine was sent back and replaced.One member of our party had a question about an ingredient in one of the salads. We asked our waiter and he answered that he did not know and would have to ask the kitchen. We waited and waited and decided to google it. Twenty five minutes later our waiter appeared again and asked if we were ready to order. When asked if he had found out about the ingredient his reply was that he forgot!So, we gave him our order. One person and myself ordered the fettucine with braised duck and foie gras, split, as our first course. When our food arrived three of us got their first courses while my friend's and mine were missing. We told our runner and about eight to ten minutes later he arrived with one bowl of pasta, and this was after repeating our order about having the pasta split! We sent it back to the kitchen and  by the time it came back it was cold, dry and congealed.I should also mention that our waiter did not write down position numbers so when the food arrived it became every man for himself.Table cleared and fresh silverware was almost tossed at the table. No finesse or know how.Our second courses finally arrived, with one of them missing. Again.I ordered the Amish chicken, which was nicely cooked but very bland, despite our waiter mentioning it was spicy. The food sounded very good on the menu but the execution was not memorable. This place is very expensive and for that kind of money someone should be spending more time training the floor staff. It was obvious there was no communication between front and back of the house.And I'm not sure if anyone really cares!Anyway, this is one restaurant I will never set foot on again!",2,,
12,Helen H.,"New York, NY",6,83,0,4.0,10/24/2017,This was a pleasant surprise! Tucked away in the back of the Marlton Hotel. The menu is small but has a lot of wonderful options. The atmosphere is great and reminds me of being in Europe. We had some meatballs and fresh burrata and the farmers board. It was all delicious. My only complaint was that we were there in the late afternoon and the waitstaff switched over and it took quite a while to flag down a waiter to get our check.,,,
13,Hilary S.,"Manhattan, NY",163,10,0,2.0,6/9/2017,"I have to come here with my coworkers a few times a month because it's conveniently located near our headquarters. The service has been painfully slow each time--something I can typically forgive as we often set up shop and work on our laptops for hours on end (making sure to obviously continue purchasing food and beverages so we're not loitering). Also, I worked in the service industry for years, so I'd like to think I'm a bit more understanding than the average patron. Today, my colleague and I waited an hour and half for water. The place--which is charming, by the way, so this is really a shame--was nearly deserted as it was early in the afternoon. I went up to the bar to ask for water, and the bartender (who had no visible customers) pointed to a server who was standing against a wall. ""Water? Sure, I'll get your water,"" he said. Two glasses landed on our table about 10 minutes later. The servers essentially run away as soon as they drop things off, so ordering anything is a real journey. With the exception of maybe two people, everyone who works here seems to be collectively miserable and totally unwilling to provide decent service. It's bizarre. Even requesting a menu is a herculean effort. There is a real attitude here as well, as if everything is inconveniencing them. I really can't comprehend it. It's unfortunate that it's like this because it really is a cute place, and as I mentioned it's convenient. If it weren't for the awful service I would make this go-to spot for drinks, dinners, and dates. I wish they would step it up.",2,,

I can't really describe Margaux as a French restaurant, since there's some decidely un-French menu options. I had the mushroom risotto with truffles and was impressed that they didn't skimp on the truffles or portion size -- there were truffles galore! The blood orange gelato was also really good -- not too sweet, and I discovered what sunchokes are (almost like the crispy part of a french fry.) The service was also impeccable, and the whole place had a cool, cozy vibe. (And apparently romantic too, since there was a couple hard-core making out in the lobby lounge when we left.)",1,1,1

The Marlton has a touch of that classic New York hotel gravitas more commonly found at an Uptown establishment, but the sleek, modern cocktail hangout is thoroughly Downtown in its sensibilities.The drinks were expensive (think any nice cocktail bar in New York), but they were pretty stiff.

Staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. Some hits & misses on the food though. Amuse Bouche presented when we sat was very nice - hummus with paper thin seeded crackers & crudités. Burrata with roasted squash was everything it should be. The creme de la creme was our portion of homemade rigatoni-like pasta with calamari sauce. It was one of the best- tasting pasta dishes we have had anywhere, at any price. We were thrilled & would go back just for that dish.  The Amish 1/2 chicken that came after was overcooked the first time, had to be sent back. The replacement was not as dry but still bland. Maybe they would do better roasting their chickens rather than cooking on a rotisserie? Skin was unappealingly blackened both times - a turn- off. And no juices to speak of at the bottom of the dish. Would not order again. Shoestring fries with my husband's burger were among the best we ever had. But he hated the burger (and he is a burger nut!) - didn't eat more than a bite. So gamy- tasting! They explained that they mix short rib into the grind of beef, but somehow they have the mix wrong - Pat La Frieda, they are not...Still, Margaux is so cute and friendly and inviting, and tries so hard to please, that we will go back - and just stick with their amazing homemade pastas...",,,

Updated review","So I have to update this, since I was informed by the birthday girl that she asked for the seating arrangements (re couches, etc.) given the limited space, to which the establishment was very accommodating. She also arranged for a pre-set menu. So I can't knock Margaux for that. Like I said, the burger was good and the server was rather attentive for a fairly large group. But, that bloody mary was the absolutely worst I've ever ever had. More like a rotten pickle-back. When it comes to brunch, those drinks serve an important function - so I'd advise on opting for the mimosa.",1,,

I ordered the burger with chips. Not amazing but decent. Everything on the menu has a bit of a flare to it, salt added to the dessert, jalapeños to the burger, so it's one surprise after another LOLOne thing that really made me upset was one of the hosts with a bun on top of his head, interrupted my table and told us to leave because they had too many people with reservations waiting. I can't trust a guy with a bun on the top of his head.. No seriously. And that is just rude The space is very cute and comfortable, felt like I was in someone's living room.

31,Amanda A.,"New York, NY",18,7,0,1.0,2/11/2014,"This review is for a recommendation I gave to colleagues in the fashion/beauty industry visiting for Fashion Week and a well-known celebrity makeup artist. I had visited the space just for a walk-through to see if it would fit for an event we were having - it didn't - but I did find the decor charming and the menu delicious! I wish I had dined myself before recommending to anyone, because now I am left feeling awful that I sent them to what was a horrible experience.Not only was the menu drastically reduced, but the staff was unbelievably rude. It wasn't the 'we're being rude because we want to seem cool' vibe, it was straight-up 'we don't care about anything' vibe. First, the place was empty - dead. Second, the menu removed an item that many of the guests had been looking forward to since they heard about it. Now I know they can't put an item back on, but they could make recommendations for something equally as good, or see what the chef could whip up - especially since they were the ONLY people in the restaurant. But they didn't - and they beyond snarky about it.I have been suggesting this place based on menu and decor alone - lesson learned.This place is in need of a reality check - treating customers like you actually WANT them to enjoy their experience with you really goes a long way. Wouldn't it have been great to have these guests share with industry friends that they HAVE to go to Margaux when in NYC? And wouldn't it have been amazing had one of the guests decided 'we really need to have our runway show after-party here?'I don't know...word-of-mouth...good PR...those sort of things SEEM important to a restaurant doing well.

32,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",367,86,3,3.0,3/28/2014,"I would give Margaux 3.5 stars if I could, but I'm rounding the review down to a 3 because ultimately I don't foresee myself making a point to go back again.Margaux's entrance is through the Marlton Hotel.  The hotel lobby is a warm & cozy space - dark maple walls, oriental rugs, moulded ceilings, and leather seating.  It was a cold day and when we arrived around 1 pm, the front lounge area was full of people reading, chatting & working on their devices in front of the roaring fireplace.  It felt like a really nice place to spend a winter afternoon (but technically this is a review for the hotel, not the restaurant).However, the warm, cozy, low-lit ""old New York""-type vibe changed as soon as we'd made our way through the bar area and entered the restaurant.   My 4 coworkers and I sat down in the small back room, which is kind of a ""garden space"" with plenty of natural light. It was really cold back there and in general, our location felt a little too exposed and casual with not enough table space for our needs, so we relocated to one of the horseshoe-shaped booths along the perimeter of the main dining room.  Our new location was an improvement, but there is still something about Margaux's overall layout and decor that doesn't do it for me.  I feel like the restaurant lacks a cohesive ambiance and - while I know this sounds ridiculous in writing - it felt too much like I was ""dining at the restaurant of a hotel"", rather than just ""dining at a restaurant"".I started with a bloody mary, which was delicious. My group ordered several things to share, so I was able to try a good portion of the menu.  Overall, I found their food to be hit-or-miss.  The burrata & leeks dish was my favorite, followed by the burger and rotisserie chicken.  I was not impressed at all with the lamb meatballs (despite my love of meatballs) or the crispy sunchokes.  The mushroom risotto tasted fine, not great, but the presentation left a lot to be desired.  I feel like their lunch menu could use some fine-tuning - there just weren't a lot of items on the menu that jumped out at me.Our waiter was great. (I wish I'd gotten his name - he told us that he'd started working there about 3 weeks ago).  He was very tolerant of our shenanigans while we occupied our table for 3 1/2 hours, making bountiful food and wine orders.The restaurant was pretty empty while we were there, but granted, it was Thursday afternoon and I would imagine they attract a much larger dinner crowd.  Margaux just opened about two months ago so they've been getting a solid amount of press and ""scene-y"" traffic to pump up their business - but in my humble opinion, I'm not convinced that this restaurant has enough strong points to be able to retain their crowd once their ""new restaurant hype"" dies down.",3,2,1
33,Paige S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0,2.0,12/14/2015,"The food is delicious and the atmosphere is lovely but the service is so terrible! The hostess would not let us sit at our empty table a little early even though there were plenty of available, set tables and our table was ready. We had already ordered drinks at the bar and wanted to sit in our booth while we waited for the rest of our party so we didn't even need our waiter. Once we were seated at the time of our reservation we sat at the table for 15 minutes without anyone coming over to take our friends drink orders.

After seeing her it all went downhill from there. The service here is almost non existent. We were here for brunch. The space was empty. Empty. There were 4 waiters/servers. They were all hanging out at the bar. It took forever to get anything- water, food, the check. Food here is ok at best and downright absurd at worst. The only highlight was the cauliflower soup, it was very good. But items such as beet chips with lemon labaneh for $7? Really? First they aren't good, then you barely get any. Ripoff. Lamb meatballs were served in a terrible tomato sauce that tasted of ketchup with some strange mustardy mint sauce on top of the whole mess. Gag. We thought dessert might turn the tide. Nope. Chocolate budino smothered in..... Wait for it.......... Olive Oil. With sea salt all over it. A terrible ending to a terrible meal. We waited 12 minutes for our check.

The place was completely packed, but we were given the perfect amount of attention without being hovered over. Even if the food wasn't great, it would have been a good night. However, the food WAS awesome. We were having a tough time deciding so asked waitress for advice. Her recommendations were spot on! Lamb meatballs with Saffron yogurt were delicious. VERY glad she recommended Cauliflower Custard with crispy brussels leaves because we would have overlooked it and it is just incredible. The Lacinato Kale salad was another hit. Even thought I normally do not like Kale, my GF and I ended up fighting over this! For dinner, they had a special of squid ink pasta with crab and chili. PERFECT hand made pasta with tons of crispy crab bites and just the right about heat. I hope this dish makes the menu permanently but if you hear it a special don't pass it up! Our other entrée was the scallop dish which was also perfect. Huge scallops, seared beautifully with a perfectly balanced sauce / garnish. Every dish really had a perfect balance of texture, flavor and seasoning. Hats off to the chef (s)! We tried the Tijuana Zebra as our first cocktail and stuck with it in between some smooth Cabernet. Even though its a tequila drink, don't think of it a flavored margarita....its way more sophisticated and delicious. After diner we hung out in the bar / lobby lounge for another round wishing we were staying at the hotel.... but there is always next time! Whole place had such a cool vibe. Trendy but not arrogant. Can't wait to go back.",4,,1
37,Yousi F.,"Washington, DC",28,139,89,4.0,1/16/2015,"This place is SUCH a gem! first of all, the hotel is so cute, the lobby bar area is so great in the winter, with a warm fire and wood panelling, its super cozy. The other side of the lobby bar has a large table like the one at le pain and the air of a cigar bar without the cigars. The restaurant is delicious-- the lay out is big change from the dark seriousness of the bar-- the restaurant is light and airy with retro booths and an outdoor-like space that is probably great in the summer. The service was super friendly and nice and they made great accomodations for our order. I am *obsessed* with the avocado mash and quinoa salad. the pasta is all made in house and i love the veal ragu. the only thing i didnt love was a black squid ink pasta (which is a staff favorite) but i think its an acquired taste.",,,
38,JP M.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,2.0,12/21/2013,"Cafe Marlton is the lobby bar and restaurant at the Hotel Marlton.I had a bad experience there, but it's a new place so maybe it'll get better.  However, my experience was due to  prissy attitude that I suspect comes from management, so I'm not optimistic.  Bummer, as I live nearby and was psyched for the place.Pro:  The lobby bar portion is very cozy and clubby.  Further in, the tiny banquettes in the room with the bar are good, but that room was way too bright.  Con: A crappy basic customer service experience.This place fancies itself a mixology spot, so there are a handful of complicated drinks with esoteric ingredients.   I ordered a bourbon-based one from our waiter, but requested less sugar.   I was instructed that they would never ever deviate from their recipes as they had been expertly developed to be perfectly balanced.  Um...ok.   (But at least I could order safely know that the drinks they concocted has a harmonious mix of tart, sweet and booze!)   I then asked the waiter to point me to a cocktail that was less sweet, and he suggested a vodka-based one, which I ordered. The cocktail that arrived was so tart that it was basically undrinkable.  Where was the expert mixology when you needed it?  I almost jumped behind the bar to help rewrite that drink recipe's ingredients, but instead I just told the waiter that I couldn't drink the cocktail and would have a beer instead.   (And, ok, I did point out to him the irony of what had transpired.)Final insult is that they charged us for the drink fail.",4,2,

It is divine. My friends and I ordered three different pastas (squid ink bucatini, orrechiette, short rib rigatoni) and all were delicious. We washed them down with a fantastic pinot noir and licked the plates :) The wait staff refilled our complimentary sparkling water every 5 mins, and were very attentive. That being said, it was also not very busy, so I can't say how a full house will be.This place is known for the farm to table ingredients, and you can taste the freshness in their food, especially the homemade hummus and ricotta spreads they serve with the bread basket. While I didn't order, I heard the boards on the appetizer menu are superb. The front of the hotel is a cozy and awesome bar area, with couches, tables and a wood burning fireplace. I seriously will be back for cocktails and another round of food!",,,

We ate in the cafe, but the lounge looked awesome for after-dinner drinks, if you actually want a cozy place to have a conversation with someone.Food was excellent - highly recommend the crispy sunchoke app, lamb chops, cod and rotisserie chicken... That's right, I said it. I'm telling you to order CHICKEN at a restaurant.Phenomenal cocktails, with non-mainstream liquors... And really fun ingredients...

Try the best cocktails with an in tune bartender who customized my bourbon drink to reflect the summer season. Well worth the 14.00.  Hand crafted ice, yes please!! Rose petal added an amazing flavor to the strapless bikini cocktail. Home made sparking water ! Love that. Cute amuse bouche of fresh raw veggies sliced thin and lightly salted with a minty pea dressing.  That's just the start...Try the Cauliflower custard. So light and delicious. Deliciously crisp kale chips but they did reflect the fact they were fried. Too greasy. Artichoke and fava bean salad is not to be missed. It's crisp and lemony yet so sweet and fresh.   For an entree I had Olive oil poached cod  which continued the trend of flavorful seasoning.  My date was satisfied with his burger and heaping mound of crisp French fries. Lastly, Dessert; the sweet corn and huckleberry ice cream was delicious, a taste of summer.  Paralleled by the fabulous stone fruit   Both tasted exactly like a homemade dessert should .  Can't wait to go back.",1,,

The ambiance was cool and the crowd was trendy but the quality of the food was well below what you'd expect for the prices charged. The best item on the menu was the sunchoke appetizer and even this was a bit on the salty side. The friend I was eating with was similarly unimpressed and so was the couple sitting at the table next to us (they were paying their check when we first sat down and informed us that there was nothing that they enjoyed on the menu). That all said, the bar in front of the restaurant looked promising and the cocktails were good - it might be better to skip the restaurant and just get a drink at the bar.",,,

53,M M.,"New York, NY",0,18,2,1.0,11/6/2014,"Let me preface this by saying that we love the Marlton and come here often for drinks with friends.  Unfortunately, our experience at Margaux was not so great. We found the food to be way overpriced for the quality.  The burgers and fries were good, and the ricotta gnocchi was surprisingly light and nice.  But, the sea bass was overcooked and served with beans. Who serves sea bass with beans? And, the desserts tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile.In all honesty, the food probably tasted worse because the service was terrible.  Our waitress gave us the wrong wine and tried to pass it off as the one we ordered.  (The restaurant however was nice enough to not charge us for that bottle.)  We were overcharged on our bill, and she then asked us to recalculate it for her. Not sure why she's in the service business, as she clearly did not want to be there serving us that night.  If you end up hungry at the Marlton, I would suggest just going to Burger Joint just down the street. The Marlton is great for what it is - a really nice hotel lounge with a great fireplace, nice cocktails, and fun people watching. Just steer clear of the restaurant.",1,2,1
54,Kyle W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,2.0,8/15/2014,"This restaurant is going to garner a lot of mixed reviews.  The hotel it is in has a lot of buzz right now as a fashionista hang out and the bar/lounge areas up front do feel and look a bit exclusive and clubby.  It is darkish and seems more like a cold weather meeting place than a summertime one, but it is lively and full of pretty people without being offputting.  The restaurant is in the back of the lobby.  Ceilings are low and the space feels somewhat compressed but it is well-decorated with an early 20th century Europeanish look.  It is small and the room is divided into three parts, so it isn't really a seen-and-be-seen space.  The menu is not huge but has nice range of choices.  It is unfortunately printed in a confusing layout with strange symbols randomly inserted (like a lightning bolt), and held to the wine list with a clip.  The overall impression is kind of cheap looking.  Initial impressions are not helped by the offering of bread on the menu for $4.  It takes a lot for me to note prices on a menu and I can surely afford $4.  But it just feels a little galling to be charged for bread in the U.S. where that isn't the custom.  It feels like your patronage as a guest is being milked.  The waiter explained that the restaurant offers the gratis crudite plate instead of bread, referring to the three pieces of lettuce, one strand of shaved beat, a split-in-half micro carrot and 5 snow peas that he had placed before us earlier.  Honestly, providing the crudite AND the bread without charge would be a more gracious way of welcoming diners.  Charge me an extra dollar for the entree, but I don't like feeling gouged with fees for bread.This little insult dropped the rating from what would have been 3 stars to 2 stars for me.  The appetizers were good if not memorable.  Lamb meatballs were tasty but not  piping hot as one might expect given that they are served in a mini-castiron pan.  Artichoke salad was refreshing. Burrata was fine.  Entrees were all very good:  swordfish skewers were most impressive presentation on a long wood cutting board but presentation was out of scale with the other typically-plated dishes we ordered.  Bass was excellent and cooked perfectly with medley of nicely cooked fresh summer vegetable.  Pasta could have been a tad more al dente but the braised octopus in it got a nod of approval.  The rissoto tasted very good but was oddly served as a thin sort of puddle on a flat plate.  A bowl would have kept it hotter longer and not looked weird and a little unappetizing as it was consumed.In the end, this is neither a rant nor a rave.  We had a decent evening but didn't find anything to rush back to experience again in terms of the menu or the ambiance.  We'll stick to cocktails up front on snowy winter afternoons.",3,,1
55,Jessica N.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/5/2014,The experience was fine until there was a RAT in the bathroom.

56,Debra M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,2.0,10/28/2015,"Food was ok, my server was great. Dining is not always about the food but also about the overall experience. When I arrived I requested a seat in the patio. My hostess told me oh no those tables are reserved. Interesting as I didn't know you could pick a specific seat when making a reservation. Those tables went empty all night. I then asked for the booth instead of a table. I was told oh no that is reserved. My hostess went on to tell me the table is reserved for a vip. Hostess seemed to think this was ok to say. This table went empty all night. Maybe I'm a spoiled New Yorker but the dining scene in ny is very much word of mouth. My vip friends will probably pass this information on as I will. My suggestion for margaux, Change your approach or your tables will remain empty. The VIPs have and will go else where.",1,,1
57,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,441,2,3.0,2/7/2014,"I'm going to be all over the board with this review. There were things that I really loved about the place and there were a few things that were really off about the night I dined there. I made a 9:00 reservation for 4 on a Wednesday night. We decided to go a little early to have a drink at the bar to catch up on things. When we walked in around 8:30 the bar was really crowded as well as the lounge but we did manage to snag a few seats on the couch. The waiter was a bit harried and I wasn't a fan of the wine suggestion he offered my friend, she said a full bodied red and he recommended the Beaujolais? I digress, that's my wine snobbery talking. I ordered a  lovely Cremant d'Alsace by the glass which was pretty much heaven. Our other 2 friends showed up around 8:45 and I went to let the Hostess know that we were all there. She stated that our table was ""paying the check"" and she would come and get us when it was ready. We had another drink at the bar and when I looked at my watch next it was 9:40. I walked back up to the Hostess stand and was given the same response. Hey, I know you can't kick people off a table but seriously? Were they really paying the check 40 minutes ago? We FINALLY sat down a bit after 10:00 which I deducted a star for. What happened next was so strange, I deducted another star. Our waitress was so bizarre. One of the guys in my party requested some bread because we were all ready to gnaw on our arms and our waitress said no. She said they were going to bring a crudites plate, which they did, and it consisted of exactly 4 anemic carrots and a sliced radish. Although the dressing was good we were now even hungrier. My friend asked if we could have another one and the waitress said ""I don't think so, it's an amuse bouche"" She was really condescending like we didn't know what those two words meant. Next, I asked her if I could taste two of the wines offered by the glass because we were going to order a bottle and I wasn't that familiar with their small, eclectic list and her response ""no, I'm sure you've tasted those in the bar area"" Huh?!! I think she was kidding but it was just strange. When I questioned her about it later she said ""We just have so many more interesting bottles than those"" She gave me a taste of a Syrah that she had opened and it was fine, a bit more than I wanted to spend but we ordered it anyway. Here is a break down on the food.1. Farmer's Board red quinoa tabouli, kale harissa. spicy smashed sweet potato. avocado hummus. beets, grains of paradise. - small piles of the above ingredients served with some type of cracker, meh2. Grilled Artichokes mint, cloumage - these were great but small, as were most of the dishes.3. Lamb Meatballs saffron yogurt - excellent4. House-Made Pasta squid ink bucatini, dungeness crab calabrain chili - this was an amazing pasta dish that packs a lot of heat!5. Kale Casarecce braised rabbit, black trumpets, vermentino - another winner. The pasta was very fresh and the flavors worked beautifully together.6. Cauliflower Custard crispy brussels leaves, acorn squash - sounds strange but order it, fabulous.7. Diver Scallops celery root, brussels leaves, black trumpet & chanterelle - I didn't taste this dish I'll have to admit. I'm very picky about my scallops but the rest of the table gave it a thumbs up.8. Burger english cheddar, pickled jalapenos, potato & sunchoke chips - this was overcooked and more the size of a slider than a burger, feel free to skip it.9. We ordered the dulce de leche gelato for dessert along with something else I can't recall, I'm not much of a dessert gal but I will say the gelato was ta die for.I would probably give the food 4 1/2-5 stars but all the other inconveniences quickly brought the rating down.I would go back because the food and the atmosphere were that good.  Oh, and we asked the bus boy for bread and he brought us a lovely basket of fresh bread. Maybe he should be bumped up to server?",5,1,

From management to servers, no one seems to care and we had to ask to order our drinks, main cause and then the check (because at that stage we wanted to just leave). At no point was the service attentive.

61,Honest T.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/11/2014,"I've been to this hotel bar three times so far. My first two experiences were fabulous. The cocktails are great, food is good for sharing and accompanies the drinks well. The atmosphere is fantastic - fireplace, dim lights, comity chairs - and different for that neighborhood. That said, last night I brought a group of girlfriend to the bar for drinks and appetizers and we had terrible, terrible service - easily some of the worst I've had in my many years living in NYC. Our waiter egregiously neglected us the entire night. We understand that it's a new spot and a busy night - but if at any point he came by and said, 'so sorry ladies"" or even acknowledged that we waited for 45 minute to place our drink order, we would have easily chalked it up to the newness of the spot and brushed it off. However, that humbleness did not make an appearance. Instead, he had an arrogant attitude towards us the entire night, failed to provide any semblance of service, and at one point even obviously rolled his eyes at us when we had questions about the wine. I would have loved to make this my neighborhood spot - but after that experience I won't be returning. **I must highlight that our bus boy was fantastic, helpful, and his service was impeccable. Also, a waiter from another section (guy with a faux hawk) came over and took our order (thank Gosh) and he was funny, helpful and kind.

By the end of the night if was tiring...The food is OK but we expected more for what we were paying. We got some pasta dish and some meat dish. Unremarkable. Like cooked at home but not homecooked... why would I want to pay a premium for that? I guess to see and be seen, if you're into that...Wines were particularly poor quality for the price.

The wine list is also on the small side, though there are some interesting picks despite its size. Our entrees (poached eggs and trout salad) were also extremely good.My only gripe would be the service was very slow-- and the dining room was empty, which made this even more annoying. Our server was kind of awkward and appeared wordlessly at our table and sort of stared at us, waiting for us to ask for something, which was...uncomfortable.

I had a nice cocktail and absolutely sensational lambs tongue (small plate). My friend, who is in the food business, had only an expresso which had to be re-made. The waiter remarked something about '""trouble with the machine""In retrospect that should have been a sign......but I was impressed!Came back this year on a Friday to check it out as a place to hold a B Day get together for a small group.......i was meeting another friend there but I arrived 1st I had gone to the gym, vigorous 2 hour workout and was hungry.I wanted protein, however the only dish on the small plate menu with any substantial protein was lamb meatballs (I'm allergic to tomatoes; ingredient not mentioned on menu) and fluke crudo (eh-h)Everything else was vegetables, olives, etc!!so I got the cauliflower custard with fried kale. It was exceptional: excellent flavor, prep; quite niceFriend was very late and I was very hungry.......had to ask for bread....meanwhile sent back a vile drink, which would have been worse with the listed chartreuseFriend finally arrived. I was very hungry so we decided to get something quick: roasted chicken ( I never order chicken at restaurants).it was OK, filled the void......homemade blood orange sorbet was quite nice Wine list was OK....So, to summarize:PROS-excellent vegetable dishes, OK wine menu. OK for a hotel restaurant. Bar and loung area niceCONS-very unbalanced menu: small plates and appetizers ~95% vegetable without soy or otherprotein sources...no actual seafood (??); mains all meat(???). Clearly not French as  anyone who has spent time in France knows, the French love meat and fish! while fresh vegetables are indeed essential in France, especially out in the provinces, one still has meat and fish!the restaurant is contiguous with the bar.that would be OK if it wasnt for the fact that the place was packed to the gills with increasingly drunken twenty and thirty year olds!Serving lots of alcohol to drunken young women should be reason enough to have a small plate menu loaded with protein based dishes in order to facilitate metabolizing the alcohol!better overall management is needed: there were very few waiters with customers not really getting much attention (unless it was the 'complainer' ie myself who got a manager :-)So perhaps this place should be marketed as a 'vegetarian focused' menuUnfortunately I am disappointed that this was yet ""another hotel restaurant""...I would suggest that foodies and those over 40 would be better off going somewhere else, which in Manhattan is quite easy....",,,

73,Angelica C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,70,37,1.0,3/3/2014,"this place is a shitty show run by a bunch of idiots! went with another two friends, and was told to wait in the lobby for our table, so we went to try to grab drinks. Half an hour pass by and no one notice us! then when we finally get our waiter, they don't seem to have any normal grey goose, ketel one, decent vodka or well know gin in stock? that's ridiculous! an hour later and they still did not get our table, so we decided to order in the lobby. Horrible service and mediocre expensive food. NOT COMING BACK!",2,1,
74,Bob K.,"Princeton, NJ",0,23,0,1.0,7/23/2014,"Upon entry we were greeted by a lovely lobby, bar, café and restaurant.   We asked to be seated in the atrium which looked equally inviting.  We were informed that the restaurant would not open until 6:00 and as such we could not be seated.  Despite the fact it was 5:50 we opted for a booth adjacent to the bar.  We ordered drinks and asked for the menu.Drinks were fine; the food menu was somewhat idiosyncratic without many options.  We then decided to try a couple of appetizers before ordering an entrée.  I ordered the Tart Cherries, Parmigianino Cheese and 10 year old Balsamic vinegar plate.  My wife ordered a spring mix salad.  The salad was fine if not exceptional.  The cherries and cheese plate was a great disappointment.  The cheese was old, dry, tasteless and the consistency of rubber.  The supposed 10 year old balsamic was unremarkable but for the miniscule and hardly appreciable portion on the plate.  It literally looked like three drips were applied from a very small eye dropper and then hidden by the cheese lumps. The cherries were nothing special.  Presentation was lacking and crudely thrown on a very small plate.   I asked the hostess if I could perhaps be given a little more of the balsamic, and was informed that there would be an additional charge as it was 10 years old.  I declined the additional charge as the vinegar was so ordinary that it was not worth the upcharge.  I sincerely doubted its pedigree. It was at that point we decided to not go any further into the menu. The one bright spot was our server.  She was delightful.  When she asked if the appetizers were okay, I responded that there were two answers, on polite and one truthful.  She was gracious enough to accept the truthful response.  She offered to remove the cost of the cheese plate, but we decided to accept it as the cost of a learning lesson. We requested the check and moved to another venue for our meal.  The other staff was aloof, distracted and not accommodating in any manner.  Only our server made us feel in any way welcome. We have no issue paying a premium for a quality product, but this experience was overpriced and afforded no value.",,1,
75,Claire L.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/30/2013,"I had dinner there last week with my sister and niece and we had an amazing time!  The food was some of the best I've had in a long time, and the wait staff were fun and incredibly helpful.  They are still getting situated so the service wasn't completely smooth, but they made up for it with humor, attentiveness and charm.  We decided to taste a number of things and split all of them and they were all equally interesting and unique renditions of classic foods.  I loved the atmosphere.  Very old school NY with booths in a spacious yet intimate setting.  I look forward to going back.",1,,
76,Teresa H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,5.0,8/30/2014,Margaux is simply amazing. It's set inside a stunning hotel and the food and drinks were great. Be sure to try the bread with the cauliflower custard! Will def go back!!,,,
77,Carolina S.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,5.0,1/7/2014,"I went to cafe marlton this last saturday after my friend recommended it. Loved the room, and took one look at the menu and wanted everything on it.  My friend and i ended up ordering and eating (all of) the following: veggie board (avocado hummus, sweet potato hummus, beet tartare and a quinoa tabouli. Then we ate this cauliflower mousse with squash and Brussels sprouts, followed by the scallops! Yes, ate all of it. Then we had the chocolate budino with cookie crumble and olive oil. Lets just say that I went back the next day and ate there again. Tried the lamb and the cod and risotto. Again, amazing! Service super friendly and the hotel lounge is perfect for drinks.",1,,
78,Krissy T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,2,0,5.0,6/28/2014,"Stopped in NYC for business, and found this amazing cozy restaurant close to my hotel.  Normally I don't write reviews, but their cauliflower custard is out of this world!  I have never eaten this type of dish and I was so impressed.  Not to mention the cod with asparagus and oysters I ordered....heavenly.  I'm such a foodie and I was pleasantly surprised.  Keep up the great work!  I will certainly return.",,,
79,Sam C.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,4.0,2/5/2014,"I went to dinner at Margaux last night and found the entire experience very enjoyable.  The décor was inviting and the scene was attractive and lively.  The service was good, although a bit spotty at times and the prices were very reasonable.  We started with the Farmer's Board consisting of red quinoa tabouli, spicy smashed sweet potato, avocado Hummus, beets served with buckwheat crackers and pickled vegetables.  The crackers tasted...healthy, but I loved the quinoa tabouli and the avocado Hummus.  The dish was enjoyable, but somewhat forgettable.  That being said, between four girls we still devoured every last bite.  Next, I had the kale salad and rotisserie chicken with smashed sweet potatoes.  The kale salad was light, citrusy and had a little spicy kick.  I would definitely order it again. The rotisserie chicken was also delicious!  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and the portions were perfect.  After dinner, we went to the bar to grab a few drinks.   I found most of the drinks we tried to be overly sweet and very sour.  I will come back for dinner or even just drinks as long as I stick to my go to vodka soda!",,,
80,Allison W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,6/13/2014,"""meh"" is exactly the word for this place. went one thursday evening for happy hour drinks and then dinner with some friends. upon arrival at 5:30, there was not a soul in the place. the lights were bright. there was no music. just a very sleepy/weird atmosphere. on the positive side, the bartenders were nice and the drinks pretty good... the same can't really be said for the dinner service or food. our waiter was inattentive, often disappearing for 20mins at a time. and the food very forgettable.",,,
