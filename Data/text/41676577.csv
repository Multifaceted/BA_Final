If you've ever been to see Sleep No More then you will recognize the similarities. The red velvet curtains SCREAM Satan..in fact they have a signature cocktail with that name. Red enamel artwork embedded with musical notes cover one wall, which looked moveable to me. An enormous red glass chandelier with electric guitars attached hangs in the center.I almost forgot to mention the incredible artwork in the basement on the way to the bathrooms. The theme is the old west in Montana. Scenes of fishing, floating on a river and cowboy shootout in large format line the whole hallway. The cocktails were fab. They made an almost perfect whiskey sour...except it was missing the cherry :(.This place is staying on my list for future adventures!!!",2,1,1

Seeing all the kids ( some adults too) perform especially my nephew was amazing. While he was playing, he said he felt like a rock star. The staging area, lights and sound were  awesome. It's a fantastic idea to have recitals here. There was $20 min per person so I'm glad we did not have dinner. I thought it was a bit pricy but oh well.  It was a great experience to see my nephew up on their fabulous stage. The food was, okay. Nothing to rave about. I had a burger and fries and a coke. The service was ok, not horrible like some of the reviews I read. I would love to come back here and see a show soon and get the full experience.

11,Michael C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,17,0,5.0,5/19/2018,"Great place if you don't want to eat or drink. I went to see Lionel tonight, May 19th, and was at my table by 6:40 under the left staircase right by the toy motorcycle. The waitresses were taking drink orders all around me. The table to the left, right and in front of me got their drinks, appetizers, main course, after dinner drinks and somehow, after 2 1/2 hours not one of them  even came up to me and asked me if I wanted anything. The Gretel looking pigtailed one was so close when she bent over, to take the order for the table in front of me, that if I had to sneeze and went to cover my mouth she's be part of the #METOO victims. Then there was the Rachel Dolezal lookalike who did the same thing, she kept walking right by me and taking the drink orders for the two guys to my right and never asking me at all. Ditto for the waitress with the dirty blond shoulder length hair and the taller one in the blue knit sweater. I would say it was a conspiracy but I couldn't prove it. So because of their incompetence or arrogance I avoided the $20 minimum table charge so all I paid for was my ticket. Took the train home and stopped at Wheelers in Sheepshead Bay and spent the $20 I screwed The Cutting Room out of and $64 more in drinks and dinner and a $25 tip for the waitress. I guess you get the help you pay for but if you are of darker completion and wear black I would say eat and drink before you go to The Cutting Room. BTW The Lionel Show was great.",,1,

We e-mailed 3 times and called 6 times and were told every time that they would get back to us within 1-2 days. Not once did that happen, nor did we ever receive the promised contract.Additionally, Susan told us on the phone that she would be ""doing us a favor"" by hosting our ceremony there, which showed absolute lack of respect. If they did not want to host our ceremony at The Cutting Room because of money or other reasons, they should have said so and we would have understood.

Updated review","I was at the Cutting Room last night to see the California Guitar Trio. The band was great and the venue is perfect for the Trio's style of music. The sound and lighting were perfect. I'm downgrading my previous review due to poor service by the waitstaff and being made to wait for over an hour to be let in due to the first event running overtime. If you mention that the doors for seating will open at 6:30 then make sure the first event is over on time. This could have been a ploy to get all those waiting to buy drinks at the bar and then be required to spend an additional $20 minimum during the show. Now if you are going to require all patrons at the show to spend $20 minimum then you better make damn sure that the waitstaff takes the audiences order in a timely manner. The show was almost 3/4 of the way over when my wife was brought her order. My wife mentioned to the server that I had not been served in any manner. It was then that I was asked what I wanted to order. I ordered a beer, a brownie ala mode and a coffee to wash it down with. I was a little peeved when the coffee was bought to me first and I told her that the beer should have been brought out first. I guess she did not like my attitude as the beer was literally dropped in front of me in an abrupt manner. They also screwed up two of the orders at our table by switching and serving the wrong flatbread pizza orders. I down graded the servers tip because of her poor service and I'm downgrading my previous Yelp review due to her poor service and being made to wait to be seated by the venue. You are welcome to read my first Yelp review below. Your results may differ.",4,1,1
16,Karen A.,"Rego Park, NY",27,148,367,2.0,11/14/2017,"Last night we went to this venue to see a group that we really enjoy seeing. I was looking forward to a night of great music in this intimate room with friends and family. The music was fabulous as I had expected but the experience was just not up to par. We were told our show would start at 7:30 so we arrived fashionably early so we could get a good table to view the band. Since the room is small there really are no ""bad"" tables but we still like to be up front. Well, there was a performance by another group before us and we were made to wait an hour! I think that is unacceptable. I do understand a show will run a little over but one hour?!!! There is the usual cover charge which is $20. I can accept that, but the serve was shabby. We were four people and it took some time for the server to come. She took the orders for 3 of our four party members. My husband sat and sat and was only asked what he wanted AFTER I got my coffee, which took quite a while to come, and I told her his order had not been taken. Two people in my group order 2 different kinds of pizza which also took a long time to come and that too was not given to the appropriate person. One came out way before the other. It seems the kitchen is very unorganized. As for hubby he ordered a beer and wanted a coffee and brownie to follow. His coffee came first without the brownie and when he mentioned to the server he thought the beer should have come first it did arrive a short while later with a dose of attitude. It was dropped on the table so some beer spilled out. The food was fine for a place like this. I never expect fine dining at a music venue but I do expect professional service.",2,,
17,Thomas C.,"Massapequa Park, NY",353,296,3807,4.0,4/10/2016,"RECOMMENDEDAfter departing from the door of my usual dive bar lunch place on Park Avenue South and 30th,muttering expletives because all TVs were showing the Mutts and not my Yankees, I needed to find someplace to eat on Friday, 4/8. Since I eat once in awhile at the literal ""hole in the wall next to The Cutting Room I have been cognizant of the placard outside the venue which advertises a $10.00 Burger and Beer Special. The burger contains a Pat La Frieda meat blend. Mr. La Frieda is the only celebrity butcher in America that I'm aware of. I entered the place in anticipation of a good burger.The Cutting Room, with its brown-paneled  and chandeliered interior, is beautiful, in the bar area where I ate. The room was peaceful, quiet and a nice refuge from the rat race. The young and efficient server/bartender Danielle took my order in a friendly and helpful manner. I ordered the aforementioned Special, which came with an at least 12 ounce draft. It is worth noting that the Special features premium drafts, not crappy Bud. I chose a Sam Adams Seasonal and ordered a medium Burger with Cheddar and Bacon for a few bucks extra(a little over $14.00 with tax and before tip). The Burger arrived perfectly cooked on a tasty English Muffin.It was juicy, delicious and, in my estimation from working in the surrounding neighborhood for 15 years, one of the best in the area. The accompanying Fries were perfectly-cooked, not greasy, flavorful and lightly browned.My Beer was cold and delicious.Because of the great lunch that I had at The Cutting Room on 4/8, I will definitely return to this establishment.",9,3,4
18,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,4/1/2016,"This is a really cool place in midtown. It's hard to describe the cutting room. It's a restaurant, lounge and a concert hall. All in one building that has 2 story's and some of the most interesting decor I have seen in a long time in midtown. Apparently the cutting room is well known in the area. I have never heard about them before. Yesterday I had some friends visiting. I decided to try the cutting room. When we got inside the first thing i noticed was how big this place is. There is a upstairs with seating upstairs and downstairs. There are private rooms with lounges and couches. The decor is funky. If you like rock and roll this is the place for you. There is a cool chandelier made of guitars in the main room. There are photos of all of the performers that have played here on the walls. It's a really cool place. I have not seen a show here but apparently. They get some big names that come through here. The food: our waitress was fantastic. She was super attentive. I wish I remembered her name. She gave us our own private area in a separate room. The beer and alcohol list is very extensive offering domestic IPA and import beers. The menu isn't really big. It has all of the basics. Burgers, chicken clubs, pulled pork. They do have some vegetarian and gluten free options, which is surprising for bar style food. I ended up ordering the beer and burger special. Surprisingly it is just as the name says. You get a beer of your choice and a burger. I ordered a cheeseburger medium. The burger was cooked perfectly had great grill marks. The burgers do come with English muffins instead of rolls. I'm cutting back on bread so I just ate the meat. Overall. I was supposed by the cutting room. They far exceeded my expectations. I will def be back here. I do recommend anyone coming here, especially if you like live music.",7,3,4
19,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,5.0,1/15/2017,"Seriously cool venue with outstanding acts. Seriously. I'm three to four degrees of separation from Dave Chappelle now. Soon, Mr. Chappelle. Soon. His was the first formal comedy set I've ever seen here at The Cutting Room. I almost touched his hand. My scrofula was thisclose to being cured. My most recent visit was to the new Burlesque Karaoke on Fridays starting at 10pm.""There's this karaoke thing this Friday, do you want to go?""""Yes!""""There will be strippers.""""You had me at karaoke... but HELL YEAH!""The stripping isn't required but it is highly encouraged. One of our group got down to his skivvies. There's something subversively sexy about a man in a blinding set of tighty-whities. I wore my good bra but I wasn't nearly drunk enough. I did sing though. The karaoke list is quite large. It's a live rock band so it's something special. If you've never done live karaoke, do it! I've done plenty of piano karaoke, but getting support from a full professional band is something else. It's much more forgiving than trying to keep up with a video. You have the full lyrics on an iPad, and if you stumble, the band will get you back on track instead of plowing on. So much better than the standard fare. Guitars, drums, and depending on what you pick, the keyboardist pulls out the saxophone! The dancers were hot AF. I have video. I hope it doesn't get deleted. Are pasties too much for Yelp? We'll find out won't we. The drinks are priced for the area and the service was attentive and quick for our rather large party of 10. They have Lambrusco. I'm in love. I will be back. And I'm going to learn ""Faithfully"" in order to meet my monthly Journey quota.",4,6,6
20,Drew P.,"Tucson, AZ",60,270,301,1.0,3/11/2018,"This is a beautiful venue and a majority of the staff is very polite and courteous. However, when you have one bad apple on your staff it can ruin the experience for a customer. I was judging an event at this venue tonight and a waitress come around and took my drink water and collected my credit card to open a tab. I wanted another drink and waited around and I didn't see her so I went to the bar and I ordered a beer. Heather, the bartender made the drink and then I asked her to add it to my tab and she searched and found that she didn't have my tab and apparently you could only order from the person that took your order initially. However, how would a customer know that. She threw an absolute fit and started asking me repeatedly who had my tab. There is a small service Corridor and through the window I could see my waitress and I told her that that was my waitress and she become very rude started repeating herself who's your waitress and I pointed to the waitress not knowing her name and she said there's three people in that room I don't understand who you're talking about and I clearly point to the person I say the only person with their back to the window and she then become very rude saying come with me and said who's your waitress now? I I asked my waitress to close my tab  and I was going to pay the waitress directly. She then told the waitress to just add it to her bill she didn't want to have to deal with this anymore. When she walked off she said this is bulls***. She completely ruined the entire experience for me. I would like to say my waitress was very apologetic and polite and courteous. She told me that Heather often has tantrums. That tells me this is something that the company knows about and allows.",2,,
21,Steven L.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",5,6,4,1.0,6/28/2017,"We went to see the Mar-Tays last night. Their sound was phenomenal. But I'd like the review the place. No complaints about the sound system and the visual layout.The complaint was with the service which unfortunately interfered with enjoying the evening. Simply put, we arrived early, before 6:30pm, and were among the first few tables to be seated. And we were the last to be served. The food arrived at 9 pm just as the band announced their final song of the set. After waiting an hour, one person in our group had to loudly complain just to get our drinks. There was no apology, no complementary deduction for us on our bill, only the excuse that everyone came at the same time, which was not the case.Even with the great music I had to work at focusing on the band, as the drinks and food passed in front of us and the tables were being cleared, we were still waiting for our food.",5,,
22,Marie R.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,0,1.0,10/19/2018,"So I just came from the establishment, and although my cousins and I had a great time  at the ""air sex championship event"" I have to say that the service was beyond poor. It was never explained to us that we have to close our tab at the bar, and open a new one in the dining area, in which there is a $20 minimum for each person. The money wasn't an issue, but as soon as we sat down, the waitress who is Caucasian with short blonde hair, and had it in a pony tail, seemed annoyed with us as soon as we sat down. My cousin who just had surgery cannot drink liquor, we politely asked for water, and the waitress rolled her eyes and  damn near banged a glass of warm water on the table. She repeated multiple times that there's a $20 minimum. In which we tried to explain that we had open a tab at the bar, and she said we had to close it. But the way she spoke to us, was very degrading. She rolled her eyes and made it seem like we could not afford a $20 minimum. We had ordered food and drinks at the bar that was well over the minimum. My cousin who had arrived  at the  dining area  a lil after us, was trying to order food. When the waitress finally  came to us, my cousin tried to order in which the waitress said she's not taking her order and to go to the bar and walked  away. She was so nasty to us, and made us so uncomfortable. We asked to speak to a manager and an older woman came to us, and then went to speak to the waitress. The older woman never apologized for the rude behavior, she looked annoyed that we even complained. I feel like we were racially profiled as we are a group of latinas. She took one look at us and was instantly annoyed that she had our table. She made us feel unwelcome. We stopped ordering and tried to enjoy the show which was awesome by the way. The owner of this place needs to hire people with a better attitude. The last thing I want to do is spend my hard earned money in an establishment that has the potential to ruin my night. Honestly, the food and drinks were good, but the service sucked so bad, I wouldn't step foot in there and I would advise  people to go somewhere else.",,,

Almost New Orleans like?Anyway, even though we were the only ones there it took awhile for the waitress to get us our beers and water, and take our orders.  The food took an average length of time and didn't seem quick due to lack of other patrons. But it didn't take too long.I got the Crab Sandwich on an English muffin and it was actually really good!

The venue is small enough so VIP seats actually have the worst view of the stage. Went to see Cold Spring Harbor this past Friday night. The band went on late and finished early.

But I also ended up discovering Simply Three during the same show and fell in love with them. They do dramatic and lively instrumental versions of popular songs (I teared up during their cover of Hoziers Take Me to Church- shut up, it's a moving song, alright?). They also had a muscial/comedy act whose performers names I can't recall. I loved the variety of the show and none of the performers had trouble keeping the audiences attention. Given the reviews I wasn't expecting to like the venue as much as I did but I really enjoyed myself. There's a bar area up front that showcases their much talked about guitar chandelier, a lounge area off to the left, and in the back an intimate stage area with dining tables. There also appeared to be a small balcony area upstairs. The bathrooms are hidden and out of the way, behind a door, down a a couple of corridors, a staircase and dressing rooms, but you'll get there eventually. The decor is beautiful. Amber colors, intimate and artsy, with art all along the walls by the stage. I didn't find it hard to get a waitresses attention as others did, I was never without a drink for too long. Service wasn't exceptional but it was fine enough. Their burger and fries were solid. Don't come for the food but if you need to nosh on something there are options. I think this is a great choice for an intimate, sit-down venue that still showcases compelling artists.",1,,1

30,Lailah J.,"New York, NY",1,13,1,3.0,2/21/2017,"Cool venue, lovely lounge, but unfortunately the service here is just terrible, as lots of people have noted. They have a decent lunch special and your standard happy hour from 4-7pm ($5 beer/wine, $6 well drinks, and food specials) which my colleagues and I take advantage of from time to time because we like the ambience, which is a sort of cozy rock 'n' roll vibe. The place is largely empty during the day (another reason we like it) but for some mysterious reason, service never fails to be excruciatingly slow, no matter how few patrons there are at the bar or in the dining area. It takes forever and a day to get a drink or any food you order, regardless of how busy they are. You could literally be the only person at the bar and it might take 10 minutes to get a beer.  There are a couple of cool waitresses/bartenders but most are rude and have a $hitty attitude. And I swear some just make up prices for drinks. $15 for a weak well vodka soda, are you kidding me?? For shows, there is a $20pp food/drink minimum which isn't unusual for intimate show venues with table service (e.g. Joe's Pub, BB King's, Highline, etc.).  However, in this case it would behoove the establishment to take orders before the show started so the audience has their food/drink in front them or at least can start being served by the time the act comes on. Yet the last time I was there - to see an act that we booked to perform there no less - the waitress didn't get to our table until well after the first half of the set (though the poor dear seemed harried and overwhelmed and I felt for her), by which time it would've been too late for everyone to order enough to meet the $20 requirement, but luckily it wasn't enforced, and we were quite a large party. Service wasn't much better on other occasions I've been there for shows or corporate events. So the bottom line is come here if you're seeing a show; it's pretty chill for happy hour too if you happen to be in the neighborhood, as the lounge is quite nice and spacious, but it's not much more than a typical club venue despite the restaurant front so don't expect great drinks or food, which is mediocre but perfectly serviceable. We really wanted to make this place our regular hangout but unfortunately our experiences have been largely unsatisfying. 4 stars for the beautiful space, 2 stars for the service/staff so 3 average.",4,,
31,Cassandra J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,2,1.0,11/13/2017,"Never again. I went to the Cutting Room this past weekend to watch a friend perform. Although the Cutting Room website stated that the show was to start at 9PM, the show was delayed and didn't begin until 10:30PM. However, instead of letting us wait inside the venue towards the entrance, the hostess and manager rudely tossed myself and the 20 other people who were waiting out into the cold. We waited outside in 30 degree weather for an hour. But wait, there's more. Due to a pressure cooker found right down the block from the Cutting Room, there was an active police investigation going on (at one point, a police bomb squad vehicle pulled up and parked right in front of the Cutting Room entrance). So not only were we tossed out into the cold, we were forced to wait outside in the middle of an active police investigation with a possible bomb right down the street. Thankfully, it turned out to be a false alarm, but the attitude of the hostess and manager was such a disgrace. This place was such a disappointment. After waiting outside for an hour and being seated, our food arrived to our table cold and the sound guy at the venue screwed up the later half of the performance. Trust me, your money is better spent elsewhere. nbcnewyork.com/news/loca…",1,,

F- for Johnny Rausch and the Bev Leslies this year...you people suck and I'm going to think long and hard about dropping my money to hear you complain all night instead of lift me up. Shame on you for ruining something pure. The Cutting Room is a great venue, for sure. One thing, the waitresses are very pushy about making you order stuff. My date and I were brought a third round of beers we didn't want or didn't order but I didn't make a thing about it because the room is such a great venue.

Knowing this in advance might have saved me some mild embarrassment.  Again, I was very impressed with the décor of the place and the room is excellent for sitting back, eating some good food, and enjoying the live music.",7,1,2
35,PJ D.,"New York, NY",62,8,1,1.0,9/28/2017,"Ok, listen. The place looks beautiful, they have great acts, I've never had a problem with the service or the prices (it's expensive, but I knew what I was getting myself into before I arrived)... but all of this is WORTHLESS if the room is HOT. I'm not talking 74 or 75 degrees-- the room was WELL over 80 degrees! Saw a bunch of GREAT musicians tonight, a night when it was 70 degrees outside. When the hostess (again, very nice!) opened the door to the main room, a wall of hot air rushed out and hit us. We sat for about 20 minutes, and literally, sweat was dripping down my face. I asked the waitress about the temperature and she said, ""yea, it's so hot in here. Let me see if we can turn the air on."" Again, it was easily over 85 degrees. Men were taking off jackets, people were fanning themselves with menus. It was a little insane?An hour later, my guests and I were still sweating. I left the room to go speak to the hostess and/or manager. The hostess (again, very politely) said that they always have problems with ""air flow"" and that the air had been on all night, but it was just ""always a problem."" If you're a venue serving guests, guest comfort should be #1! No one can enjoy food, beverage or entertainment if the room is roasting! She repeated several times that this is an on-going thing they deal with and that tonight was not an isolated incident. And then a manager lady swiveled her chair around from inside the office and echo'd that, yea, it's always hot and people always complain. The hostess just apologized again and I went back to my seat.Well, five minutes later, wouldn't you know that the air kicked on and the room promptly cooled down.If you don't want to turn the air on bc the air conditioning dissipates the effects of the hazers and the other lighting effects, say that. Truly, after about ten minutes of AC, the room was markedly cooler, and the hazers (the smoke meant to make the lighting effects look more dramatic) had indeed dissipated. But guest comfort should come BEFORE cool lighting effects. With thirty minutes left of the show, again, it started heating up in the room again. It got very warm and very uncomfortable again- very quickly. And, wouldn't you know it, the hazers seemed to be back in full effect.If the air's out for a night, tell guests before you take their money so that they can make a decision. If you can't find a way to make your lighting design work with the temperature controls, fix it. Other music venues do. Theatres do. Comedy clubs do.And, furthermore, if this is ALWAYS a problem (as the manager and hostess said)... FIX IT! It's Hospitality 101. There are so many other great venues in the city to see great, live music. I won't be back to The Cutting Room. And from the looks on the (sweaty) faces of the other attendees tonight, I'm not alone.",,,

I would go again for the experience but I would probably eat beforehand.",,,
37,Ryan A.,"Boston, MA",131,235,43,5.0,2/9/2016,"We had our major label showcase here and I honestly believe The Cutting Room played a big part in us getting signed. It is such an impressive venue, it's almost hard to put into words. From the second you walk in and see the guitar chandelier and the guitar-shaped counter top at the bar you just don't want to leave. And they went above and beyond for our event. They gave us catering (the food was amazing) and an open bar and waited on our guests hand and foot until the night was over. This is what I meant when I said they helped us get signed. Yes, the performance had to be impressive but all of the stuff I've described so far goes a long way to leaving a lasting impression to the people in the crowd.The venue holds 250 people which is perfect for a showcase. The stage area itself is so beautifully designed, you feel as if you're on a stage fit for a king (I've included a picture). But here's the best part, the sound clarity. The sound engineer they employee is the best sound engineer we've had anywhere on the east coast, only rivaled by the sound engineer at Lestat's in San Diego. He's so knowledgeable and thorough. If you're lucky enough to play here, make sure you show up very early because sound check will last for almost an hour. But it's worth it because you've never heard a show sound so good. If you're looking for a place to organize a showcase or if you're looking for a truly unique place to have your next show, please do yourself a favor and go here.",2,,
38,George M.,"Manhattan, NY",4989,522,680,4.0,11/2/2014,"Although The Cutting Room is  stone's throw way from work I haven't had an opportunity to visit. That is until a friend called and asked me if I wanted to see Ron Wood and Mick Taylor from the Rolling Stones play a set of Jimmy Reed blues songs in a fairly intimate setting. I was in with only a half hour's notice. And thus my first visit to TCR began with my waiting in queue to enter. This particular show was a blues gif by what look like octogenarians and the audience reflected the musicians. I speculated that it might not have been as pleasant waiting outdoors if it were raining and the line was full of Marilyn Manson fans? Nevertheless between the sassy lassie behind me and the aforementioned octos there was me--midlife in all my glory and waiting patiently to marvel at what could be my grandfathers play blues guitar. My experience got better from here...Alas it was my turn to be humble with the face controller in charge--whom would easily qualify for the fourth Reich by the way he grilled me. Yes mon furour I smartly replied as I pushed my way past the threshold. He wasn't amused. I'm in! Victory at last.Upon entering I felt I was magically transported from the streets of NYC to a Disneyesque theater sans oversized, happy rodents in bowties. But wait, was that Earl Slick that passed by? Hey there's Little Steven over there (he ain't so little anymore). In fact the joint was crawling with RnR celebs. Missing was Keith. He was rumored to be the guest in Ron Wood & Guests. No Keith but great show nonetheless. Since this is less a review about the show than about the theatre let me say that its a great venue for an intimate show. The food is pretty good too and the shoe-string fries are outrageously good.",2,1,5

No wait staff  asked the band & I if we wanted to order drinks. Not even water available!!! They also rushed the band off stage & out of green room at 10:30 pm sharp to make way for Rumer Willis.

The dancers are very talented but then the MC makes them get out and dance as though they are strippers and earn money. And then the men dance like it's a gay bar. The MC does what's basically karaoke to pre-recorded tracks. And then he screams into the microphone as though there's no PA system. It's just awkward and uncomfortable. If I wanted to go to a strip club and make it rain I would do so. I wanted a regular burlesque show. This is not it.

Staff is nice, but once the show starts, it's really hard to track them down.-Food is pretty standard pub-type food, nothing will wow you but then again, you shouldn't expect 4 star cuisine at a venue such as this.-On top of the ticket price, there is a $20 per person minimum you must spend.

As a live music fan, let me say that the sound was FANTASTIC. No PA issues. Perfect sound in all corners of the show room. Reminds me of the House Of Blues in Chicago, just much more intimate.

Thirty minutes later and we're still waiting for service; no one even asked us if we needed drinks. I had to ask the table next to us to see their menu. I stop one waitress and she said she'll get our waitress. Ten minutes later the same girl asked if our waitress came and I said no; she said she would take our order. Another hour goes by and we finally got our food lol. Your $20 min per person baffles me; if your service sucks do not put a min for each person!! Menu only offered brunch. Very weird options. Mostly stuff with egg.. I'm allergic to egg if I eat a lot of it. So I paid $18 for my nonexistent salad LOL. Had to fish for the beans, corn and avocado. Barely any in there. Not that much chicken either. My guest's bacon egg cheeseburger was good, I wish I had ordered that.. I was still starving after my salad. Fries stunk, most were hard/over cooked. Also didn't get a spoon for the soup, really?! Wait, it gets better. I asked one guy if I can have my salad wrapped to go.. 5 minutes go by.. he leaves the kitchen empty handed. I asked where my salad was. He says they're wrapping it in the kitchen, then proceeds to go back in the kitchen. It takes a second to put a salad in a box, he really couldn't do it? Wait it gets even better! The girl who was supposed to be our waitress, who never even attempted to ask if we were doing ok, places a box on the table next to me. I asked her if this was mine, she said yea. You couldn't hand it to me? Or place it on my table? Lol! I didn't even keep the salad.. I don't trust her. Maybe she was mad because I wasn't so quite talking to my bf about how our waitress hasn't come to us in 30 minutes. If you hate your job so much, get a new one!! Don't ruin other peoples' experiences with your sour soul. Did management hire monkeys as their waitstaff? I'm grateful for the waitress who helped us. We gave her more than 20% because she was helpful and nice. Oh yea, your bartender is a bit*h. I asked her if there was a lunch menu, I couldn't even get eye contact.. all she says is no there's no lunch menu. Please fire your waitresses with RBF. Its not a good look for the establishment.

I spoke to several servers down below and they said they go in order, I'm not up there, etc.  We were on the left balcony and I saw a server on the right balcony.  Looks like I chose the wrong balcony.  By the way, we're about 45 minutes into being let in by now and people down below are finishing up.  Also, I forgot to mention, one of the times I went downstairs to floor level, someone just came in and I heard someone say ""there's a table over there"", so we could have been down there earlier if the girl at the front hadn't said anything.  About an hour into it, I went downstairs, again, and was speaking into what turned out to be a busboy's ear ( I thought he was a waiter, turned out to be a very nice guy too), and dropping F bombs, which I never do, but was not happy.  As I was doing this, a waitress tapped me on the shoulder and let me know she was coming up.  She was very apologetic and I know it wasn't her fault.  As I came back to the balcony, people were fist bumping me because they could see her coming up behind me.  I guess they weren't to happy either with the lack of service.  By now, this was 60 minutes into being let in and at least half an hour into the show.  She took our order and I ordered a burger because by this time, I was past having breakfast.  My wife ordered eggs and sausage.  We got our food and it was OK.  I wasn't expecting much anyway, but my wife's was a little cold, which was not good.  She was not going to ask for them to heat it up though!  The good thing was that after she finally got some food in her, she was herself again and really got into the show!  Overall, great show, great place to see a show, but the service good be better ( I did tip the waitress the full amount, like I said, not her fault), and the girl at the front could be more useful and less patronizing.",2,,

For starters, it's a midnight burlesque show in the middle of a tourist jungle, can't we just have a little fun without being judged for it? Considering we were the table ordering the most drinks through out the night and having the most fun, you would have expected a little more professionalism and customer service on their part. Overall the acts were fun and entertaining and for the price of the living social, it was fun but when you're paying the kind of money you pay for drinks, you expect a little more respect and charm from the people working there.

I rarely drive into Manhattan, so as I exited the subway station I walk a few blocks North then East and the Pret A Manager, random restaurants and bakery/coffee spots did not entertain my senses. I walked back to subway station because The Cutting Room is only a few steps near the exit on the downtown side. I could feel a little energy coming from the inside or at least notice how night club or lounge like the place appeared. I walk in and look around, the manager or owner not so much greets me but ask how can I help you. He points me to the bar.This place has two levels and both levels are almost empty except for the mildly full bar of patrons for an end of weekday where there should be happy hour, but there's not. Matter of fact if this were a bar I would not have gone in or stayed. It's a venue. A venue that one would appreciate if you like:---Rock from the late 60s, 70s, 80s...basically rock n' roll genre (The background music coming from the speakers are perfect, not too loud at all to need shouting)---There's a juke box next to the bar but it wasn't lit and not sure if it worked. The place is pretty cool with the decor lined with a rock n' roll vibe, especially the paintings of rock legends: The Beatles up front and some I could not picture---The seating is mostly stool seating (comfortably cushioned): at the bar, main room and up the stairs on level two. There's a back room with tables but that might be the events room where based on the venue artist will perform. I could imagine this place getting packed on a events night---You're looking at $12 vodka drinks and $6-7 beers here. The food averages $20 from Lobster Rolls to Thin Specialty Pizza and Pulled Pork Sandwiches. I wouldn't come here looking for great food but the drinks aren't water and the vibe is ""happening""---Cool and courteous wait staff in all black ---Patrons are an older crowd, but think guys in cool Fedora hats and old school hip ---I could not get cell or internet on my phone further in the establishment",14,5,6

The problem is the performance included a screen with a slide show of rare photographs, and the seats available allowed you to see Peter, or the screen, or neither, but not both.  When seeing both was kind of the whole point.  ""Oh, you don't want to sit there,"" a waitress told us of our best effort to compromise on seating, then disappeared when we begged her to help us move someplace better if she knew of any. When that didn't work, we asked up front for a refund, and were told that didn't happen.  I found it dishonest.  How can you sell more tickets to a multimedia show than you know will actually be able to watch it?People wandered around unhappily trying different vantage points. Upstairs was bad because the decoration over the stage cut off the view of the screen.  Downstairs the problem was massive pillars.  With a little foresight, the venue could have solved the problem and made everyone happy with a few small additional screens.

Ms. Rhonda was gracious enough to greet her audience at the end of her show. It would've been a treat too if she walked to tables as she sang. The food was pricey but worth EVERY penny. I had lamb sliders for an appetizer and then the super crab cakes. The lamb sliders were smaller than a conventional slider but they so favorable! The crab cakes seasoned to perfection - cabernet was delicious!The atmosphere was grown and sexy and most importantly to me - NOT ghetto. There was a very mixed crowd and friendly. I don't know why I never heard of this place before. I'm kicking myself!If you like small intimate musical venues, this is the place for you. Yes - you can download a song and play it in your car on the way to work or school, but there's something artistically spiritual and balanced when the venue is intimate with you and the singer in a small space. Enjoy whichever show you book!",1,2,1
58,David M.,"Manhattan, NY",15,49,3,2.0,4/3/2016,"Great place to watch a live music concert, as long as you don't mind over priced food and sub par audio/visuals. The lamb sliders and pastrami roll are really good but steer away from the fish or zucchini tacos. Food is seriously over-priced for what it is and there's a $20 minimum per person for tables. The wait staff is attentive and friendly, though.Unfortunately, the reason why I'm giving two stars is because the a/v people are terrible here. Improperly themed lighting for the show, inconsistent mic-ing and audio levels as well as feedback from the instruments and mica. The visuals are placed in a terrible spot and the lights are used in a way that you would think it's there first time. Kind of a shame since Ameri-Floyd the band was amazing",1,1,1

I purchased my tickets via Goldstar - they were part of the complimentary tickets that had a service fee of $10 per ticket. I then sent my boyfriend (who purchased the tickets) a karma code which gave us $10 off. We paid $5 per ticket and had a great time! The performance was fantastic! The cast was very funny and talented - there were not any racist jokes - all jokes were in good humor. There was a $20 per person minimum - which I don't think they are very strict about. They do however add 20% gratuity automatically on the full price of the ticket. For example, our bill came to $39 - but the gratuity added was $14. All around I think it was worth the $61 we paid all together (Goldstar + bill @ the cutting room).",1,1,1

I work 2 jobs to survive..."" YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.  We are your guests. We paid for a service. Maybe you wouldn't have to work TWO jobs to survive if you did ONE of them professionally.  No one gives a shit about your sob story.  You're young, broke, and living in Manhattan? Join the club. And the people starving all over the world didn't pay $50 for a ticket that included food, so stop your hippie bullshit and go find me a tray of chicken satay skewers.They then passed menus out as the show began, so that customers could purchase food...We did (since the complimentary appetizers were pretty much nonexistent).  Food didn't come out until the LAST song of the performance, and 2 plates didn't come out AT ALL.  Managers of this place need to pull their heads out of their asses...They have what could be an awesome venue, but something tells me this place will not be a permanent fixture of Manhattan.  Gotta do better than this in NYC....",17,9,2

The place was packed and the a/c was non-existent.  I don't know how the band handled it, but it was mentioned on stage (and throughout the crowd) how hot the venue was (and not in a good way).While I love the architecture of an older building, the view of the stage was obstructed by an additional interior entryway, so if you're in the bar area you were not catching the whole show, which is where at least half the crowd was.

Midway through the show, someone from a balcony spilled wine on us - my wife was covered, scarf, sweater, hair, coat etc. These things happen, and in the end it's all about how you handle it. The waitress came over and said she found the person who spilled the wine and wanted to put us in touch with them. I told her that might be a bit awkward, and asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over at the end of the show and asked if she could comp us a round of drinks, told her thanks but we were heading out - could you just take a round off?  She came back and said that the owner felt bad and you can talk to him after the show. So went and spoke to him when the set ended, and explained what had happened. His response was, ""so you're the ones who want $10 for the dry-cleaning?"" He pulled out his wallet and tried to throw us cash!? We kind of just looked at each other confused about the whole thing...fortunately what seemed to be his wife was there and asked what they could do. We explained that it would be great if they could just take the drinks they offered off the tab and we'll handle the dry-cleaning. He grudgingly came out of his office and did so, but not without some angry words. The couple waitresses who observed the whole thing said they were sorry and that ""its just the way he is"".

They sat us in the balcony and because the stage has an awning type thing we could only see half the stage. The safety bars around us so we won't fall to our death made me feel like a caged bird, but I understood the need for them. We were pretty high up. We picked the best possible seats and watched the show through the bars, it was ""fun"". (--- that's sarcasm) Normal seats were way better but also very expensive. Personally, I didn't care for the show so I'm glad I didn't pay the full price. The Cutting Rooms the speakers were so loud, I actually left with a headache.The service at the Cutting Room was horrible. To start it was not mentioned on the website or in the email I received from them that there was a $20 per person minimum. The waitress made it her duty inform us that we can either order or just get charged a fee. Because we didn't know, we ate before we arrived and just ordered drinks. The first round of drinks came pretty quickly however the second drink my bf ordered took 30 minutes. The waitress admitted that she forgot about us. When she came to bring his drink it dropped so she had to go back and get another one (probably because she had to walk up and down the stairs to get to us).

The way the place is managed is inexcusable. ""Doors 6:30"" was a canard.  More like 7:00.  Then we were herded into another space to wait for a second set of doors to open. My reservation had been lost, and the ""manager"" told me there was a reservation with a name similar to mine; was that it? Yes, because I don't know my own name. I made a reservation knowing that patrons are sometimes forced to share tables, and I didn't want that. When I expressed my displeasure, I was told, ""Ma'am, that's the nature of the music business."" The cherry on the collapsed cake was when the server mixed up my companion's credit card with two others, and that had to be sorted out.  Five stars for the music, one star for the ""service.""",2,1,1

Be advised that once you go into the stage area to see your performance it is a $20 minimum per person to get your food and drinksI was gonna give this 3 stars because of a mixup with my freaking drinks but the saving grace was the island head performance itself......they sounded really good,2,,2

Updated review","I returned to this venue for a second night of the performance I saw earlier in the summer. This experience was markedly improved! This was a weeknight show so the vibe was different and there was what I assume to be a happy hour crowd already there so we didn't have to wait outside (although it was beautiful weather so it wouldn't have mattered). We were let into the performance space and had much prompter and efficient service. Food again was delicious. The show itself was even better this time around and again, the sound/lighting was almost flawless. I'm looking forward to returning again for future shows!",,,
91,Jane D.,"Lebanon Junction, KY",0,32,1,1.0,5/17/2017,Wish I could give it zero stars. Have never waited so long for drinks in NYC and that says a lot because there are a lot of busy places and I've lived here for years. The blonde female bartender was falling over because she was so drunk. Inexcusable. Felt bad for the brunette female bartender who tried to cover for her. Blonde drunk female bartender swiped my cousin's card three times over the course of 30 minutes when he tried to cash out. She then couldn't find the receipt so the drama started all over again. She shouldn't be allowed to drink that much while working. It really slowed everything down to an intolerable level. We all separately waited at least 30 minutes for a drink on three separate occasions during the night. Not worth it at all. Terrible service. Drinks nothing special anyway.,,,
92,Kapil G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,12/31/2014,Very terrible place... I came here for new years eve party... To start with they have not given my jacket... And reason was because they have only two guards for finding it and owner is too busy with other things and would not let me in. It started with I bought their VIP package for $135.00 for 3 people. And they told me that I cannot be served with VIP package. Because I am the party of 3. I accepted that. Then I ordered French fries and paid for it. I was not served for 1 hour for French fries. Finally I was served with French fries for some other groups order to whom it was for free.Then I asked for ketchup and they didn't served me. By the way I paid for the fries. After that they are supposed to serve for drinks from 9 to 2. And they didn't served me drinks because they are out of glasses at 12:30. Wonderful. And I was throw out of the bar because I asked why I am not served drinks for  half an hour.,3,6,1
93,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,589,852,3.0,3/7/2013,This re-invented Cutting Room designed from the ground up with all the themes of music run amok.  From the music notes along the bar and the guitar chandelier gives it a fun venue feel. The drinks are crazy priced as one can expect from a place like this and the food that comes out of the kitchen here is very good. I'm not sure with other people but when there is a two drink minimum they mean when sitting at the table. It doesn't mean having two drinks at the bar and then you can just go and sit at a table which has table service. The layout is a bit quirky so arrive early to get decent seat for show. The service is friendly and as a whole makes the experience enjoyable.,4,,1
94,Michael T.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",0,39,8,3.0,3/4/2017,The bartenders are too slow here. The bar is always backed up. They need to hire more staff who are more capable of serving large crowds quickly,1,,
95,Brooke M.,"New York, NY",0,17,0,2.0,2/16/2016,"Came here for Valentine's Day Brunch and saw Truffles Murder Mystery (which was great), however the buffet that came included in the ticket wasn't very good. There's also a $20 minimum per person at the table, which would otherwise be fine, we ordered unlimited mimosas for $40 in total, we were happy with the service, etc. But, when it came time to pay the bill, they charged us gratuity based on a brunch buffet that had already been included in the ticket price. In other words--gratuity came out to $13 on a $40 bill (plus tax). That's 30% gratuity and we didn't have a say in the matter!!There were at least five other couples at the end of the show had the same issue, and we all went up to speak to the managerr. No waitresses knew where he was, so we all waited by the bar for 10 minutes until a man with a grey ponytail, (don't know if he was the owner or manager) finally came out, dismissed all of us and told us to talk to our waitresses and walked away. It wasn't our waitress' problem, it was a restaurant issue. The waitresses didn't know why they had charged us like that, and couldn't explain a single thing. Once again, this could have been fixed with a simple talk with the manager, but instead of treating us like the paying customers we were, he was rude, disrespectful, dismissive and frankly quite obnoxious. I won't return here again, regardless of what show is playing, because of the discrepancy in the bill and the manager. Horrible horrible horrible customer service, I cannot stress this enough.A shame, too, because it's a cool looking place and Truffles was great.",2,1,1

The food wasn't good. We ordered platters with all sorts of finger foods that just didn't cut it. I can't judge the drinks because I only had an apple cider.When paying the bill for 3 tables, the total was over $1,000 and there was $180 gratuity included. The waitress stood over my boss watching her sign the bill and asking her for a larger tip. She even said ""You can do better than that, I'm a Veteran"". This was a charity event where we were raising money for Veterans. I doubt she was really a Veteran. Unreal.",5,3,1
103,Jack C.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,36,32,2.0,10/25/2016,"The Cutting Room is like a low budget, understaffed, disorganized version of City Winery. There were 3 people locking up cell phones, but only 1 bar tender and no wait staff in the front room at all. The $17 burger was pretty good (though served with no silverware, napkin, or condiments- all of which were made to feel like chores when we requested them), the whiskey selection was generic and expensive- the pours were short, and the venue room is poorly laid out and the seating is quite cramped. If someone is playing here that you really love (Dave Chappelle was great last night!), it might be worth it, but if you want decent seats, you'll need to get there early, wait on line, and run in to claim your spot, like Southwest Airlines. It's just not a pleasant show experience. If they just allowed you to purchase specific seats (like the far superior Joe's Pub or City Winery), it would be much less chaotic, but they clearly don't care.",4,1,2

Easily 4stars but had to remove one star because the food didn't taste that great.AND upon arriving there wasn't much direction. I'm not sure if it was because of the event.

Service from bar waitress was just okay--you would think most bar people would have heard of a Negroni.  Also not sure if this was specific to the particular event, but it seemed that no one was running the sound board since they had to always switch inputs from the front mic to the overheard a/v system manually. A few times since we were sitting at the bar tables we couldn't hear well.  Overall it was a great night though, but many people were frustrated with the audio snafus especially older people.

Yes, that's what I said..they performed for the majority of the time we were there (at least 3 hours) and it was entirely memorable. I danced from the moment I walked through the door until we were forced out!

I don't know, but it feels like I am watching a comedy show on the set of Boardwalk Empire or American Horror Story, but I mean that in a good way. There weren't a ton of people in the audience, and between the two servers, I was served quickly, and they were very attentive. The show itself was very good, featuring a number of up and coming comics. The highlight of the night was definitely meeting Chris Noth!

The space at the Cutting Room is cool and funky. Showroom seating. I thought the menu was good and the prices were similar to what you'd pay at BB Kings or the Iridium. The wait staff, however was not good. My waitress was unpleasant, and hard to find at times.  When I asked for ketchup that should have come with my burger, I got a straight up attitude. When I went to the ladies room later, - which is downstairs- I realized so is the kitchen so it appears the waitstaff has to trudge up and down a full flight of stairs all night long, but hey- that's not the customer's fault.

128,Victoria L.,"New York, NY",16,38,0,1.0,2/5/2013,I attended a trivia night called The Big Quiz Thing.  On the Big Quiz thing Website there was a $15 minimum purchase requirement listed for The Cutting Room in addition to the $12 entry fee.I purchased 2 alcoholic beverages at the bar  which totaled $16.  The room in which the event was held was a separate one.  The waitress asked if I wanted to order anything and I declined.  She said there was a minimum of $15.   I told her I had already consumed 2 beers at the front bar and the minimum had been met.   She brought over the manager and he proceeded to harass me in the middle of the trivia night (we were trying to answer questions).  I explained to him that I had  met the minimum and he said there was a minimum at the table where I was sitting and that I had to pay for real estate for sitting there. I told him I paid the admission fee and that WAS for the real estate.  I asked what difference was where I spent the money since the money all goes to the the venue.   He told me I was not welcomed there and that I should leave.  At the end of the night I was handed a bill of $15.  I had ordered NOTHING from the waitress and received nothing. I nervously departed the venue and did not pay. How can a manager be so mean to a paying customer and harass  them for spending money in their venue?   AND then have the nerve to charge them more for service not rendered?,39,8,8

131,Dave T.,"Kearny, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,2/23/2016,"Unfortunately I cannot rate this place 0 stars. To those who don't feel like reading: The waitress actually returned to our table after we paid and asked for more money. The management is nonexistent, when we asked to speak with a manager, no one could find him. Stay away.My wife and I, our son and his wife, came into The Cutting Room for dinner last Friday evening. Personally it was partly a good experience and partly quite awful. By my writing, it is hoped that you will take steps such that our experience is made known to the entire staff with the hope that it will not occur again for any patrons coming to your establishment.When we arrived, at about 6:30pm, we asked to be seated in a quiet area, if possible, as we were visiting from out of town and wanted to be seated in a space where we could carry on a normal conversation (having said that, however, we've been in the city often enough to know that Friday night at that hour is almost always noisy anywhere). The hostess led us into the back room, to the table that we soon learned was beside a passageway to the kitchen and also the entrance to the performance area in the rear of the restaurant. Our server, Cindy, came soon enough and took our order. While we were waiting and talking, servers and bussers went back and forth through the doorway (which was somewhat distracting and disruptive), and then people began lining up to go into the performance area and several were standing literally inches from our table. When that first group went in, an older, pony-tailed gentleman came and propped the door open at which time I politely asked if he could close it while we were eating. He curtly replied that ""this is the door into the theater; this is where people go in."" I then asked again politely if it could be kept closed while we were seated there, upon which he kicked up the door prop, slammed the door, muttered something in a rude fashion and stormed off. If the employees knew there was a show that night with many guests arriving they should have thought ahead and not sat us at a table right by the stage door. Our meal arrived in a short while and by all accounts it was good. But while we were waiting, I kept asking for the waitress but she was nowhere to be found. I even asked the busboy twice to find her for us. So, by my reasoning, our service had been poor: we were not in an area where we could talk in reasonable tones (although there were tables a few feet away that would have allowed this) as I had requested; people lining up for the performance  space were practically on top  of us; and the server was totally un-attentive. At that, I chose to make my displeasure known by tipping at less than 10 percent. Our server, Cindy, took my credit card, processed the transaction and then returned a few minutes later saying to me and my guests, ""we usually expect a tip of between 10 percent and 20 percent."" To say we were shocked and angry is an understatement. We have eaten at many establishments in NYC and we have never had any waitress ever return to ask for more money.  As a person who runs his own business, anytime I sense in the slightest that one of my clients is dissatisfied or unhappy with my service, I don't ask for more money as if I were entitled to it. Rather, I am apologetic and make every effort to find out what might have gone wrong and to remedy the situation. While Cindy's actions may have been of her own undertaking, I am inclined to believe she was put up to it by someone else. She is quite young and this may have been one of her first jobs, so she could be excused somewhat, and I certainly would not want her to lose her job over it. If she were put up to it by someone else, then I believe that person deserves to be fired.In the end, my minimal tip should have sent a very clear message that we were not at all happy with our service. Clearly that message was not received. Had it been, and had a shift manager or restaurant manager come to our table to try to understand our displeasure and apologize, I would not be writing this review. It was a missed learning opportunity for the restaurant and will result in our not returning to your establishment again. Further, I have already related this story to a number of our friends and you can be certain they will not be coming to The Cutting Room either.",3,2,2

Upon arrival, you must pay the $15 charge and get stamped for the show. The very nice woman collecting money and stamping hands named JoJo, helped explain that there was also a $20 minimum inside the venue. I sat with a friend and ordered the lamb sliders, and the corned beef rueben cigars to split. Both appetizers were priced just under $15 I believe. Both were very delicious, but I wish the portions were larger. I wasn't really expecting this kind of ""classy"" presentation for the food based on the decor of the bar, but no real complaints as everyone was friendly and it was very delicious. The bartenders were very nice, and made small talk with us throughout our stay.Now, we entered the venue section which was a very pleasant surprise. A large raised stage area in a very big room full of round tables with waitresses coming around taking orders. The acoustics were great, and the band sounded amazing. We ordered dirty martinis and they were OK. If I'm paying over $12 for a dirty martini with Tito's vodka, I would appreciate some blue cheese stuffed olives, but the waitress let me know they did not do that... Overall, I had a great time seeing my buddy and his band tear this place up. I will definitely be back to see him play here, because of the decor and atmosphere of this venue. Very cool lighting throughout the show brought out these really nice ornate wooden designs on the ceiling. As for the food, I'm not sure I would eat here again because the portions were miniature, but it set us up for some delicious street meat on the way back to the Path!",2,,

We had to pay a $20 cover though the website mentioned only a $20 minimum. Apparently the bar has the minimum and a table for the performances has a cover. The drink selection was modest with only a few draft beers, about 3 mixed drinks and some wine. Food looked better than it tasted. The steak looked very good but was completely unseasoned. The bands were excellent and the accoustics in the room were very good.

We had been to the old location of the Cutting room which was small and kind of dumpy with a small stage and the food was just ok. But we had enjoyed the show we saw.This was our first time at the new location of the Cutting Room. It is like night and day. Brand new and fits A LOT more people! Overall, I really liked it and I would go back again.The pros:Even though we waited in a very long line, when we got in, we were still able to get pretty good seats at a table downstairs and could see the stage very well.The food was very good. I had a hamburger and fries and they were great.It was a very fun atmosphere.Bathrooms were very nice. (Although very far away downstairs through some long hallways.)The show we saw was excellent.The cons:We had general admission tickets, which seemed to be what most people had.Although the show was supposed to be at 7pm and doors were supposed to open at 6, the doors did not open until 6:30. The line was extremely long and the check in was extremely slow. There was one person at the check in desk and she had to look up each person's name on a paper list. She was pretty stressed out! I think this is something they could easily change by selling tickets online that you can print at home and they can either just look at them and let you in or scan a barcode on the tickets.We got there at 6:30 and did not get in until 7:30. I have heard from many people that an hour is typical for how long you wait to get in. Luckily we were standing next to some fun people in line and talked to them the whole time. This made the wait enjoyable. Thankfully it was a nice night, not raining or cold. I could see how bad weather could be a big problem if you had to stand outside waiting that long.The people next to us at our table had stood in line starting at 4:45 and were the 15th people in line and had to wait an hour and 45 minutes. They got in right at 6:30.The waitress was very nice, but extremely overwhelmed. Once we sat down, it was a very long time until we got menus, a very long time until we got drinks, a very long time before our order was taken and not quite as long to get our food. I was starving by that point. Getting our check took a very long time. This problem could be avoided by hiring more staff. We had a great view, but the stage has huge pillars holding up the little roof over the stage and a lot of people sitting on the side could not see anything. I am sure there was a reason they built it that way but I don't know why. We went upstairs when we were looking for seats and there are not as many tables up there with good views.I thought the sound was good, but my husband is more of an expert on that and he said he was not that happy with the sound and thought it might be better if you sat in the exact center.Overall the decor is really nice except for the stage which is this huge gaudy gold thing.",1,,
145,Kelly B.,"Mount Baldy, CA",26,29,1,4.0,7/9/2013,"Beautiful and bizarre is the best way to describe the decor of The Cutting Room. There's cool and quirky art work (a guitar chandelier in addition to some odd stuff on the second floor). I've only been there a few times (mostly for free events with free alcohol) and have discovered some pretty decent bands. Its stage is excellent, and if you go to the second floor you can usually find a table. If you're interested in free events then check this venue out on Eventbrite.",1,,
146,Chloe F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,0,1.0,2/16/2016,"Bartender/Waitress/Service Personnel at this place are evil. As in evil to the extent that the experience of watching an amazing show  (80s/90s coverband Stifflers Mom) was compromised. Waitress comes to our table. Friend asks ""what's the liquor in today's shot of the day?"" ($5 shot that changes daily) Waitress (with attitude): i have no idea. Do you want it or not? (No offer to find out what it is- no that would be crazy) i say yes. She asks one or two? I say one. 2 shots get delivered. We ask for one to be taken off the bill as we only ordered one. She then proceeds to argue with us as if her mistake is our fault, and that ""the owner is going to be very upset"" um ok. We also asked for food menus and never got them- which is fine, no biggie. Yes she was rude, but the bartender really took the cake. Other reviewers have mentioned this, but they only serve men. Myself and another female (stranger) were skipped so many times it became laughable and she had her boyfriend place my order for me after a near miss where a female bartender listened to my order then feigned amnesia and moved on the man next to me. My drink order was an adios motherf***er- the bartender said in an extremely bitchy tone ""I have no idea what the fuck that is"" I'm like ""its like a Long Island- never mind, I'll just have a Long Island."" Again she repeats ""I don't know what the fuck that is"" and gives me a nasty look. Like what the hell are u trying to do mean girl bartender? Is your job not to be nice to patrons who are literally paying $12 for well vodka shots? Is there a reason ur trying to shame me for my order instead of doing your job? And trying to embarrass me in front of strangers as if I'm ordering some crazy made up drink? Adios's are common where I'm from, and most bartenders would just ask ""what's in it?"" And I had hastily switched my order to a Long Island after her initial attitude so maybe just think about making a drink instead of literally just standing there giving me attitude and rude looks? I'm like ""u don't know what a Long Island is?"" She's like ""yea I do""- At that point I didn't want to drop any more money on the ""service""- said forget it and went back to watching the show. Never again. Shame on you cutting room.",1,1,1
147,Chloe M.,"Oakland, CA",341,12,2,1.0,3/15/2015,"The worst worst WORST show experience I've ever had. They left us standing out in the rain for an hour after the ""doors opened"".... Lauryn hill.... I am not even gonna go there. #enoughsaid.... and then we had to run all over the restaurant to track down our credit card we asked to have back an hour before.

148,Dan C.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,170,2,4.0,6/14/2013,"Recently saw the band Snarky Puppy in the backroom. The sound quality was OUTSTANDING. The band itself was amazing, but that's for another review.

149,Toni V.,"Staten Island, NY",0,15,0,1.0,2/22/2016,"I was there on Saturday to see The Lords of 52nd Street - they were great, the venue was not.  Couldn't get a seat even after pre-purchasing tickets.  All the front row seats were ""reserved"" and we ended up going upstairs.  Waited over an hour for a drink and two hours for mediocre and overpriced food.  When the food did come, we had no utensils, napkins, etc.  Ridiculous.  The management is awful and doesn't even respond when you talk to them to tell them what's going on.  Would definitely not recommend to anybody.",1,,
150,Fred S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,9,0,1.0,6/13/2015,"There is no excuse to have a sold out show & have absolutely no air conditioning in the venue. Last night SUCKED because it was unbearably hot   .It's possible the AC was broken for that night so I might have a little understanding. But I had friends who went to the same venue 2 weeks ago to see Moe & it was sold out & unbearable hot NO AC.  So there you have it these owners do not give a shit about your comfort or safety,the Fire Marshall should be notified as this place is a hazard. It was that bad.",,,
151,Paul F.,"River Edge, NJ",43,59,21,4.0,4/13/2015,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. We were a party of 4. The place was SRO for the Cowsills. After reading some prior reviews I was expecting a typical mish mosh of service and food.....Wrong! Anna our server was spot on. The toughest thing in a crowded venue is connecting with your customers. Well Anna was at our table like clockwork. The food was brought to our table in a very timely manner. It was very good and appropriate for this type of venue. The drinks were never empty more than a few minutes before Anna was there to ask if we needed anything. When all was done the mood of the evening was not broken by having to wait for the check, which would be expected, the crowd being what it was. Once again Anna was right there.The only thing keeping the 5th Star at bay goes on management. If you say the doors open at 6....don't open them at 7 and make us wait till 7:30 to get through the door.When all is said and done....I'll be back!",,,
152,Douglas A.,"Staten Island, NY",22,11,5,4.0,9/20/2013,"So we went here to see a friend perform, Carrie Welling (formerly of the Vanity Bells and The Shells), and I knew there was a $20pp minimum, I figured I would drink it not expecting  the food to be all that interesting. First of all, The Cutting Room is a really nice place, the bar is well laid out, a cool guitar lighting fixture hangs in the middle of the room and they had some nice Jazz playing ie Brubeck and Jobim/Getz, the kind of room that welcomes people.The music stage and dining room are in another  room, again a very well designed room with stage. It has a theatrical feel and an air of sophistication.We checked out the menu and joked that it looked good but can the food really be good and fresh...We ask a gentleman who was working about the food and he got very serious, he said the food was terrific and he was so serious he said it came with a money back guarantee. So we ordered, 2 of us got the Steak f rites and another got the House Burger.The steak was tender (it was a strip) cooked perfectly and tasted great, both of us were very pleased, the friend who had the burger was very satisfied as well, none of the fries (f rites)  were left on anyone's plate. We also had a Soy Tuna roll as an appetizer which was very good and we shared a Fig and Goat Cheese Flat Bread which was also good.This  is a great place to see live music and get good food, bring a date or just go with friends.",,,
153,Drew E.,"Ringwood, NJ",0,32,0,1.0,11/8/2013,"This review is based solely on the 'Ron Wood, Mick Taylor & Special Guests' early show on Nov. 7, 2013.ZERO STARS.Ticket prices were $300 (VIP), $200 (General Seating) and $100 (Standing). I had no problem with what, at the time, seemed like fair prices. After purchasing, I found out that the prices for the Fri. and Sat. night sets were $150, $100, and $50. My ticket was TWICE as much. When Ron and Mick came on stage they announced that the show was a tribute to blues man Jimmy Reed and that they would be playing his music exclusively. I have no problem with that, EXCEPT, that was not the way the show was billed. The music was great! All 52 minutes of it ( no encore). And those 'Special Guests?' One of the owners told someone I know ""They're Friday and Saturday."" All in all, a disappointing, blatant rip-off of the customers attending this show. There was a later, 'Invite Only' set which I've seen reported as being 90 minutes. Why was the early set twice as expensive as the next two nights? Why were 'Special Guests' advertised but not produced? The Cutting Room should be ashamed. They apparently complained about high prices being charged on StubHub and then decided to go into the price-gouging business themselves. ZERO STARS.",13,,
154,R K.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/3/2013,"I'm conflicted as to how many stars to give to this establishment....I came here with a group of friends to see Ariana and the Rose (club is also owned by Chris Noth, so a bonus reason to go). While we enjoyed the performance and the service was OK, I would peg my review and experience at 3 stars. Reason I'm knocking off 2 stars is based on what we saw happening after the show when we were outside saying good bye to our friends. A great night was somewhat tainted after we witnessed one of the employees furiously/violently yelling at a patron to ""GET THE F* OUT OF HERE!!!!"",  and rambling on about a $2 tip. Since when was gratuity mandatory and part of the bill? I'm not sure of the backstory, but the thought of an establishment literally throwing out a patron for not giving a large enough tip makes me skeptical about their practices. Makes me think twice about setting foot in a place where employees publicly humiliate customers for not doing something that is voluntary and correlated with good service (which leads me to believe she did not receive great service throughout the night based on how it ended with her running out of the club).Not sure if Chris Noth knows this stuff is happening at his establishment. It's a reflection on him so he really should do a better job at quality-controlling his staff.",12,1,
155,Punita K.,"Boston, MA",13,52,33,3.0,2/19/2015,Kind of a cool venue with a nice small stage...beer selection was okay. I think it is a nice place to rent space for a show. Interior decor was interesting. Could use some updates.,,,
156,Jenny T.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,221,722,4.0,1/25/2015,Great happy hour deal right across the street from my office in Murray Hill! $6 wines and $5 draft beers. Food selection is decent and perfect for sharing. Theres plenty of seating and it's a fairly large venue so it doesn't get uncomfortably crowded or unnecessarily noisy. Would definitely recommend for groups looking to actually hear what their friends are talking about.,,,

158,Casey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,2.0,11/25/2013,"This review is for a special event held at The Cutting Room. First of all, why double book a movie screening with a jazz band? For both, sound is integral. Second of all, $12 for whiskey is insane. Especially when they don't differentiate between Jameson and Dewar's. If I ask for Jameson, give me Jameson. $48 for 4 whiskeys is for the birds. Too expensive. No atmosphere. Go somewhere else.",4,,

Not only does the place bill great acts but the food is surprisingly enjoyable. I've been here for multiple shows and while the venue isn't tiny by any means, you can easily get up front, producing the feeling you're at an intimate show with your best friends. Love the way they geared the atmosphere towards everything and all things music - I could stare at the guitar chandelier for hours. And be sure to look up, both at the ceiling and the stairs. You won't be disappointed! Classy yet funky, the Cutting Room has my vote.",,,
163,Donna M.,"Patterson, NY",0,25,0,3.0,8/17/2014,"The food is very good but the service truly is horrendous.  It is obvious that they are short staffed.  The servers are literally all over the place.  It was infuriating sitting for a half hour with the show already started and not even ordering a drink.  After asking 3 different people for a waiter/waitress, one finally appeared after about 40 minutes.  This seems to be a running theme in the reviews. The waitress wasn't rude at all just very busy.  My tip, after 10 minutes ask the host to get you a waiter, order everything you might want in one shot, seriously, ketchup and all.  I would only come back to support a band that I had a personal connection with.  For just a night out with good music and a meal I would go anywhere else.",1,,

I was proven wrong the other night. They are as awful as ever. Table service was non-existent, everyone at my table left the concert room when they needed a drink refill. The attitude from the bartenders was just add bad tho. I tried to get the attention of one of two bartenders having a lengthy personal conversation. One stopped talking to say ""I see you"" and them went back to her conversation before coming over to tell me I didn't have to keep trying to wave her down, ""she can see."" I opted to leave a minimal tip for her lecture and attitude rather than explain that she could have shown me she noticed me by posting attention to the paying customer instead of continuing her social conversation. Oh yeah, they charge you for things you never got, and they charge tax on drinks at tables! I hope my friend's band never plays here again.",8,,1

166,Rosa B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,51,31,1.0,4/7/2013,"Terrible experience here, which is unfortunate because it might be a pretty nice place. We went on a Thursday evening around 6pm (happy hour) and asked the hostess if the happy hour was just at the bar or at the tables too. She responded that it was anywhere so we sat at a table. We ordered two glasses of Pinot Grigio (which were terrible) and my other friend asked ""what are well drinks?"" (she's a little silly). The special was $5 well drinks, the waitress explained a little about what they are so my friend ordered a vanilla vodka and coke. When the bill arrived, they had charged us $13 for the vanilla vodka and coke, turns out, the waitress gave her Stoli. When we questioned her about the price she responded ""happy hour is only at the bar"" to which we told her that the hostess had said otherwise. She huffed and walked away with out credit cards. When she came back she told us that the flavored vodkas aren't included in happy hour and that's the way it is at every happy hour all the time. Besides this being a straight out BS statement I said to the waitress ""well, we were asking about the well drinks and it would be customary, at that point, if you told us that what we were ordering was not part of the special. She huffed again and walked away again with our cards. At this point she just kept walking back and forth in front of our table hold our credit cards and not doing anything for us. Finally she came back and said ""I don't know what to do because if I take this off your check, I have to pay for the difference."" I then offered to talk to her boss for you since she was having such a hard time. She decided then that she would just fix it. FINALLY! When she came back with our corrected check, she decided to give us a lesson on happy hour and what it meant. I had to shut her up by basically screaming THANK YOU! and grabbing our cards from her hand. Despite my friends silly question, we go to happy hour in this neighborhood at least once a week and this was the first and LAST time we go to this place. Watch out for this waitress, she's blonde and sort of has a faint mustache. She's terrible!Also, the food is really under portioned for appetizers and sharing.",5,2,

The guitar chandelier is stunning and the excitement in the room for the event I attended was infectious. However, the service was extremely slow, when the food finally arrived it was cold (I ordered a veggie burger). And moreover the veggie burger fell apart and tasted as if it was from the frozen foods section of Key Food. It also took forever to get the attention of the server in order to get my food warmed and to get some ketchup.

Drinks are the price you'd expect with a $20 per person minimum. The food didn't look too impressive but we still got a flat bread to snack on. The fact that basil meant one leaf split into four pieces across the whole thing actually made it kind of memorable. You don't go for the food though. I'll be back if there's something else on the calendar that looks interesting to me. I think the complaints about seating, service and air conditioning are really tied to how packed the place is. Admittedly the show I went to had very few people so that has likely positively biased me about The Cutting Room.",,,

As with all of NY, food and drinks are pricey, and there's a $20 pp minimum.  And service is slow.  So, be aware that that's the norm. However, if you're ok with waiting, I'd recommend it. For about $85 each with VIP tickets, we saw an awesome show.  Compare that to tickets to big shows for $200-400 each, that's a great deal.",,,

181,Dara C.,"New York, NY",11,14,0,1.0,11/3/2013,"I will start out this review by saying the manager is lucky I am not filing a police report accusing him of HARASSMENT!This place should be shut down by the city and all the staff fired and I will explain why..A few friends and I went to this venue last night to check out a band that our friend was playing with.   We had stepped into the room where the band was playing and went to find seats with our friends.  Within 2 seconds the manager comes over screaming and saying we need to sit down already, so we quickly grabbed a single chair from a table next to my group. He starts screaming that how dare we grab that chair because we are taking a table away.  I thought to myself, what does he care who is sitting in the chair if there is a $20 pp minimum anyways?So, the night goes on..I order a sauvignon blanc which is the only wine I enjoy and of course they had no more in stock so I had to order a Pinot Grigio that tasted like it was bought from Duane Reade.My other friend orders a beer from their limited selection and we had planned to order more drinks and food however the waitress comes over to bring the bill right when the band that we came for comes on stage.  So at this point, can't order more food or drinks so we assumed we obviously didn't need to meet the $20 minimum..Score for us!The waitress comes over to check if we had paid about 10 times while we were watching the final band. After awhile I finally put in $ for my wine as well as my friend.  Apparently there  were other girls who were originally sitting at our table and then moved.  We had no idea who they were and I told the waitress I did not know who had ordered the other drinks on the bill.  At that time she responds with ""Well I don't just make things up and put it on your bill"".  Ok thanks for the attitude!So then this situation is obviously too much for her small brain to handle so she calls over her manager. I kindly explain that my friend and I have put in $ for our bill and we are not sure what the other charges are. He shouts at me ""There's a $20 minimum per person! SEE THE SIGN!!"" .Now this is when I started to get annoyed..I said "" I fully understand that sir and if the waitress didn't give us the bill an hour ago I would have been more than happy to order my $20 worth"" ..He denies that and says he was timing her and she gave us the bill 20 minutes ago...TOTAL LIAR!Anyways, the women who moved to another table paid their share and left barely anything for a tIp .The bill was $50 and we left an $8 tip which was about 17% tip (the tax was 4.50 so we roughly doubled the tax).  The manager comes over with a flashlight on the bill and starts screaming at me again ""YOU LEAVE AN $8 TIP FOR MY WAITRESS??""  I said, ""Sir..We left almost a 20 percent tip and that is customary..We would have ordered more but she gave us the bill so early we never had a chance to""..At this point he gets in my face and says ""THIS IS NY...IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO LEAVE 20% HERE""  I was extremely furious at this point and said ""I've grown up in NY all my life sir so you can take it and shove it""  At this point I felt uncomfortable being in the venue any longer so I went outside waiting for my friend, and the manager follows me! He starts screaming and going on a rampage saying something to the effect of 'HOW DO YOU SIT AT A TABLE WITH PEOPLE YOU DONT KNOW BLAH BLAH BLAH..."" He was speaking and it wasn;' even making any sense.  I was trying to explain to him that those girls switched tables and perhaps they were my friends friends but why do I need to explain myself anyways. At this point he is screaming SO LOUD that everyone in the front of the venue hears and I start pointing out to everyone that this is the manager of this establishment and they should notice how he is screaming at a woman and abusing a woman.  He starts screaming and telling everyone I left a $2 TIP(which was  obviously not TRUE)...I step outside to leave and he follows me so I run around the corner and get a cab and leave!I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE BEEN TREATED LIKE THIS AS A PAYING CUSTOMER! THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE FOR $ AND TAKE IT OUT ON THEIR PAYING CUSTOMERS! STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",28,5,1
182,Thais A.,"Manhattan, NY",24,8,2,2.0,3/16/2015,"Came here for Lauryn Hill the other evening and not even sure where to start.  First, stood in rain for over an hour past the time that the doors were supposed to open, without explanation or even someone from the club perhaps walking the long line and assuring people that doors would open soon (it didn't have to be true, but at least try to make me feel better about ruining my hair in the rain).   Once seated (and good thing I bought reserved seating as show was three and 1/2 hours late getting started), it took forever to get drinks and food.  Specifically, over two hours for food to arrive and I had to go to bar to get my own drink because over an hour to wait for a glass of wine was just too much to take.  If you're going to keep people waiting three hours for a concert at least give them food and drink in a timely manner.  It goes a long way towards maintaining some goodwill.  Worst was when we complained to the manager, he response was ""I understand, but its really packed in here"".  They sold the tix and made the decision to pack people in, so knew it would be crowded.  The failure to staff appropriately is simply a reflection of their lack of professionalism.  Unfortunately, the waitress may have gotten the brunt of everyone's frustration in the little corner where I was seated, but ultimately, it was management's fault and truly was unacceptable.  I did give one star for the look and ambiance of the venue.  Cute place for an intimate concert (although as noted by another review, the sound needed a bit of work).  I gave another star for the concert itself.  I thought Lauryn was awesome and her tardiness was simply her living up to her reputation.  Was probably to be expected by the fans, so should have been expected and anticipated by management.",,,

184,Maria L.,"East Bronx, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/22/2013,"I have never seen a place go down so much in only four months. It was our 29th Anniversary and I figured it would be as good as last time. Were we disappointed, first I got harassed for sitting in wrong sit, because I was told they were VIP seats, thenthere was no air conditioner on, so it was hot and stuffy.  The food and drinks are very expensive. To top it off they served me cappuccino without my dessert (pie). This place was so nice when it opened but its already going downhill in such a short time.What a shame!",,,

187,John W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0,2.0,10/2/2014,"Guitar chandelier in the lobby is nice and there is nothing wrong with the atmosphere in the room.  However, that's about where it ends.I sat off to one side of the stage and the sound was not well mixed at all.  I suspect that from the engineer's perspective in the back of the room, the mix was ok, but the shape of the room does not lend itself well to the small number of speakers they have.  So, if you go, get there early enough to get a table in the center.Food was fine.  Nothing to write home about, but good.Service was pretty bad.  At one point I asked 3 different people a total of 5 times for a glass of water and some pepper.  Ironically, two of them brought me water at least  20 minutes after the initial request, along with one pepper shaker.The band was great.  So, if they have an act you really want to see, go ahead and go, but I would not recommend the ""new and improved cutting room"" until it has, in fact, improved.",1,,
188,Todd P.,"Danielsville, GA",2,1,0,2.0,1/12/2015,"There are no ""quiet voices"" used at The Cutting Room.Sunday evening at The Cutting Room represented one of the fine bargains in NYC entertainment.  Five quality acts, capped by the incredible Morgan James.  For less than $30 cover plus a $20 minimum, there were fewer dollars spent per minute of fine music than any other place in recent memory.  That was the good news and why I wanted to love this place.  Alas, it was the crowd that almost spoiled the evening.   It's not clear why everyone was there, but it wasn't for the music.  A table of twelve up front and to the left of the stage had at least four conversations going without break for the first 90 minutes.  A couple behind me was on an early date and decided they needed to chat nonstop for two hours.  Nobody uses their ""quiet voice"" that we all learned in grade school.  The wait staff responds accordingly with all transactions happening with bustle and in full voice.  Bus people flashed LED flashlights all over the room, which fit in with the many flash bulbs of patrons taking pictures of each other all evening.  Even when the main dining room/stage area quieted a bit for a ballad, there was a steady 80 DB din from the bar area that never shut up.   If you are completely self-centered and in desire of so-so food to go along with midtown priced cocktails, you'll feel right at home.  If you want to focus on the music and respect hard working performers, the Metropolitan Room, 54 Below and Birdland are all much better options.",,,
189,Brian E.,"Glastonbury, CT",46,11,2,1.0,3/21/2014,The drink sizes are not consistent from bartender to bartender and they are very rude... Which is ridiculous at these prices ($30 for 2 drinks).,2,,

191,Rob E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,27,1,1.0,7/27/2013,"LOUD, OVERPRICED, INATTENTIVE, BAD SOUND. Don't bother coming here unless you want to get ripped off.Seriously. A total Ripoff.Just got back from the ""new Improved"" (cough) Cutting Room to see a band. We were informed upon paying 15$ (the only charge listed on the website BTW) that the previous set went long, it would not start at 10PM, they'd let us know, go grab a drink at the bar. So, 20$ later for 2 Pinot Grigios, we wait (apparently they were 10$ each, but after asking the Bartender twice and her not hearing us due to the loud music, we just assumed that was the price since she never returned with change.).--Side Note-- Their website is touting $10 tickets in advance instead of $15 at the door. However, you must register for Cutting Room's promotional Website and after that, they STILL charge you a 2$ fee per ticket. You only save 3$  and they register your email to harass you. nice.)Anyway,We checked at the door to the performance space by the bar, but were referred to *another* door - we made the mistake of going to the *back* door to the performance space, and after being corrected, we had to go thru a private room (with a private party at one large table) to enter the venue. But we were told the setup wasn't ready, so we returned to the bar and waited for the announcement that the band was on in the other room (the main part of Cutting Room is a large restaurant with LOUD speakers.)Except, no announcement came. I happened to see a friend when i was in the restroom. He said are you here to see XXX ? I said yeah, to learn the band was already on stage.So we head in, having to convince the door guy we have stamps on our hands because he can't see in the low light.And they've been playing for three songs. And there is a $20 PER PERSON cover at every table in the venue - which wasn't listed on the website or mentioned at the door.So we payed $90 to see 6 songs of a badly mixed band (the sound and lighting were horrendous and amateurish. Strobe lights,really?) basically missing 1/3 of their set. We complained to the ticket taker and he blew us off. Took our money easy enough though, but couldn't care if i missed the whole set - even though HE said there would be an announcement. We complained to the promoter and she was bummed. Even moreso since we won't be back to see this band.We wanted to complain to a manager but after waiting 10 minutes, we decided we wouldn't be back. Don't waste your time, and if your favorite band is playing here, avoid it- the sound is worse than you'd hope. Don't waste your cash on a substandard venue that does not care about your experience there.",4,,
192,P A.,"Port Washington, NY",0,13,0,1.0,5/18/2013,I walked out even though I had pre paid tickets. Totally unorganized. The show was super late. They want you to buy drinks. Never again.,4,,
193,B. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,104,1,5.0,6/10/2014,"I attended this venue during the Spring time to see the music artist, Judy Torres perform singing her hits, covers and more. She was excellent as is the venue. The venue has a classy ambiance without being pretentious. Although I had nothing to eat at the time, the bar is EXCELLENT! They mixed quality cocktails that are FULLY worth what it is priced. The sound of the performance area is excellent. Anywhere you are seated gives you a fabulous view of the stage. Everyone working there I encountered there was both friendly and helpful. The tables are spaced wide enough apart that if you felt the desire to get up a dance little bit you can without hitting anything. Overall, The Cutting Room is one of the finest venues I have ever visited. I do not know how it is on a day to day basis, however, the one time I was here, it was most certainly a hit night and one I enjoyed very much! If there is any other artist I enjoy performing there, I would not hesitate to purchase my ticket then visit this venue again.",,,
194,Kelly M.,"Goldens Bridge, NY",0,9,0,2.0,11/1/2015,"We were there to see Stella Blues last night (Halloween). The bar was four rows deep with two bartenders. Now, before I go on, I just want to say that at this point, I was actually feeling bad for the bartenders. You have 400 deadheads in this place and two bartenders. Really? Anyway, after waiting VERY patiently for about 30 minutes, I finally get to the bar. I did not complain, I did not push, get aggressive, or give the bartenders the stink eye. I am a women, mid 30s. All the patrons around me were men, and there were 2 women bartenders. The tall blond girl had the one side of the bar, the brunette had the other. They were each taking orders down the line. I thought this was efficient. I understood the situation, not their fault, and, I waited patiently for my turn. Brunette bartender skipped me once. I let it go. Skipped me twice. Now at this point I'm noticing that this women is favoring the males and I recruited my boyfriend to take the spot next to me to get a better chance at getting a drink...since you know...he's a guy. Can you believe she skipped me AGAIN?To the point that even the people next to me noticed. I literally threw my credit card up in the air and stormed off. 45 minutes and still no drink. My boyfriend wound up ordering two rounds at a time so we didn't have to go through it all over again if we wanted another. This episode literally set the mood for the rest of the night. I don't understand what this was about. But it put such a damper on the evening that I plan on contacting management AND the band whose members I know personally to let them know how unhappy this made us. I don't write yelp reviews. I had to download the app and go through changing an ancient password just to write this. I am appalled and will never step foot in the place again. It ruined our Halloween and what was supposed to be a fun date night in the city.",,,
195,C. L.,"Seaford, NY",0,1,0,2.0,1/20/2014,My wife and I were here recently for a show.  We had been there a few times and truly enjoyed the food and decided to wait to eat.  When we were seated and ordered and were surprised at how long it took to be served our food.  When it came we were very disappointed.  What has happened.  When we asked why the quality was not what we were expecting we were told the chef had recently left and they have had trouble adjusting.  We finished but will not eat again here soon.  The drinks were fine and show was ok but we were confused by how the food could lose its quality so quickly.  Please fix this so we can enjoy the show with dinner like we had previously.,1,,
196,Hector L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,6/1/2014,"This is my first Yelp review and I am glad that I could write it for the Cutting Room.Just had my wife's 30th birthday party at this location this past Friday.  The first thing I have to point out is that working with Susan (the manager) to set everything up was a breeze.  I walked in one day as I had never been in the establishment, and she was very open to conversation and receptive to what I was looking for.  I gave her my guest count and the type of appetizers I wanted served and she made it happen.The day of the party, as I had reserved the East Balcony (which looks down onto the main floor/bar area), all my guests (30 in total) had to do was talk to the person at the front and they were told where to go.  After I arrived with my wife for the big surprise, we were assigned a waitress that took car of us the entire duration of our stay.  She took our drink orders and had the appetizers that I had previously ordered brought up.  That waitress worked like a mad woman as she had to run up and down the stairs to make sure we were taken care of.All in all, it was a great experience.  The venue itself is very unique in its look which is refreshing as most of the bars in nyc tend to stat recycling the same decor.  At the end of the night, Susan came up to make sure we had a good time and say hello to my wife.I will def go back to this place to have drink and catch a show next time",,,

198,Christine L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,45,0,1.0,6/27/2015,"I had known the Cutting Room mainly as a venue for live performances, but decided to check it out for a meal this past Friday afternoon when we noticed that they had a lunch special.  There were only three other people there, all sitting at the bar since it was a bit late for lunch on a weekday (almost 2PM).  My friend and I sat at the bar and it took 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention since she was having a conversation with a patron.  We both ordered burgers (my friend medium well and me medium rare).  When the burgers arrived, they were both overdone and it took us a while to find the bartender again as she had disappeared into the office at the front.  When the cook arrived with my re-done burger the bartender was again nowhere to be found and I had to get up to flag down the cook (who was walking around trying to find the bartender) so I could get my burger.  Again had to go to the front to get the check and then back to the front again to pay.  When we walked out, we noticed that she was back in the office on the internet.  If the service is anything like this when the place was empty, I can't imagine ever going back for a meal when there are actually other people there!  Not a good way to build a lunch business folks!  I'll stick to the occasional live show and skip the food.  What a disappointment!",,,
199,Fiona M.,"Greenwich, CT",1,2,0,1.0,10/15/2014,"The Cutting Room pulled a classic bait and switch on us last night when we went to see a band recommended by my friend's brother. We checked the Cutting Room's website a few days before the show, and again on the day of the show, and it advertised ticket prices of $15 for standing-room tickets at the bar, and $25 for table seats, both with a $20 food or drink minimum.  When we got there, however, the hostess told us that they were no longer offering standing-room tickets - not because they were sold out but because management had decided to sell only table seating tickets - and that table seating was $30, plus the $20 minimum.  Putting aside the fact that the place arbitrarily decided to nix standing room tickets, where did the $30 price come from for table tickets? Management was plainly just jacking up the price in the hope that we would pay it since we had already taken the trouble to get to midtown.  This place clearly has no respect for its customers and was just trying to see what it could get away with.  We didn't go in and won't be going back.",3,,
