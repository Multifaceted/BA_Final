0,Dutch S.,"Atlantic City, NJ",40,338,435,5.0,8/12/2013,"Lovely staff. Small seating area. Right in front of the CitiBike stand. I love their coffee and their croissant (unheated) but what I like most is that this place is pretty peaceful and quiet in the afternoon. I think it gets packed in the AM. Great Tuna Salad, by the way and their Smoked Salmon Cream Cheese is deelish.",,,
1,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,1.0,10/8/2016,Somehow this place managed to get their old listing removed and get a new one put up. The donuts are always stale whether you go in the morning or afternoon. Any of the sandwiches with chicken always taste like the chicken was undercooked. Coffee always tastes old like no one cleans the machines/filters. The attitude of the staff is horrible. I only come here if I really want coffee and don't feel like crossing the street to go to one of the carts.,,,
2,K T.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,4/7/2017,"Don't even think about going there at 7:00 am....always such a long wait. On most days, the line is to the door with only one or two employees visible. The woman behind the register is not always pleasant and seems to use manners only with certain people. Rude and slow as molasses!!!!",,,
3,Danielle W.,"Richmond, VA",2,69,0,5.0,5/4/2013,"How does this particular Dunkin not have any reviews. Come on First Ave stop L train commuters, you know this branch is the sh**. Even with massive lines they are fast and friendly. Their multitasking warms my heart each time and over several years of patronage and many different employees they have never once messed up my order of ""large coffee with a turbo shot, extra skim, cinnamon flavor, and 3 Splenda"". Yeah, that's right, that's what I order and I own it.",,,
