0,Keoni C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,21,2,4.0,8/23/2018,"I think people are being too harsh on this place. It's a fucking Applebee's. Came here to pig out on some apps and really sugary drinks. It's exactly like any other Applebee's because it's a chain. One of the better chicken fingers in the city. Service was quick and got orders right. Only issue was when I wanted the check and couldn't find he waiter and had to ask a bus boy who only said ""no"". But eventually I got it.",,,
1,Ivan V.,"Jersey City, NJ",86,27,10,1.0,11/5/2018,"To the manager of this locale:I just came out from watching a movie at the AMC 25. Because the escalators were non-operational or going up and I didn't initially think of the elevator in the second floor lobby area, I decided to take a shortcut into the establishment and proceed to go out into the street and towards the PATB. You saw me coming first I suppose because I was deep in thought from the film (I host a movie site and was collecting my ideas to write) and immediately stopped me. I didn't know what I'd done wrong; I was simply coming into the locale and as far as I know there is no rule against doing so. It had fleetingly occurred to me to perhaps have a quick dinner but I just wanted to go home. But you, manager who worked the evening shift, decided you had a bone to pick and it could have been anyone: now it was me. A simple movie goer and potential customer. You began in front of a NYPD officer and others to belittle me as if your routine was a comedy act and you were Karen Walker. I kept saying ""I'm going home."" But that didn't go well with you and you then swung into a mock barrage of faux-languages that have been used to point out when someone is ""slow."" I asked, ""What?"" Because I couldn't understand what was your attitude all about and What were you trying to prove, in front of a cop, no less. You didn't let up and continued your onslaught and even when I told you, without losing my cool--I too work with customers and I know the value of treating people with dignity--""I speak English,"" you cackled and stated ""well. You looked like you didn't understand it.""What makes you think that a manager can talk to a customer or even a transient person in this way? How can you expect me or anyone else--because later, when I came back in and spoke to one of your people, I found out you do this frequently and can ""run people the wrong way""-will come and feel welcome in your establishment? When you are a manager you REPRESENT the locale. I have eaten in Applebee's since 1996 and I've never experienced other than possibly sub-pat comfort food. All I was doing was walking through. I was and am not a threat to you but you somehow made it your business to make it seem that way. I also, for your information, am multilingual and Work in linguistics. So yes. I did understand English--just not the tripe that was coming out of your underpaid mouth. You are a disgrace to Applebee's and I thank you for not breaking my patience nor my calm. I would eat at the chain. Just not this one. Treat people better. You'll be surprised at what you get back.",,,

No one attempted to get the man thrown out, just awkward blank stares and shuffled feet in silence. Eventually the bartender had the nerve to hand her a bill while the verbal assault continued. Like really?! I have never been so disappointed and quite frankly disgusted at the lack of attempt to protect a person from a racial attack within their business. I hope someone caught the ordeal on video and it goes viral because that man needs to be seen for who he is and this establishment needs to realize it's their duty to protect their customers.

7,Amanda B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,47,13,1.0,9/19/2018,"This place is truly horrible. There's a reason that they only have two stars. I really have to believe that some of the positive reviews are from friends of employees or something similar. I sat down and ask if it was happy hour. It was not so, I ask how much a glass of house Chardonnay would be. I was told 8 something. I also decided to order a turkey quesadilla burger. It took almost an hour and it was barely edible. When the bill arrived, my charge was $80! As I looked over my bill, I realize that I was being charged for 4 glasses of wine AND  I was being charge for the premium KJ wine. I never asked for KJ, I asked for house. Even after asking for the manager it took 4 times, for them to fix my bill. So, it is absolutely not worth to stop at this place, if it's not happy hour. The bartenders are clueless and the practice of adding the tip to your bill is, completely unethical. I personally think it is preying visitors, don't speak or understand English, that well. Shame on you Applebee's for such unethical practices. I don't care how close I am staying to your location, I won't ever eat at any of your locations. If you wonder why you are having to close other locations, it is because your business model does not work. Your Time Square store will be close soon, too.",2,,

Updated review","Worst Applebee's store. Not a big fan but went in for lunch. Good server but food is awful. Buffalo wings were cold so they were cooked earlier, our sandwiches were taken to table next to us so after some seconds we ask the couple is that what you orders? They say no so we took our food from their table. Sandwich was ok but fries were old and cold. Spoke to manager who did offer his apologies. Then you are obligated to 18% or higher for tips. No way Jose Applebee's you are dead to us",1,1,
14,Angela L.,"New York, NY",289,221,186,3.0,9/24/2017,"Pretty pricey for a chain restaurant. Had a $75 for a two people dinner. Also, this applebees doesn't adhere to those ads you see on tv for dinner deals - they think they're too good for that. Waiter was very inattentive. Used that nonsense tablet they have on tables now to call him but he never looked and the red blinker. He'd be two tables away and still not see that we were calling him, man. All I wanted was a refill...Food was good tho tbh",1,,

16,Anya R.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,0,1.0,8/23/2018,"After waiting 20 minutes for an order of nachos I asked if they would come soon. So the server checks on them and returns with a cold plate of nachos. Of course I send them back.  Finally we get a warm plate of spicy nachos. Just what we wanted except our tongues are burning! The two beverages we ordered with the nachos never came! 45 minutes prior to eating the nachos.....When we arrive and sit at the bar, the server tells us that we can't sit there and has us move to  another part. Okay, not a big deal except that less than a half hour later she allows three others to sit in the exact same spot. I could be wrong but that felt like discrimination. It was at this point that I should have gone with my instinct. Our server ignored us the entire time (same one who asked us to move) and only asked if we were okay right before we asked for the check.  Service was the worst I've ever experienced. Never going back.",,,

18,Lisa H.,"Washington, DC",107,56,82,3.0,9/24/2017,"Food was DELICIOUS. Burger was seasoned, salads were great. Our server name was Christian (Chris for short). He was so pleasant and made sure we're kept update on the status of our meal, he made sure our drinks were refilled, etc. We planned on going back for breakfast since this locations provides it on Sundays. When I called the lady said ""Go to the website."" I stated it wasn't listed on the site; and I would just like to know what is offered, she kept saying ""go to Applebee's.com and it's there"" and it seemed as if she didn't know what was listed on the menu herself. I suggest she be properly trained before answering the phone and just rushing customers off.",,,
19,Mark F.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",1,99,0,3.0,8/7/2018,"I could easily give this place a two-star but I am feeling generous. The food is Applebees so we all know what that is whether we are in Times Square or Lower Boumphuqwest. The prices are revealed so you can decide if that is worth it for yourself. Therefore the key thing is the variables - service, cleanliness, quality of what is promised.It is the service where this one fell down on my second visit which in the interest of full disclosure was October 2017.  I had a ticket to go see a movie, I want to say it was an Avengers or DC one but I can't remember. So I had somewhere to be. The trouble was getting the bill when I had finished. I had to ask twice and it took 10-15mins to get it all sorted. I mean god forbid I miss the trailers. The manager got on top of it all once she was aware of what was going so they can hold onto the third star.The meal, a NY Slam, was ultimately 20 bucks all up because I couldn't bring myself to bump off the tip which had been automatically added. I understand why they do that, Times Square and foreign tourists who might not get (might claim not to get) how it works, but not happy about that. The food was fine as it was the previous time.",,,
20,Shirley S.,"Brooklyn, NY",110,113,464,1.0,12/16/2017,"I have never been disappointed by Apple Bees until i came here. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful day shopping at times square after having a busy week of working and stress. i suggested us to go to apple bees after shopping because i personally had great experiences at other locations. Never again coming to this location.. Whats the point of having a waitress when I only seen the waitress twice. When she took our order and when she took our money. She didnt even serve us our food. After she took our order, 5 minutes later she came over and asked ""hows everything?"" when there was nothing on the table. No food and no drinks. I was so puzzled. Why are you asking me that if I haven't even got my food yet..? When my food came, a man brought the food to our table. Our food was cold and they got my whole order wrong. How does sirloin steak sound like chicken..? I ordered medium rare sirloin steak and my boyfriend ordered rare sirloin steak. They gave me chicken and corrected it after. Both steak was made WELL DONE. THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE ASKED FOR. Everytime the waitress came, she would walk away in 3 seconds. but when she gave us our check, she literally stood at our table and stared at us writing the tip. what... the... fuck... food sucks and customer service sucksdont bother coming here",2,2,2

They were extremely busy of course, and so I asked the hostess if our table would be nearby so that my things could be easily seen. She hesitated and shook her head no. Then just stood there without offering me another option. I told her I didn't feel comfortable leaving my bag there out in the open where anyone could just grab it and go, as my suitcase contained valuable items. Again, no response. I stated that I would like to sit and enjoy my meal comfortably without the concern of watching my bag. She rolled her eyes and escorted us to another area of the restaurant where I easily wheeled my tiny luggage under our table, unseen and out of anyone's way.

I came here with a group of friends for a birthday dinner and drinks.We went to the movies across the street and decided to get a bite to eat. What a mistake we made.I ordered the burbon chicken with potatoes.My chicken tasted like a bar of soap!!!My other friend got chicken Alfredo and the pasta was under cooked! My friends stir fry was also extremely salty! Our waiter also brought out the food before the drinks!The experience was horrible and it ruined my friends birthday meal.

Let me give you the lay down:My co-workers after work wanted to grab a drink because it was a Friday and Applebee's has the Long Island Ice Tea deals during the month of December. So we went and walk in.  They seated us on the main floor. Tell us none of the happy hour deals are applicable down here so that we should go upstairs; fine.  We get seated upstairs and find out that we went to the wrong part of the upstairs, so we should go closer to the bar; fine.  We walk over to the bar and if you look at the bar, the tables by the window do not count although we tried to sit there, so we went over to this little part of upstairs where we could sit and happy hour still was applicable; fine.  Finally, we sit there and tell us we won't get served over where we were sitting so we walk up to the bar and order our beers.  They have an increased 18% tip if you don't say anything which is dumb because you leave with a dumb amount of a change and don't really feel inclined to tip anymore afterwards when I would've tipped more in the beginning.  The menu is also quite expensive compared to a regular Applebee's, say one in the Bronx.  Just overall, horrible and the bathroom was not clean.

First we were seated upstairs in some back room which was way too hot and requested the air conditioning be adjusted. Fixed quickly, cool. Next it took a while for a waiter to greet us and take our order. Someone pops up.. He seemed in a rush kind of rushing us on the order. Making a recommendation would of been a plus but whatever.Then it took some time for the food to arrive and it was a different young man. Food, no utensils and we had to grab ketchup from another table. We asked another person (#4) for utensils and napkins. We receieved two napkins and 2 pairs of utensils. We're eating messy burgers with our hands, go figure. Then we cut our burgers in half and find that they weren't cooked how we requested. I'm not picky but i dont like dry beef. Now, we had enough and were getting ready to leave... all this took an hour... My bf spoke to a different hostess and she asked if we wanted to speak to a manager. We said yes and gave it about 5 minutes because we were ready to be out and not pay for the ridiculous service and food. Within just that breaking point Lily, the manager comes to us, listens attentively to our complaint, apologizes and ask us to stay and give them another chance. We had to leave soon to NJ but she politely insisted. Few minutes later, the right food, utensils, extra napkins and the original waiter checked on us frequently including Lily. That was cool. We were happy and laughing at the end of the night and were pleased with the final outcome. End of the day, I strongly believe that the cost of food in a restaurant takes into account the experience and service of eating there so once Lily rectified everything, it did feel like the prices matched the service at that point. Thank you Lily and the waiter that helped us; please don't take this as an insult, it's a learning experience.  I'm in retail and it takes alot to provide great service and we all learn to put ourselves in the customers position.  We'll be back!

It does have a very prime location in the middle of Times Square, which is reflected in the prices ($20 for a salad, $20+ for other entrees).  The service was abysmal. We waited at least 30 minutes for our food, and our waiter maybe checked on us once during the meal. The food itself was not exceptionally terrible. The portions were quite large.

45,Jennie B.,"Glen Head, NY",0,1,0,2.0,4/9/2018,"Would give Applebee's in Times Square a 5 star rating for being a top notch dining experience, however, knocking off 3 stars for the fake news they are also serving. Came here for $1 margaritas and when I got the bill was surprised to see that they were in fact $3. Since I drank 6 of them that added up to a $12 swing in cost....could break the bank for some people. Pros: In Times Square where people have good times. Margaritas get you lit.  Bartender had a good eye and knew when I needed a refill. You can bring your own pimp cup for special occasions. Cons: Taxation without representation. Have confirmation from people who visited other Applebee's that $1 margaritas were in fact $1.",,,
46,Jessica G.,"Ottawa, Canada",176,16,37,1.0,3/21/2018,"A quick stop to eat before my friend and I went to watch a Broadway Show. I found it interesting that they took orders and payments from this tablet but there had to be a server that would input it/approve the order before it was sent to the kitchen. I found it a little redundant in all honesty. I originally wanted to order the French Onion Soup, which was unfortunately not available that day. I find it difficult to believe that there was not enough ingredients to make this item...but I ordered the Spinach/Artichoke Dip which included chips and salsa. The salsa was better tasting than the main character of the dish which was a little disappointing since the amount I was paying was for the dip and not for the salsa. I ordered one of the berry lemonades which was way too sweet and sugary for my liking. I was practically drinking sugar water that was not dissolved properly. I would not recommend this place unless you were to get water and nachos if you were willing to pay more than the regular amount for a place close to the broadway theatre. The server was a nice at least, but that was about it.",,,
47,Susan H.,"New York, NY",306,168,284,2.0,12/27/2015,"The food is way overpriced! The American burger is basically a standard cheeseburger with no extra flare. And it cost almost $20?! The burger wasn't even big. The order also came with fries but the fries weren't fresh. Even fast food restaurants make better burgers and fries. On the other hand, the shrimp scampi was slightly better. It came with a lot of shrimp but the scampi sauce was not tasty. The pasta also cost $20 and it wasn't even up to par. Service was slow and on top of that, the 18% service charge was already included in the bill. So expensive for an unsatisfying dining experience. If you're price conscious like me, I suggest you don't come here. You definitely won't get the bang for your buck.",1,,

Updated review","Let me tell you guys what happened later. They called me against my complaints through website and left message like ""we're sorry about that and please call me back to what we can do"" and they never got my call, even during the hour they supposed to work.",,,
49,Angy S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",227,29,9,1.0,10/23/2017,"So Applebee's recently realized how much money they were losing and decided to do a month of $1 Margaritas. I got my team at work together to go try out their food and drinks. Most of the people that came were first timers so I was also excited for them to try it out because I always remembered Applebee's as a great place!A. The $1 Margaritas was a lie- they claimed they didn't have it at that location. I don't plan on going to any other locations to find out if it's real, but this is just false advertisement. B. They don't take reservations - this restaurant is in a central part of New York, it was dinner time, an important baseball (Yankees) game was playing, and I'd say it was 20% full- clearly they could have taken my reservation. C. The folks at my table tried to order certain drinks that were on the menu and the waiter came back for THREE of those drinks (all different ones fyi) and said they were out of them. So one of the guys ordered another beer on the menu, the waiter said they didn't have that one either. At which point we asked what they DID have, and he said ""Whatever is on the menu"" Keep in mind we attempted to order 4 drinks at this point that were on the menu. D. I got some kind of sangria that tasted NOTHING like a sangria. It tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher will ice. Watered down jolly rancher. E. There are 0 vegan dishes at this restaurant. Don't know how an establishment at 2017 can allow themselves to do that, but whatever.F. The appetizer sampler we got was super plain and has been the same one they have been serving since they opened. It gets boring, it's time to change it up. G. This location is NOT clean in any way. The carpet was gross... and it's super dark inside for no apparent reason. H. Leaving this place, they made us get out through some mall that was attached to it and wouldn't let us just walk out to the street... So we had to go into a mall and down the escalators to get out... No idea why.  There are many reasons this place has been doing so badly. 8 of them stated above.",1,4,
50,Don V.,"Milford, DE",40,312,865,4.0,12/12/2016,"Stopped in for late night dessert. We knew what they have to offer so there were no surprises! We were seated on the 1st level (this is a 3 story). Food was good. When we tried to pay on the tablet on the table it said our total was like 4X higher and there were things in our check we didn't order. I hit the button for ""call server""...he never came. Finally I was able to get someone's attention and I guess they told him. He came back 10 min later with.

51,Sylvia O.,"Manhattan, NY",1,58,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"Applebee's was a last resort (every other ""better"" restaurant in the area had a hour+ wait time and we had a show to catch in an hour) and as a last resort, it was a horribly overpriced and unworthy one. The food was mediocre and extremely expensive. You can taste the rust in the tap water they serve. The food is so salty it's hard to down more than just a few bites. The pastas that we ordered were overcooked, dry and hard. The only thing I can't complain about is the portion size. At least my friend and I couldn't finish our plates, but considering that every single thing is $20+ and dinner for two came out to over $60 (which could've translated to a really nice meal in a much better establishment) I don't think that's something to give them kudos for.

54,Andy L.,"New York, NY",333,133,785,3.0,7/16/2015,"I find it interesting how so many Applebee's locations are rated so low.  Luckily for me and the person I came with two Fridays ago, we were not disappointed because we had no expectations.  In fact, we were overall impressed.  We initially wanted to go to Dallas BBQ but the lines were long, so we came here spontaneously.  I thought the service was alright - they let me charge my phone at one of the desks, and the people were pretty friendly.  We got a seat by the window, and at night time, the lights in 42nd street are very interesting to look at.  I suppose we came on a good day at the right time.Seeing as how I am a generally cheap person, I was happy when I saw on the menu, ""Build your sampler: Mix & match any shareables, pub plates, or bar snacks.  Choose any 2 for $15.99"" ... I still consider this pricey, though, so minus one star for that.  So we chose 4 different pub plates to share between us.  They were filling and good, and came out to $20 per person after tax and tip.  Not bad at all.  I will probably not come back in the future but I was definitely satisfied with my experience here.",2,4,3

What I like most about this location is the wall art. I'm very visual and I like to see cool things when I eat. It just feels soooo NY in here, especially the way it's decorated. The apple chimichurri cheesecake is divine! Service of course is nothing to talk much about. I mean...it's your average chain restaurant. Had the sizzling chicken and shrimp and it hit the spot. Last time I came to this location and ordered take out...they gave my food away to a person who somehow came and acted like they were me.

67,Brett C.,"Huntington, IN",11,14,14,4.0,9/30/2017,"My friend and I stumbled across this particular place to eat by happenstance, but aside from the price it was a worth while visit. I feel as if we had read the reviews of this restaurant before going in we probably wouldn't have stopped but I can not agree with the assessment of this location based upon what I have read. Here are some highlights of our visit: * Price. Might as well get this beast out of the way first. So, if this is your first visit to New York (much like it was ours) do not make the mistake of thinking that since this is an American restaurant chain that you can expect similar prices to what you're used to. That is not the case here, this is New York and as with most things, the price is considerably higher. We come from Indiana, and for the meal we had we would have paid roughly $40 to $50, but we ended up paying $75. And as some of the reviews have hinted at, there is an 18% tip pre-calculated into your total. I would highly recommend checking your bill before paying if you feel that the service you received was not worthy of an 18% tip. * Great food. The food we had was fantastic. My friend had some ribs, and I some salmon. The salmon was considerably better than I had expected it to be. I also had grilled shrimp which was also spectacular. * Amazing atmosphere! Aside from the food being great, the atmosphere was fantastic. I've been to a few different Applebee's in the past, but this one was my favorite. Especially during the time of day we went. We went around 3:30pm and it was nice having a table near the window, allowing for a nice view of the street.I would recommend this place if you are on the street walking around and you need a place to eat and want something familiar. Though, I can not speak on the other locations in the area, but there are a few other choices that have large familiar franchises (i.e. Ruby Tuesdays, Dave & Busters).",,,

Updated review","i stopped by for breakfast once again on my way to work, I got three eggs up, bacon, coffee and toast. I wanted rye toast but they only offer white or multigrain so I got the multigrain. Coffee comes with half and half so if you want milk you have to ask for it. The food was very good. The bills arrives with an 18% tip tacked on [this is a heavy tourist area with a hotel right next door] so check your bill so you do not tip twice.

We loved the fact that they brought everything super fast because we had limited time as we were waiting to se a movie on the cinema.  The only reason why i did not chose 5 stars is because the waitres did not took care of out drinks very much.

We got 3 appetizers (there was a deal to make your own sampler), 3 soups, 1 burger, and a sangria and the bill came to about $100. I'm sorry but that's ridiculous. The portions are smaller and the overall quality of the food is lower compared to other locations. The white peach sangria is big but very sweet and contained very little alcohol. I tasted more pineapple juice than anything else. The restaurant is HUGE but fairly empty when we were there and the service was horrible.Considering this location is in the heart of Time Square, I expected a lot more. I will not be back.",3,,

That might have a been a bad sign in hindsight, but I mean, it's Times Square, so no biggie, right?Well, the server that we had... you know, you wanna try to give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she was having a bad day. But her attitude was trash and her service was slower than what I would call normal. You figure the food would be tasty for its price? Nope. Bland. Even for Applebee's.And I would like to point out that, unless the quality of all Applebee's around the world have diminished since the last time I've been to one, it's this particular Applebee's that I feel like needs to be avoided at all costs.

It wasn't terribly busy and we did get seated right away even though it was dinner time. Didn't think there was much that could go wrong, but it was not a good experience. The prices were not only much higher than a normal Applebee's (Times Square, ok I get it), but on the high side compared to several GREAT local restaurants we had eaten at in the days preceding. I ordered the cedar plank salmon with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. When it came, the mashed potatoes were cold, not room-temp, actually like out-of-the-refrigerator cold. The bed of spinach that was supposed to be with the salmon was not there and I had to ask for it which when the server did finally bring it out came as two small leaves of spinach hardly even visible in the bowl.Being very thirsty I had downed my water before our meal arrived and had never got a refill even thought the place was not super busy.

Once we finished our disappointing meal, we said we were done and was ready for dessert. The waitress proceeded with ""oh, did you still want the [birthday dessert]?""

TIP- they don't have drink prices on the menu for a reason!!! They are very high...the food in addition to drinks and deserts it gets super expensive for a place that doesn't look fancy. The final straw that made us mad is not only the secret drink overpricing, as that was just an irritant; it was the mandatory 18% surprise gratuity. So yeah: WARNING 18% MANDATORY TIP!!! It is charged AFTER you swipe your card. There was NO way to cancel and pay cash because the waitress said the card and the mandatory tip would be charged to your card regardless. Surprise! :( Oh and yeah they made us go through the 2nd floor mall entrance instead of down the stairs which was the way we came in and the direct way out. Why? Because apparently people can't be trusted to walk down stairs??? And yes it was on a posted sign and everything prohibiting going back down those stairs (which were wide and empty. Or my theory is that Perhaps it's so pissed off customers don't have a chance to warn incoming customers? When leaving I was slightly mad and was about to walk down those stairs but the waitress spoke up loudly after us and told us to go out the back for ""our safety"". (Yes there were non slip strips on the stairs and it was NOT raining) How was service? Below average- in all fairness it's not the employees fault that the company is baiting its customers to revolt. How was the food? AverageWill I ever visit Applebee's again on a trip to the states? Never ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I would recommend lots of great nearby restaurants instead.

All the tables were also set up for couples which made things even more weird. Fast-forward to present time, I think most of these chain restaurants are not what they used to be anymore in terms of quality of food and services.

121,Luisa H.,"Manhattan, NY",4,9,0,2.0,12/18/2017,"On Sunday, December 10th, my sister and I took my young daughter and niece for an afternoon of theater in Times Square. Once we were done with our show we were quite hungry. As we walked towards the subway station we saw a restaurant that was familiar to us and have enjoyed on several occasions for its hospitality and great prices. This restaurant was applebees. We entered applebees and were greeted by the friendly hostess and seated within a few minutes. Once seated we were disappointed to find out that this applebees did not have a 2 for $20 menu that we have enjoyed as a family on many occasions. Not only was there no 2 for $20 menu, but the prices were almost double what we have paid for applebees in the past. Since we were already seated, we decided to order our usual- artichoke dip and chips, the chicken oriental salad, the kids cheeseburger meal with French fries, and the kids chicken finger meal with French fries. When the food came we noticed that it was half the food we would ordinarily get at applebees. The salad barely had any dressing on it, the full size non-2/$20 artichoke dip and chips was actually smaller than the 2/$20 portion, and the french fries were VERY salty. Needless to say we were very disappointed. It did not help that our waiter was very slow and did not check in with us from time to time. I am not sure why this is the case because the restaurant was not crowded and we saw him just standing by the front counter doing nothing aside from staring into space. Because of this It took longer than usual to order our food, get a soda refill, pay the bill, etc. I expected better from applebees and was sad to see that the quality of the franchise located in a major location was less than what I was used to. The only positive thing that I can say is that the restaurant was clean and the location is convenient for theater goers.",1,,

Overheard a family talking about how tight the seating was and I agree.My waitress was very kind & attentive until 2 additional tables were seated. She stopped by once all the other 3 times I had to ask for A1 sauce, the check & napkins. The overall food quality was ok besides the prices being outrageous. Ordered the steak, shrimp with veggies/mash potatoes which was cooked well thank goodness I ordered medium. My boyfriend ordered a blackened fish dish which he said was cooked & seasoned well.Overall good experience but what left a bad taste in my mouth was my waitress was very aggressive on reminding us that too wasn't included.

This 5 star review is because of SERVICE ONLY (since their food let's face it..is mediocre at best...) See my Dave and Busters review for part 1 of why we (party of 19 people) ended up at Applebee's in the first place.No other place would have been so accommodating of such a large party of 19 people (all adults, no kids) on a Saturday night at 8:30 pm in the center of NYC. The server's name was Tyler, and he was amazing. He handled 19 people  like a champ. He got refills, drinks, food out very promptly. They asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes while they prepped our table. The 17% gratuity was already added in, but I am sure that he made well over $100 bucks from our table, since myself tipped $10 extra, as well as a few other people.

Everyone's close in seating upstairs which can't be helped because let's be honest it's not a five star restaurant or anything and louddd kids screaming crying, people talking louder than the next to hear one another which causes a chain reaction for more people to talk even louder.

Updated review","The French onion soup is exceptionally delicious! So are the honey BBQ boneless wings, and the sweet potato fries!! The service is kinda crappy though. It wasn't very busy but still our waitress came around only 3 times, to take the order, to bring out the order, and to give us the check. I couldn't even find her for about 15 minutes I had to ask her co worker to flag her down for me. I would go back, but prices are significantly higher than the applebees in queens! Roughly $20 for a burger. It was $40 for 2 soups, one order of wings, and a side of fries. No drinks, just water. The soups were about $4.99 each. Oh well, city prices.",,,

They had a horrible experience at this place. The waiter was rude throughout to begin with, totally ignored them by obviously pretending not to see them when they tried to get his attention, had them wait on everything for long times (the restaurant was half full), and adding salt to injury, the waiter had the audacity to demand a 20% tip by circling the tip amount recommended on the check, putting a star next to it, then POINTING TO IT while standing in front of them!!! They were terrified and extremely upset!Looking at other people's comment, this obviously is not an isolated occurrence. I can not believe an American corporation would tolerate such behaviors, even in New York. Not only will I leave the comment here, I will also contact Applebee's headquarters regarding this incident.If I can give a 0 star, I would.

I just want to confirm that this place should ONLY be your restaurant of last resort and only if there is a: natural disaster and/or all other restaurants in the vicinity are closed. I know it is Times Square, but this place represents price gouging like no place I have ever seen. My first mistake was taking a chance on this place. I thought, ""Applebee's is pretty standard everywhere you go. How could this place be any different?"" First, the food is not as good as other places and is hastily put together and served. Second, the prices are crazy; at least twice as much as at any other Applebee's. I paid $28 for a grilled chicken Caesar salad and a Diet Pepsi ... $28! Including a 17% tip already on the bill ... for one person!Oh, and while I have this little platform, let me also say that while I believe and support America as a land of immigrants, I don't think it would be a bad guy to actually hire someone who speaks English fluently. Everyone working there was a Non-Native English Speaker (NNES) and it showed. I am the child of immigrants and am the first person in my family to be born in America.

She took care of us as if we were her kids and made sure we were happy. She said that she's been working at the restaurant for 15 years and they only give her 3 tables.

There is no incentive to do well because they just give themselves a tip. Also, there is a very dangerous ramp to the women's room. It is carpeted and completely unmarked.

No matter what chain restaurant you go to in NYC , do not expect the same prices as you would in NJ for example. They have to raise their menu prices because the rent is very expensive in order to operate in a times square building. So it's fair game , just be prepared for your bill to be higher with the included gratuity. Then again if you don't want to go to Applebee's , go to another restaurant or fast food place or even a food truck to save money.

At first he was very friendly, and I though to myself that this would be a great experience.We ordered many appetizers, and some entrees as well, and to cut the story short, our bill came to $120 and some change. I asked to have the bill split, and the guy rolls his eyes at us as if it is a hard task to do. When he returns, I give him my card and tip him $20, which is generous for him since he really didn't do anything at all for us the entire dining experience. I even clearly told him that the tip was going to be for both bills, and made that clear to him.When it is my brother's turn to pay, the server would not take the card unless he gave him a tip. I even told the server that the $20 bill I gave him was for the both of us. He would not budge. He kept stating that we needed to write a tip for him.I understand that the majority of people in this industry work off of tips, but the fact that he was imposing it upon us when it was clear that he did not deserve it was beyond unacceptable. I do not see any reason why he should still be employed in the company as this is not the first time they are forcing tips on customers.Bad management will not even reply to anyones Yelps.

There were about 8 pieces of ribs, which comprised of about 90% bones. They were also stingy about the fries. I got less fries than a McDonald's medium fries.The food were not bad, but not great. And thr tab water tasted a little funky, so I had to order drinks. Overall, its the PETIIE MINI BABY portion that gets me, I don't know if it's because it's New York, or just this area. my total came out to be about 60$ after tips and tax, which IS NOT a bargain for the portion and services I've received.

As a waiter myself, I could understand that she might have been a bit busy and couldn't offer her 100% attention to me, but to not even ask how everything is or give a refill? It takes 2 seconds! And on top of this awful service, the tip was included!? Luckily the food tasted pretty good. I still won't be finding myself ever going back to this place.",1,,

It's in Times Square.  If you're reading these reviews and thinking of going here, do yourself a favor and STOP IT.  RIGHT NOW.  Walk down to 8th avenue, make a right and head north and try one of the many awesome local places.  Do it. NOW.",1,2,
186,Daniel C.,"Queens, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/15/2016,The weightier refused to let us leave with out giving a ten dollar extra tip. Luckily a manager was able to give our ten dollars back. The machine payment system is strongly annoying and once you start it is to complicated to end it. The service was horrible I said refill and get handed no soda only a check to pay.,,,
187,Zee H.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,93,79,1.0,12/24/2014,"Not impressed at all! Overpriced and small portions. Our server disappeared for such a long time I thought his shift was over until he turned up an hour later looking for his tip money. Food was very mediocre, everything was over salted and overpriced.We definitely won't be back",,1,

189,Craig A.,"Wind Gap, PA",5,3,6,5.0,12/28/2015,"We stopped in after seeing Phantom and we were glad we got seated right away. Our food only took about 10 minutes to get to us. Yes the prices were high, but it's NYC.  Applebee's never disappoints!!!",,1,
190,Patrick R.,"Sartell, MN",0,9,0,4.0,12/27/2015,"Yes, it is an Applebee's.  And yes, this is NYC. With all the restaurants available why would you choose this one?  Well, for one, we are tired of the attitudes at other restaurants. In fact we got up and left a highly rated one due to lack of service and walked over to Applebee's.The service here was the best we have received on the Times Square since arriving a coupe days ago. The food was good and prices as reasonable as one can expect. Beware, there is an 18% automatic gratuity, which I typically don't agree with, but I actually left an additional tip for the service. When you are tired of crappy wait staff, ridiculous prices and complex menus from other arrogant restaurants, try this bit of familiarity. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",,1,
191,M K.,"Richmond, Canada",0,85,42,4.0,11/26/2014,Great place to grab a quick bite. They have very friendly staff. Customer service in US is generally not as great as in Canada but it was still good service in comparison to other restaurants we went to in the area. I would go again if in the neighbourhood.,1,,
192,Jennifer S.,"Brooklyn, NY",497,810,99,1.0,3/26/2012,"Why Why Why do people come from all over the world to visit NYC and choose out of all the places in the city ... they actually look around and SELECT Applebee's?I came here ONLY because I had a gift certificate. My cute grandparents  gave me it for Christmas because they know my boyfriend and I are into food and restaurants. Little do they know, Applebee's isn't really a ""foodie"" place, but I am into free food more than I like being a snob. The Times Sq prices are higher than usual. Why anyone would pay 25 bucks for an Applebee's steak when you are in NYC is beyond me. But people obviously do. I got this cajun steak and shrimp thing. I ate it all, but that is because I am fat pig. The texture was not like steak. It had the taste and consistency of a microwaved salsbury steak from a hospital cafeteria. The shrimp was doused in some gooey gel-like ""gumbo"" sauce. Again, the whole thing screamed ""high school lunch lady made this"". The waiter was fine, a little intimidating. He wasn't out of the way un-friendly, but I dont think he smiled once. He wasn't into being at Applebee's. Neither was I. I guess we can all agree on that.",3,3,2
193,Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,558,36,2.0,3/30/2014,"Ok. The service was fast. The Patron margarita drink was strong, but I have a high tolerance for alcohol. I order a burger called Cowboy burger. I ordered it medium done. It came smothered in bbq sauce,red onions (a bit too many),lettuce,tomatoes, crispy bacon,long strands of hair. Yes, it came with two long strands of hair,gross indeed.

194,Marsi N.,"Vancouver, Canada",3,19,23,2.0,11/2/2014,"I found this really hard to rate b/c there were some pretty serious negatives and one outstanding positive.  I'd probably give it a 2.5 star rating.Negatives:- Really bad service.- Mandatory 18% gratuity.  I guess when the gratuity is already included the staff don't need to try and impress you.- Disgusting side dish w/ the salmon.  The spring vegetable medley and gross potatoes were not enjoyable.- Really pricey for a chain restaurant.- So very, very loud.Positive:- One of the best salmon dishes I've had in a long time.  The salmon was perfect and the artichoke topping was delicious.I've never eaten in an Applebee's before and originally we wanted to avoid chain restaurants on this trip but after a couple of uninspiring and expensive ""unique"" NYC restaurants we decided to give it a try.  Plus it was next to our hotel lobby so it was convenient.",1,,
195,Emmanuel C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,23,8,1.0,11/19/2015,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! BY FAR THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! This place doesn't even deserve a star. I suggest to NOT bring a loved one here. After tonight I don't think of ever dining here EVER again. Been here before but I guess it's under new management. From the minute you walk in most of the employees are in a pissy mood. The only one that greeted us was this nice young hostess on the first floor. But once you reach the 2nd floor forget about it the hostess is grumpy. A couple asked if they could be seated near the window view but the look on her face made it seem like she was going to lose it. Now the server I had tonight needs some sense put into him. I'm a server myself and I know what good catering is! My parents are restaurant owners and trust me I KNOW business. You greet someone bring water to their table wait for them to look through the menu. My sister and I got to our table went through our menu but our server at first seemed a bit in a hurry. I asked if he could bring our drinks first while we looked at the menu plus my sister had gone to the restroom. As soon as she came back he rushed and asked if we was ready. We ordered our food we ate. The food was okay not bad but not the best. We ordered burgers!! We didn't order caviar or anything luxurious. . BUT when it came to the bill I was ready to pay without any hesitation!! He brought our check and spoke to me nicely when he mentioned the suggested tip. I laid my card right away so he can pick it up and charge me. All of a sudden the server decides to scream that my card is declined when I mean scream I mean YELL !! Next time someone should hand him a microphone while he is at it!! The embarrassment I went through tonight is unbelievable. (If I'm going out to eat trust me I will be assure to have the sufficient funds). This guy was screaming sorry your card is decline mam! There is no money!! (Who is he to tell me what my card has?) I guess he thought I was a criminal if he was screaming. I insisted he typed the number manually into the credit card machine cause it is a option. (I must say my card did get wet since it was a rainy day and I was running around in the city). He said no that he isnt allowed! Fine whatever I called my bank they told me it was fine that my card had sufficient funds the man came back after him having to get permission to enter my card numbers manually from his manager. He then starts to say it went through and starts nagging about him typing it manually. My question to him was ""did it go through?"" He started saying the same thing over and thankfully he said YES. I guess he felt relief that it went through. I seriously think he needs to get retrained and take actions like this seriously and not dramatically. Instead of shouting across the dining area that my card is decline! Next time his lazy butt should try a different machine or punch in the numbers manually. Unfortunately I left the suggested tip but it will be my last time there!! Lastly my last comment is for the manager or whoever the lady was suppose to be. She was looking at the menu while my sister and I were exiting she decides to scream exit is around the corner well excuse us we didn't see no signs or arrows pointing out the exit. She needs to relax we were exiting not robbing the apple bees. So yeah they need to lighten up a bit stop being so crabby and stop screaming its a fast food chain restaurant not a zoo!!! I didn't even bother calling the manager because I felt like no actions would be taken properly! So my tip is avoid this apples bees at all costs go elsewhere!!!! Their prices are extremely high for poor customer service !!!!",,2,
196,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1268,914,3.0,2/12/2012,"Set firmly in Tourist Territory around Times Square this Applebee's is one of the few I've ever seen that serves breakfast.  I was attending an event in the area so I met my friend here for a quick bite before we went.I ordered two eggs, a fruit plate and whole wheat toast.  My friend ordered a bagel with a couple slices of cheese.  This wasn't normally on the menu but our waitress was more than accommodating.  Our orders came quickly and my eggs were perfectly cooked (over easy) and the toast was nice.  The fruit plate was a bit blah.  The fruit could have been sweeter but that's about the biggest complaint I had.  The wait staff kept both water and coffee flowing and they were kind enough to let my friend and I hang for a good hour before beginning to shove the check at us.  Kudos for the courtesy!Our total bill was $19.50 so not bad at all compared to what some of the other places nearby want.  Granted you might be able to get a cheaper meal at McDonalds down the block, but trust me, it's not the same.The space is divided into two floors.  We ate on the first floor where there's seating nicely lit by the sunlight outside.  A staircase leads the central dining area upstairs which has a ton more seats and leads into the adjacent movie theater (the Empire).  I had a good experience here and the service was fantastic.  It's nice to know you can get a nice, quick breakfast in the heart of Times Square without breaking the bank.",5,1,4

Instead she gave us the NEW YORK attitude and didn't even bother to pretend to be nice to the costumers. Is it because we are foreigners? Or because we're Asian? I don't understand her arrogance.
