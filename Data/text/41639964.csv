0,Katarina L.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",270,65,119,5.0,10/5/2018,"This place is smack dab in the middle of a row of grab and go lunch take out spots. I've worked just across the street for about 3 years before stopping in because I just assumed it was another place where I could buy an over priced salad and bring it back to my desk to eat. Fast forward to now, I've been here 3 times in the past 2 months and plan on making it regular for a late lunch. Every time I've gone, it's been around 3 or 4 so it's pretty dead with most of the waitstaff just setting up for dinner. But the food...... wow. Crazy, amazing, and unique flavors in nearly everything I've tried. The Roasted Carrots aren't just roasted with salt and pepper but have this wierd coffee INCREDIBLE kind of crunch on top and sit on a bed of pesto. The Crispy Rice is wonderful and comes with a fried egg on top. Call me a basic b but I almost stabbed my friend with my fork when she tried to break the yolk before I got my picture...But I do have feelings so please don't call me any names. Anyway... back to food. Lucky for me I come here with a friend that is just as big on sharing as me. We get a couple plates and have a family style kinda meal. If this kind of style appeals to you too, I would shoot for one big plate and then maybe 3 small appetizers to fill the table, depending on how hungry you are. They also have a fully stocked bar so go ahead, be a little crazy, get that glass of rosé.",1,1,1
1,Michael F.,"Norwalk, CT",21,117,141,3.0,10/31/2018,"The good: Clean eating (for a restaurant), bright, decor, clean bathroom, pretty good service, and not too many options to overwhelm you.The bad: For the price you pay, several dishes seem like a ripoff. My pork carnitas tacos (3) were $21. In most restaurants, these would go for $4 or maybe $5 each. I got three tacos with no sides (unless you count the personal hot sauce). Throw in some rice or a slaw or something!The side of sweet potatoes is uninspiring. It's basically a grilled sweet potato with no butter.  The consensus of the rest of the group was that the food was okay. We all left a little letdown after reasonably higher expectations.It wasn't all bad. I liked the cauliflower hummus. Some other people didn't like it though. The crispy rice appetizer was tasty. It lacked a little flavor, but the texture and peppery veggies in it made up for it, leaving you almost guilt-free, considering it's fried. The happy hour had a couple okay drink specials. There were beers for $4 and $5. Wine (red & white) was $8/glass. Then there were three signature cocktails about $10/each. The Sextana Cabernet was a nice red wine, but sets you back about $64/bottle ($20 retail).My final verdict is: Maybe it's better as a brunch spot? Dinner again? I'll pass.",,,
2,Jennifer S.,"New York, NY",16,663,0,4.0,10/4/2018,"Yum, yum, yum!!!We enjoyed a veggie rich dinner at The Little Beet Table.  We ordered an assortment of awesomeness for the table, including: roasted carrots, smoked eggplant, burrata salad, cauliflower steak, side of smoked mushrooms, side of charred sweet potato, and the chickpea Caesar salad.  The roasted carrots wildly exceeded my expectations.  They were full of flavor and covered in their delicious pesto.  The smoked eggplant was lovely.  I loved the mixture of flavors and how they put the tahini under the smoked eggplant.  The burrata salad was creamy, buttery heaven.  The cauliflower steak was yummy, where I particularly liked the green curry that it's served with.  The smoked mushrooms were simply splendid.  The charred sweet potato were incredible with the delicious charred-ness mixing perfectly with the mildly caramelized spots on the potato.  The chickpea Caesar was the only dish that the table agreed was only ""meh.""  I like my salads lightly dressed, but you couldn't even see or taste the Caesar dressing.  The service was friendly and kept our water full!  I highly recommend getting a reservation since it looks like they have limited availability if you do not have a reservation.",,,

The cozy wood interior really draws you in and the menu outside had several options we both liked. The restaurant looks deceivingly small from outside but inside there is a large bar and plenty of tables. The hostess gave us our choice of where to sit so we decided to sit near the front windows.  I completely comprehend NYC prices but $20 for a very basic salad with grilled chicken on top is excessive. My friend ordered salmon and while she enjoyed it the portion was very small. We also ordered drinks, a mojito ($15) and a prosecco ($13 and flat). Our waitress was great, the restaurant is beautiful and our food was good but the reason for only 3 stars is that nothing really blew either of us away. You will definitely not have a bad meal here but it will cost you a pretty penny.",100,54,92

I was hoping to catch up with a college friend and decided to grab dinner here. I made reservations for 6:15 on a Saturday night, but I wouldn't say it's necessary to make one. They weren't very busy at that time and had lots of open tables. Towards the end of our dinner at 7:30 ish they were pretty busy so maybe around that time, a reservation would be better to have. The interior is really cute and modern, which I liked. It had a cafe feel to it. Our server was so nice and gave us a lot of recommendations on what to get + her fav dishes.We decided to go with the cauliflower hummus with toast (it's an extra $5 for veggies...) as our appetizer, I had the shrimp salad, and my friend had the salmon.Cauliflower Hummus ($15)I was bummed they charged extra for veggies because I feel like it would've tasted great with the vegetables but whatever. They topped the hummus with some oil, pepitas, sesame seeds, red onions, and dill. I'm not sure what Sorghum is, but that's in there too apparently. The cauliflower is really prominent, and at first we weren't too sure if we liked it, but it gets kind of addicting. I actually really enjoyed the hummus. It wasn't too heavy but also had a creaminess to it.Roasted Shrimp salad ($22)The bowl was huge! But it was also mostly lettuce...I'm not too sure it's worth $22 but it did taste good. There were about 7 or so pieces of shrimp and I have to say they were cooked perfectly. There's a little quinoa and spiced almonds which added great texture. The sweetness comes from the raisins but it's nicely balanced with the dressing, which was so good. There's half an avocado thrown on top too! Will definitely try making this myself!",2,1,2
6,Sam E.,"Queens, NY",140,119,296,5.0,10/11/2018,"This dinner was really something special. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's a really large, clean venue so it's instantly very welcoming. My friend and I started with two delicious cocktails, each a different shade of green. I got a cucumber basil gimlet - so refreshing, and she got the matcha mojito which really packed a punch. We shared some roasted beets with quinoa as an appetizer which came with a delicious sprinkling of spice on top. My only problem with the dish was there wasn't enough! For our mains she got the mushroom and black bean burger with sweet potato and I got the sesame chili chicken salad. The chicken was so fresh and perfectly cooked. The salad dressing was crisp and light. Overall, you can really taste the quality of the ingredients at this restaurant. There is so much integrity in the food and it really shows.",,,
7,Judy S.,"New York, NY",313,1107,1132,2.0,7/19/2018,"Absolutely not a fan. The food claims to be clean and healthy a la organically sourced. And that is well and fine, as long as it is tasty too. And The Little Beet Table was not tasty. We ordered the salmon ($25), eggplant ($15), bass ($29), and burger ($20). For the price, the portions were small and the taste was lacking. My salmon was overcooked. And I was still hungry after eating it. The quality to cost ratio is very off.",1,1,1

Rich in warm colors and exceptionally crafted.My biggest issue with the menu was that almost every single dish (small or entree-sized) looked appealing. I eventually decided on the Roasted Shrimp Salad, which far exceeded my expectations and really surprised me.All of the components were expertly prepared and had real thought and consideration behind them. The shrimp were substantial and beautifully roasted. I loved the addition of the quinoa and bright golden raisins. It was an extremely satisfying and light meal. Service was really thoughtful and attentive, as well. I found our entire meal and experience to be incredibly warm, friendly, and I left feeling satisfied but not overwhelmed by heavy, greasy food.",1,,1

The food is spot on, well made, and you'd never know it was gluten-free if you didn't read the fine print somewhere.The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and happy to chat (which makes this a great place to just hang out!).  The food is seriously delicious, well made, never over-done, and just the right portion size.Oh, the lunch crowd seems to be a bit of a ""see and be seen"" thing, but thats ok, it just adds to the charm",,,

The vegetarian burger was also good, but I was not a fan of the buns. My fiancé got the angus strip steak and very much enjoyed that too.

Achieving great gluten free in every meal is hard, had a good amount of bad gluten free and this place needs to teach a class. I've never had better gluten free bread and it was my first time eating a black bean burger- it was bomb-speaking as a proud eater of all things non black bean/vegan/gluten free. Go here.",,,

Updated review","The food and drinks were very tasty, but the service rushed us a bit! I split the olives with friends to start and had the coconut gin cocktail, which was refreshing and nicely sweetened. My main course was the cauliflower steak, which I highly recommend to anyone who likes a little spice. The curry sauce was on point and the serving was large and definitely filling. Overall, the food and drinks are what makes this place. The atmosphere is nice and dimly lit and low key. By the time we left the place was packed and had a line at the door waiting to be seated.",,,
14,Yaffa N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,68,79,5.0,10/25/2018,Love the atmosphere and decor here. So soothing. Wait staff was phenomenal. Everything is so so healthy and fresh. Cauliflower hummus and GF bread was perfect. As was the ginger/carrot soup if I remember correctly. They had tea and honey and if you have that you're amazing. Definitely wanna come back here,,,
15,Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,63,107,5.0,10/22/2018,"Third time back already and this establishment never disappoint. Would prefer sit down over take out/delivery even though I very often do so because of the nice wall art, comfortable atmosphere, and rustic wooden tabletop. Place has a pretty long wait but of the times I arrive around 11am we were seated quickly. First lets talk about drinks: quality of Bloody Mary is excellent. They have a variety of cocktails made from fresh ingredients that you can very easily taste. Now come the entree: the salads are hearty, filling. The burgers are hearty, filling, with a side of sweet potato dusted with a light shaving of salt. Finally their specialty dish: crunchy rice with egg, is so so good. Would come again and again and go through their full menu.",,,
16,Vanessa A.,"New York, NY",81,55,87,5.0,9/20/2018,Picked up the Arugula salad with chicken as a mealpal lunch. It was a very delicious salad. The chicken had the right amount of crispiness to it and the dressing was light. Highly recommend!,,,
17,Susie K.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3,21,16,5.0,6/17/2018,"This might be the best restaurant I've been to in the past two months in NY. Everything feels clean but more importantly, it tastes great. Unlike other restaurants that mostly serve vegetarian food, they don't put loads of salt in the food. Standout dishes include the eggplant, mushroom burger, and shrimp wrap.My dining partner--a friend who has celiac disease--loved that everything is gluten free. Even the dessert was surprisingly good (get the brownie and banana foster).",1,,1
18,Stacy D.,"Tampa, FL",7,53,2,1.0,8/28/2018,"Stopped by on Sunday for brunch with some friends...the place is really cute inside, and the hostess and waitress were super friendly, but that's where the good ends. Our coffee was lukewarm, and horrible tasting. Seriously. lukewarm coffee. I ordered the french toast, which came in sticks, and seemed to be deep-fried. It was hard to cut through with a fork, because it was crunchy all the way through. I ate a couple pieces, and picked the fruit off, and left the rest. Awful. My friends both ordered the black bean and mushroom burger, and it was completely inedible. Super mushy...with an odd taste. I was so so disappointed. There are many many great options for brunch in the city, and I can't believe I chose this one!! Won't recommend. Won't return.",1,,
19,Moraya D.,"Beacon, NY",9,16,18,4.0,9/15/2018,I have celiac. Eating in a 100% gf restaurant was a treat. The food was very good and I was the only one with a gluten allergy so it was risky if I could make everyone else in the party happy. But ya know what. I didn't feel like dealing with cross contamination today. The hummus starter was very yummy. I got the eggs Benedict. I really found the English muffin to be far to small and I ordered a side of toast to sop up the egg yolk. Because that's the best part. The salad was very good and looks like the way to go here. But when you are gluten free getting a salad is the norm. Downside is the waitress was just a bit odd- drink service was beyond slow and we could have easily ordered a few more rounds if it had not taken so long for them to arrive. It's a really good option for a weekend brunch if you don't want a place that's insanely packed.,,,
20,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,5/14/2018,"The good:We sat at the bar  and the female waiter/bartender was amazing (wish I could say the same for the hostess).The food: We shared the salmon appetizer and it was quite delish but literally the size of bird food.I had the cauliflower steak and it was super delish.The boyfriend had the pork tacos and he liked!The place is super cute, with awesome wall art and clean.The bad:Unless you have reservations, getting a table between 5-7pm, will be nearly impossible, so you will have to hope you can get a seat at the bar.We did not have reservations, however there were two available seats at the bar, but they were at appositive end. We asked the female hostess if they could tell some of the people at the bar to move down one seat so my boyfriend and I could sit together. They said they could not do that. I am not sure why? So my boyfriend and I stood by one chair waiting till someone next to us decided to leave.  Out of nowhere, the hostess got some common sense and asked everyone to our right to move down one seat so my boyfriend and I were able to sit next to each other. I am not sure why this was so difficult as it did not inconvenience anyone.Verdict:  Their dishes are packed with flavor, however a little overpriced. I would not object to returning but only if I have reservations.",4,3,3

And I was dining with a friend who wasn't doing anything special and was equally impressed by the quality of the food. Impressive variety of meat and seafood options. Mmmm. The shishito peppers were a yummy starter. And the crispy branzino was phenomenal. I loved the fennel accompaniments both done a purée and a slaw.

I was having some difficulty cutting into the english muffin of my benedict. My friends ordered the maple french toast and their toast was a little on the harder side as well.

They take reservations, so I recommend making one, especially for larger parties!The crispy branzino is delicious and seasoned well.

27,Alexandra G.,"Dallas, TX",104,105,68,4.0,10/26/2017,"Def a great place to go for brunch. I got a quinoa dish that was really good and enjoyed a cup of coffee with almond milk. We ordered the Banana Bread for the table with the hazelnut butter and that was also really delicious. My husband got a drink with cucumbers, which I tried and was also impressed by. The service was efficient and friendly and let us sit there and talk for a little while after we finished and didn't act like rushing us. Only thing I would suggest is maybe adding one sweeter breakfast type vegan dish .. because I would have loved to get French toast or something else similar or even granola with some almond milk cream and berries .. i felt the menu was limited to savory food if you're trying to eat vegan.. and one sweet option may be nice :)",,,

29,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4421,4418,35768,4.0,7/25/2017,"Having been washed over by the energetic, Cossack-kicking cavalcade that was ""Natasha, Pierre and The Great Comet of 1812"", Jamie W. and I were surprisingly not in the mood for some blinis with Beluga caviar or a bowl of red borscht at the Russian Tea Room - though I would love to try it some time just to see what Woody, Jascha, and the old doyennes of NYC society were raving about back in the day. In the meantime, we were determined to go gluten-free for dinner hiking all the way from Times Square to earn our health-conscious meal on Park Avenue in Gramercy Park.By coincidence, we walked into one of the original fast-food chain spots from which this tonier restaurant was borne just a couple of days prior. I have to admit I was taken in by the concept of a grilled cauliflower steak, something I saw Ming Tsai prepare rather awkwardly on his PBS cooking show. It looked like something I wanted to try to see if I have the makings of a vegetarian. Not really as I am as flexitarian as they come. Take note of the appetizers we ordered. The first was the $15 Arctic Char Crudo, which laid our fresh, sashimi-style pieces of raw char fermenting in a cucumber & jalapeno aguachile, pickled onions, and cilantro (photo: bit.ly/2uA59nh).The second was more satisfying, the $16 Slow Poached Shrimp Wraps, which took fresh shrimp; mixed them with citrus, creme fraiche, and crispy shallots; and stuffed the mixture in torn, hand-size pieces of Bibb lettuce (photo: bit.ly/2vYYQJt). They normally charge $13 for three wraps, so they added a fourth for an additional $3 to accommodate our need to have two each. For our entrees, we decided to go vegetarian again. In an uncharacteristic burger mood, Jamie tried the $17 Beet & Chickpea Burger, which we both thought was pretty good, although it subsequently paled against the Impossible Burger we had a week later.It probably didn't have umami flavor for us, but the butter lettuce, hibiscus pickled onions, cucumber, white bean ranch dressing, and roasted sweet potato helped considerably (photo: bit.ly/2uA50QL). Of course, I ordered the $21 Grilled Cauliflower Steak, which didn't look much like a steak but more a pile of overly charred florets. However, it was saved by the complement of green coconut curry sauce, roasted mushrooms, sugar snap peas, and rainbow Swiss chard (photo: bit.ly/2uzN4WF). We were good and held off on desserts, but the reality was that we were pretty sated for such a health-conscious meal. This is truly the Little Beet that could.FOOD - 4 stars...healthy plates with a nice combination of flavorsAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit dark but spacious with a low-key vibeSERVICE - 3.5 stars...accommodating though not as expert on the dishes as I was hopingTOTAL - 4 stars...if gluten-free is your thing, this is the place for you",8,5,9

There are several locations around the city. This was close to our hotel so we came to the Park Avenue venue. We arrived in between the typical meal hours so it was not crowded. It was clean and bright. We ordered a variety of dishes. Dome were appetizers, signature snacks, an entree and a market side dish. They included the cauliflower hummus & toasted bread, crispy spirulina rice, autumn squash soup, toasted shrimp and salad, and grilled cauliflower steak. Since we were all sharing everything was served at once. Everything was delicious although I didn't try the grilled cauliflower steak. The cauliflower hummus was different and excellent. The toasted bread was also a nice touch especially for scraping the last bit of the hummus from the plate. The soup was very tasty and great for the cold weather we were experiencing that day. The rice was also tasty and added some texture to the meal. The shrimp were properly cooked. The salad included a half of an avocado, golden raisins and spiced almonds with white balsamic dressing.

Had a glass of wine for $8. Was just ok. When my friends arrived, we got seated. Our waitress was extremely rude. My friend asked for recommendations of something that's light and filling. Waitress rolls her eyes and says ""that's like literally half our menu"" and leaves without making a single recommendation. She ended up having the cauliflower ""steak"" which she said was ok. I had the burger. They don't ask how well you want it to be cooked and it's comes more on the well done side. Nothing spectacular about the burger. The buns were a bit crumbly. The sauce that it comes with is what saved the burger though. It's like a spicy, chipotle mayo type of sauce. Burger comes with a side of baked sweet potato which I enjoyed because I literally love sweet potato. Then the rude waitress came by to fill our water cups and To my friend who it seemed like she was singling out, she literally wagged her fingers at her to pass her the cup. Like what the heck?Ended up trying the desserts. It's so unmemorable I forgot what we ordered. I think there was something strawberry with vanilla ice cream and a brownie sundae. Nothing great about them. Overall I don't think I'll be coming back here. Food seems extremely overrated and especially when there are waitresses who treat customers with disrespect. No thanks.",1,,

I thought it was a little crazy that the restaurant charges you $25 per person if you cancel the day of the reservation. There was 6 of us so it a steep price to pay if something happen and we couldn't have made our reservation. Anywho, the restaurant wasn't too crowded when we arrived. The decor is very nice. It's very clean and simple. Feel like a farm to table restaurant. Everything on the menu is gluten free. I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict ($17), it was pretty good but like others have mentioned the bread is tough and difficult to cut. Also my eggs were way overcooked.We also ordered a banana bread to share which came with a hazelnut spread (basically smashed hazelnuts) this was good and not too sweet.And last but not least we ordered the apple cobbler off the ""birthday menu."" It came with a candle and we all sang. This place is pretty good, but not so much for its price. I found everything to be alright only. If you are looking for a restaurant that has gluten free options this would be a good choice.",3,1,1
40,PL G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,2.0,5/21/2018,"This place gets praise for being vegan-friendly, but as a vegan, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat at The Little Beet Table. All the dishes can be *made* vegan, but all but one or two are actually designed to be dairy-free plates. Essentially, to make the dish vegan, you remove key ingredients and alter its flavor profile ... and most of the dishes at The Little Beet Table fall apart when you do that.Since this is similar to my experience as a vegan at almost any restaurant, I can't recommend that vegans seek out The Little Beet or that NYC-based omnivores consider this a good option for vegan guests in from out of town. There are better places to enjoy a vegan meal, ostensibly the places that actually prepare them.",3,2,

For our mains I had the beet and chickpea burger and mike had the regular beef burger with cheddar and bacon. Both were served with roasted sweet potatoes that were drizzled with olive oil, red pepper and coarse salt. Having sweet potatoes this way has since influenced how i make sweet potatoes at home! We both really enjoyed our burgers. Love when a veggie burger has flavor and substance. They came with delish sides of different dipping sauces too. Really enjoyed my white bean ""ranch"". We also ordered a side of the roasted Brussels sprouts. These were garlicky and salty, yes please. They ended up coming out during the middle of our mains tho, so just took them home to eat later.

The plating and visual of the food was really cute, and the interior of the shop is very rustic and has a good atmosphere for any potential date nights. The burger was very average, had a nice sauce on it but didn't really stand out. The bun was toasted which gave it a little nice texture and the sweet potatoes it came with tasted good. Kind of a nice little healthier alternative side to your traditional fries. The Chipotle Pork Tacos was slightly more interesting, the ""kimchi"" and apples topping gave it a different twist. Not too special, a bit mushy besides the apples and didn't have as many textures, I wish they would've put a bit of lettuce might have made it better.",1,1,1

Breaking down the review as follows: Reservations: They allow reservations through OpenTable and our table was ready when we got there. No waiting, like most NYC restaurants for brunch even when you have reservations. Ambiance: Little Beet has a bright and airy decor. I especially love the ""beet"" colored wall in the back. Such a nice accent to the whole restaurant. Service: Our server was ok. She was a little blasé, maybe she had a long night but she could use some cheering up. She did get our orders eventually. Our food also took longer than expected, like they forgot someone's food or got it wrong (my girlfriends requested scrambled eggs instead of the sunny side up that came with the dish). But the food was pretty tasty so that part was forgiven. Food: Since we started talking about the food... our dishes were pretty good. We had the watercress guacamole which is amazing! I got the Huevos Rancheros which was very tasty. All the flavors went well together. Drinks: I had the blood orange mimosa. It was pretty good. Overall, I think the Little Beet Table delivered for brunch. It probably won't be at the top of my must-go-back-to list but I do like their veggie-forward menu concept.",,,

I'll give them another shot, but this experience didn't wow me like their assembly line spots do. Sad!",,,

One of our party ordered the regular burger which was great.  The side of brussel sprouts was tasty but almost too much food after the hummus and burgers.  Perfect place for a vegan dinner with a cauliflower steak in addition to the mushroom burger on the menu.    Thank you!",,,

We did the shrimp lettuce wraps as an app (the shrimp was so fresh and perfectly lightly seasoned) We also shared the branzino dish which came with this creamy (!'But still quite light) fennel salad. We also got sides of broccoli and sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were possibly the best I have ever had at a restaurant. They served three half potatoes perfectly roasted and seasoned with really large salt flakes. The plates had hearty portions. Also, the wine was delicious! I had a Malbec and my friend had a rose.

The vegan squash soup was fantastic.  I can't remember the last time I even had a squash soup that I didn't make... For my main course I went with the crispy branzino accompanied with sea salt roasted sweet potatoes and rosemary roasted brussel sprouts in olive oil.  Doesn't that sound yummy?  As a COMPLETE GLUTEN FREE RESTAURANT, you know they had an excellent sorbet right? Oh yes they did.  Concord grape that was creamy but not tart.     I went with my favorite gluten free drink, reposado tequila  on the rocks with agave nectar.    This place specializes in servicing fresh vegetables.

Dairy? No grains, right?"" but she was patient and had the answers. They even have tasty mocktails! I had a rosewater lemon beverage sans simple syrup. I got the chicken here, with Peruvian potatoes. It probably sounds boring but it was really well done -- crispy skin and juicy meat. The potatoes were really unique, with a great flavor and firmer texture. My vegan friend really enjoyed her cauliflower steak, and my boyfriend liked his beef steak. Definitely get the eggplant appetizer. It's smoky and the tahini adds a creamy, nutty richness.

The spicy grapefruit margarita was well made and delicious. It had the right amount of zest!! And I am saying this after just returning from having margaritas in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.  Hubby got the cucumber mule, he thought his drink was better!Now the food.  Our server suggested few notable dishes on the menu. He also warned us not to go by the pictures on yelp as their menu is seasonal. Well, he should know that we chose this place based on yelp photos!  Anyways, his recommendations were spot on, we enjoyed the cauliflower hummus and shared one portion of the pumpkin soup as appetizer, crispy branzino (my entree) and burger (hubby's entree).  The crispy branzino was out of this world! The skin was crispy and the fish was cooked to perfection.  The burger was also great but on the heavier side (as expected).

Updated review","After attempting to come here at lunch near our hotel and seeing the crowds lined up we thought to give it a try for dinner.I made reservations coz that's what I do, tho place was emptying out and it was quiet.Country style decor simple and warm I found the menu well rounded and conveyed a fresh farm feeling.Great veg options I went for the green curry cauliflower which was well played and colorful as well as tasty. My partner had the chickpea burger with sweet potatoes and that's when it got muddled.We had asked for Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes to start so why the heck wouldn't the waiter let us know and talk us into another side instead given we were going to be served sweet potatoes with dinner.Really? Silly waiter wasn't very attentive... ya think?.",,,

The menu is entirely gluten-free, which is pretty unique. Our table shared the cauliflower hummus and sweet pea guacamole, both of which I thought were just okay. I would have preferred regular guac. Avocados, am I right? I went with the carnitas tacos for my main course, which were pretty solid. A couple of my dining companions shared the red snapper, which they weren't loving at all. Fortunately for them, they also shared the burger, which looked great. For lunch, this place is pretty pricey. Though I enjoyed my healthy meal, I'm glad I wasn't picking up the tab!",13,1,5

My Chipotle Pork Carnitas Tacos blew me away. The are served with kimchi apple, butternut squash, black beans, avocado crema and are packed full of flavors that really compliment each other.  I would certainly find myself back at Little Beet.  It's the kind of place that you can feel like your bending your diet, but actually still eat healthy, delicious food.",5,2,4

I am not gluten free, but this wee little beet seemed like a good fit as my old landlord was coming from NJ and we were looking for a spot close to the PATH stop on 23rd. The ambiance at the Little Beet is quite lovely, feels like you're entering a rustic tavern that's very minimalist in design, I really liked it. We started with a chick pea ceasar salad, followed by the carnitas tacos for me and the burger for my compatriot. The food was absolutely delicious and the presentation was clean and scrumptious. Overall we probably were there for about 2 hours. Why I am not knocking this up to 4 stars was due to our server. She was pleasant, but basically made us feel we need to rush through ordering, and eating, and was pushing upsell big time. Listen I've waited tables before, I understand the desire to be attentive, but I also felt like we were getting rushed a bit and doesn't create the atmosphere that I was looking for.

It came out with maybe 4 tortilla chips which was strange to us but they gave us more upon request. We thought they should have given us more than the 4 chips straight from the beginning. We then had two salads: the chickpea Caesar salad with Salmon and the roasted shrimp salad. Both were delicious, with the roasted shrimp salad winning me over. The salad was well seasoned, well dressed, and the sweetness of the raisins was a perfect contrast to the dressing. Along with the salads, we had the grilled cauliflower steak. It had a a mint sauce on it which was really good combination with the curry spice rub on top of the cauliflower. On the side, we had roasted Brussel sprouts and a mushroom dish. The brussel sprouts were good, nothing spectacular. The mushrooms were tasty but a little salty and topped with goat cheese. We thought they would have told us that there was cheese on the mushrooms being that they are a vegetarian & gluten free restaurant, but none of us are vegan so it was not a big deal.

We had varying diets to accommodate, my husband and I being vegetarian and my cousin being vegan. We had no issues whatsoever. The cocktails we had at the bar to start were great; they had a thoughtful, seasonal selection. We shared a couple of bottles of wine for dinner - both were well liked. We had a difficult time narrowing down what to eat, so we ended up getting a few appetizers and sides to share along with our entrees. Everything was delicious! The only complaint I can come up with was that my vegetarian burger was a bit on the dry side. But it had plenty of flavor to make up for it. Also, the ambiance is really inviting and comfortable while still feeling like you're out for a fancy meal. And the service was really great too. Highly recommend!",1,,1

79,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,8900,4.0,10/6/2016,"Judging by the name of this fine establishment, I fully expected my poop to look like a crime scene after eating here. Is that too much information for you? Well, don't worry. My bowel movements were perfectly normal because there were no beets in anything I ate. Also, the tables were made of wood. Even the little ones. False advertising, if I've ever seen it.That aside, this is one of the nicest sit-down lunch spots in the area that won't cost you several arms and legs. It's bright and clean and welcoming, and there's something on the menu for everyone. A friend and I split the burger and what our other uncommonly rude dining companion dubbed the ""basic bitch chicken salad"" after we ordered it. The burger is fantastic. Two thinner patties (still cooked carefully to a nice medium), juicy and messy and delicious and accompanied by an excellent broccoli slaw. It is the lunch I always want to eat, and that I should probably only eat once every couple months.In contrast, the chicken salad was a bit disappointing. I don't mean to disparage the Thai, but it tasted just like the iceberg salad with ginger dressing you get thrown in with your drunken noodle lunch special at every Thai restaurant in this city. By that I mean it tasted like a salad I get for free all the time, which isn't really a good thing, considering it cost around $15. To recap:Burgers are better than salads, and my poop is just fine, thanks.",15,24,13
80,Jenn H.,"Arlington, VA",0,51,59,2.0,7/18/2018,"This is a cute restaurant with tons of natural light, but I was disappointed in the Sunday brunch food. My friend and I were having trouble deciding, and the waitress told us that we couldn't really go wrong. Unfortunately, we found out we could from the combination of tasting our own orders and then seeing delicious-looking food delivered to other tables. The avocado toast ($17!) was a single piece of sandwich bread topped with what looked like straight avocado and a few imperceptible chili flakes, with a ""side salad"" of plain arugula and olive oil. The banana bread was good but not fantastic. Our advice? Order the veggie burger or the French toast instead.",,,

Argo I wouldn't really bring someone here to wow them. On to the food, the banana bread appetizer was eh, it's a little troublesome why they would toast the banana bread because it seemed to really dry it out, this was seconded by the later sitting next me who concurred in agreement. Wouldn't order that again. La Sirena cocktail was nice, but i am probably bias to most things with mezcal, plus she was strong :). Last, ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which I usually feel like a pig ordering ( and love it), which were surprisingly quite lite considering the heavy ingredients that usually make up a Ranchero Eggs, so you get almost subtle notes of spices and beans with a wafer like tostada. This i would definitely recommend.",,,

Though the space filled up quickly with reservations throughout lunch, my group and I were easily able to grab some seats at the communal table. We ordered a medley of stuff from their menu from the super healthy to the not so much, and everything was flavorful, filling, and well-prepared. I did a splitsies situation with a dining companion so I got to enjoy both the shrimp and avocado salad and the Little Beet burger. The salad was excellent with fresh tasting, huge shrimp and quinoa, and the burger was messy and hearty just like a burger should be, and perfectly medium rare per my request. Turns out their burger is a double by default, so even having half a burger was quite filling! At $21 for a salad and $19 for a burger it's definitely not cheap, but the quality of the ingredients and the classy ambiance made it feel worthwhile. May not be a realistic choice for lunch every day, but it's definitely a great option for those 'special' work lunches that might come up once in a while!",11,5,12

One daughter ordered the beet and chickpea sandwich, which by the way, came, with a gluten free bun, and said it was delicious.   My vegan daughter had the grilled cauliflower steak. Again, it was delicious and  flavorful. If you are a fan of beets, I would order the beet drink, mixed with orange and pineapple juice. Very yummy.

Don't let the 'uhh' fool you for boring, flavorless greens though. Little Beet does vegetables damn well. They're a 'vegetable forward' restaurant, really focusing on veggies as the main star (think Lady Gaga) and meat as the mini sidekick (think back up dancers...I tried). Neither my roommate or I were too hungry, so we decided to split their much-raved-about Cauliflower Hummus and the Chipotle Pork Carnitas Tacos. The hummus was a real crowd pleasahhh *cue Rae Sremmurd*. Seriously. So creamy with that delicious cauliflower taste. The pieces of popcorn, and sprinkle of toasted seeds gave the dish a nice crunch, and the red onion and dill some acidity and 'zing.' Not to mention, the grilled bread was perfectly toasted--although they give you about 8 dipper-sized slices, we still asked for more. Serving was big. The tacos on the other hand were a little underwhelming considering how much praise it gets. I couldn't really taste the kimchi apple nor the avocado crema. Much of the flavors I got were from the pork and the butternut squash--I did love the cute little squirt bottle served on the plate that's filled with some sort of spicy chipotle aioli (?). Overall good tacos with a generous amount of meat, but nothing out of this world. I called beforehand to make sure our server would bring out a dessert for the bday girl. They brought out their Warm Chocolate Brownie with a candle! And out came all our cell phones to document this stellar presentation on Snapchat :). I'm not a brownie fan, but it was surprisingly light, and it paired deliciously with the scoop of vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate ganache, and drizzles of red and yellow beets. We were all stuffed and happy, yet feeling a little less guilty since we got some veggies in (just try to forget that extra ordering of bread)... Will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes, although probably not until a special occasion since prices are on the higher side. --PS. the ambience is warm and farm-to-table community-like feel.

103,Rebecca A.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,269,2201,4.0,3/6/2016,"After a night that wasn't turning out too well, having dinner at The Little Beet Table was a great decision. We had reservations for 8:30PM. When we walked in, the Maitre D' told us that two tables were finishing up and it would be approx a 10 minute wait. That annoys me. If you're going to allow us to make reservations for a certain time, please make sure there's a table ready. It always dampers the mood. He offered us to go to the bar and order drinks, but the bar was full so that was pointless. While waiting I took a look at the decor and vibe. I love the art work on the wall and the dimly lit room. It has a romantic yet casual vibe, making it feel like you're not pressured to be uptight. I peeked into the kitchen. One of the cleanest kitchens I've ever come across at face value. Total pleasure. 13 minutes later, we were finally seated. Lucky for us, they gave us a quiet corner table. We did notice throughout our meal (2 hours) that the 4 table near us was empty the entire time. I'm sure they could have split that and sat us down right away. Next. Our waitress came over with menus and took our drinks order right away. She was great. Very attentive and astute. They definitely get a point for refilling our water glasses super fast. We had already glanced at the menu prior to coming to the restaurant so we knew what we wanted. We put our order in and waited. Our drinks came right away but we waited quite a while for our appetizers. I was unsure why as they were not very complicated dishes but when they did come, Oh god! Those dishes were something else. If you dine here, you must must get the Seared Tuna! I saw heaven -- no jokes. The blood orange and tabbouleh takes it to a whole new level of yum! We also got the mushroom flatbread as an appetizer but we weren't crazy over it. Our mains did come faster than the apps so that was definitely pleasing. We ordered the cauliflower, slow cooked salmon and rigatoni. The salmon and cauliflower were phenomenal. The cauliflower is also a must get. You have never had such amazing cauliflower with tastes that are out of this world. I loved the tomatoes in the rigatoni. Every bite had so much flavor and zest. It was perfect. Dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse. Very pleasing and not too heavy. Overall our dining experience at The Little Beet was top notch and exactly what we needed.

104,Maha B.,"New York, NY",5,19,2,1.0,4/8/2018,"This was my third visit to ""the little beet table"" and the establishment will probably wish I'd written this review after my second. I hate it when a place disappoints me this much. I suggested that my husband and I have brunch here after having had dinner here twice before with great experiences. First of all, the service was below sub par today, the waitress couldn't even be bothered to smile at us. We ordered the guacamole to start and the portion was meager, it could hardly satisfy one person as an appetizer, let alone two. I ordered what I'd previously had here, the beet and chickpea burger.  Today it was visibly burnt and completely dry. I admit my mistake in not having sent it back, I just hate to have to watch my husband eat while I wait for my meal. So I endured the burger, it was burnt, it fell apart and the bread just crumbled and didn't hold together. The two previous times I'd had this burger it had avocado on the patty and this time it had the tiniest piece of leftover lettuce that crumbled along with the stale bread. My husband had the grass fed burger. It was overcooked and his bacon was extremely chewy and not even close to crispy. At the end of an extremely disappointing meal and even worse service, I went over to the hostess stand and asked the hostess if they had a different team in the kitchen today. She said they didn't and gave me the blankest most uncaring look when I described today's experience.As a return customer, I was giving the restaurant an opportunity to redeem itself but she didn't bother to even say sorry; maybe she's just not smart enough to understand what I was saying. Regardless, for 60$ a person, don't bother coming here and go spend your money elsewhere with better food and better trained staff.",,,

We were seated at 6:15pm and were told we needed to be done by 7:30pm due to reservations - that was fine, but just keep that in mind as you read on. My friend and I ordered crudités trio and dip to share and she had the salmon while I went with the squash & cavatelli for entree. We did not get our entrees until 7:10pm, so service was quite slow. If we need to be out of there soon, why are we getting our entrees after a mere crudité app so late? The dips itself were good, especially the hummus and guacamole, but the middle red one could stand to be a little spicy and more flavorful. The veggies were not a great choice. Might be too rabbit food like for my tastes considering it was lots of raw cauliflower, carrots, beets, skinny green peppers and cucumber. I kind of wished it came with crackers/chips instead or at least some cooked veggies or other kinds of veggies (less raw beets would've been good) It wasn't a ""hit"" but I can see how specific people would like this. It's not for everyone. I don't fault them for this dish though, but it does add to my dissatisfaction.Salmon from my taste was decent and cooked correctly, and sauce had a nice spicy kick, but my pasta was not only way too salty but had an odd flavor to the sauce that just was not pleasant. I don't know how to explain it other than not good. I couldn't eat it and actually sent it back to the kitchen (which I've never done btw) and ordered carnitas tacos instead because I thought it would be quick. It was quick--so quick that the pork was cold and I think it took 5mins to come out after I ordered it. I just hope I don't get sick from eating cold pork. At this point I was just annoyed and hungry so I finished my food because it was edible.I used to work in the service industry, so my expectations and standards are quite high. While they did have the hostess come apologize to me for the bad pasta and replaced my order with something else, nothing felt genuine and it would have been nice for them to offer something complimentary to take care of the fact that my friend was finished with her meal way before I was. Waitress was also unapologetic and honestly I was wondering why there wasn't an apology from her but the male hostess instead. Maybe he was the manager, but why tell me that ""yeah, your right the pasta was too salty""?! Did they take a bite from my dish?! I really had been wanting to come here for a while, but I don't think I'd return. Either we just got unlucky and ordered 3 not so great dishes or their service also just isn't great.

We waited to be seated and had a drink at the bar. About 15 minutes later I approached the hostess and she said she gave my table away because we never told her we were ready. I explained that we were sitting at the bar and she saw us there. She couldn't care less. And, on top of that she was rude, disrespectful and condescending. Bottom line, don't waste your money. And if they gave the food away I wouldn't eat there anyway based upon the attitude of the staff in the restaurant.",,,

The server suggested around 5 plates to share so we ordered the crispy sushi rice with added egg, cauliflower hummus, chicken salad, tender shrimp with chickpeas and the cod. The shrimp and cod were too lightly seasoned for my liking, and although the shrimp was light, it had a spicy kick which I wasn't a fan of. The best dishes were definitely the crisply sushi rice and cauliflower hummus. Those two dishes really saved the night. We also ordered bourbon which we later found out is a 1$ surcharge on the rocks..",,,

I really like the more casual ""the little beet"". They had a delicious cucumber lemonade which is a must-try.

I arrived here without reservations with a party of three around 6:15 on a Saturday night. We took a seat at the bar, which is full service, and despite originally preferring a table the corner of the bar worked perfectly. Between the three of us we ordered the vegetable crudite and prosciutto flatbread as starters, as well as the curried cauliflower, a few orders of brussels sprouts, and the grilled skirt steak for dinner. Everything was phenomenal! I was expected carrots and celery as crudite, but was instead treated to a selection of fresh-from-the-farm vegetables, some with the roots still on. Beautiful beets, fennel, turnips, and more paired nicely with the mint raita and red pepper hummus. My only complain about that dish was the tiny amount of raita and hummus they give you. My favorite dish was the curried cauliflower with date and prune chutney. The cauliflower was nicely charred and didn't have an overwhelming curry flavor. I left the restaurant satisfied but not stuffed, and definitely got in a few servings of vegetables! I'd love to try their brunch sometime, as I hear the banana bread is amazing.",2,,1

Best bite of the night were the tacos for sure. Crispy rice had nice socarrat and was really heavy on scallions (hence almost authentically Asian??). Shrimp salad was crisp and had a bunch of candied nuts - easily could have been a meal in itself. The crudite was good and pretty but at the end of the day really just some glorified raw and blanched vegetables.Great dinner overall and the waiter was a delight!",2,1,2

For my lunch I opted for a grass fed burger which came with a double patty, Vermont cheddar, bacon, and the best part, a special sauce. Even though I opted for the burger the menu here is very veggie friendly so you would have an easy time finding food for your vegetarian friends.The food was fresh and delicious, the service was outstanding, and all in all I couldn't have asked for a better lunch spot, group or not!",7,3,8
123,Helen Z.,"Stanford, CA",304,235,536,2.0,2/9/2016,"2.5 stars. 5 for service/ambiance. 4 for vegetables. 2 for price. 0 for entree.For such a highly rated place in NYC, I had higher expectations. I came here for dinner with a party of four. Service, menu selection, and ambiance were all good. We were seated at our own table, which was fortunate because the restaurant is rather loud and conversation would have been difficult at the communal table. Our server was friendly and attentive, letting us take our time with our ordering. We started with a round of vegetable appetizers - roasted mushrooms, curry cauliflower, and xo sauce (pork, scallop, and chili) brussel sprouts. The first two BLEW me away - they were delicious! The mushrooms were a good assortment of crimini, oyster, and something else with a perfect earthiness and good amount of seasoning without overpowering the mushrooms themselves. The cauliflower came roasted and served atop a date and prune chutney - I could eat that for days. Brussel sprouts were decent but nothing to write home about. If we had stopped the meal here, I would have easily rated this place at least 4 stars Unfortunately, then came the entrees. I ordered the steamed red snapper served atop a butternut squash risotto. Sounds delicious right? When the dish first arrived, I was surprised at its size - the dish was much smaller than what I would expect for $29. No immediate complaints though - I can appreciate quality over quantity. However, when I took a bite of the dish, my optimism faded. The fish was mediocre at best. Meanwhile, the risotto had an odd crunchy texture, as if half the rice hadn't actually been cooked thouroughly. The dish overall lacked flavor, very underwhelming.Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish. However, my friend who ordered the LBT burger was also unimpressed. Adding potato chips and bacon was an interesting attempt to make the burger unique, but neither actually added texture as they were no longer crunchy by the time he was eating them. The most interesting part of the dish was the horseradish sauce, but again, at $19 a burger, more was expected. Had this restaurant been somewhere other than NYC, I would be willing to come back and give it another try, maybe just opting for vegetables. But given the wide selection of other foods in NY, I'd recommend trying somewhere else instead.",1,,

Im obsessed with these two. The shrimp is always a good size, grilled perfectly and juicy. They also aren't cheap about their ingredients, we get at least 6 jumbo shrimps on the salad, green raisins. Their salad dressing is the bomb, whatever it is, has some sort of nut i think. Spirulina rice...obsessed! I always get it with two sunny side up eggs, i think i will start asking for 3! The rice is crispy, fluffy and light, kind of taste like popcorn..but healthier? The mix is perfect! Their sweet potatoes i've had once, super sweet and juicy. I've tried their tacos, not a fan..very salty. We also tried their burger, the bread wasn't soft and overcooked meat, not juicy nothing to rave about. Latte was a bummer, they use nespresso pods, hope they get a real espresso machine soon! I usually walk over to Gregorys (literally two stores over) to get a latte before i get lunch at little beets.

Paired with some Saint Roch rosé, this was exactly what we'd hoped for after a lot of walking around flatiron in the morning.

I loved my scrambled eggs and my cucumber/gin drink as well. We split a simple fruit tart for dessert. (Not overly sweet - just perfect. )Service was great too.  The staff and  restaurant space were warm and inviting.  We loved having the extra space which is not typical of a Manhattan restaurant.

137,Helen L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,19,9,5.0,1/15/2017,"I came in for a 5p dinner today (1/15/17 Sun). This is my first time dining here. Unlike other restaurants that have limited selection of gluten free dishes, everything on the menu here is gluten free! And the food was simply fantastic (and this is coming from a person who is not gluten sensitive). This was part of my ""trial & error"" dining process in search for a terrific gluten free restaurant in Manhattan for an out-of-town guest. And this is definitely a keeper, and I would return here for my own dining enjoyment even without my gluten sensitive guest(s).  I ordered the following:1) Cucumber lemonade with mint: Very refreshing. Not overwhelmingly sweet. Goes very well with the entree I ordered (see below). 2) Chipotle pork carnitas tacos: very creative in re: flavored profile! I love this entree and the sauce it comes w/ on the side. Would definitely order this again next time! Comes w/ 3 tacos. Quite filling. 3) Charred broccoli w/ spicy carrot remoulade and carrot chips: ordered as a side. But this can be easily shared w/ two people as a side dish. And it is very tasty and not heavy. The carrot remoulade is not too spicy (just a mild hint of spiciness). Just perfect to enjoy the slightly charred taste of the broccoli. And the sprinkles of carrot chips on the whole dish added to texture and crunch. A great side dish!4) At this point I was happily full... but I had to look at the menu of gluten free desserts for my ""research."" My eyes landed on ""warm chocolate fudge brownie w/ vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate ganache, red & golden beets."" Amazingly good!! Served warm. Crispy texture outside but perfect warm brownie texture inside. Pleasantly surprised that it was not overly sweet! And it went quite well w/ their hot black Americano. So happy that I did my due diligence and ordered the dessert! The dessert is large enough to be shared with another person. 5) Terrific service. Good food presentation. Good décor for a dinner w/ friends/date/family: spacious yet warm & inviting. A large group can be easily accommodated; just make a reservation in advance. Of note, per other Yelpers, their ""burger w/ broccoli slaw"" and ""crunch rice with fried egg"" are also good. I may try those next time!Highly recommend based on the dishes I had above -- regardless of your gluten sensitivity status!",,,

We couldn't stop commenting on how much we loved the restaurant's decor! There were a lot of things on the menu I liked, but I went with the flatiron steak salad, which was grilled steak, tomatoes, arugula, olives, carmelized onions, ricotta salata, and red wine vinaigrette. Delicious! The steak was properly seasoned and tender, the tomatoes were just slightly roasted to bring out their sweetness, and the onions were caramelized perfectly. Also seemed to have just the right amount of dressing. The only thing I didn't like as much was that the ricotta seemed a bit tasteless, but otherwise it was fine.As good as that salad was though, I'd definitely skip that next time and get the burger instead.

The bride to be is gluten free, dairy free & meat free and then one of our friends is paleo so this was a good spot to suit them both. I eat anything so this is my take on the place.The pea guacamole came with a tostada so we asked for veggie sticks to be served on the side as well. They said it was fine for a $5 fee. Then they brought out thick pieces of cauliflower...very weird. So we asked for carrot sticks instead and got very thick slices of carrots, the server seemed annoyed with this. It's just a little weird to me considering the establishment itself is for people with food allergies (gluten), so I thought they'd be more respectful of understanding other types of food sensitivities/allergies. It's not fun to feel bad about things you can't/don't eat when you're trying to have a good time at dinner.Another negative is that the salads were nice and large but the lettuce wasn't really chopped like a typical salad, we had to cut it up. The broccoli dish had a fake cheese sauce and crispy bits on top that resembled something like bacon but was completely meat and dairy free, SO cool! I also enjoyed the shrimp and chickpea curry but wish it was a main instead of being an appetizer (curry as an appetizer is so weird to me). If you're not gluten free, stay away from eating typical carbs here like bread/pasta it'll probably disappoint. But definitely go for the veggies! They're yummy and seasonal.

It also comes with an avocado crema which I left off due to allergies, and a little squirt bottle of guajillo pepper sauce. The tacos were perfect (if you can't have avocado you won't miss the crema). And surprisingly filling, too. I also got a bowl of olives to snack on which were tasty but which I'm regretting now considering how filling the tacos were.

The red snapper has an ""oaky"" flavor because it was baked with some green sauce (I don't know what it is). I actually enjoyed the sides which includes spaghetti squash and mushroom. The combination is really unique and good.Dessert:- brownie: vanilla ice cream and some beet sauce over warm brownies.. Perfect way to end it.

Updated review","A bit after my first review of a not-so-pleasant experience at The Little Beet Table, the manager Jenifer graciously reached out to me with an apology and an invite to give them another shot. My friend (the same one who accompanied me the first time) and I decided on brunch on a Saturday in March.The experience was the polar opposite of the previous one. We ordered the cauliflower hummus, which absolutely blew us away, followed by the lobster benedict and the chicken sausage dish, both of which were delicious.The only nitpicky details I have are that the entrees again took a very long time (we understood it was prime brunch time and were so happy with the hummus that we didn't mind too badly) and also the one time our waitress offered to get my friend some more hot water, it took about 20 minutes.Again, kudos to Jenifer for reaching out and rectifying our original situation. It's rare for any managers to actually do this, so it was a very pleasant surprise and I'm glad we got to experience The Little Beet Table in a different light.",,,
157,Misa H.,"New York, NY",1,25,7,4.0,5/6/2017,"Came to this gluten-free restaurant on a weekday dinner with a friend.Not crowded but not empty either. You could probably come here without a reservation for a weekday dinner.Had some beer, and shared hummus, quinoa, and tacos.Hummus was very tasty, and quinoa was great. Tacos was okay.For dessert, we shared Strawberry crumble and had a cup of coffee each. The price ended up $60 for each, which is not cheap but acceptable for a dinner in NYC.Overall, good experience, although ABC Kitchen still higher on my list when it comes to organic/gluten-free restaurants in NYC.",,,
158,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",140,204,438,4.0,4/1/2017,"Very good food, but the portions could be a little bigger.I will say their grilled beets will yogurt, and granola are the best beet dish I've ever had; I would go back again for them alone.Other items like steamed broccoli for $13+ dollars don't make much sense to me.",,,
159,Ashlie M.,"New York, NY",45,33,55,3.0,2/6/2017,"This place was just okay. My friend and I are on a diet and wanted a quick dinner and decided on this spot. Very clean decor, but just wasn't amazing . We had someTacos and two salads to share. Nothing spectacular but also not bad. I am not sure if I would return.",1,,2
160,Nini B.,"New York, NY",0,24,9,3.0,11/29/2017,"Love clean, plant-based meals, so was very exciting to check this place out, but found it to be a little lackluster.  Appetizers and signature snacks are the way to go here.  The Cauliflower Hummus was incredible.  Disappointed in the Beet & Chickpea Burger.",,,
161,French Foodie P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,58,175,4.0,5/28/2017,This is my second visit here and it didn't disappoint. Food was excellent. Service was  a bit slow even though we came early and there were only a few tables. We were in a corner table and the server kept bumping in to the table and brushing my friend which was a bit annoying. They should increase the space between tables so this doesn't happen again. Started with the guac and olives both delicious. My friend had the burger which he couldn't stop raving about. I had the tacos which were perfectly balanced with 2 different sauces. We finished the meal off with the brownie - very good! Will be back again.,,,
162,Amelia C.,"Jersey City, NJ",281,248,376,3.0,7/23/2016,"A good pick for vegetarians. Rustic-chic ambience with refreshing cocktails and healthy seasonal options. The one particular standout for me was the cauliflower hummus, which had a tahini-like consistency and taste to it. Delicious! We also had the sweet pea guacamole, fish tacos, baby kale salad with pecorino, and roasted shrimp salad. The shrimp were fresh, but nothing else was particularly noteworthy. About $50pp for dinner and a cocktail.",,,

165,Lily M.,"Manhattan, NY",12,333,16,3.0,1/25/2017,"I really really wanted to love this place because I have a gluten intolerance and I love supporting gluten free establishments. Also because I absolutely LOVE The Little Beet fresh food chain (poke all the way!). I had my husband book a surprise date night restaurant and this was the place he picked (not knowing that I LOVE The Little Beet, great husband!). I got here earlier than he did so I sat at the bar to have a couple of cocktails. A couple meaning one of each on the menu. My fav being the Matcha Mojito.I had the red snapper, husband had the grass-fed double cheeseburger. The snapper was a tad overcooked, the flavor was on point though and the sides complemented it well. The cheeseburger was meh, not the best we've had and for $19, it's not justifiable. Would I come back again? Probably not. I wish they had the poke on the menu though because that shitz is da bomb!",1,1,
166,Az K.,"New York, NY",346,26,17,4.0,7/22/2017,"Delicious and healthy, though not inexpensive. Some dishes are a perfect hit (the char, the branzino), but others, like the cauliflower hummus, lack flavor. I usually just ask for a side of chili pepper, and it remedies the situation.",1,,

168,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",96,191,288,2.0,2/28/2016,"Located on Park Avenue South near restaurants like Hillstone, Upland, and Pippali in Gramercy the restaurant is convenient to the Lexington avenue subway line.  There's plenty of space in side the casual, dim-lit dining room where the patrons are not sitting elbow to elbow, unless of course, you're sitting at one of the communal tables.  We were glad we had a cozy table for two.Appetizers and sides are the highlights here.  We had the tender shrimp with chickpeas, curried cauliflower, and roasted sweet potatoes.  These were seasoned well, the shrimp and chickpeas were delicious and had a bit of pepper in it which made it spicy; the cauliflower was soft and overcooked however the date and prune chutney nicely balanced the curry flavor; the sweet potatoes were one of the highlights of the evening, the skin had a slight crunch from the grill which enhanced the texture.  The skirt steak with chimichurri was fine, the sauce was vinegary with freshly chopped ingredients. The grilled beets had a nice presentation, with Greek yogurt and pumpkin seed almond granola.  The plate consisted of one inch cubes of golden and red beets.  I took a bite and was surprised at the cold center of the root vegetable - cold as in right out of the refrigerator, definitely colder than room temperature.  I was expecting warm ""grilled"" beets, perhaps the menu could have been more descriptive and clear.  Not a bad dish if you're looking for a salad.The drinks were pricey, we had the spicy grapefruit margarita, honey orange caipirinha, orange pop, and root beer.  $14 for a cocktail is standard in this neighborhood and they were just run of the mill here.  The natural beverages were $6, they weren't overly sweet and also unmemorable.  Our server (Matthew K.) rushed to clear our table and took away a cocktail glass that we were still in the middle of enjoying (there were other empty tables in the room - there wasn't a need for space).  When we brought this to his attention he apologized halfheartedly and said the only thing he can do for us ""under the table"" is to give us a taste of one of the wines (he asked us to pretend we were studying the chardonnay - we didn't care to drink the tiny sip he brought to the table.)  If he was more careful this hiccup could have been easily avoided. We're gluten-tolerant, maybe there's something special here that I missed.  However $150 for a mediocre weeknight dinner for two with poor service is a bit exorbitant.  Next time I'll probably stop by nearby curry hill for cauliflower and chickpeas rather than returning to Little Beet Table.",1,1,
169,Mark H.,"Failsworth, United Kingdom",0,1,0,2.0,11/5/2017,"In town from the UK and although not self professed vegans, we try to stick to a vegetarian/vegan diet as much as possible.After eating a phenomenal breakfast at the butchers daughter, we chose this place for a late lunch as it was close to our hotel.Food wise: crudités with dips - The dips were really good. The vegetable choice was disappointing.We asked for some toasted bread (which they offer for $3) Brussel sprouts side dish - roasted with a hint of salsa and salt. Quite nice but a little dry.Beet/chickpea burger -It looked okay when it arrived but It didn't seem like any thought had gone into how to eat a dish. For example, I was given a steak knife to eat it, but if you try to cut through the bun then the whole thing falls apart into a mess on your plate!If you try to pick it up, then it falls apart into a mess on (you get the picture)The only option left seemed to be scrapping off what was left on the bun and just eat the crumbled burger on my plate with the sweet potatoes. It was dry, bland and difficult to swallow. I ate some of it and the two sweet potato wedges that accompanied it.The Chickpea Caesar salad was also disappointing and bland and my wife left more than she ate.We were given no more than 4-5 mins before being offered dessert, which we declined. The check was brought to our table before we could even finish our wine, let alone decide whether we wanted another glass or a coffee to finish.$100 in total for the food and two glasses of wine. In our opinion, we found it to be disappointing & over-priced for the quality of produce offered and the way that it was delivered to our table.",,,

The food was SO delicious, with fresh ingredients and tons of unique flavours. My personal favourites were the Cauliflower Hummus and the Beet & Chickpea Burger. Both were so good that I looked up similar recipes for both dishes online immediately after dinner! Despite how good the hummus and the burger were, the Strawberry-Rhubarb Crumble definitely stole the show that night. It was the perfect mix between sweet and tart; gooey and crunchy; and hot and cold. Although I was already on the verge of exploding before dessert, I will always make space for a dish that delicious.",1,,3

It would have been nice to have a stand alone table but none were available.Service - everybody is really friendly here and food came out quickly.Food - overall excellent.-- Tender shrimp + chickpeas was VERY good. I was actually amazed at how much flavor this dish had.-- Side of broccoli was FANTASTIC. Not sure what they do to this but it's a must-order.-- Side of beets was just okay for me. Not something I'd order again.-- Co-workers ordered the fish tacos and seemed to really enjoy them.Prices - here's where TLBT loses a star...prices are a bit on the high side, especially considering that portions are disappointingly low.

However, I was pretty impressed by the quality of the meal. I would have never thought to order the crispy pearl rice as an appetizer but it made an lasting impression and left me craving more. It had the perfect amount of crunchiness to the dish and was accompanied with a delicious orange sauce below the rice, which packs in the perfect amount of heat and flavor. For my main dish, I ordered salmon which was very moist and cooked nicely. However, the bok choy on the side of the salmon was just okay. Overall, the food was delicious and good quality but the prices were a bit high. I would probably come back again in the future and get the crispy pearl rice!",3,1,2

It was dark brown and all you could taste was lemon.  Not edible.  I thought it was coming with bread and veggies. Turned out to be just bread. Veggies extra.  I couldn't see that because the menu is small and poorly printed.  Then we got the Bronzino.  This was just GROSS! Tiny piece of fish surrounded by the most fennel ever to be served on one plate.  Who eats raw fennel? A whole bunch of it?  YUK! And a different form of fennel under the fish too.  About the same size of the fish.  We ordered a half portion of the cavatelli with green pea sauce.  This was HORRIBLE too! Another dish that sounds good, but wasn't.  All you could taste was the mint.  And lastly the charred broccoli.  Hopping or some simple Broccoli, it was covered in some mystery sauce and over burned.  Very nice atmosphere but the food stinks.  AVOID this expensive restaurant.",1,,

I ordered the Chickpea Caesar Salad and the Arctic Char. Before I discuss the food I felt as though our waitress was really trying to upsell -- do we want this, are we sure we don't want this, you've got to try this, etc. to the point where it became a bit frustrating.However! The Chickpea Caesar Salad was INCREDIBLE. The romaine was grilled, which I never would've thought to do but it imparted such a smoky and delightful flavor. The dressing was great and there was plenty of chickpeas, croutons, and parmesan. The Arctic Char (served with a carrot salad and bok choy) was cooked perfectly -- maybe one of the best filets I've ever had. However, I felt as though the whole dish was a bit underseasoned. Quite tasty certainly, but I think it could've used a bit more salt or something. I also had a bite of my friend's quinoa and vegetable dish -- I think I'd order that next time!Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I'll definitely be back!",,,

The rice was amazing and I need to figure out how to recreate this dish, the shishito peppers in it were awesome. Everyone was really impressed with their entrees (burgers, tacos, shrimp salad) and we also shared the broccoli (which was pretty spicy) and the Brussels sprouts.The only negative that I could see is they do have large communal tables which we were seated at but they did not place another party at the same table throughout our meal.
