0,Paige J.,"Charlotte, NC",340,251,96,5.0,10/5/2018,"The Milton is amazing! I was disappointed I wasn't there for the $1 oyster happy hour, but I'll be back for it. Bar tenders are fun and personable. I enjoyed watching them interact. It seems late night during the week the bar top is jammed with locals. They even knew what people ordered the week before from memory, that's service.The drinks are unique as they have a few options with Rose. I loved the wine list. Definitely a good spot to get a cocktail if that's your thing.The food - yes! I had a tuna tartare dish, it was served in a jar on a slate board and yes the flavor matched the aesthetics! Fresh, tender tuna and good guacamole on top. We ordered the Jameson wings, which was a unique find and intrigued us enough to try them. They did not disappoint. While you may think it would be hard to mess up wings, it's not hard. Milton's are really good, definitely recommend. There was a man sitting alone a few seats over just eating a burger and I don't think he looked up once. He was in a suit, not a starving man so this is how I know I should order that next time. Decor and ambiance was adorable, I couldn't stop gawking. Late night happy hour is also a huge perk, for us night owls. Can't wait to go back.",2,,1
1,Matt C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,0,1.0,11/10/2018,"For me to pan an establishment. Two metrics need to be met; 1) the bad vastly outweighs the good, and; 2) there is good reason to share this with others in posting a very negative review. In this case both are merited. For my family, we've given The Milton two chances. Consistent in both was sloppy service and back-of-house. Getting the order in is easy, waiting an inordinate amount of time for it should not happen. I get that in a new restaurant, that does occur until they work their kinks out. The Problem is, The Milton is not new. Let's talk about our most-recent visit. We ordered fish & chips and burgers and Jameson chicken wings. The food came out in a raesonable amount of time. FIRST PROBLEM -- the fish & chips reeked of iodine (an ammonia/urine-like scent), the science behind this occurs behind frozen seafood, most notably shrimp and crab, its an occasional unpleasant side-effect of the freezing process. Typically, in the business, whoever receives an order from a vendor would refuse it and the vendor would take it back and order a credit. Sometimes, a cook does not sign for the order and some slips through. Fair enough, so when the cook thaws the product, they'd MOST CERTAINLY smell it, and good chefs/cooks would ""86'it"" from the menu. It's not dangerous to health to serve this, it just smells and tastes bad -- mostly smelling bad. Any place that cares about what they do, and their customers, wouldn't let something leave the kitchen this way. So assuming the kitchen did not sign for the fish from the vendor, either the chef/cooks were didn't bother to care for what they were cooking, or didn't care about the customers. It's one or the other, and there's no excuse for it.We sent it back, and we asked for a plain salad in its place -- to be expedited -- a fair request. It took us quite a while to get anyone's attention, so I got up and asked our server. 20 minutes later (I noted the time), no salad in site, and me having waited for my wife to eat, my burger was cold. I got up again and asked our server, she went back and looked like she said something to the kitchen. We waited another 10 minutes -- for a plain salad (no chicken added) and had enough, by this time my wife told me to eat. I finally got up and told the manager we were leaving.We want to like The Milton, it's a nice place and the food is good. The Jameson Chicken wings taste spectacular, the burgers are well- proportioned and full of flavor, and the shepard's pie is rich, and unlike most covered with gooey cheese (a nice touch from the norm), even the fish & chips on our first visit were good. So for food, it's nice to have in the neighborhood. But for server attention and back-of-house, The Milton is a sea of ineptitude. If you want similar quality food, atmosphere and far-better service, go ten blocks south to The Penrose.So here's the public's take-away, go enjoy yourself, the food is generally good and fairly-priced. The bar service is good, but if you don't have the attention you need from your server or the back-of-house, don't wait, call for the manager (we were being polite). And if your seafood smells off -- it is -- send it back and let the manager know, if enough people do this, they will get the message. Here's the owner/manager's take away. Fix your back-of-house with timing and paying attention to what they send out (the latter is really easy), better manage your servers, they are indifferent to all. I have tied to be as fair as possible to all parties. It takes a lot for me to write something negative, too much has to go wrong to spend the effort.",1,,

Plus, brunch menu items come with a drink of your choice so its a good deal. Service both times was meh, but its a cute neighorhood spot with a nice atmosphere. Seems like they get busy on the weekends so might be good to have reservations (though we didn't and they were able to squeeze us in). They have outdoor seating (dog-friendly) during the warmer months.",2,,
3,Daniel S.,"New York, NY",9,13,2,2.0,10/11/2018,"Was not impressed with this place. Here's why:-No air conditioning inside when it was 75 degrees-No espresso/latte machine-I ordered the smoked salmon breakfast. This was a major mistake. The salmon was TERRIBLE - salty, slimy, and old tasting. Additionally, they don't have bagels, so I got a flimsy piece of english muffin instead. Pretty silly to offer a salmon breakfast without bagels. Just remove it from the menu. A really lazy and bad tasting breakfast. Hopefully the dinner is better.",1,,
4,Ally R.,"New York, NY",11,56,79,4.0,9/29/2018,"I've been to the Milton twice lately for brunch. It is a solid brunch spot. It's reasonable, the food is good and the servers do not rush you one bit. All of the brunch entrees (prices $14-$18) come with tea, coffee, Bloody Mary, mimosa or screwdriver. What a deal! Ordered:Two eggs any style ($14)- I swear the Milton gives you more than two eggs when you order them scrambled. See my pic for proof of this. The eggs come with roasted potatoes and onions and bacon or sausage. I got breakfast sausage which I enjoyed. Omelet of the day ($15)- the Milton's omelets are made in the french style- soft eggs wrapped around cooked fillings (rather than fillings mixed into the eggs and then cooked). I had a mushroom and Swiss omelet. The mushrooms were very finely chopped, almost like a paste. They were flavorful and nice when paired with the Swiss cheese. They came with roasted potatoes. If you are looking for a brunch spot on the Upper East Side, check out the Milton.",1,,
5,Heather W.,"Manhattan, NY",36,391,890,3.0,9/19/2018,"Came here a couple times since my friend is nearby-- both times there was an AWFUL waitress who ruined this aspect of our evening! She was completely snarky/snippity the ENTIRE time- eventually we asked for the other server, and it was simply a much, much better evening.Her service and people skills were a disaster. Every time we asked for anything, she'd ask and leave us hanging with no answer. Things took FOREVER.  Chicken bites came out burnt twice and they insisted that's how they are, and the chef just does them that way. Giving this a neutral review since the other guy fixed it all for us. The alternate dish he sent out was not blackened. But still, left a memorably awful experience...",2,,1

Updated review","I have no idea what happened to this place!We made a reservation and dined at the Milton on a Saturday night.  We ordered the Deviled Eggs and two Milton Burgers (medium-rare).  The burgers were ""moo.""  Totally unacceptable.And the service?!  Terrible.  The waitstaff looked miserable and it had a noticeable impact on customer service.It's a shame too, because the Milton was a great addition to the neighborhood.  We won't be returning.",,,
8,Aditya R.,"New York, NY",212,95,107,5.0,7/28/2018,"Fun neighborhood brunch spot. Each entree includes a beverage (non-alcoholic or adult) :) I got the eggs benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was a bit on the vingerey side for my first taste, but the house potatoes were really good! My wife got the omelette of the day, which was Swiss and mushroom, also really good!  Waiting staff was friendly and service wasrelatively quick. I would definitely go back.",,,
9,Gauri L.,"Manhattan, NY",56,80,116,5.0,3/25/2018,"Cute low key spot in the UES with an intimate setting and great food! Came here on a Sunday night for dinner and to my surprise, it was quite crowded. The ambience is very warm, brick walls with candle lights - perfect for a dinner with friends or even a date! We got the oysters, tomato soup and grilled cheese (yup, it was one of those Sundays) and the organic chicken. All were outstanding...definitely want to return and try more items on the menu!!",2,,1
10,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,4.0,8/11/2018,"GREAT neighborhood brunch go-to on the UES!  I live right around the corner and literally walk by every week but never set foot inside before.  We finally came for brunch on a Saturday (YES - they take brunch reservations!) and it was fantastic - service, food, and ambiance.  The overall vibe is casual and relaxed with spacious, dimly-lit Victorian decor and seating.  The service is solid as well - our server was great about checking in without hovering.Some brunch highlights below.  The entrees come with tea, coffee, OJ, screwdriver, mimosa, or a Bloody Mary which is fantastic given that all are in the range of $14-16!1. Chef's Masterpiece: This was a true brunch masterpiece - basically a baked skillet of 3 eggs, goat cheese, and peas/chickpeas with grilled country bread.  Savory and creamy.  It's a must-try.2. Eggs Benedict: Solid take on a classic - the Hollandaise is a bit on a vinegar-y side but overall very good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were well-seasoned and not over-fried or dry (many places will overcook potatoes for brunch).Portions are solid and we were served our food in less than 10 minutes.  It's a great British pub and a nice option for grabbing brunch with friends or a date - the noise level is definitely on the low side even when it is packed given the acoustics.  Will be back to try dinner but the brunch is a keeper!",,,1

Sampled a few things and you really can't go wrong with any choice. Service was really great for our large group. People would order drinks and then wander around and the poor waitress would have to hunt down the person who ordered. Food was also really good. We ordered a bunch of apps and they brought them out pretty fast. Very tasty and quality is great. Mac and cheese is always my favorite. They also had these chicken nuggets that were a hit with everyone.The space itself was really nice too. You can choose the outside patio, communal tables by the door/open windows or more space in the back.",3,1,3
14,Jonathan M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",12,13,0,2.0,10/2/2018,"I first went to the Milton with a co-worker several weeks ago.  We were hungry and it was at the right place at the right time.  We both ordered identical meals, the Milton Burger, medium rare and fries.  This burger was actually one of the best burgers I have had in a long time.  So much so that I couldn't wait to go back.I spoke so highly about this place to another colleague that we decided to go there again just last week.  We walked in there just a few minutes after noon.  In fact, the bartender / server recognized me and I did mention that I couldn't wait to go back here.  We both ordered the exact same thing once again, the Milton burger with bacon - medium rare and fries.I was appalled and shocked at what was delivered to the table.  The bacon looked like it was at least 48 hours old and the fries looked to be 24 hours old.  My colleague and I both looked at each other in disbelief.  I asked the server to come over, and asked her what her thoughts on the bacon was.  She seemed a bit surprised.  I said to her, how did this make it past the kitchen?  She took it away, and came back a few minutes later.  In the meantime, we started eating the burger and fries.  This was a completely different burger and fries!  It didn't seem fresh at all, and the fries were absolutely 24 hours old.  There is no way on this earth that both the fries and bacon were so over cooked at this time of day...noon.  They absolutely had to be at yesterday's leftovers.When we were done, I again shared my thoughts with the server, her response was, ""I brought you new bacon"".  Are you kidding me?  What was I expecting?  I was expecting a bit more than 5 words.  Perhaps a discount?  Perhaps a manager?  Perhaps a voucher for a discounted or free meal?To the owners, I would be happy to share with you the picture of the bacon that was served and my receipt to verify my patronage on both occasions.  Feel free to respond.",,,

16,Jason C.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",96,559,23,5.0,4/16/2018,"5 stars for great cocktails and an even better bartender (whose name I did not ask, I'm sorry because he deserves to be recognized for his awesomeness). Stopped in on a windy and rainy Sunday night around 6:30pm before a book signing nearby. I was hungry for a snack and nothing really stuck out to me on the menu, but I ultimately settled on the tomato soup and grilled cheese (a bit steep at $12 for the small cup, but perfect for the weather). Soup was top notch - creamy, smooth, and with a bit of bite from the tomatoes. My only complaint was that I wish I had more of it; the cup serving was small. Sandwich was white bread and cheese with the crust cut off, nothing to write home about.My first drink was The Miltonian. It was potent but incredibly refreshing. Cucumber is at the forefront but it has some slight fizziness from the egg white and tartness from the lime. A great cocktail any time, but I could drink five or ten of these on a hot summer day. I moved on to the much more forward ""Long Day At the Office"" which I cannot recommend highly enough if you really have had a long day. It is strong but very well balanced.  In between making drinks and checking on other patrons, the bartender and I talked a bit about our favorite drinks. He had some good suggestions from their menu and to make on my own. Great spot for a date or a drink on the way home.",2,2,3

Updated review","Reviewing again for their brunch. Let me start off by saying I think their dinner is definitely much better, that being said the brunch is good too. I got the eggs benedict with salmon that comes with potatoes on the side. Each of their entrees also comes with a complimentary drink (mimosa, bloody mary, tea, or coffee) and so I got a mimosa. The drink was great and the eggs cooked perfectly. I didn't care too much for the flavor of their salmon and felt like it was too much with the eggs, almost over powering, but definitely can't complain about the amount they give you for only $2 extra. My friend got a ham grilled cheese with an egg on top and that looked really good, she really enjoyed it. It was a nice Sunday brunch but I definitely recommend the Milton for dinner instead!",1,,
18,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,3.0,4/23/2018,"This is the classic place that's a 3.5 stars, but I overall just had to round down. The atmosphere is warm, cozy, inviting. It has a rustic charm, with cute windows and greenery, wooden tables/beams, brick walls, lots of candles floors, and good music. They have a good section of outdoor seating and a large bar area that was full of young, hip UESer's. We walked in on a Sat and were able to be seated right away. Unfortunately, there was a private party, that was so loud we saw two tables near by us walk out. We were about to leave also, but the party was on their way out. Regardless, it is too small a space to have a party that loud, and completely took away from our experience. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and apologetic which helped. We got the truffle chicken fingers that they are known for, and honestly I wasn't that impressed. The chicken is a patty, kind of like mcdonalds, and ground chicken. The truffle/breaded seasoning is amazing, and would be soooo good on a true chicken tender. But I felt like I was just eating a McNugget or an interesting meatball. I got the fish n chips, which are a large portion and tasty, but nothing special. Greg got the roast chicken which was average, but again, nothing tasty or special. Everything was somewhat bland and lacked any wow factor. My cocktail however, was delicious, so flavorful and hit the spot for a decent price ( Ginger bee). I would definitely come back here for drinks or patio drinking, but not sure I would eat here again.",1,,
19,Denay W.,"New York, NY",308,226,736,5.0,10/9/2017,"Go here for the cocktails and fun atmosphere, and stay for the fantastic food. Having walked by the Milton many of times, I was surprised by how nice the interior of the restaurant was - it was very Penrose-like but a bit cozier even. Expected okayish British pub food based on looking the menu in advance but what we ordered exceeded my expectations for sure. I went with the Coconut Curry Chicken Pot Pie since I was in the mood for the unique sounding comfort food. It was quite enjoyable and wasn't a heavy as I expected it to be, probably because it wasn't an actual ""Pie"" and had a layer of crust on top. My husband went with the Cottage Pie (seems to be their main popular item) and dang... my food envy has never been so real. I had so many bites of this dish that I basically claimed it as my own because it's THAT good. Blown away by the short rib, mashed potato and cheese combo. Next time I'll be getting that. We also happened to come during happy hour so we ordered a few cocktails - I ordered the French 92nd and Lucky Walker and both were great but I definitely preferred the Lucky Walker. If you need a good strong bourbon drink, get the Long Day At The Office. Definitely will be coming back soon! Already recommended this place to friends.",1,,1
20,Sean D.,"New York, NY",248,25,4,4.0,10/22/2018,This place is always enjoyable to come to. The staff is always super friendly. It's usually possible to grab a spot at the bar and it's only one of two places all thru 2nd Ave. I can think of that the bar actually stays open until 4 AM like it says on Google. The place is always lit up with candles which creates a very comfortable setting and the burgers are tasty. They have a moderate selection of beer and your typical cocktails on the menu but it's always consistently good. Monday nights are prohibition nights which include discounted bar food and cocktails. As well as a happy hour every night after midnight and you can't go wrong at those prices.,,,

I have yet to have an unsatisfactory meal here and have made The Milton one of my go-to restaurants. The Irish Joe (braised pork, not ground beef) is amazing, and I highly suggest substituting the potatoes for the buttered kale. Their fish and chips, grilled cheese with tomato soup (which my girlfriend loved), and The Milton Salad (apple strips, bacon, blue cheese chunks, walnuts, kale) are all fantastic as well!The atmosphere is quiet but always lively, the waiting staff has always been exceptionally friendly and attentive, the manager is a nice guy who regularly checks to make sure everything is going smoothly, and the prices are reasonable. I've spent a very solid New Year's Eve dinner at The Milton, I've brought my parents here when they've visited, I brought my girlfriend here on one of our first dates, and I will continue to make it one of my regular dinner spots.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.

To add the cherry on the sundae (or Monday in this case :P), there was live jazz music by L&P trio. They sounded great and my friend and I could still hear each other if we wanted to talk too.

We told our waitress and she brought us ""new"" bacon. We said the fries were horrible too and she shrugged her shoulders. We said it was one of the worst meals we've ever had and that they were serving day old food and she responded ""well I brought you more bacon"" and then proceeds to give us a check with nothing taken off.

30,W S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,1,5.0,6/16/2018,"My wife and I have been eating and drinking at the Milton close to weekly for over a year now, so this review is long overdue. We live in the neighborhood and had been trying various places to find a regular, ""I don't know, what do you feel like eating?"" place. The food is kind of British/Irish-pub-themed, but very nicely executed -- and with some creativity-- for what it is. For example, the ""Irish Burrito"" puts Guinness-braised short rib, potato, carrots, etc. in a grilled tortilla to surprisingly good effect. The coconut curry chicken pot pie is nice, and they do wings in a Jameson and honey reduction that's just yum -- a great appetizer or late night snack (or meal if you're not too hungry). Oh, and great grilled cheese with tomato soup. But where the Milton really shines is in the drinking department. They have the requisite interesting cocktails, but the evening bar staff -- Matt in particular -- really knows how to pour a drink. We sometimes come before the evening crowd and they're always good company. There's also just a good, friendly vibe here overall. When we're at the bar we rarely have trouble striking up a conversation with other people, and the music is never too loud to talk (a major complaint of ours elsewhere). Don't get me wrong, it's not a quiet place, but it is a place you can go to enjoy the atmosphere and people. As long as we're in the area we'll keep coming back!",,,1

I sent them an email to let me know where and what type it was but it must be a secret because I haven't received a response from them. My friend had the cottage pie which they enjoyed. I had the fish and chips which is one of the better ones I have had in the city. My husband said it's not the same (as in the U.K.) but passable.  He had the half chicken which was VERY dry and salty. Service was fair. The rosé sangria was super sweet and off putting. Would I come back???Maybe for the cottage pie and that delicious blue cheese.",1,,

I felt like they were very average.The chicken sandwich was decent, though I felt like it was even a little bit on the salty side. It also was not a huge portion.The cottage pie may have been the best item, but it is also super rich and hard to get through, even with two people. The meat is cooked well and the flavors are there, it is just a very heavy and rich dish.Overall, this place serves up decent food, but it can be pretty heavy. The service was also not the most attentive as I think that they had one guy taking care of the whole afternoon crowd. Nevertheless, the outdoor seating provides a nice setting and the service was friendly.",3,2,1

Never have i ever had such good service in my life! the selection.. GREAT!! They have cold and hot selections, local cheeses, buffet style for all you buffet fiends (buffiends as i like to call them). !Ahhhhh. The bathrooms smell majestically disgusting. Although the acoustics i must say are simply magnificent. It's a great place to scream. However i would much rather have my waiter bring my libations and sustenance in there seeing as its a HELL OF A LOT BRIGHTER in there than in the restaurant itself.XOXOtracy",1,,

My husband and I split the shrimp ap which was so crunchy and well cooked it got us excited for dinner and our food at dinner was fantastic as well. He got the fish and chips and I got the beef dish. If I had to complain about anything it would be the fact that their ac was broken and it was about 100 degrees there even hotter because out food was hot.

We each got a drink and shared a few appetizers - they were all delicious! They have a few nights a week called ""Prohibition night"" and the staff dresses up reminiscent of the prohibition era and it is super fun to see!The vibe is very casual and hipster-esque but I would recommend it to anyone. I also had brunch here one morning and it was so good! I forgot what I ordered but we got there right as they opened and got to choose where we sat. It was still winter so the outdoor seating was closed so we sat at a high-top in the bar area. The waitress was very sweet and the food came as ordered.UPDATE: The other night I had the opportunity to sit outside and have a drink at Milton's ""patio"". It was very nice out and the cocktails were great! My friend for the ginger bee (gin, ginger, lemon juice and some other stuff) and I got the sangria (red wine, cognac?, others). I did not love my drink because of the added liquors but I would definitely recommend going here for a post-dinner drink if you are in the area. Their outdoor seating is lovely.",3,,

45,T K.,"New York, NY",13,108,0,2.0,7/6/2018,"Been here a couple of times before but it just keeps going downhill.  Last time the waitress was so new she told me they couldn't make a drink I requested. One that was hardly exotic. Ok fine she's new.  But tonight we came for food. Starved and hungry.  Such a disappointment.  Sadly the drink I requested last time (which turned out great), was now made by an amateur.  Not a good start. For food I had the fried chicken sandwich - which was adequate at best. It came with chips, but they seemed to be warmed up after being previously cooked - and with no taste.  Sadly the salt shaker didn't even work to help things along.  I was doomed to using ketchup with fructose syrup in it.  If I hadn't been starving I'd have gotten up and left. Prolly should have. I had asked the waitress for regular mayo and she said ok. When it came, it was malt vinegar mayo, which I had specifically requested to not have.  She didn't tell me and so I started using it. Good thing it wasn't an allergy I had.  Finally got the manager over to ask for mayo and he said they don't have any. Really???  He seemed surprised that I disliked malt vinegar mayo. Was a bit snarky I'd say.  My husbands hamburger was described as ""good"" but it was over cooked for medium and for what it was, expensive.  He said the chips were the worst. All in all, not even a passable meal for two starving people. Won't be coming back and definitely don't recommend.  (We did find it amusing that they pushed the bill on us to leave (not crowded) and didn't ask how the meal was. Think they might know",1,,1

I ate the top bun because I was hungry but nothing else.Our waitress never came by to check on us and when we finally found her we asked for the check. She came by and took the plates, noticed I hadn't touched my food at all, and didn't ask - was something wrong, do you want anything else else? - she took the food and gave us the check.

The staff, however, came off as unfriendly and overwhelmed. When we asked to move two tables together because we had a larger group, they seemed annoyed that we asked to do so. The service we received was a slow as well. Overall, The Milton was nice; however I wasn't very happy with the service - sub-par overall.

There is a lot of energy at the restaurant and it has a great vibe.All of the cocktails are amazing, you can't go wrong. Their dinner menu features rustic fare. The Cottage Pie is delicious, and my personal favorite is their chicken. The skin is perfectly crispy and the chicken is so juicy still. They serve it in the cast iron which is a nice touch. You can really taste the charred lemon and it adds a vibrant element to the dish. This is my go to, and it never has disappointed me. There is a lot of hype about the truffle nuggets, which I don't really understand. I am personally not a fan of chicken nuggets, and they reminded me of a slightly better version of McDonald's.

We had to flag the server down for silverware, we saw him bussing before he brought us our silverware while we had hot food waiting.

My fiancé got a mixed drink, French 92nd, which was so bad that she couldn't even finish it.  The reason for the bad rating was the horrible service. We were the first people sitting outside but it quickly filled up. At one point a bartender/waiter came outside with a huge tray of waters and proceeded to put it down on my table then hand them out to all of the other customers except us. Not sure what he had against us, but it seemed like a clear jab. There are tons of other great happy hr spots along 2nd so we won't be coming back to this place",5,5,1

57,Veronica O.,"Manhattan, NY",316,25,0,3.0,9/16/2018,"The Milton is my go to neighborhood hub. The ambiance is like an English pub brick wall with the back windows over looking tenement buildings which gives it an old New York feel. The food is good and the menu interesting but I find the food somewhat inconsistent. One day I could get a perfect Milton burger and the next time it is dry. One day I could get the Shepherds pie and it is perfect the next time it is soupy. The Milton salad is divine and always fresh so that is my go to most of the time. The cream puffs for dessert is always great as well. The servers are always friendly. The service is inconsistent as well. One day its prompt the next day you wait 15 minutes for a coffee. In the Summer the a/c is never good. I write this because I love this place and it has great potential, ambiance and menu. It seems like management can step up its game as far as continuity goes. Also the atmosphere is a friendly pub atmosphere where you would think to go for a nice cozy conversation. The music is always blasting most of the time rap which is also not conducive to the place. Light pop or classical at a low volume for the dinner hour. After 10 when the bar is popping throw up the music volume. I love this place and just would love management to be more aware of the customer experience and consistency a little more.",,,

The Milton has become my go to spot for drinks, food, and an overall great time and experience. I have already recommended it numerous times to friends for private events, dates, family dinners, and nights out.Everything I have tried on their menu is phenomenal; I have a particular soft spot for the Milton Wings and the Milton Salad. Both on point and delicious. The servers are always very attentive and incredibly friendly. I've also done brunch on a Sunday sitting outside which was lovely, and you can't beat getting a free drink with your entree! For nights out, the cocktails (and bartenders) are great. On top of that, in my experience, the staff has also been incredibly knowledgeable about their wines too, and I have never had a bad glass.10/10 would recommend-- hands down, my favorite spot on the UES.",1,,
62,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,4.0,6/10/2016,"This place isn't just your average Irish pub, it's a very cool upscale pub! Having been here before for just drinks, it has been on my radar to return after having seen the intriguing food menu, specifically truffle chicken nuggets. (Why yes, chicken nuggets are my favorite food)Also having loved the cocktail menu here in the past, I was excited to try some new drinks. I tried the Miltonian, and then had the Straw Sombrero. Both good, but the Straw Sombrero was amazing, and I would've had 5 more if they weren't $12/pop. Onto the food...the truffle chicken nuggets were amazing, as I thought they'd be. The yellow beet sweet & sour sauce was much tastier than I thought it would be and was my favorite of the 2 dipping options. I opted to top of my chicken appetizer, with a chicken entrée, and ordered the half roasted organic chicken, which was shockingly moist, tender and much tastier than I imagined, being at a pub-style restaurant. My boyfriend had the cottage pie, which was similar to a shepherd's pie, but made with short rib. Looked phenomenal, but I didn't try it! He enjoyed very much!The menu doesn't offer a huge selection of options, but definitely has some good comfort items available and I'd come back and try the burger sometime. They have a good amount of beer listed on the menu, lots in bottles/cans. Prices are a little high for the style of restaurant but they deserve it with the high quality of the food. The Milton for the win!",2,,2

66,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,4.0,3/10/2016,"Needed a yummy brunch place in the Upper East Side and this place sold me on the fact that a drink was included with the brunch entrée.  I made reservations on a Saturday at 1 and were seated with no issues. The restaurant itself had a nice rustic vibe. A good place to sit and catch up with friends and family. The service was really nice and we ordered the bloody marys which were nice and spicy, accompanied by two big olives which I loved. As for the food, my sister and I shared the Ploughmans brunch and Chef's masterpiece, ranging $15-17 which was a good deal considering the amount of food and it being accompanied with a drink choice. The Ploughman's brunch was presented beautifully and was equally delicious. The English muffins were toasted well, giving a good crunchy contrast to the two big slabs of cream cheese provided and the deep red heirloom tomatoes. The salmon was smoky and soft to the bite. It also came with raw red onion which I avoided just because I wanted to avoid onion breath for the remainder of the day but my sister had it with everything and it looked like a delicious addition. It also came with two deviled eggs. The yolk part was super creamy. A yummy nibble with the rest of the meal. As for the Chef's masterpiece, it was nice and buttery and came out piping hot. Baked eggs surrounded by bits of sausage, mushrooms and ricotta. Every bite was a nice surprise and complemented each other well. The toasted bread was also great to scoop up those eggs. Overall, everything was very good quality and full of flavor. Definitely recommended for a casual brunch try in the Upper East Side.",6,3,6

I've been here twice within the past few months, and the experience does not disappoint. Cocktails are pretty good and worth the price. Food I've ordered include the croquettes and the mac and cheese. Both were pretty solid, not too greasy or fatty.

They use Yukon gold potatoes and that in and of itself is the best thing ever!!!! The French fries are out of this world. For drinks, the autumn's domaine is comfortable and cozy, just like the establishment. It's Christmas morning in a glass. The walker drink is amazing and so are the lemon over basil and Newton's Apple. You cannot go wrong with letting the bartender fix you a drink based on your preferences.

The half price bottles of wine on Sunday nights unbeatable. With coincidence I call it a hidden, yet not so hidden gem!!!",,,

87,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,10/6/2015,"Wonderful new bar in Yorkville for a classy cocktail in a terrific setting. (yeah, it's been a while since it opened but I have been lazy catching up on my reviews to write)Pleasant date spot. Good for brunch, light dinner, or after work drinks.Attentive service and friendly bartenders.Some good craft type beers on tap, and a nifty cocktail list. They make a pretty decent spicy bloody mary here too.The menu consists of American, Irish and English influences. Quaint seating in the back dining area. Kind of a mix of Irish snug and British pub. Hey, clean bathrooms too! For the ladies, there are hooks under the bar top to hang bags and coats on. Bonus!Come in for a libation in the $11-$13 price range, and a pint will run you around $8 - $10 on the average. Funny, their cocktail prices are fairly priced, but the beers are maybe a dollar or two overpriced in my opinion. Also, they offer a happy hour on select drinks for $5 and bar snacks for $7 so there is that option to go easier on the wallet.Another win for the hood in an area that needs it during the 2nd Ave subway construction going on! Nice decor, ambiance, food, and staff. Great locals bar and they have some outside sidewalk seating too.",5,3,7

89,Yan L.,"Washington, DC",0,84,3,1.0,11/5/2017,"Don't really understand what the hype is all about. Food is very bland and service is horrible. We came in a little before noon and even though there were plenty of empty tables, we were told to sit at the bar in this very condescending attitude.  We found a new iPhone x brand new in its original product box on the bar next to us. So we gave it to the waitress and let her know that someone who had been sitting there probably had forgot it there. Instead of asking the bartender if he can locate the receipt for the last person sitting there, she just took it without a word to the back, not even a thank-you to us. There are plenty of places with better service and good nearby than this place. Also, if you accidentally left something valuable here, don't expect the waiters to watch your back.",3,2,

92,Amane E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/15/2018,"Really terrible experience, was first greeted by a waiter hasting us to be quick just upon sitting prior to even being given menus probably because it was towards the end of his shift when the restaurant didn't close for another three hours, we should've just been given another waiter and not felt rushed immediately upon sitting. Ordered the ""truffle ""chicken nuggets which didn't taste to have a hint of truffe in them - The cottage pie was my entree and was also mediocre, not a hint of salt and pepper and when I asked for salt and pepper I received McDonald's style salt and pepper, needless to say I didn't finish either meal. Watered-down cocktails that were not cold served in a glass that was warm from the dishwasher... all in all a $60 meal for what could have been instead 2 enjoyable slices of pizza next door.",,,

They have a very limited happy hour snack menu with deviled eggs, a flatbread, and chicken nuggets for I believe $7 each. The flatbread we had the other night had chopped sausage (even though the waitress told us when we ordered that it was marinara and cheese, and then incorrectly identified the chopped ingredient as mushroom), and it was pretty lackluster. I once had a bloody mary at brunch that was undrinkable - about half of the the glass was cracked peppercorn -- and when we complained about it they revealed that it was from a mix...er...not the best way to deflect criticism. On the other hand, I enjoyed the chicken pot pie at a recent dinner -- good flavor and lots of lean chicken in side. Service can be spotty.",1,1,
94,Irene Y.,"New York, NY",264,72,772,3.0,8/22/2016,"BRUNCH: Not typically busy on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30pm. Lots of outdoor and indoor seats. I like how the brunch menu has a lot of variety instead of your typical Eggs Benedict at every other brunch place. I opted in for the Chef's masterpiece (skillet eggs with breakfast sausage, goat cheese, and heavy cream -$18) --Super unique item, I have never seen many brunch places offer something like this. If you love cheese and cream, you can't go wrong with getting this to make your taste buds dance as you savor each individual bite and yearn for more. The two pieces of bread adds a great accent to dip into the creamy and cheesy eggs. However I have to complain about the portion of the food. Although it was made in a skillet, the layer of egg was very very thin & the sausages weren't packed on to fill up hungry bellies. For $18, I would at the very least expect to be full when I leave. DINNER: I got two appetizers for take out.-Truffle Chicken nuggets (Chicken, black truffle, yellow very sweet and sour sauce -$10) -Flatbread (herb pesto, grated Parmesan, cheese, radish -$10)After seeing the rave about the chicken nuggets, I had to try it and see what it is all about. I was actually slightly disappointed and did not taste the way I have envisioned it. I thought the truffle was mixed into the nuggets, but it is actually truffle sauce on the side. The chicken nuggets indeed have real chicken pieces and it is very crispy, but I don't think it is worth $10 for these chicken nuggets with truffle sauce since there are only 5 pieces. I might as well buy my own truffle sauce. In addition, the flat bread was also $10, but it is nothing to super rave about since it is only decent.",5,1,1

They have a great food and drinks menu. Good price for the amount you get. My favorite is the cottage pie. O. M. G. So good and extremely generous on the portion. Their drinks are just as great. My favorite is The Miltonian. I'm a sucker for gin based cocktails. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. If it wasn't for them, I would know they have live music on Mondays! They call it ""Prohibition Night."" Which in my opinion, is the best night to go. Great food, drinks, service and entertainment, what else could you ask for? Great times. A must for a date night or any occassion. A must try for sure.",1,1,
97,Lauren B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",542,152,314,5.0,10/13/2016,"We stumbled upon this place after he program we meant to go to at the 92nd St. Y was cancelled...and what a find.Each cocktail we had was delicious and well-balanced in its own way. The Miltonian (gin, elderflower, lemongrass, cucumber, egg white), Lemon Over Basil (lemon-basil gin, St. Germain, simple syrup), and the French 92nd (aperol, St. Germain, rose water, champagne) were all huge winners in our book, tantalizing our tastebuds how can I say...just right. Honestly, I can't even pick a favorite, they were all so exquisite and refreshing, well worth the $12-$13 a pop.The only one we didn't love was the pre-mixed Milton Pop-it's watermelon flavor was very watermelon, but too strongly sweet for our tastes, more watermelon syrup than fresh watermelon, so be forewarned!

102,Jennifer P.,"Long Beach, NY",264,274,130,5.0,6/30/2016,"This place is fantastic. The decor is so cozy that I could see myself in here on a Sunday morning (if I were to venture into a bar on a Sunday morning) but fun enough with a great crowd that would do justice to a Saturday night. The bathrooms are clean and very roomy.  This is one of those bars that is moody enough to make you feel very cool all the time. Now on to the actual drinks and food - WOW! Not your standard bar food. Not your average watered down or badly made drink. The bartenders  here definitely have the training and talent to make a GREAT drink. A bit on the strong side but entirely satisfying and always delicious. The service is quick and the whole staff is very attentive. I had a few different appetizers but what stands  out the most and has been haunting me with cravings since my last visit is the AMAZING chicken nuggets. These are a must. More than one order is enough and do not share with anyone!! These are the perfect consistency of crispy and juicy with that upscale truffle flavor and mouthwatering dipping sauces. If you order anything, just got for this and you will be satisfied enough. The owner came out and mingled with us for a while - excellent attitude with a lot of pride in his bar.

Order the vegetarian pot pie! It's to die for. The snack list has chicken nuggets that are only good bc of the wonderful beet sauce. We were there from 4-7 and never once were hassled or rushed out like most other venues. Super friendly staff.

106,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",913,269,1028,4.0,6/13/2016,"Came here with my boyfriend on Friday night for a late dinner and some drinks. We walked in and were lucky enough to be seated immediately (we happened to walk by again later in the night and it looked much busier so I think we must have just come at the perfect time). Our experience: The Food: Oh my god it was so good. We weren't super hungry so my boyfriend ordered an app (the beer battered shrimp with spicy mayo- $9) and I ordered a side (the mac and cheese- $8). My boyfriend's appetizer was pretty much the size that one would expect, with a handful of really tasty shrimp that were crispy but not too greasy or heavy. They were also served on a really cool stone platter thing that we agreed was a neat presentation for a simple app. My mac and cheese was MASSIVE. I saw other Yelpers' pics of it and it looked like a sizable portion but when I saw that it was only $8 and on the 'sides' part of the menu I figured the pictures must be deceiving, but no. My boyfriend helped me out quite a bit and we still didn't finish it. But god, it was good. It was so decadent and creamy and the gratin on top was nice. I joked to my boyfriend that I was probably going to have a heart attack later that night but it would be completely worth it because of how good the mac and cheese was. Highly recommend, and would come back for the mac and cheese alone. The Atmosphere: Good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The restaurant was darkly lit with candles on each of the tables. It made for a decent date spot. We were sat against a wall and close to the bar but shockingly it didn't feel cramped. The Drinks: Solid. My boyfriend had the Tiki Taka, which was rum, passionfruit puree, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and aperol served with flaming 151 in a lime. I had the Straw Sombrero, which had chipotle-infused tequila, strawberry syrup, lime, mint, and mezcal. They were also having specials on negronis (for national negroni week, I guess) where $1 from each was being donated to a charity. We enjoyed our drinks but decided to go elsewhere for a second round.The Service: I really, really wish I could say that our service was perfect because it started out that way. Our server, for the first part of our meal, was SO fast. It took me a couple minutes longer than my boyfriend to decide what I wanted to drink and the server came back in the perfect amount of time to get my drink order. She was super efficient with getting our food order into the system, and we received both drinks and food really quickly. Unfortunately, it took the most ridiculous amount of time for her to come back and clear our dishes. It must have been close to 25 minutes or so from the time we finished eating until she came back and we asked her for our check. My boyfriend commented on it when we left, and I defended her, saying that she may have been really busy, but he told me that he saw her at the bar talking to a coworker for most of the time. TL;DR: Almost 5 star material, but took off a star for the shoddy service. Would definitely return and get the mac and cheese again (mmm).",2,,3

108,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",824,153,147,4.0,4/20/2016,"Solid spot for food and/or drinks in Yorkville.I came here with a couple of friends earlier this month (4/1/16) for a casual dinner and some liquid persuasion to kick off the weekend.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience.The restaurant had a welcoming vibe, featuring a larger bar near the front, table seating towards the back, friendly staff members, and lively crowd.  We were able to grab a table in the dining area with little to no wait, and our server was highly attentive despite the restaurant being busy.The cocktails were very good.  The ""Long Day at the Office"" was a nice blend of bourbon and vermouth, and the ""Straw Sombrero"" had a favorable spice given the appropriate use of chipotle-infused tequila.  Extra credit goes to the bartender, who did an excellent job of preparing a somewhat rare off-the-menu cocktail for one of my friends.The food was great.  We started with the truffle chicken nuggets, and they were awesome.  I thoroughly enjoyed the cottage pie as an entrée, which included tasty Guinness-braised short rib.  Others at my table liked the deviled eggs, coconut curry chicken potpie, and their version of a Sloppy Joe called the ""Irish Joe.""I definitely recommend coming here for a casual dinner or drink.  Their brunch menu also looked appetizing, which I hope to try sometime soon!",7,3,4
109,Chris B.,"New York, NY",0,14,2,2.0,10/11/2017,"Food was OVERPRICED and UNREMARKABLE. $12 for 6 small sized wings. They weren't bad, just tiny and $2/each. Pretty ridiculous. Butternut Squash Flatbread was unremarkable. The Veggie Pot Pie was $18. Besides the fact that it was incredibly bland, it was a children's size portion. Again, for $18, ridiculous! I'm leaving 2 stars only because the wine bottles were 1/2 price with dinner. Totally not worth it since dinner was an way too expensive for what we got and complete bust... but it's a good concept. I live a few blocks away, been wanting to go for a while, feel ripped off and will not be back.",1,,

Updated review",Great atmosphere. I really like the setup of this place. It's good for a happy hour.I just can't get past how poor the service has been every time I've come in here. I came in recently for a drink and let my friends know I've had poor service before... and as soon as we walk in it took almost 10 minutes to get a hold of a hostess. I kept asking servers and the bartender if they could get someone to seat us and they were preoccupied with other things. I was a hostess for many years and it's important to have someone ready at the door. There were about 10 other people in the same boat as me.Also it would be nice if you could introduce some more gluten free options. Overall I do like this place and a nice environment but there are some areas that really need improvement.,,,
114,Zach W.,"Manhattan, NY",101,3,0,3.0,9/13/2017,"Bruh, you gotta get the cottage pie! When this thing comes out you won't be able to contain your salivary glands.

116,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",620,332,2371,4.0,3/2/2016,"The Milton is solid bar in the UES; a classy spot with exposed ceiling beams and bare brick walls, old timey cash register, crafted cocktails and a great selection of beers on tap. Walking into the place I was struck by how large the bar seemed in relation to the overall size of the place. The space really isn't that big, and yet they've made a point of extending the bar 2/3rds of the way down the place...good ratio if you ask me. We were lucky enough to grab a couple of stools right away, which turned out to be an American Gladiator-esque challenge if you showed up much later than 6 on the Friday we were there. The place was jamming, and the space is narrow. The last thing I'll note, about the bar which seems trivial (but I find pretty awesome) is that there appears to be plugs by the coat hooks. Now I didn't try one out, but if they work it'll mean I can sip a drink and be on my phone all day, thus avoiding having a conversation with whomever I am with. Win win (kidding, but it's a solid feature at any bar). We were greeted by one of the two bartenders working, who seemed exceptionally friendly (always a nice touch), and ordered up a round of drinks; a bubbly pear (green pear, tarragon, gin, lemon juice and a champagne float), and a Sixpoint Bengali on tap. I will say that the bubbly pear was delightful and not crazy at 12$, but the Sixpoint seemed a bit steep at 8$ (no happy hour the night we were there), but it is the Upper East Side and this place is absolutely has a high end feel to it; these things are to be expected. We chatted for a while over a drink or two, and I couldn't help but notice the rather large TV hanging in the corner. I couldn't help but reminisce about living near the Black Swan in BK, and if this place is anything like it, I am sure they blast Barclays Premier League games on the weekends...which I will 100% stop by to see. Think the next time I come though, it'll be for dinner; love a place that has curry and fish and chips, it means that the chief probably knows what he is doing. Overall this seems like a great place to come in for a pint or two and have some finger food at the bar, which is always OK in my book.",16,14,15

I was not able to try any of the drinks this time, but each one my husband ordered looked amazing and smelled great. Very light, spring, & tropical perfect for a warm evening. We started off with Truffle chicken nuggets(to die for) and the spring vegetable flat bread(yum) both were stop on and tasty. For our main course my husband and I both decided on the steak and chips while sharing an order of the Brisket Mac. First and foremost the portions were surprisingly generous for the price. We were able to finish the Mac, nor was I able to finish my steak even though it was heavenly. From the moment I stepped in until we left it was a great experience all around.

123,Deanna Z.,"Long Island, NY",26,38,110,2.0,5/6/2016,"I came here once before with friends for brunch and I actually really enjoyed it. Service was great, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food was pretty good... But oh man. My recent experience here was a disaster. I came for lunch on a Wednesday with my mom, brother, and boyfriend. We got there around 2:30, were greeted promptly (as we were the only ones in there) and were told to pick any seat we'd like. Cool. My brother was meeting us, so we were waiting on him to get there before we ordered our food. We were informed at 2:40 that the kitchen closes promptly at 3... Not a problem. My mom immediately pointed out that she thought our waitress was grumpy. Her service wasn't HORRIBLE, but it definitely wasn't pleasurable. She didn't check on us often, which was odd because, like I said, we were the ONLY table in the restaurant. Call me crazy, but it's always nice when you finish your drink and your server asks if you'd like another... instead of having to wave her over 20 minutes after you finished it. We thanked her every time she bought a drink or our food over, but not ONCE did we hear a ""you're welcome"" or any kind of response to the 30+ ""thank yous"" she received-- which came off as extremely rude. The entire time we felt as if we were bothersome, which is never a nice feeling.The lunch menu is limited, but the food is pretty good. I got the tomato soup/grilled cheese combo which I enjoyed and split the burger with my boyfriend. We asked for the burger to be cooked medium, it was very rare. My brother ordered the burger also, cooked medium, and it was rare as well. My mom ordered the cottage pie which is a huge portion and everyone really liked it. Personally, I think the truffle nuggets are over-rated, but the dipping sauces are pretty good. I had such a great experience here during brunch, it's a shame the service was so bad the next time around. We just felt uncomfortable being there and wanted to get the hell out. The food would've made this review a 3.5, but the service was just unacceptable. I understand the place was closing for dinner and that might have had something to do with the bad service, but we were out of there by 3:15. I probably won't come here again.",1,,
124,Maryann S.,"San Francisco, CA",207,267,415,4.0,12/12/2016,Ducked in here for a quick drink after an event and it's a great option if you're in the area. Drinks are yummy but not super strong. I ordered the Miltonian which was very light and refreshing. Ambiance and service was great! Cozy and very friendly. We walked in around 10p and were able to get seated immediately. At first we just wanted to grab a drink before heading home but everything on the menu looked enticing so we couldn't resist. We ordered the cottage pie and it was huge! Glad we decided to share. So much cheese on the mashed potatoes omg and the braised beef was super tender and flavorful. What a lovely surprise for a spur of the moment decision!,4,2,2

126,Khalil M.,"Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan, NY",82,46,56,4.0,8/1/2016,"This is one of the newer trendy spots. My friends have come here a few times, told me their food is really good. There is plenty of space so if you're bringing a large group, it won't feel crowded.I ordered the Milton burger which tasted really good. It was cooked exactly the way I ordered it, medium, was not too dry at all-which is what a lot of places end up doing. It came with cheddar cheese, Lettuce tomatoes and onions- there was no one overwhelming flavor everything was in the right portion. It came with a side of french fries which were also pretty good-some spots either burn the fries or make them too dryMy friend ordered the mac'n cheese which he said was one of the best mac n' cheese he's ever had, another ordered grilled cheese with tomato soup which was also very good. They also recommended their cocktails, don't recall the exact names but one had basil and gin which my friend enjoyed a lot I recommend this place, good atmosphere, food and service. -The Milton Burger -Mac n'cheese",,,
127,Brianna E.,"New York, NY",626,84,160,5.0,1/3/2016,"Just thinking about this place makes me happy inside! Weird, but true. As soon as you walk in, you feel at home. Not only is this place presentable from the outside- it is so cozy and fun on the inside. For dinner, we started with the truffle chicken nuggets - if you like truffle and or chicken- YOU MUST TRY THESE. We shared the Half Roasted Organic Chicken ($18) & the Milton Salad ($14). I have to admit, the mash potatoes served with the chicken might be the best I have ever had! The chicken was phenomenal and the salad was a great pairing. Everything was fresh, seasoned to perfection and brought out in a timely manner. I wish I could remember our waitress' name because she was the BEST!! If you can't pick a cocktail, like me, do the Bartender's Tale (I think that's the name), where you say what taste you want and they work their magic to create it! I said a sunrise in my mouth & that's what I got :) Small downsides : we couldn't add chicken to the salad (that's what our initial plan was) and they were out of fish and chips. But no biggie- what we got was even better!!",3,,2
128,Melissa V.,"San Francisco, CA",70,106,20,4.0,8/17/2017,Very good food and a good atmosphere. The prices are a bit steep but the food makes up for it. The best time is brunch time. The seating outside on the sidewalk is also definitely a plus during the summer months.,,1,
129,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,4.0,1/5/2015,"This is a nice, cozy brunch place. When we came around noon, there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant so got a table immediately. It started to fill up after a while but still wasn't super busy like some places are. The food is excellent. I had the Chef's Masterpiece (skillet eggs with sausage, goat cheese and heavy cream) - delicious and not so huge that you go into a food coma afterwards. The presentation of the food is beautiful, too. I also had coffee and a cocktail called Brunch Punch. The drinks aren't too strong but they're good. Prices are not cheap but they're fairly comparable to other brunches in the city. You get one complementary beverage with your meal, but if you want coffee/tea AND a cocktail then, sadly, only one of those is free. I kind of wish it was a complementary cocktail PLUS tea/coffee but if you only plan on getting one of those drinks then it's a good deal.",3,,
130,Nina L.,"New York, NY",541,717,153,4.0,3/19/2016,"Notably excellent service, warm and inviting atmosphere, (mostly) tasty and imaginative menu...The Milton has all the makings of the perfect neighborhood spot, which in my opinion, it is!I came here with some pals on a Saturday night, at 10pm the bar and all the back-of-house tabletops were full. The crowd was a perfect mix of younger and older locals and not a shred of pretension was in the air. It felt more like a your living room occupied by a large group of strangers than an actual bar/restaurant. We ordered a handful including mixed drinks, an appetizer, salad, and an entree and were all-in-all impressed at the quality for pub fare. There's a bit of fusion/confusion happening with the menu considering the Milton has both Irish and British roots with a splash of New American-esk dishes but the food was still solid. Of everything we tried most notable was the mac and cheese pie which had a marvelous flavor and was rich and plentiful. It's places like this that the Upper East Side needs to continue it's growth and it's business owners like them that make going for some simple bar food just all the more pleasant.",1,,

He made wrong drinks and couldn't be bothered assisting other patrons at bar.He was very nice, and good when you could get his attention away from the game....The food was good, the ambiance was nice and we will definitely go back; just not when that one bartender is on duty.",,,

134,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,5.0,10/29/2015,"Truffle chicken nuggets: so good that we paused in the middle of the first order to get a second round. Even before the pink slime fiasco, I wasn't too crazy about McDonald's' chicken nuggets, but how could anyone not love these beauties? Deep fried to a deep brown crisp and accompanied by a garlicky ranch dressing, totally worth the hike up Second Avenue in all its current stages of utter demolition. I suppose if you had to, you could lump The Milton's vittles into pub food, but everything we ordered went above your average limp mozzarella sticks and potato skins. The coconut chicken pot pie came with a little hat of flaky, croissant-like bread. I sampled some of my friend's cottage pie - braised short ribs, mashed potato, cheese, otherwise known as winter hibernation food. But my boyfriend's burger took the cake: as I was eating it, I kept thinking to myself how, in a true fit of gluttony, I would not be above taking the French fries, er, chips, and mashing them inside the burger.  I also ate most of the Knickerbocker glory, even though I never thought the combination of strawberry marmalade and ice cream would pair so well. NEXT TIME: more of the fizzy pear drink, more of the chicken nuggets, more of the burger, and maybe the Milton kale salad because, you know, ""health.""",27,16,23

The Milton provided just the environment I wanted to celebrate in: a warm and friendly environment that wasn't overly crowded, sold good liquor at a good price, and had some bomb cast-iron skillet mac and cheese!I am but a simple woman...I do love visiting bars / restaurants above 86th Street on the east side; Happy Hour crowds usually don't make this area of a city a post-work destination, which I love. More for me! Ha! I arrived at The Milton around 6 p.m. on a Tuesday and while there were people, we could all be seated at the bar comfortably. As friends arrived and gathered, we snagged one of the high-top tables by the entrance. We enjoyed good Happy Hour Specials: ALL cocktails on their menu were $8 until 7! Keep The Heid, with Rooibus tea-infused scotch and fruit juices, was popular among my friends! The Newton's Apple, with apple juice and Four Roses Bourbon, was also a hit. Being my birthday, I felt intrigued to try the Bartender's Tale; it's up to the bartender what you get! I told him my aversion to egg whites (for health reasons) and anything spicy (because I can't stand the heat!), and I got a light and lovely strawberry-based vokda concoction. Some friends got their wings, and I heard nothing but good things! My beau is a wings snob, and he almost bought a second plate, he loved them so much! Some friends I split the mac & cheese, and it is LEGIT! It was creamy and a bit smoky, topped with crisp garlicky breadcrumbs. I'm in love with this place! It's got the right vibe! I had such a wonderful low-key post-work birthday celebration - honestly, all I ever wanted this year - and I can't wait to return in the future for some very pleasant Happy Hours.",3,2,3

I wasn't a fan of the batter--the fish does get soggy as mentioned by other Yelpers, and then everything gets a little hard to work with. My companion (LB) also wanted to order some scotch, but each one he picked seemed to be out of stock. After about four tries, I was hoping the bartender would just suggest one and get it over with, but then it turns out he found a bottle of one of the first ones we asked for. I'm not saying this is a big deal, just something that I wish would have happened haha.But everyone was really nice, the space was great (even decorated for halloween), and I plan to come back someday to try those nuggets...",4,,

(The place I wanted to go to had a two hour wait).The space is cute: dark, cozy. We started with the avocado toast-- good, not great. I always feel like restaurants over mash the avocado and neglect to add easy ingredients that would elevate the toast, i.e. Garlic, red pepper flakes. Overall, the avocado toast was alright-- the fried egg helped. I got the chefs masterpiece-- it's a skillet dish with eggs, goat cheese, cream, and peas. The flavors were good, but the eggs were totally cooked by the time they got to the table. Personally, I think baked egg dishes should have over easy eggs. My boyfriend got the ham and grilled cheese. It was pretty good. It was a tasty grilled cheese with two sunny side up eggs on top. Overall, it was a decent brunch for popping into a random restaurant.",,,

There were two girls sitting right beside us who had been there well over an hour and were really upset about being there over an hour of being there and didn't receive their food. My boyfriend decided to go inside and get the check we didn't even bother waiting anymore.

It sounds like a super heavy meal and yes it is a little more than a salad but the way they make it at the Milton is very fresh, and just delicious so you don't come away in a food coma! A side of mushy peas finishes the dish perfectly and adds a serving of fibre which is most welcomed!! I have been here multiple times and every time the comfort and ambience of this well presented bar/restaurant is great. I have only been at lunchtime and keep meaning to get there in the evenings as the beer choice is great and they have some delicious looking cocktails.

154,Simone W.,"Bronx, NY",28,3,1,4.0,1/24/2018,"I actually stumbled upon The Milton while I was in the area. I went around 9 p.m. on a Saturday with my mother and we were seated immediately in the back at a table for three. I appreciated the ambiance in the restaurant. It was pretty dark besides the necessary bar and kitchen lights. There were individual candles on every table which contributed to the vibe. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant, I wish I got her name. She came to the table to check in at least three times. When it came time to order drinks, we each wanted two glasses of wine each, one red and one white and she was knowledgeable on the various brands offered on the menu. In addition, when our food came out, my side dish was not brought out right away. I just thought it was late but she was very honest and said it was accidentally brought to the wrong table, so she'd take it off the bill. Great experience and a calm date night spot. The portions are on point as well. Only reservation is that there are no vegan options and only one vegetarian option-  their flatbread which is pretty popular. Obviously if a person has dietary restrictions they should do their research before going to an establishment but at the same time, it's 2018 in NYC, shouldn't every restaurant perfect at least ONE vegan entree? just my opinion. Def recommend this spot thought.",,,

161,S S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,15,10,5.0,5/18/2017,"Milton has now become our favorite place to go for mouth-watering food that's cooked to perfection and taste, along with their own recipe of cocktails that are so tasty you wouldn't even know it's an alcoholic drink. We moved here from midtown last summer and didn't know anything in the neighborhood. We decided one day to go here and ended up at Milton. The two main reasons that make a dinner/drinks experience special and memorable is customer service the min you walk in and then the quality of the food. Milton goes above and beyond that. The manager/own (not sure what his title is) is always so polite, courteous, and looking out how to make this experience for the customer nicer and more memorable. The servers are all nice, attentive, smile and make you feel comfortable. Not like other places where the servers look like they don't even want to be there, and they just want their tip and that's it. So far I can say I've never had a bad experience at the Milton and whoever I take there wants to go back there whenever they come to visit. There was a small incident at the bar that happened though. Can't say it's Miltons fault but more so the Bartenders fault who was working that day. He seemed like a new worker, a little too much into his looks and flirting with two girls at the bar. We had just gotten home from work and decided to go to the Milton quickly for a beer to unwind and then back home. So we sat at one of the high-top tables near the bar and I went over to the bar to get beers. I saw the bartender getting his condiments ready for the night while trying to pick up two girls at the bar. I waited patiently for him to finish his conversation with the girls and whatever he was organizing in his condiment tray. After he was done, he just started doing some other chore and totally ignoring me. There were only 3 other people at the back apart from me. The two girls he was flirting with and another gentleman at the other end. So, for him to not see me at an open bar with no other clients is a little hard to believe. At one point he walked right in front of me and still ignored me. After 5-7 min of standing like an idiot, I was about to head back home and was actually a little sad that in nearly a year this was the first bad experience I had at the Milton. Luckily as I was walking back to the high top table a server stopped me and asked have I been helped and she ended up serving us. So like I said, the bad experience isn't necessarily Miltons fault but rather the bartender who couldn't stop being horny at work and was more interested in picking up girls rather than doing his job. I haven't seen him since then so not sure if they fired him or he quit, but Milton is still our favorite to go place for food and drinks and I love all the servers and management there. I've had their burgers that are freshly made, not that frozen crap. Ck Curry pot pie is my Fav ! it's kind of a Thai taste to it but a pot pie with a thin flaky crust on the top. Thier shepherds pie is my families fav, it's served with mashed potato. I've also tried their half roast ck which comes with mashed potato and green beans I think. It's so juicy and flavorful. Fish and chips is another fav here. I can go on and on...I'm telling you.....you can close your eyes and order whatever and it's all so good and flavorful. OOOOH you have to try their truffle ck nuggets. We usually get that as an Appetizer. It's amazing! Note to the Management and staff: Please don't stop smiling and being courteous to the customers. it's the small attention to details and service that brings us back to the Milton, along with the great food and fun times!",,,

I ordered the fish and chips and the coconut chicken curry pot pie. The fish was not that crispy, it was soggy and I did not finish it because of that. The pot pie was amazing, it was a Thai fusion dish and I cleaned the plate! I also ordered two drinks, they were strong so you do get your bang for your buck given that drink prices were $$. One thing that I did not like during this visit, the waitress kept coming back to my table to clean things off when I was not done. She came to my table 3 times within a span of 20 mins asking if I was done with my dish, which was very annoying because I was clearly still eating. Nothing too special about this place... Not amazing but not too bad to give it a shot.",2,3,
166,Jason F.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",31,6,0,2.0,5/28/2017,"No good for brunch, better for dinner. Over cooked eggs and bacon that was so hard it shouldn't have been served. Too bad, as we like this place.",,,
167,Ricky H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,12,0,4.0,7/2/2017,"Had brunch there earlier today and was pleased. The service was good, the food came out fairly quick and was tasty.

Stopped at a place a few doors down but they only had bison so came here.  Moderately crowded around 7pm on a rainy weeknight.  I sat  at the bar.  Service was ok but as the other reviewers have said, the bartenders concentrate on making drinks and bantering with regulars.I had the wings which had a Jameson Whisky type of sauce that had great flavors. Wings could have been meatier but were ok.Had a burger with house made chips (fried potatoes).  Was a solid burger and fries were above average.Ambiance was a homey little bar with class.  Would return.",,,
169,Lia S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,44,4,3.0,9/17/2016,"Food - 4 starsService - 2 starsI came here last weekend for a late dinner. We split the fish and chips with a side of kale. The fish and kale were really good, the 'chip' we're just okay, but that can be forgiven.I had a cocktail and enjoyed it. Forgot which one.The service was pretty bizarre. We walked in without a reservation and asked about a table for two. They said ""sure"" and led us to the back of the restaurant. Then we bumped in another employee who said, no we're full back here. These tables are reserved. Ooookay. They offered the bar and we said okay, but it wasn't actually part of the main bar.  It was next to the waiters station. Apparently this is a no man's land, because instead of one assigned waiter, we had a bazillion people asking us questions and checking up on us. It was confusing and very disruptive. One of the waiters also fed us a sob story about why are drinks were taking so long by pointing at the bar. I guess they aren't used to being busy on a Saturday night?Overall, food was good but with so many other options, I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon.",,,

I had an amazing server named Mary who was so thoughtful, considerate and funny. She's quite a catch for a lucky man. And a top notch server to boot. The vibe and outdoor seating were absolutely perfect. A server named Julia also assisted. Overall great experience, would recommend, will be coming again.",,,
172,Valerie H.,"New York, NY",172,45,9,5.0,6/26/2016,Super friendly and great service. The decor is extremely cute with a lot of natural sunlight and there is some outdoor seating which is great during the summer. Brunch includes a complimentary drink which is nice. I ordered the grilled cheese with ham and fried egg which was absolutely delicious! Also for $14 in the upper east side you can't go wrong! Their cocktails are also very yummy and affordable (about $10 each). I will definitely be back!,1,,
173,Tyler S.,"New York, NY",11,12,4,5.0,5/2/2017,"Best cocktails in the city! My favorite is the Lucky Walker, a spicy chipotle-infused vodka with lime and mint. A great place to bring a date!",,,

Our food was also delicious- between us we had the fried chicken sandwich, deviled eggs, burger, and the cottage pie. We all loved what we ordered. I live in Brooklyn so the UES isn't my hood, but I will be sure to come to The Milton again if I'm in the neighborhood and will definitely suggest it to friends.",,,

The Tiki Taka tasted really good. For food, I had beer batted shrimp and a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. The beer batted shrimp is somewhat spicy and tasty. The grilled cheese sandwich was soooo good I ordered another plate. Absolutely delicious. I could have done without the tomato soup. The service was good. After work crowd. The only complaint I have is the music choice. I need upbeat music during happy hour not somber soft rock.",,,
176,Alexis B.,"Newport, Berlin Charter Township, MI",0,3,0,5.0,2/28/2017,Stopped in tonight for dinner. I thought it looked like a good place to have some classic bar food and boy was I surprised. Julia was my waitress and suggested a beer to go along with the special you guys had tonight. She definitely sold me on both considering I just wanted a plain old cheeseburger and a corona. She was great! Fried shrimp sandwich! It was amazing! You should put it on your regular menu!,1,,
177,Claire F.,"Manhattan, NY",4,27,0,4.0,3/27/2016,"I came here twice, for dinner and brunch. Service, food and drinks were great both times!On a Saturday night, I went around 7:45pm. I had a reservation so I was seated immediately, it wasn't too packed though. The cocktail list is cool, so I found myself trying a few. The Snow Pumpkin was my favorite but the other one I had, Luckey Walker was also great. In terms of food, I just did a few apps to share. The Pork Belly was outstanding. The Chicken Nuggets were also delicious. The deviled eggs were good but nothing to write home about. Mac and Cheese was yummy, I ended up bringing some home and enjoyed it the next day. I went yesterday for brunch as well. My boyfriend and I were starving so we ordered the eggs benedict and grilled cheese sandwich to go half and half on. It was ... so decadent. It was really yummy but we couldn't even touch the potatoes served with it because it was filling. Had to go lay down afterwards, especially pairing it with a mimosa. Looking forward to my next meal here!",1,1,1
178,Jon R.,"Manhattan, NY",91,24,0,4.0,5/31/2016,"My Fiance and I love this place.Atmosphere: Very homie. Not like ""Homie doesnt play that"" but veeeeery comforting, very cozy. The lighting is just right. Dimmed enough to provide that subdued relax feeling, but light enough to see the entire room no matter where you are, but more importantly, light enough to see the person you are there with (Unless you're alone, inwhich case, that's also cool)Look the brick walls. Place has a Brooklyn feel to itFood: Love the food. Our go to is ALWAYS the Grilled cheese and tomato soup. SO BEYOND GOOD. you talk about comfort meal, it's that. The Organic chicken is really good too. I recently tried the coconut curry chicken pot pie and it's soooooooo good. very filling without a doubt. Suggestion: Add more wings to make it a meal bc the ""Milton Wings"" are beyoooooooooooooond good. Crispy with the right amount of sweetness that it's not like candy. Omg mouth dripped just thinking of itDrinks: I cant say much bc i have 1 go to drink there and the name slips my mind. I think it's called Long day at work or something like that. Bourbon drink. Very good. Actually, now that i think about it, i think i may go this weekend just to have some.All in all it's a fantastic place. place you can take a date or a friend. It's one of those places you want to go to for a relaxing evening. Maybe see a movie after or netflix it at home.",,,1

For weekend brunch, they have outdoor seating during the warmer months, and it's a great deal (most entrees $13-16 and comes with free mimosa/bloody mary/coffee!). It's also a solid bar with great cocktails, and they get a good crowd on the weekends.",5,1,1

186,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",252,505,1,4.0,1/14/2016,"I've been to The Milton a few times now and it took me until this last time to be convinced that I like it.  It is clearly well designed and they have created a nice atmosphere for a pub...it's an upscale pub really.  I guess I was unconvinced at first because the food was heavy and my girlfriend was meh to the experience.  That said I knew I liked something about Milton and now after having gone back with friends a few times, I've decided this is a great spot for grabbing a drink and a bite.  The menu allows you to dabble or order a full meal, which is great for groups who want flexibility.  This isn't a sports bar, but they have a enough TV's to appease someone needing to watch a game.  Overall, if anything, having a beer and the fried shrimp is worth a stop.  I live up directly up 91st from the bar, so I see it making it into a more regular rotation for me.",2,,1

There's plenty of table seating if you can't get a seat at the bar, and it's no problem if you only order drinks.I got the Bartender's Tale, which is basically a surprise drink based on your mood. I said I wanted a tart tequila drink, and got a margarita-esque cocktail in return. I really enjoyed it. My friend got an Old Fashioned, which she said was a bit watered down.Would definitely come back again!",,,

For $12: got the Milton Salad and a complimentary cup of coffee (I got the bloody mary as well, which would have qualified, but they assumed the coffee as the free portion, oh well). Salad was crunchy with bacon and had just enough blue cheese to offset the kale. Drinks were decent but could have been a bit stronger (coffee and cocktails).Service was quick, but it was empty, so not sure on a busy day. If you want a straight forward brunch where you can hear people talk, then this is a great bet.",1,,

198,Mrs. P.,"New York, NY",0,52,0,4.0,11/14/2016,"I've ordered in from the Milton several times, but finally had the opportunity to go there for brunch this weekend. The Milton is one of several new places popping up on the Upper East side that have a decidedly ""hipster"" vibe, and bring a welcome breath of fresh air to the traditionally stodgy and boring eateries in the area. The menu was intriguing, but very limited. When we've ordered dinner from them, my husband has enjoyed their Irish Joe and their Cottage pie. For me, with a gluten problem, I've only had the opportunity to try the crab deviled eggs (DELICIOUS) and their burger (no bun). For delivery, the food was good, but I could tell it isn't their comfort zone, so was excited to eat there in person.The brunch menu is almost as limiting for those of us with gluten issues as the dinner menu, but the waitress was great about adjusting my order. I got the Eggs Benedict (no toast) over a salad. WOW!!! The salad dressing was very flavorful, and the eggs were poached perfectly. The price point is pretty high for what it is though - and I'm sorry... people need to stop encouraging this avocado toast phenomena. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE avocado. I love the idea of it on toast. I whole-heatedly oppose charging $10 for it. Even if avocados are a whopping $5/ piece at grocery stores, there is no way this makes fiscal sense. The true star of the dining experience was the cocktail menu; not only were the drinks delicious, but they were also reasonably priced (for the area). If you are a vodka fan, you MUST try the Lucky Walker. I regret that I didn't order this until my second round, since 1 of these was not enough, and I didn't want to get sloppy drunk at 1pm on a Saturday (I know, adulting is hard), but I wanted to order at least 10 more of these.I'm excited to go back again soon, in spite of their limited GF menu, the vibe and cocktails make this someplace I plan on spending a lot of time.",2,,
199,Stephen B.,"Manhattan, NY",16,45,11,3.0,3/22/2016,"I want to love it here and part of me really does. The ambiance is amazing and everything I've had off the menu is fabulous. Probably the best burger on the UES (when they have the challah buns but not when they substitute it for brioche and don't tell you). The problem here is the service is SUPER spotty, to the point where it can sometimes be downright awful - I've been when it's empty and had trouble getting a bartender to even look at me. I get it that it's a craft cocktail bar and I get that drinks will take a long time to make. What I don't get is being ignored, sitting at a bar for up to 8 minutes before being acknowledged. It really bothers me when I have to physically accost someone in order to pay my overpriced tab! The food and drink are good enough to where I'll most likely be back. The service can often be good too - I just wish it was a bit more consistent because I'd love to give the Milton 4 or 5 stars!",,,
