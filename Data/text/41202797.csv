0,Dave S.,"Chinatown, Vancouver, Canada",0,2,0.0,5.0,10/1/2018,We came on a Monday for Happy Hour & sat at the bar. Nice ambiance and a good beer selection. The bartender was friendly and the music was on point. I'd come again.,,,
1,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",362,209,333,4.0,9/29/2018,"Solid bar, with great space in the LES if you have a group with you.Good choice of drinks, and the vibe is super chill.I love the open windows, how can you not?This is a great place if you just need to escape the crazy New York scene and grab a beer.I haven't tried any of their little bites, but I'll definitely give them a go in the future.4.4/5",,,
2,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,4.0,5/20/2018,"Marshal Stack is a really solid bar with a great Happy Hour. I always have a good time here. The vibe is really decent even on Friday and Saturday nights which is hard to come by in the area, since it seems to be so overrun with college kids these days. I love that they have cider on draft and a ton of really great beer and wine options. They also serve small bites here like slider, tater tots and more. My one recommendation would be to skip the wine. I ordered a glass of white one day and was pretty shocked to get the smallest wine pour i've ever seen. I'm talking 4 sips and it was gone....Stick to beer and cider and you are all good. Marshal is cash only hit the ATM before you arrive. Great LES spot overall.",,,1
3,Rae Lynne K.,"Brooklyn, NY",183,436,128,3.0,8/13/2018,"My friend and I were looking for a place to have a quick drink before dinner and we came into this little bar on the corner. The menu was written old school on a chalk board and kinda hard to see. We opted for a glass of rose each. The bartender was super sweet, she kept us company while we were catching up. The bar was super loud with people and music, a little too loud for my taste. And the rose was good. It was by far the most expensive glass of rose I've ever had. $22/glass! I overheard the girls next to us talking about a quick bite but we didn't have any food on our visit. If you're looking for a place to chill that's loud and noisy this place is for you. The service is great at the bar.",,,1
4,Sam S.,"New York, NY",255,73,6,4.0,9/21/2018,"Cute little neighborhood bar with a good happy hour deal and a nice retro vibe. Love the jukebox when you walk in, and the variety of on tap beers. They're all a little different/ out of ordinary which makes it cool to come here and try a few new beers. The seating is open and the location is ideal in the LES. Definitely will be coming back here.",,,
5,Laura K.,"New York, NY",143,79,60,5.0,9/20/2018,This is a great neighborhood bar. They have a chill vibe with good happy hour deals and lots of options for draft beers! We went in on a Friday evening and it wasn't crammed at all with lots of tables and room at the bar. I would highly recommend stopping by this spot,,,
6,Jiahui L.,"Manhattan, NY",32,355,40,5.0,3/24/2018,"Excellent selection of beers, including evil twin IPA kolada and mil house cucumber cream ale! Spicy nuts were 3 stars, decent but wouldn't get again.Service is awesome. As long as it's on draft, they're good about letting you sample. Space is great as well, with plenty of windows and natural lighting during the day",,,
7,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2209,8238,4.0,4/21/2017,"Very cool place.  Came here post brunch on a Sunday afternoon with friends.  They had a nice beer selection and everything was discounted!   The place still smelled like brunch, but that wasn't bad.  The windows were open and the weather was nice so it was a pleasant experience.It was lively but not overly loud so you could still have a conversation with your friends.  Bartenders were friendly and fast.  It is definitely worth a visit.",9,3,4
8,Jessica C.,"Princeton, NJ",313,409,682,4.0,1/21/2018,"I came here on a Saturday night with a big group of friends. It's hard to find a ""normal"" bar with reasonable prices in NYC, but Marshall Stack is exactly that! The drink and food menu is found in the blackboards above the bar. There are a few varieties of wine available but it seems like there is a decent selection of beer (on tap and bottle). There is a $15 minimum on credit card.",3,,
9,Jedsada Y.,"East Elmhurst, NY",282,491,1567,4.0,4/7/2018,"Good beer bar in LES with happy hour everyday. $2 off draft beers and $5 house wine. Just be careful when you order Sauvignon Blanc, which is not ""HOUSE WINE"", that will cost you $10 a pop!",,,
10,Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,255,104,4.0,10/29/2017,"This place has a large beer menu. I don't drink beer but they also had a great selection of hard ciders for me to choose from. This place primarily serves beer and wine, but they had a mead on the menu as well. The bar is chill, inviting, and intimate. The bartender is super friendly. They have the perfect bar foods, like tatter tots, wings, and grilled cheese. I would definitely come here again.",2,1,1
11,Joe H.,"New York, NY",1,13,0,5.0,7/3/2018,"I always try to make it out for happy hour on Fridays when I need to kill time before dinner and it never disappoints. There's always a great rotating draft beer collection and limited edition cans on hand for the beer snub in your crew. There's also a decent food menu for snacking and it's always pretty fast service. I love the bartender that's there on Friday's, she's always friendly and patient when you taking a bit too much time. Chill bar, always.",,,
12,Michael H.,"Chicago, IL",473,643,393,5.0,9/21/2017,"Literally stumbled into this joint and I'm glad I did!  First off, great draft list.. everything from Alpine to Pipeworks and of course Local brews.  I traveled all over the place and did not see any Chicago beers represented properly; no not Goose Island.. sorry!  They also had Alpine on the line; this is a relatively obscure west coaster & also something I did not see anywhere else.  The place is cozy, the music is exceptional & the bartender was great; why leave?  Maybe the only reason would be cash only & no liquor is served here.... other than that I don't see a reason.  Friendly locals and good food really round it out.  Must stop in The Lower East Side/ talk later PS- Check out the Marshall Fridge!",6,5,6
13,David V.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,30,0,1.0,9/3/2018,Exceptionally rude bartender last night. And I am someone who has always gotten along with a bartender - it's not hard. Definitely will not be back and will discourage everyone I know from going,,,
14,Rodolfo D.,"New York, NY",258,83,75,2.0,8/11/2017,"Kind of low key for a Friday night in the LES. Perhaps that has to do with the calibur of service...All I gotta say here is that the bartender was pretty rude. I respect that fact that there were other customers to serve, but when I ask ""What do you recomend?"" and you simply turn and walk away from me....screw you. Not coming back. End of story.",2,1,
15,Kelly G.,"Plano, TX",7,1,1,5.0,3/10/2018,"A little pricey but great atmosphere and friendly bartenders. Wine selection is decent, and high end.",,,
16,Colin K.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",131,299,28,4.0,6/28/2017,"Awesome little bar in the Lower East Side.  Stopped in with the girlfriend while barhopping for a few drinks.  They had a decent amount of beers on tap and the waitress was very friendly.  I guess it was happy hour because it was $10 for two beers...can't beat that in Manhattan.  The vibe in here was pretty cool as well, and I loved the fresh breeze coming in from the wall of open windows.  I can't believe I haven't seen this place before....I'll definitely be coming back!!",,,
17,Ashleigh S.,"New York, NY",1,22,1,5.0,6/7/2017,"If you could dream up the perfect neighborhood watering hole, this would be it: extra long bar, great selection of beers and wines, low prices, and the best bar food you could ever want. I love this place. The bartenders are great. Will chat when you want, but mostly leave you be and make sure your glass never empties. The music is always great, but never too loud. I always invite friends that come to my neighborhood to meet me here. You can actually talk! It's the perfect introduction to a night out, pre dinner drinks, or when you've had a rough day and you want to get hammered and eat some gourmet English muffin pizzas. Speaking of food: if you only eat salad, do not come here. The people won't like you anyway. Disco Tots are on the menu. I don't even feel like I need to describe that, it's a quick yes. I personally like to order the After School Special, but the cheesesteak sliders are also excellent. Always meet wacky cool people in here. Would recommend coming alone, actually. Just don't come here if you suck.",,1,
18,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,5.0,8/18/2016,"Probably one of my favorite beer bars in the city. While it has been on my bookmarks for awhile, I finally made a trip last winter and have since been in love with this place. If you love beer, this is a spot to check out in the LES.The atmosphere is chill and the crowd is fine. Depending on the nights you go, it can get super packed so make sure to get here early and grab a seat at the bar. There is plenty of space to accommodate nonetheless. There are bar snacks, but I always end up getting a safe and sure bet of tater tots. The draft menu rotates, and I have discovered some pretty good brews. I have been lucky enough to find the Boulder Shake Chocolate Stout on draft here (It honestly tastes like a chocolate shake, and it is one of the best stouts I have had) and some other uncommon beers on draft. The bartender is super chill, and we have seen the same guy the few times we have went. There is a jukebox for a plus. Mind you it is cash only here.Overall just a cool spot for some great beers. Invite some friends, at an unpretentious, low key spot with a legitimate list on draft. For the serious beer drinker to someone who just wants to try something new, this is a great place to check out.",2,,3
19,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1723,604,7753,4.0,5/23/2015,"I love that Yelp informed me 30 somethings hang out here. Thanks Yelp for letting me know where the big kids are hanging out. Even though I am a sucker for a $2 PBR I am also willing to splurge on the occasional crafty beer. At Marshall Stack there is a great list of crafty beers. I especially like that they had Ninkasi IPA from Washington on tap. A little taste from home in New York is a definite plus. And you know the Northwest is huge on beer so we know our stuff. The bar is named of course after the Amplifier so it has that rocker vibe to it. I especially love that they used a poster of my fave Siouxsie Sioux as the ladies room sign 'cause those are the ladies that should be hanging out. I also enjoyed seeing the ""KISS"" Russian stacking dolls! I could use those for my personal home decor. And how could I not point out the smokin' hot poster of Blondie. Waittttt.....I see now why it's ""30 somethings"", it's because kids these days might not recognize some of the amazing details. Well I am glad I am part of the cool kids and I will definitely continue to stop on by and enjoy a beer or a glass of vino.",3,2,1
20,Shelton H.,"Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, NY",44,172,8,4.0,4/25/2017,"Good craft beer, nice bartenders and a great bar food menu. It gets crowded at times, as it should. It's a go to LES institution for me and has been for years.",,,
21,Alex A.,"Brooklyn, NY",398,164,49,5.0,9/21/2017,"Excellent bar with a fantastic beer list, plenty of seating at the bar, tables for two, or big tables to share in the front, as well as old school table Pac Man® arcade game to boot! Great lighting and decor, and friendly service make this place a good option in the Lower East Side. They stay open REALLY late too.",,,
22,Sarah R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",103,136,1,3.0,12/16/2015,"I don't love a bar that only serves bar and wine. Gimme that sweet, sweet liquor.The (one) staff member working there on Saturday night was sweet as pie, but of course, service was a bit on the slow slide. Where were all the other bartenders?I love the ambiance inside, but this place is pretty forgettable.",3,3,3
23,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,453,363,3.0,9/28/2015,"Cool spot in central location. Came here with a semi large group (8 of us) and we were able to sit at the front table (it could have held 2 more people). I liked that the windows were completely removed to let some cool fresh air in and allow you to somewhat feel like you are outdoors.The seat was comfy. They have a juke box which appears to work. The table buser was on top of his game.We sat for a while without anyone bothering us, although they did turn up the music really loud at one point and we couldn't hear each other.",2,1,1
24,Danielle B.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",332,140,6,4.0,12/20/2016,This place is a hidden gem we stumbled upon.  Really broad craft beer selection on tap and a super generous happy hour.  Will definitely be back if in the area.,,,
25,Vicky F.,"Tampa Bay, FL",137,468,294,4.0,4/19/2016,"Not a bad place to chill with some snacks. Typical American food with a good selection of beer and wine. If you are looking for mixed drinks, don't come. But it's a nice and clean area, not too loud, and the bartender was nice.",1,1,1
26,Bernardo C.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",535,161,54,4.0,7/31/2016,"Came out here last night with friends for drinks. The atmosphere is really chill. I'd like to come back on like a Thursday to enjoy the homey decorations and local crowd. But for a big group it was a little uncomfortable. The space is skinny so we were at like three separate tables. Great location and good service though, bartender was actually nice! Lol",,,
27,Nathan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,27,27,4.0,3/24/2016,"Solid selection of beers, that change enough to keep it interesting, and aren't outrageously expensive considering the area.They do some sweet ass tater tots and sandwiches in their tiny kitchen, and the Jukebox is sufficiently stacked with songs you would expect from a bar named after an amplifier.It's not usually too crowded, and makes a pretty great first date spot if you want to start with drinks, and then throw some food in to the mix if it starts to go well.Cash only, so keep that in mind.",1,,1

29,Tom D.,"New York, NY",50,69,1,3.0,12/23/2016,"Nice vibe, come unwind with some beer and wine. Dumplings are excellent. Sloppy Joe sliders are also recommended.

31,Hong L.,"Brooklyn, NY",310,627,193,2.0,8/15/2014,"Came here for happy hr ($2 off drafts!).  Service was horrendously slow.  The bartender could only handle one person at a time, and disappeared into the cellar for 5 mins to look for a bottle of beer.  There are a bunch of thirsty patrons waiting...  Selection is definitely not good as when I was first here years ago. I may not be coming back any time soon unfortunately...",2,1,
32,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,5.0,9/11/2012,"Come for the:1.  Top notch bartenders (knowledgeable, nice, responsive, kick ass)2.  Amazing beer/wine selection (things you've never heard of...be honest, you don't know them all.  Stuff you have. Start at one end of the taps and work your way to the other)3.  Great music (juke with kinks, clash, other good stuff.  If not a solid selection on Pandora or and IPOD plays)4.  Location is sweet (on the corner, perfect for people watching or letting them watch you)5.  Food is solid for a bar (nothing healthy, stop that...its a bar and the food is tasty)Don't mind the:1.  Tourists, upper-eastsiders, other passersby, walking in, looking up at the menu, and attempting to order shots, rum and diets, jack and cokes, vodka tonics and being told its beer and wine only...followed by the 5 stages of wtf?:A.  Confusion: whaaa?  no booze?  How do I...? What do I...? Is this for real???B.  Consternation: Am I really going to drink beer or wine? Man, how am I gonna dance tonight?  Really?  Beer and wine only?C.  Moral Dilemma: Ut-ohh, I dont know what I.P.A stands for, do you think this awesome bartender will let me try it (YES!, of course he will, just ask).  Will these people judge me if I turn and run out (no, no we wont, happens very very often)D.  Asking the nice, knowledgeable bartender what is the closest thing they have to Bud light/or the lightest lager... and most of the time...E.  The slow wonder out the door while looking down at the cell phone..AND CUTLeaving the rest of us to enjoy some great beers/wine, listening to some good music, chatting with some interesting bartenders in a pretty chill environment.2.  Fact that it's Cash only.  This can be a little tough sometimes.

33,Danesh I.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",210,295,372,4.0,11/11/2014,"Beer. Wine. Reasonably priced, and even better priced for happy hour when you get $2 off drafts. No frills, not very ""woo-girl"" friendly, and you can get tater tots, sloppy joe sliders, wings, and an assortment of other delectable treats from the guy working the microwave and oven towards the back. This place is nondescript and that is what gives it so much charm. Yes, service might be slow, but what do you expect when you have one bartender working? I get the need to respect the ""NY Minute,""  but despite having places to be, and things to do, when you're here you can't help but unwind a bit. It's a fun and easygoing place where you can have audible conversations with friends and have a good time with a great soundtrack playing a variety of music. Lots to love at this place and I can't wait to go back.",1,,
34,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,3.0,7/21/2014,"Pretty extensive beer list, and a decent low-key bar. I had always passed by this place on my treks up and down Allen St, but had never taken the time to actually stop in for a drink.Not a fan that it's cash only, and that the bartender was rude about it to my friends. It is the 21st century, son. But afterwards, we were largely able to ignore him for most of the time. He was also really slow about getting us our drinks, even though it's not like he had to mix anything, since they don't serve hard liquor here, only beer and wine. Pricing is decent, although I'm not a fan of Heineken and that was their special for $4.A/C was pretty weak, especially on a hot summer weekend, but as a result, it wasn't too crowded, and there was plenty of seating. So we just kept fanning ourselves. There's a small counter for late night snacks, which was pretty cool. The offerings were pretty limited, but I felt like it was enough to satisfy someone with a late night craving. Luckily, it's also very close to Los Perros Locos, and a number of other places with late night eats.If I'm in the LES and looking for a low-key night, I may stop in for a drink. However, there are plenty of other places in the area that aren't cash only, and serve liquor.",1,1,
35,Craig Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,589,22,4.0,9/11/2014,"I have been going to Marshall Stack for many years, usually just drinking, but also have eaten a few times.  It is a good all purpose, all-season bar.  There are definitely some nights there that are better than others, but I never regret going.  Sometimes it is relatively chill, other times it is pretty packed.The beer selection is usually pretty good.  There are times when I'd like to see more diversity and better beers, but usually not disappointed.  I don't drink their wine much, but I think it is solid, especially for the prices.",,,
36,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,7/21/2013,"Dropped in here last night after seeing the Bob Saget show at the Bowery Ballroom. Damn, this unpretentious dimly lit bar has a pretty terrific craft beer list on tap, some tasty munchies such as tater tots and spicy nuts, good tunes from a jukebox, and nice staff. Cool hang but be aware it's cash only.Just a chill laid back vibe to get your drink on. Not a dive per se, but a comfortable spot to grab a table with friends or relax with a date after a night out. No attitude here and the craft beer list alone will make even the snobbiest beer drinker pretty happy. Long bar with plenty of bar stools to plant your butt at, and tables and chairs for larger groups along the window to people watch. One of my fav new spots now for when I am downtown on the LES. Low key and surprising at the same time. Rare Voss on tap? Yes sir, I'll have another.",5,5,5

38,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,4.0,8/30/2013,"Since I get out of work early and work close enough to the lower east side this seemed like the perfect bar to kill an hour. It has plenty of beers on tap and in cask ale with a $1 off during happy hour. Steph had been here about a year ago and suggested it and was shockingly on time! She almost beat me for once. For my first beer I went with penis boy beer or Blanche de Bruxelles. For some crazy reason it was calling out to me. It was light and summery and perfect. I didn't need a second beer and went with a crazy double ipa Brooklyn Blast that I needed help chugging down pre Yelp. But it was delightful as well. They also have board games here and I hear pretty decent bar food and tater tots. This may have to be re-examined because I always find myself at local, epsteins or that lolita place. But this has such a unique variety and its different and it has grown on me.",2,,1
39,Kevin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",364,281,548,4.0,2/10/2014,"One of the many great bars we patronized in the lower east side. Great selection of craft beers on tap with a variety of New York local brews as well. Plenty of seating at the bar along with a few tables. Dimly lit and relaxed atmosphere that is perfect for those nights when you just want to enjoy great beer with great company as the music does not drown out opportunities for conversation.Bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly. I can easily see how this would be a great neighborhood bar for locals. This establishment could easily earn 5 stars if they accepted credit cards, however it is cash only unfortunately.Tip: Cash only!",,,1

I've also had another friend hold a birthday get together here one time and it was really nice for a group of friends, because they have a few tables that you can grab. It was Super Low Key.Happy Hour is from 4-7pm ya get $2 off draft, $1 off bottles, and $4 wines",,,

They don't have an extensive food menu, but we got a tilapia po boy that was delicious. Also they have pretty amazing tater tots, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The beer selection is extensive, I had a $7 Blanche de Brussels that went down easy (x3). In the summer, windows open fully for a nice indoor/outdoor feel.",1,,

56,Sarah S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,14,0,5.0,9/12/2013,"I now have one more reason to love Marshall Stack: They found my wallet and cheerfully returned it to me, and wouldn't even accept a reward. That's the kind of service that makes a place a neighborhood bar.So back to the original reasons why I love Marshall Stack--one, the beer selection. I have scribbled down names of beers I have here so I don't forget them, then tracked them down at out-of-the-way places so I could have them again (they do always taste better from the tap here, though). Amazing hefeweizens and fruity and spicy beers (my favorite). Two, it manages to have a laid-back vibe in a neighborhood that's getting increasingly crazy and fratty. In fact, I once brought an obnoxious out-of-town guest here, and he hated this place and we left immediately--this place possesses a natural repellant that keeps away horrible people. Cheers to Marshall Stack! The next time I have a pint here, I'll be remembering the kind, honest behavior of the staff.",3,,1

There is always a great selection of beer, which ranges from ciders, ales, stouts, IPAs, wheats, etc. Sit along the bar and get swooned by the gorgeous bartender.

Like Eastern Parkway in BKLYN, the wide avenue lined with trees reminds me of certain streets in Europe: Rome, Milan, Paris, Berlin. A distant past. A lost connection.I like that from Marshall Stack I have windows overlooking Allen Street. It feels like a window over my long, remote past. And at the same time a more recent past. A past when I was used to hang out in the LES more frequently. A cold night in February. A bachelor party. An impromptu wedding afterparty. Friends who have since long gone.Bittersweet memories. A bit like the beers I like[1]. On a recent visit, I had the pleasure of drowning my memories in bittersweet Founders Red Rye: rich amber in color, with a hoppy punch and a smooth, bitter caramel aftertaste. Unfortunately my memories were perfectly happy to  swim in it.And if you want some food with your beer, try the English-muffin pizza, or a Cuban sandwich served on a Sullivan Street Bakery ciabatta.An extra star for the awesome music selection. When was the last time you heard Heart's ""Barracuda""?[2]Minus one star because some memories are just a wee bit too bitter.

Both their beer and food menu is awesome. I was happily surprised to see they even have Tusker, a Kenyan beer I rarely see in the U.S!

Allagash Grand Cru on tap, and I am pretty sure I saw them hiding a couple of bottles of Hitachino in the cooler! The selection of draught is small but selective, which I certainly appreciate.Buuuut, (and there must be a but) the vibe here was way weird. For example, at one point, the bartender held his head in his hands like he either wanted to cry or he had a serious hangover. I tried to engage him in friendly conversation about it, and asked if he was okay? He immediately replied, ""no,"" and left to the other end of the bar.

Meeting up with friends and finding space is not a hassle, yet the place is still dark and sexy if you are on a date. I came here a while back with a crew and my boyfriend at the time. He didn't realize it was wine and beer only, which of course was fine for me and his friends but after about the 3rd bottle of Bubbles he had that goofy wine drunk look. Haha, good times. I do believe one of his friends told me I look just like Claire Danes, and for that lovely comment and the lovely Bubbles we shared I will always have a special place in my heart for Marshall Stack.",6,6,7

77,Steve B.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",126,618,53,5.0,5/15/2012,"Great neighborhood bar with some amazing beers, solid food and a clutch oldschool jukebox.I've been into Marshall Stack a few times before while wandering around the Lower East, once for food, mostly for beer.  Dark, chill place with a good amount of seating for the size of the venue.  Solid craft beers which, as a craft beer head, always have a few good options to choose from.Then came this Friday, when I rolled in after an early concert at Bowery Ballroom - on the chalkboard above the bar was Founders KBS.  Doesn't mean anything to you?  It's like finding the beer equivalent of finding a bunch of Victoria's Secret models hanging out at your local bar looking for partners for karaoke.  It's like finding the Easter Bunny and Santa playing dominoes in the park.  It's like finding a diamond earring on the sidewalk.  These are things that never ever happen in the wild.Normally, when this beer is available on draft, you have to be at the bar 3 hours early / buy tickets / enter your name in a lottery . . .it's a big production, and a crowning jewel in most bars' beer events, and the keg is usually gone in 10 minutes.  Here, it was just on the wall, and had been for 4 days, put there with no publicity, no advertising, no tweets, no facebook . . .just there for the locals and those lucky enough to find it, like me.I spoke to the manager while there, and he says he does these sort of things on a semi-regular basis - as such, I'll get myself there on a semi-regular basis as well.  As should you!",2,1,1

First, and REALLY important to know - this place dies not sell booze!! just beer and wine! but, it was Nice to be able to find a wide range of prices for both - I think they had a $4 Pinot, unheard of in NYC. I seem to remember the music sucking, but that is, obv, a personal taste - and it wasn't loud enough to annoy.

There are a wide variety of beers on tap and everything is $2 off during happy hour, I believe.  They even serve very well-priced and yummy snacks, such as the After School Special (a really yummy english muffin pizza) and Sloppy Joes, among other fun options.  I got the impression that this place is a ""local"" because the bartender seemed to know a lot of people! I always find it a great endorsement if people come back again and again in a city with such a plethora of choices, so kudos to Marshall Stack.  I also love that there is great music on the jukebox too.  Even the bathroom is cool!  I will definitely be coming back to this spot.  You should check it out too!",1,2,1

There's even an every-day happy hour that will lessen the impact on your wallet (believe it ends at 7 p.m.)The snacks, offered at the far end of the bar, are tasty. Tater tots and wings are my faves.

The exposed brick interior fits well with this place and the vintage jukebox is priceless. It is cash only so that kinda blows but the vibe eviscerates my complaint. The bartenders are nice, knowledgeable and attentive (it helps when your friend knows them all as well). The wine is great and their catfish sandwich hit the spot.

Updated review","OK, I'm back again to talk about music. They were killing it the other night with the playlist. Really great stuff - but there was something going on with the bass level that was bizarre. I had forgotten to mention that before, but it's happened other times I've been there too. The bass will be thumping - almost, barely, too loud - for a couple of songs, then it's like someone disconnects the subwoofer and there's NO bass for a couple songs. They still killed it though. And the beer was still delicious, bartenders still cool, service still good.",,1,2

104,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146,4.0,9/14/2010,"Marshall Stack is another great option for beer (and wine) drinkers on the Lower East Side.  There are over 20 beers on tap, imported and domestic.  It would be cool to try them all, but that would probably end up with someone in the hospital unfortunately.The great thing about Marshall Stack is that it weeds out all of the obnoxious Coors Light broskis because this is strictly a craft beer kind of place.If you start to get hungry, there are reasonably priced appetizers  available that look really good.  Bring some small bills or change because there's a jukebox, with pretty good indie and 80s tunes.  And for all of the music buffs: there are plenty of Marshall-related equipment items around the bar.  The bar is not all that big so it does get crowded.Now that the fall is approaching, there are excellent Belgian and German Oktoberfest beers on tap, which I would highly recommend.Cash only!",4,2,4
105,Anthony C.,"New York, NY",6,41,1,5.0,3/22/2014,Marshall Stack is a great beer and wine bar. They have a tremendous beer selection and the bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable about everything they serve. Garrett and John are great bartenders and you should definitely check this place out if you want a low-key place to grab a beer/glass of wine.,,,

108,Susanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/7/2014,"Question for you: if you're looking to get 1 glass of wine at 1030 with 2 girlfriends on a Sunday night before heading home, should you head to Marshall Stack? Well, that all depends. Would you like the bartender Garrett to ask you how old you and your friends were, 5 minutes into sitting down, when you lost your virginity? Would you also like bartender Garrett to introduce his intoxicated and not mentally well friend to your group of friends, have him single out one of us and get in her face, touch her and call her the C word? Then after you ask the bartender to make his friend leave, have him laugh in your face and tell you this is what happens at bars, then the best part-- have him laugh in my crying friends face after she was sexually accosted, and tell her to get over herself and that he hates white people. FINALLY to top everything off, us 3 women trying to be decent and pay for our bill, instead of walking out, put cash on the table. A total of almost $40 on a $21 check Garrett took it upon himself toPocket $10 extra dollars instead of making change for us which is what I asked him to do. When I pointed this out to him he said, ""oh well"" and we left because his friend was STILL calling my friend a C**t and we were worried for her. SO if this is the night you would like to have then please visit Garrett on Sunday nights. You will be sexually harassed, laughed at--and oh yeah--robbed. Matthew Kelly, owner of Marshall Stack, you need to know that this is how your establishment was portrayed last night. And I'm positive similar instances occur whenever this man is behind the bar and running your place. It is clear that Garret's friend wasn't of sound mind but it was even more clear and horrifying that Garret was enjoying watching my friend be accosted and wanted to take full advantage of this sick situation. I can only assume you don't approve of this and that you strive for a harassment free environment in your bar. It's a shame this had to happen.As you can see this is my only yelp review ever. I am in the service and hospitality industry as well, and would never want to single someone out like this, but he went above and beyond to be cruel and disgusting. Mr. Kelly I would have loved to send this to you privately but your email was no where to be found.",10,,

We got there around 12.45-1am, each grabbed a pint & were very excited by the huge selection of beer. We noticed the food menu on a blackboard at the end of the bar and debated whether the kitchen would still be open at 1am - it was and i had my very first real tater tots ever!

And then the spices hit you're tongue and it is like ecstasy in your mouth. Imagine the MK+A Olson movie It Takes Two where the ""refined"" twin takes a bite of her first sloppy joe, and proceeds to shove it in her face. You will want to do this. You might do this. And if you do, I won't hold it against you because they are un.be.liev.a.ble.Also, the After School Special, aka english muffin pizzas.

They employ really knowledgeable bartenders, and have great beers on tap and bottled. I usually stick to the Japanese beers, but there really is something for everyone at decent prices.BIG-UPs (do people still say that??) to the food selection! Seriously, who doesn't like Tater Tots, with their odd-shaped potato-y fried salty goodness?? 5 bucks gets you a nice basket. The Bruschetta comes with some lovely toasted french bread and the whole pile of tomato goodness in a bowl, so no soggy toast thing is happening. De-vine! And I highly, highly, highly recommend the Tilapia Po'boy. It's lightly baked 'blackened' tilapia on a yummy roll, with lettuce, tomato and mayo. A side of chips.

The beer selection, both taps and bottles, is really nice, but hard to read on their high-up blackboard menu.  The wine selection is smaller but good.  I had the Pinot Noir, pricy at $10 a glass, but I found it to be amazing.  Although someone else ordered the same wine and hated it (too sweet, fruity, tastes like apple juice, etc.)The food looked good from what I could see, and served on paper - not paper plates, but on long strips of brown paper, plunked down on the table.  How eco friendly!  It make the dining experience all minimalist-looking.  I would totally come back here.  Good job dudes.",1,1,1

Oh well, the aforementioned surly/jovial bartender quickly poured us three flutes of champagne (sparkling wine) and we proceeded to drink up and loudly gossip about old friends, nemeses, and the general state of our love lives as said surly man grinned smugly and rolled his eyes at times. I personally loved the interplay between our half drunk group of girls dressed in our finest gear, the dead pan bartender slinging beers, the psuedo-divey bar decor with wood paneled everything and tables full of frat boys with backwards caps, a thirtysomething hipster couple playing hearts and an entire Polish family (baby and all) chowing down on pub food.

Bring your cash, and plenty of it, because it ain't cheap.  The happy hour special (2$ off drafts, I think?) takes some of the sting out of the bill but it only lasts till 7.   The deli across the street has an ATM but it is Sketchtown, USA with lots of homeless guys hanging around outside. Lastly, the beer selection itself is pretty awesome.  I've never had a skunky or funky-tasting beer, the whole place wreaks of cleanliness and care.  I love the Sixpoint Sweet Action Cream Ale, and they almost always have that.  Last time I was there I tried Lentenbier, it smelled like a smokey BBQ - really interesting, really fun.",,,

We settled down at the end of the bar and ordered $4 glasses of white wine (generously poured). The beer selection was fierce.. but I was in a wine me up mood. It was pleasant how every seat in the joint was taken- yet the crowd was mellow and perfectly dispersed. It was notable that at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, two other patrons were even reading books at the bar.They have a nice snack and sandwich menu.. With, possibly my favorite childhood snack, the ""After School Special""- which is english muffin pizzas! The cheese board looked really good- with a nice presentation (next time for sure). My only complaint: The warm pretzels were no better than SuperPretzel from the grocery store.. with way too much salt. They were baked in the oven, making them tough and stale tasting. (SuperPretzels are best microwaved. Everyone knows that!) The mustard was doled out of a Costco size French's jug (and while I normally heart on my hot dogs- for warm pretzels I feel a more coarse, artisan mustard is in order).  The pretzel issue will not deduct any stars- as they have a great selection of wine and beer, awesome prices and english muffin pizzas.",,,

It's the only thing I miss about not living on the LES anymore. Food is great (when was the last time you had tater tots?), wine selection is top notch, and the crowd is always interesting. The number of beers on tap is quite impressive, too.To those concerned about the volume: the bartenders are always happy to turn down the music a notch if you ask them to.

Try not  to go if one of your companions has lost her voice. It will be a frustrating experience. This place is great for groups, with big, groupy tables, and it serves alcohol, so people in groups will be screaming. Be aware. b) It totally smells like farts in here. But after a good two hours, we realized it was literal cheese, and not people cutting same. The food menu looks fairly good, though we did not partake. Extra points for the weird but cool bartender, who made a point of showing us the menu(s), explaining the wine selections (good wine at an LES bar! novel!) and being generally friendly. And having an unusual belt  buckle.

Since discovering this bar I've become a fan too -- there's always room, they're always nice to me, and the bar tab is always cheap!Disclaimer: I can't really speak about weekend nights at Marshall Stack, but weeknights here are great (which I guess is the norm for a lot of bars in this area).  When you walk in on any given weeknight, there are always people in the place, but it is a mellow scene.  Nothing too corny ever comes on the jukebox, and the music is subtle so you can definitely have a conversation without shouting.  For the Lower East Side, it's a decent-sized space, with a dimly lit, relaxed atmosphere and lots of dark wood and black paint.  It kind of has the casual, relaxed vibe of a dive bar, but with nice, clean decor and minus the smell of spilled beer. This is a beer and wine only place, but they do have a great selection of both AND they offer them at happy hour half-off prices every day until 7pm.  When you order at the bar, the bartender/owner who is there most nights is really friendly and knowledgeable about the alcohol selection.  Drinking those $4 glasses of wine before dinner, you will get hungry -- but luckily, Marshall Stack has a better-than-you-would-expect selection of meals and small plates.  The vegetarian dumplings are yummy and come with a spicy gingery sauce, and the tuna melt is grilled to perfection and comes with chips.  None of the food is expensive, either!Recently my friend had her birthday drinks night here, and the bar was very hospitable and accommodating towards us.  We took up a big table at the front of the bar, and the birthday girl set out cakes from Whole Foods and a cheese plate.  We got a little bit rowdy at times, but we were having lots of fun and no one complained!  I really thought that was awesome.  This, along with the nice wines and delicious food, is one of the biggest signs that Marshall Stack is a good place.  It's great when you can go into a bar and just have a little celebration of some kind with no hassles from the staff -- no having to reserve tables, leave by a certain hour, order a certain amount of drinks, order from certain people only . . . blah blah blah.  It was a great place to celebrate a birthday, and in the future I know I'll be back at their happy hour for more of those $4 glasses of wine & delicious dumplings!",,,

Didn't have any beer, so can't comment on that, but looking at their chalkboard, it did seem like the selection was a bit limited.

There were about six beers on draft, all good choices.

So of course someone decided they were hungry so we went in search of food. Enter Marshall Stack. The kitchen was closed, but the very sweet door guy let us order a pizza to be delivered there. In the meantime, my non-beer drinking stupid self asked the bartender for 4 light beers. He replied with something like ""do you want light as in low calorie or body"". I was a bit lost...so he gave a few samples. I ended up choosing a Hefeweizen, which was served in a nice, tall pilsner glass. I also picked out another beer for the boys....though I have no idea what. I chatted with the bartender for a while, probably even past when our huge pizza got there. He was really sweet, and probably really easy on the eyes. Even though I had started drinking at 7:30, I'm usually not a victim of ""booze blinkers"" as my friends so lovingly call beer goggles. Oh, the bar tender didn't charge me for my beer either, which was very nice. I tipped on what I thought the price might be. (I'm notorious for tipping the amount of my check, so who knows what I left.)It was dead empty inside, which we didn't mind at all. There were only four of us at this point anyway. I think we shared our pizza with the bar tender and the very awesome door guy. We probably left around 4, having laughed our way through one of the best hours of the night (...I think).

Serving piping hot pressed sandwiches (made with Sullivan Street Bakery bread) and off-beat American microbrews  and European classics is certainly not.On a recent visit before a show at Mercury Lounge I sat at the bar with a friend and ate almost an entire bowl of mixed olives (she wasn't down) and shared the ""Blue Balls,"" four seedless grapes battered in a goat cheese mixture then fried and dusted with pulverized candied nuts. Both plates looked great straight-out the adjacent table-top kitchen and started things right. On a previous trip I sampled the cheese plate, which is pricey at $14, but offers a nice variety of hard/soft/raw/goat/sheep staples. The sandwiches were impressive as well, crusty with that Sullivan bread and filled with  gooey American cheese/tomato (my pick) and goat cheese/asparagus (friend's pick).

The staff were also very friendly, dispelling any notion I might have harbored about the stereotypical New Yorker attitute. (Realizing of course they work in the hospitality industry and subsist off of their tips, it is not always so that this results in ""hospitable"" service. For this, the bartenders at Marshall stood out in my mind.)",,,
192,Emily F.,"Manhattan, NY",33,75,9,4.0,7/19/2010,"Totally adorable and low-key venue which I found thanks to my pal, yelp.com. Sat at the bar and was eagerly greeted by the bartender who proudly told me about the $4 house wine and $2 off drafts. Sold! Ordered a cuban sandwich which was tasty but perhaps a bit bready and I underwhelmed by the toppings, but the extra crunchy exterior redeemed itself.  Aside from the food/drink,  I really enjoyed the space. And the bartender who came back at 10 to 7pm to remind me that the happy hour was almost over and it was time to order another drink if I wanted to save $5--and somehow he managed to pull this off in a very sincere and informative way. Again, low-key, unpretentious, plain and simple. If that sounds like you, definitely go. Verrrrry chill.",,,
193,Robbie K.,"Lexington, KY",15,153,6,5.0,7/5/2010,"Possibly my favorite bar in the City. I've been there under many circumstances - 3 pm, 3 am, small group, large group, etc. and it never disappoints. Great music, cool but not trying to be too cool crowd, generally friendly and helpful bartends, great beer selections, and great pub fare being whipped up in the corner. Can't go wrong with this bar.",,,
194,Eve A.,"Los Angeles, CA",289,81,0,5.0,8/31/2010,"This is one of the most relaxing bars in NYC. Great bear selection. Not too loud, not too many hipsters, good music on the jukebox.",,,
195,Ben W.,"Lancaster, PA",0,21,2,5.0,12/13/2010,"Hands down best bar I've been to! Warm inside, immediately familiar, and comfortable. Frankly, its welcoming. Spectacular assortment of beers on tap.

199,Tom O.,"San Diego, CA",133,6,6,4.0,5/11/2010,"Having just moved into the neighborhood, this was one of the first bars my wife and I checked out. It's truly a neighborhood bar. Very chill and laid back. Great beer selection. Tasty food options. Good music on the jukebox. A nice place to grab a drink and hang out with your friends. We'll be coming back for sure. Just gotta make sure we bring more cash next time!",,,
