0,1,9/17/2018,675,1,"New York, NY",Brandon D.,175,4.0,55,"4/5! This place had a really great interior / vibe. It's a very classic breakfast joint. Food: 4/5.I had an amazing eggs Benedict but was a bit disappointed with the short rib scramble that needed to have more flavor. The Benny, though, was phenomenal. The English muffin was spongy, and absorbed all of the yolk / sauce well and made for a super well balanced bite. Atmosphere / service: 4/5. Good service, however we had a meal that was forgotten about, but that happens. Over all good, though, even for a large group (9 without notice early in the morning). Price to experience ratio: 3.5/5. I thought the place was pretty pricey for what you were getting (especially the short rib) and the coffee was overpriced at $5 a cup, but I guess this is NYC. I do think there are better deals to be had, but honestly just come here for the Benny!!",1
1,,10/22/2018,250,,"Nashville, TN",Mallory T.,0,2.0,12,"2 Stars because the food was good.But 3 stars docked because at 9:30 am on a Monday, with multiple open tables, the service here was insufferable. You had to beg for someone to bring you a drink or a check. Once you begged, you waited 10 minutes for anything to show up. Also, the dining room was so loud I could not hear my fiancé across the table. We were also seated in the middle of the room about 1 foot from 2 women practically shouting at each other. When I asked about other tables (as there were many open), the hostess said she had none. We had a reservation, I should note.All in all, I would skip this place. Even if the food is good, the atmosphere and service are miserable. Even on a Monday.",

3,,11/17/2018,0,,"New York, NY",J S.,0,3.0,23,"Although I have been to other Sarabeth restaurants in New York City, this is my first time reviewing it. I found the tables very close together. It was hard to get by with a large coat and not knock something over. I ordered Grilled Octopus and the Chicken. The Chicken came with root vegetables. I wanted to know what root vegetables. In the answer I was told that there were no substitutions. I am not a fan of the word, ""No."" I have to admit that the root vegetables were good. The Octopus was also tasty. When it came time to pay, I used cash. After waiting too long, I finally asked for the change. I would never have received my change if I had never asked. That would have given the restaurant around a 30% tip. My service and food would have had to be extraordinary for that amount.",
4,1,5/16/2018,149,1,"New York, NY",Hong An N.,1551,4.0,139,"I came here with a party of 5 for dinner after visiting a museum nearby. We called before coming and were told that the wait would be around 30 mins. We got there within 10 mins and waited another 10 mins and they were able to get us seated pretty quickly. I was happy that we did not have to wait the full 30. I am a little confused with Sarabeth's vibe. The dining area and menus looked to be a little bit upscale, but the waiting area and front display of desserts looked pretty causal. I did liked the decors in the dining area and found the ambiance to be very relaxing. Our waiter was super professional and nice. He answered all our questions and made our experience here super pleasant. For appetizer, we all shared the chips with crab guacamole. I have never seen crab meat in guacamole before and was quite intrigued. The dish turned out to be delicious and they gave us a lot of crab meat. For my main course, I went with the crab spaghetti and it tasted delicious. Again, they gave a lot of crab meat in this dish. I was a little disappointed because they did not have red pepper flakes, but I got over it. One thing that I'm not sure of is that some of the crab pieces in the spaghetti actually tasted like fish. They had a more dense texture versus the more fluffy and light texture of crab meat. Despite this, the dish still tasted great. The other people in my party tried the filet mignon and they had great things to say about it. Someone also tried the cheesecake for desserts and she said it was too sweet. I did not have any desserts asI could not even finish the spaghetti. Overall, I think Sarabeth's is a close to solid restaurant. If you are looking for a little more fancy restaurant (but not super fancy), then I'd recommend coming here.",2

Unfortunately, I found it extremely underwhelming. I had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes. They were lovely, but not worth $21. The portion was large - five pancakes in total, and yet the condiments they provided didn't seem enough for five. The pancakes were slightly thick and heavy, and I struggled to get past three. The servers were all nice and friendly, but the tables were all set so close to each other that i just felt uncomfortable and rushed to eat.With coffee, I ended up spending $30 on breakfast. That's a high price to pay for average food in an uncomfortable setting.",

The watermelon salad was a real highlight, where the fish was not a stand out and the coconut ice cream used in the brownie sundae was a bit odd. However, I want to congratulate the staff on how well they handled some difficult patrons seated on both sides of me--classic UES ""ladies who lunch"" types who were extraordinarily demanding and kept the staff on their toes. I will say that if you need to use the restroom, the available option is awfully small, and the venue is not well equipped for anyone in a wheelchair. I might come back for a drink, but probably not for dinner again.",

I ate here often when I lived a few blocks away but now every single time I'm in NYC breakfast here is a MUST! Every dish is good and the English muffins are homemade and amazing and my favorite! You've probably seen their jams and jellies on your grocery store shelf. They have an even larger selection at the store. Do yourself a favor and stop here. Dinner is really good too but they are famous for breakfast/brunch!

Updated review",132,1,"New York, NY",Kim G.,986,1.0,329,"We came for breakfast today and left. I just had to review. How disappointing, to walk in sit down and feel like your out side swatting nats from in front of your face.  The light powder yellow walls were filled with disgusting nats. Anyone who knows if there's is a few in the dining area there are a ton in the kitchen.  As we were talking and planning our exit we noticed that it felt like the table wasn't even wiped down properly. Sticky and oily with butter and maple syrup from the last guests.Sarabeths has gone from a elegant restaurant for a lovely breakfast, to just a reg dirty diner I wouldn't step foot in. What a turn-off. This place I thought, WAS really good. Not anymore! It such a shame!",8

17,,5/26/2018,537,,"Washington, DC",Dominique C.,45,3.0,198,"I really enjoyed my breakfast: omelette with ham, leaks, and gruyere a lot, I was extremely disappointed with the service received at Sarabeth's. I met a friend who frequents this location pretty often for breakfast on a Monday morning. I was literally the first person in the restaurant, yet somehow even though we ordered about 10 minutes after sitting down, our food came significantly behind several people who had more complicated orders,  and who ordered after us. The server was overly chatty with other employees even after she told us she was going to check on our food. My friend was frustrated because she'd never had such poor service and felt bad for bringing me here. So as stated previously, the food was enjoyable, but the staff make me question returning again.",
18,,5/18/2017,58,,"New York, NY",Colie R.,279,4.0,156,"I've been here multiple times for breakfast, it reminds me of a classy old fashioned breakfast establishment.  They do not take breakfast/brunch reservations on Saturday and Sunday so fair warning it does get busy quickly because it is not that big.  Most of the time I have come here no later than 10am because by 10:30-11 there always seems to be a wait. This place is extremely expensive in terms of breakfast/brunch. All the sides are a la carte.  WIth the omelettes you do get a muffin, croissant, scone or toast but if you'd like to add home fries, bacon, sausage, everything will cost extra.  In terms of the food:Sides: 1. Home Fries- Did not have a ton of flavor, was not very impressed by these. 2. Bacon- Very good, if you want to get this as a side there is enough bacon to feed at least two to three people so I recommend splitting the side 3. Chicken & Apple Sausage - This is delicious and extremely flavorful highly recommend4. Basket of Muffins - Wide variety and good to split amongst the group Meals: 1. Cheese Omelet with pumpkin muffin- Their omelets are amazing and they are huge.  You get a lot of eggs and fillings. Normally I get a pumpkin muffin with the omelet and it is delicious. Highly recommend. 2.Fat & Fluffy French Toast - French toast is good however it does not come with any sides so you will need to pay more to get the sides3. Morning Crunch - Perfect for the healthy eater that wants a lot of fruit to start their day 4. Crisp Potato Waffle - Popular choice at our table and ordered a lot.  Great taste and comes with a side of the chicken & apple sausageI've had mixed experience with service when I have been here.  A few times I feel like i'm extremely rushed and they really want to get your table to turn it over. One time after we paid I asked for another coffee refill (Coffee is almost $4.00 I like to get my money's worth) and they refilled it but literally cleared everything off our table and glared waiting for us to leave. Another time I sat upstairs where I had the complete opposite experience.  The service was not as attentive, it took a long time to get water, and I had very few coffee refills (they did take it off the bill). It also took a long time to get the check and to pay.  My experience has been I feel more rushed when I sit downstairs verses when I sit upstairs.",

The wait was only about 5 minutes. I liked the high ceilings but the entire place seems a bit run-down. Just remember one thing: expensive. I mean they priced their OJ at $8. Come on. I had scrambled eggs on a piece of ham on English muffins with some tomatos on the side. My friend got the chicken sausage and waffle. The food was fine, but the cups we had our coffee and tea in looked dirty and old. The two stars are for the food which was quite good.Our waiter was fine but the hostess was not friendly nor helpful. She did not acknowledge us when we walked in (she wasn't busy and was deteremined not to make eye contact) and had a RBF on the whole time. No one is forcing you to be there. Go home. It always amazes me how people  get to keep their jobs. I'd rather wait two hours for some of the spots in NY because they are tasty, fun and lively. This location is old, boring and expensive. Will not return.",

It's my to-go place whenever I'm out for brunch in the Upper East Side with friends that live up there. Getting a table can be a daunting task, but once seated, the service is excellent and the environment is very enjoyable. Yes, the prices are a bit on the higher end of the spectrum, but totally worth the experience and the service provided. The food is good and the portions are large enough to fill you without needing to unbutton your jeans (if you know what I mean). The coffee is not great, but better than your average brunch place.I definitely recommend Sarabeth's East if you're looking for a nice environment with good food to spend your weekend morning with friends.",1

The menu also had options for everyone. For an appetizer I had the chips and guacamole with crab meat. It was very good I just wasn't expecting it to be potato chips. Then for my entree I had the chicken which was good. For dessert we shared the banana split which was great. The bananas were served on the side of the scoop of ice cream glazed with some sugar butter sauce. Overall, the food and experience was very good. I just can't say any dish was incredible and different from something I could get at another restaurant.",

I would highly recommend the eggs with lox an jalapeños an cream cheese, what a dish! It was cooked perfectly an had a excellent flavor combination. My wife an kids also enjoyed their pancakes, waffles,and eggs in spinach although my wife felt their could have been a bit more goat cheese in hers.All in all this is a great place, but beware of the prices they are a bit high for a breakfast place an the crowds can be a bit much at certain times so be prepared to wait.",1
23,,6/8/2018,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",James B.,1,3.0,10,"Three things establish whether a restaurant is good or not good. The quality of the food, obviously, is number one. Here, Sarabeth's did well. My Caesar salad was crisp and the dressing was savory and well portioned - the lettuce and croutons did not drown. Our guests had an omelet, club sandwich and yogurt with granola. Well, actually, it was granola with a dollop of yogurt, but the cheerful staff was happy to remedy that with additional yogurt brought to the table. All of these were very good, according to the guests. The second element is the staff and, as noted, Sarabeth's crew was polite and responsive. No issues here. We were well-served on a busy day. The third element is ambiance. Now, granted, this is mostly a lunch establishment so no one should expect candles and soft music, but the noise level was really very high. I invite the owner to sit in the loft section on a busy afternoon and just listen to the noise. Please hang some wall coverings or do something to tamp down the volume. The noise really did hamper what was otherwise a tasty lunch, well-served. If you are fortunate to be there when it's not busy and, therefore, less noisy, you will enjoy a 4-star lunch.",

Did not matter that it was a weekday, as this place was packed.Thankfully we got there a little on the earlier side and were able to be seated right away.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the farmer's omelette and the blueberry corn muffin. The blueberry corn muffin was decent, but the omelette is probably one of the best I've ever had. I wasn't really expecting to be 'wow'ed, but this dish really was impressive. The portion size was also pretty large as I could barely get through the whole thing on an empty stomach.Overall, this place has some premium pricing, but the food is very well worth it. Some of the waitstaff can be a little rough around the edges, but it is sort of part of the whole experience. Definitely a place worth checking out if you are in the city.",2

I had chips with guac and lobster, I thought it was a bad combination but I was willing to experiment. And I was right, not such a good combo and didn't like it.

My partner got the ""adult grilled cheese"", which was laughably small (about the size of a flattened hot dog bun.) It came with a bowl of ""velvety"" creamy tomato soup... it was chunky.

Salad - bitter and underseasoned. Tomatoes were chopped up in so many random shapes and pieces, many of which are too big for one bite. Lobster roll - bread is not well buttered and dry as chalk. Lobster is more of a mayonnaise covered sour chunk of flavorless meat than real fresh lobster. I have never had worse lobster roll actually. For $27 it needs to be much, much better, especially in NYC. Mamosa - $14 for what most places would offer for $1 or even 1 cent mamosasOld fashioned - no apple taste at all. No bitters taste.

Once my turn came in line, the hostess asked for my name and said to come back in 30 minutes. No problem - we obviously knew there would be a wait. We came back inside after 25 minutes and the hostess told me she gave our table to someone else after calling my name in the extremely packed waiting area, even though I told her we would leave and come back, AND she didn't take down my phone number! She said it would be another 10 minute wait, so we opted to stay INSIDE the restaurant. After 10 minutes I went back up to her, and she looked panicked, admitting our table was given away again (still didn't take my number nor call my name) and it would be an additional TWENTY minute wait. I requested the manager (I've done this many times to compliment service, but this was a first for negative comments) to politely explain how terrible of a system this was, and that a restaurant with MULTIPLE locations should know how to deal with a Saturday brunch crowd. I was patient and understanding in my comment. The manager's response was, ""Well it's pouring rain outside and there's nothing else to eat in this area. We have a table of 4 ready for you, so you might as well take it and eat here."" Are you kidding me? What kind of condescending response is that? I told her there was no way we were spending our money here, and left. Highly unprofessional team and terrible experience - wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone. I've never written a bad review, but this was infuriating considering the complete lack of attention or care.

41,3,3/12/2017,1167,2,"New York, NY",Joy G.,153,3.0,786,"Sarabeth's reminds me of this girl's house that I used to go to for sleepovers. Even the decor is the same: yellow linen curtains, a slight hint of lemon verbena in the bathrooms, and always, always, the rich, yeasty smell of freshly baked bread. Every Sunday morning, her dad would make us a ridiculous spread of breakfast, right down to homemade jam. The food I ate as a kid reminds me so much of everything at Sarabeth's and that's a big compliment. You can't go wrong with any of the baked goods. My personal favorite is the pumpkin muffin, stuffed with pumpkin seeds, fluffy with only a tint of sweetness. I've tried the Goldie Lox and the morning crunch granola. My boyfriend swears by the Goldie Lox - it's a hearty, creamy dish with both cream cheese and chunks of lox - but the portion sizes have been getting smaller and smaller. The most recent time, the omelette barely covered half of the plate. The granola was perfect for a morning after a massive Shake Shack meal (although granola isn't all that healthy but anyway) with fresh strawberries and banana. I wish they were a bit more generous with the yogurt, as I ended up eating the granola just by itself and it got pretty dry. My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey for brunch, especially when you add in drinks. I didn't really enjoy my Aperol Fizz because it was too dry and not sweet enough but my boyfriend's spicy margarita was absolutely delicious. Not chokingly spicy and with just the perfect amount of ginger. Weekend brunch lines are long. Come as early if you can or be prepared to wait while crammed in  the tiny area next to the pastry counter.",4

We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which was expected and understandable.It's very classically decorated. Exactly what you'd expect on the UES at a long-standing, traditionally popular brunch spot.Food was acceptable. Tables are small, with very little room to fit all of the individual tea pots, coffee cups, and brunch plates. My dad's plate tipped into his lap as he tried to cut into his meal because there was not enough room on the table for it to fully fit, and the staff came over to clean it quickly, but didn't even attempt to offer to replenish the veggies that fell all over. That was surprising to me. Not anything substantial, just these tomatoes that came with his meal that he was really disappointed to have lost.And for the price.........c'mon.We laughed about the fact that the staff was all over the spill but literally only came back to deliver initial coffee, food or the check. We couldn't get a water or coffee refill for the life of us. Which we really could have used.I personally ordered their goat cheese omelette with egg whites. The goat cheese was pocketed in one small part of the omelette which bummed me out...who wants to eat just eggs in 80% of their bites? Their english muffin was not what I was expecting. Kind of resembled a popover.I don't know, I would probably visit another location, or go if I have visitors in town that want to be touristy and go. But my expectations were not met.",1

Expect to pay a bit more in this part of town. Sarabeth's is a cozy oasis in NYC. In my experience the restaurant has been clean and orderly. The entire staff has been professional and attentive.  The food is excellent. Omelettes come out hot and fluffy and never dry... just right. Pancakes and French toast are wonderful as well. Tea is served in a small pot, not simply hot water poured over a tea bag and the waiters continually refilled our coffee cups.

47,,1/28/2018,10,,"East Quogue, NY",Cameron H.,0,1.0,4,"I have always thought of this establishment as a top notch place for brunch.  The result of this assumption was to take my girlfriend here for her birthday brunch.  It was intended to be a special day where her and I went out for a nice brunch, then later attend an equally nice dinner.  Upon arriving we were told there was a 20 minute wait, which was expected.  After twenty five minutes of perusing Madison Avenue we ventured back to the restaurant.  Not only did they seat people that came in after we did, upon returning after twenty minutes, but had us wait even longer as several double tables were not only set, but vacant.  After waiting even longer we finally were seated at one of the several available tables (mind you we were only two people).   After finally being seated, it took longer to get a glass of water than the people who were seated more expeditiously than the prior half hour we had waited, not to mention the fact that one of the duo present was celebrating her birthday.  I wanted to bring my girlfriend to Sarabeth's because she had never been there, and in my past experience, the service and food was always exquisite.  I was extremely disappointed with the service.  The food was delicious, however it was a major effort to get tap water poured, ordering the food, even getting the check.  The dining experience was extremely disappointing, considering upon giving the hostess the name and specifying that it was a birthday brunch.  I have always held this restaurant in the highest regards for a brunch, but I will never overpay for food when the service is atrocious.  If you charge over twenty dollars for pancakes, maybe come see if we even like the food? Maybe if it's a birthday give someone a free coffee or pastry? However, don't make that party wait longer than a walk in, then not even acknowledge the fact that it was a brunch for someone's birthday.  Truly disappointing.  Especially after going out for dinner (on the same day) at a restaurant less expensive, with a much more attentive staff, and even better food.          I never write reviews for any place I go, however I felt it imperative that I write this because that is how unsatisfactory the experience was.  The fact that I took the  time to write this review, when I never write reviews, that this Sarabeth's has made a wrong that cannot be made right, since one cannot relive a day.",2

It had a cute interior decor that suited the upper east side vibe. We got the chicken salad for starter and I got the salmon. Chicken salad: nothing fancy or unique. I thought the chicken was a bit bland and the dressing wasn't enough to add the flavor to the chicken. Salmon: I asked for the salmon to be cooked medium but it came out more medium well but still the dish was pretty good. I think the combination of potato, string beans and salmon went together very well with the sauce. I would probably come back to try their brunch menus.",

If you don't order the toast, then the eggs just come on a plate by themselves looking very sad.

Sarabeth's is not a lost cause and with a few improvements to the menu's structure and food freshness, I think they could live up to their reputation again.",

I recommend the Goldie lox (scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and cream cheese, which creates a nice texture), braised short rib hash (comes with egg sunny side up), French toast, potato waffle, anything Benedict, and even more, but I can't list them all. I prefer the brunch over the dinner, but the dinner is pretty good too (the menu isn't super exciting, which may be part of why it's mostly older folks at night). I particularly like the mushroom risotto which now comes with delicious burrata on top, which is super creamy mozzarella for those who don't know. I also like the bread pudding dessert. I would not recommend the mac and cheese because it has more of a plain cream sauce (béchamel with nutmeg, to be exact) than cheese sauce.Tip: if you want the weekend brunch experience, make a reservation if you do not want to wait.

The food orders were wrong a lot of the group had ordered English muffins as a side and then brought scones, and then were told by the waiter that those were the English muffins.....um what?

The carpets and upholsteries clearly have not been dusted in several decades. This, however, is not the restaurant's main problem.That brings us to the food. I visited here with my mother and boyfriend. While both my mother and I were deciding between several dishes, the waiter directed us to fettuccine and meatballs, saying it was the best pasta on the menu. We both ordered it at his recommendation. What we were given was by far the worst pasta dish I have eaten in several years. The pasta was soggy and flavorless. The sauce was more like squashed tomatoes than a proper sauce. When I requested more sauce they said that was not possible. When I requested crushed red pepper flakes, I was told there was nothing of the sort. The meatballs were puny and pathetic--hardly the panko-crusted fare promised on the menu.Third, the service. All of this may not have been so bad had our waiter been attentive. He hardly checked in at our table. To be fair, it was a Sunday night and the room was full, but not full enough to merit the mere 5 times he came to our table.  When we complained about our food, he offered a complementary dessert. At that point, no one was interested in eating anything more from their kitchen. When we declined, he apologized and walked away. He left his poor busboy to handle us. My mother and I nearly gave the busboy what tip we were going to leave. Poor man. We ran a 200 dollar tab for this meal--a meal that was more like an ill-fated attempt at cooking than an actual experience.DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION.",1

It arrived about 15 minutes later. The muffin was toasted to my liking however, it was too thick for an eggs benedict. There were two little pieces of smoked salmon on each side of the muffin. My friend ordered the same thing. Both our eggs were well-done, which was not what we were use to because we like our egg yolks oozing out when you cut it. My friends were able to cut the eggs without the yolk getting everywhere (that's how cooked they were :x). The eggs could have used some salt. It was very bland. The eggs benedict also came with salad on the side. Our plates were so hot that our salad became slightly cooked and became a darker green color and soggy.Overall, my experience wasn't so pleasant.

It comes with poblano sauce but it doesn't really need it because the flavor is very good. Two eggs over easy on top made this an excellent plate. It also comes with a choice of a muffin, croissant or toast. Naturally, I opted for a toasted pumpkin muffin. Real good! They also give you their house made marmalade too - gooey good!Service was super attentive and friendly. Coffees were refilled when we were low, and it was a hot, fresh roast with every pour. The only knock on this place is the draft from the door. On cold days, the air can really rush in through the foyer and into the main dining space.

While nice for dinner I think this has the perfect feel for a cozy brunch.Their Bloody Mary's  were superbly made. And presentation with the pickled vegetables - so pretty. I had seafood Cobb salad. What an interesting salad! I love a great Cobb salad and this variation  added lobster, crab and shrimp.   Mmmm delicious! The dressing was great.The bread basket with assorted breads, very nice. Adding to the warmth was the small pastry display as well as all the jams / jellies they make and apparently sell online. Like aunties kitchen and that warmth; not something you'd see or feel in a lot of NYC restaurants. We did not have a reservation and it was a little crowded. Being seated -and the service- were a little slow, but enjoying the delicious Bloody Mary and conversation, that didn't really matter.

The three of us ordered various breakfast/brunch cocktails and damn, they were delicious and potent! I had the Five Flowers and a Bellini. Was not disappointed. The other ladies had mimosa and Sweet Symphony. Both were equally as delicious! For brunch I ordered the Spinach and Goat cheese omelette. It was fairly good! One of the ladies has a gluten allergy and that seemed to really throw the waiter off. I was a little shocked with the answer ""I think it is..."" when one has a gluten allergy that simply is unacceptable. He ended up having to go check with the chef and came back about 30 minutes later with an answer. It was frustrating. She ended up ordering the Apple Chicken Sausage and the Oatmeal (both gluten free). The other lady ordered the Kale Salad with Egg. She enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say she was thrilled!

I was staying at a hotel few blocks down and it was pouring outside and it's the only place nearby I know they made the best eggs. Upon arriving and I was seated immediately by the window. This was my second time at this location. The waiter came immediately and took my order and told him I want coffee. I waited almost 15 minutes for my coffee, I was a little bit wet from running under the rain and was expecting a hot coffee immediately. A family came in a few minutes later after I was seated and sat at the right table next to me. Finally my coffee came and the family next to me already ordered. I thought it was because they starting to get busy and I forgot about the wait. My ordered came the same time as the family next to me. My coffee was empty and saw the waiter refilling the family coffee next to me and thought his gonna filled my cup too. No! He didn't even asked or looked my way to see if my cup is empty. I began eating my breakfast and try not to think about it. I saw how immediately they provide service to the table next to me but seems to forget me sitting there. The other table on my left, were being served immediately. They kept checking up on them and I felt invisible sat there by myself. As soon as I finished eating, the waiter came around and asked if I want another coffee, I said yes politely and thanking him all the time. He came back and I told him to bring the check, he brought the check and I gave him my card. When he left with my card, I stood up and went to the bathroom. As soon as I came back, I saw my coat being removed and my table was moved too. I wasn't ready to live and it seems like they want me out of there immediately. The waiters moving the tables because a big group was came in and they put my check on the table behind. I signed my receipt and still gave them 20% tips. I was shocked how they made me feel like I don't belong in there. It is not the feeling I want to experience in my lifetime and it was the first time I experience from this so called top notch.

They make a mean bloody Mary as well. The only other place I compare Sarabeth's to is Clinton Street bakery and (As small as they are compared to sarabeths) wins by a landslide.

Even if you go lunch there during the week, they still have egg benedicts available to satisfy your weekday brunch craving. The food here is good, the servers are always courteous and polite, and the bloody mary here is pleasant. That being said, there's a few elements to Sarabeth's that make the whole experience mediocre for me.I think first and foremost, Sarabeth's is expensive. You can certainly get food and cocktails of equal quality for cheaper in the neighborhood. I'm also not sure how I feel about the crowd that Sarabeth's attracts. This is great for a calm family outing, but the people that come here are the cliche Upper East Side residents.  You have sweet, wealthy old grannies coming here to catch up alongside bratty 15 year olds pulling out credit cards for their 'casual' Sunday brunch.

Yes there will be at least a 40-minute wait here, but this is New York. If you don't see a wait for brunch, then you're likely at the wrong restaurant.I had the lemon and ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries, and my goodness, they were DELICIOUS. Last week, I had the famous blueberry pancakes at Clinton St. Baking Company, and while those were already super delicious, I thought these were just mind blowing. I love the super buttery texture combined with the lemony flavoring. The fresh strawberries also added a nice touch of sweetness. The extra maple syrup and butter just made the meal all the more amazing. For $18, you get 5 pancakes, pretty standard for New York. I was so, so full and so happy by the end. I've heard so much about Sarabeth's and given its 3.5 rating, I really wasn't expecting THAT much, but those lemon and ricotta pancakes have easily made Sarabeth's one of my new favorite brunch spots in the city.The service here is also spectacular! Our waiter was super friendly. We gobbled down our food in less than 20 minutes, but he did not rush us to leave despite the long line waiting for brunch. Instead, he refilled our water many times. It was only when we asked for the check that he brought it.Also, if you're interested in people-watching and experiencing life in the Upper East Side, Sarabeth's is a good place to do it.

The veggie frittata was make a dry open-face omelet. I took the salsa from the hash and used that. Good veggies, but the rest was nothing special. The eggs on the Benedict were done perfectly, though it could've used more hollandaise sauce. The red omelet had good flavor, as did the hash (from what I could tell they enjoyed their meals). It seems the winners were the raspberry and strawberry preserves with the freshly-baked scones and muffins.

I don't like marmalade which it comes with in general so I asked to try other flavors. They brought strawberry peach and mixed berry. The mixed berry was the best! You can even buy little jars to take home. The service was great and once you are seated you forget that you even had to wait to get in.

Nobody in the entire Manhattan does that!The second time we were going to have dinner in the restaurant. One of the dishes we ordered was meatballs.

The person taking down names had her nose up high enough that I was surprised it wasn't grazing the ceiling. The waiters were clueless. The crowd was, well, the crowd that frequents Sarabeth's. But I would have forgiven it all had the food been worth the $40 that I parted with. The guacamole with crab meat was some of the worst guac I've had. Okay, okay, Sarabeth's is not your authentic neighborhood cantina. But eggs? Can you do eggs without making a soggy mess of it? Can you give me toast that is warm and not so hard I worry for my teeth? If not, what business do you have calling yourself a brunch place and charging through the nose for it? I will never return, to this branch or any of the others. Such a waste of time and money.",

I arrived around 9am and the wait was about half an hour, not bad at all. However, larger parties (4+) had to wait longer. I love the display of the baked goods in the bakery, which is in front of the restaurant when you enter. The menu offered enough options but not overwhelming. There's a category for breakfast and one for lunch. Underneath the breakfast category, food was broken down by taste (sweet, savory, etc). I tried the potato waffle with apple and chicken sausage, and some of the almond crusted French toast with strawberry sauce drizzle, with a side of bacon. Not only did the food look good, but tasted amazing. Everything looked so good, I had to order something to drink -mimosa. The Orange juice was fresh squeezed and the champagne was very good. My waitress was very friendly and efficient. Although food is on the pricier side, it was worth every penny. The portions are great and the food was fresh.  I fell in love with this place and wish that I could bring it back to California with me.

There is a stuffiness for all fo the simple, comfort food they offer and adds to the popular theory that NYC is far too expensive for everyone to live.Brunch seems to be the most popular time for most visitors. There is a wait on the weekend, even with reservations sometimes and its best to scope out the menu ahead of time to ease the ordering. Most entrees are between $14-19, which sides at around $7 each. Theoretically with everything combined, it'd be roughly a $35 meal, but that's only if you decide put together a typical breakfast (eggs, potatoes, whatever else).If I'm going to order anything, I'm likely to get the Goldie Lox Scramble ($16), a rich scramble of lox and cream cheese, which comes with a muffin, scone, croissant, or toast. I'm always tempted to get their benedict combos or even huevos rancheros, but the $18-19 price tag is a little bit of a buzzkill. In the end, what's an additional $3 anyway? To save you the trouble of ordering it, they're hardly worth the price tag.Brunch not so appealing? Dinner is going to be a similar page, with most entrees hovering around the $23-30 mark. I've had decent results with the Grilled Long Island Duck Breast ($25) and the Pan Roasted Filet of Sole ($24) isn't half bad either.

There is pretty much always a wait for this location, and sometimes the host can be a bit rude/curt.

We split a pickled Bloody Mary and their famous cream of tomato soup. The drink was sour and horseradish dominant and topped with plenty of pickled carrots, bell peppers, etc. The soup was perfect for this slightly rainy day. It had chunks of tomatoes, cream, plenty of cheese and served with side of bread & butter. The combination felt like Campbell Tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. Chloe had the omelette with cream cheese and chives. The simplicity of three ingredients blends was extraordinary. I had the short ribs with onion/potato hash topped with two sunny side up eggs and a side tomatillo salsa. The hash was very onion forward and green tomato salsa was thin.

We waited about 15 minutes for a table for five on a Saturday morning.

I also had the Pork Apricot Sausage, served in orange-apricot marmalade. The sausage was as heavenly as a ground-up meat product can be.My partner wasn't as lucky. He ordered the crab omelet, but had trouble finding any crab in it. In fact, after no one at our table was able to find any crab in it, he sent it back. A waitress brought it back to the table and said it DID contain crab, but that the pieces were quite small. She offered a small dish of crab meat, which he accepted. Unfortunately, the crab in the dish was cold, so it didn't blend well with the hot omelet. Another of our party had the same omelet made with egg whites and there was no problem finding the crab in that.Sarabeth's is known for its baked goods, and the table had toast (which had to be sent back because it wasn't toasted) and a pumpkin muffin, among other things. All were delicious.Three of our party had Bloody Marys, which looked like miniature jungles.The staff is perfectly efficient, but the lack of friendliness borders on hostility. We would say something to our waitress, and though she heard and acted on what we said, she didn't acknowledge it. I'd chalk it up to her having a bad day, but other staff members behaved similarly.

172,,8/18/2013,26,,"Manhattan, NY",Kathy Y.,38,4.0,111,"Sarabeth's on UES is one of the few places in the city that has lived up to its hype and expectations. My wait on Sunday morning was 10 minutes without reservation, and the waitress seated us by the large window, where we had requested. The food came surprisingly fast (this place is a brunch machine!), and the food was set neat and clean on the plate for a lovely presentation. My ""Mixed Vegetable, Gruyere & Bacon Frittata"" ($15) was thick, plump and fluffy. The top was lightly browned, with a soft cheesy inside. The vegetable and bacon were evenly distributed with light-moderate amount of cheese to hold all the ingredients together - my clean plate was a proof of that! With this warm, chewy texture, the taste was splendid. The brunch dishes come with a ""side"" of muffin or toast - definitely go for the muffins. My friend had corn muffin, while I ordered bran muffin. The bran muffin was sweeter and crunchier than I expected, but the corn muffin was firm and moist. I recommend the sangria, too. The wine could have been stronger, but I enjoyed the fruitiness nonetheless. One pitcher fills 5-6 glasses, and I DEFINITELY had way more than I needed (let's just say we had a very fun time at the museum afterwards...). Compared to most brunch places, you will pay more for what you get. The brunch dishes don't come with potatoes or salad. But the meal is still very filling, and for the quality of food, I give Sarabeth's a thumbs up.",1

My sister had Eggs Benedict and that tasted very good. We waited about 20 minutes to get a table, not that bad. The service was great and it was very busy. Def. will come back again.",1

The Upper East side location felt elegant and refined, perfect for our brunch.I had the eggs benedict, and split an order of pancakes. Very tasty and fun time!",
176,,4/21/2014,10,,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",Vanessa A.,32,5.0,22,"This place is simply delicious. I came here for brunch on Easter Sunday and yes I had to wait a while but it was worth it.I had the Big Breakfast and substituted the pancakes for the fluffy French toast. Yum! (Careful, my friend substituted her eggs for egg whites and there was an extra charge of $2.50.) On their brunch menu it says that they ""politely decline any substitutions during brunch"" but that's not all true.I also had a peach Bellini, perfect. Oh and the best part of my meal was my dessert. I ordered their bread pudding with raspberry deliciousness! Heaven in my mouth! It's more of a custard but definitely worth a try. Now the prices maybe a little high depending on how you spend your mula but it's definitely worth every penny! Caitlin is also an awesome server! She has a sense of humor which is always a plus!",
177,1,3/2/2013,785,1,"New York, NY",Victoria O.,371,5.0,815,"In a word: GLORIOUS. This is of course a very famous place, with a touristy branch on Central Park South and another on the UWS I've never been. I didn't know about the Tribeca one as I never go down there. I haven't even been to SoHo for Balthazar in 3 years. One does get stuck in a cluster of neighborhoods and Tribeca isn't one of mine when in the city. This would be the fantasy house: cozy, elegant and quintessentially Upper East Side (well, 80s and 90s between 5th and Lex). I walked 30 blocks, in the mood for a day outside, and when I arrived before 2PM, the wait was just 10 minutes. They told me 20 minutes but it was more like 10 and I got one of the booth tables for two, with no one on one side (middle obstruction). I had been here once, not to eat, just for coffee and muffins and I loved everything about it. It's pricey, yes, but when most (slender to average) women consume a huge lunch like this, they don't eat dinner so whatever. I found quite a nice Malbec for 11/glass which is far from out of line with wines by the glass in the city, which tend to be a good 20% above comparable restaurants in West LA or SB, particularly at nice hotel bars--the Pen, Gramercy Hotel--which are truly outrageous. I was tempted by lemon ricotta pancakes which my server said were the absolute best among the pancake/waffle offerings--but I had a very rare half a pastry for breakfast (prune hamantashen for Purim from the Bread Factory), so I just didn't want a sweet lunch. (On the online menu I saw a pasta with crab meat I intended to have but it wasn't on the menu for whatever reason. The specials included a curry, carrot and saffron soup with crab meat I sampled and liked but didn't think was over-the-top great) and the signature decadent ""velvet cream of tomato."" The BLT frittata was bacon, lobster and something else but I just am not much of a bacon person except on a cobb so I passed.)Sarabeth's has made a national brand out of their jam--I bought a friend a FB birthday gift of three small jams last month--and I had that on sourdough. Unlike almost every breakfast place I've been--and breakfast is one of my things--you have to order potatoes on the side (7 or 8 I think), so even if you have the very cheapest omelets (cheese for 13 or spinach and goat cheese for 15), you're looking at low 20s for an omelet. It is , however, huge and perfect so if that offends you, this is not the place to go for brunch. The pancakes/waffles are 17--""sweet breakfast""--and the couple next to me ordered the salmon benedict and blintzes to split. I have only tried blintzes once or twice--not a big LA thing and I don't even know if Fromin's, our family Jewish deli, serves them--but these looked orgasmic as I posted on FB from my phone during a long, lingering lunch. The hot Toddy was tepid but it was close enough for government work: Makers, honey, lemon (12). One quibble: the mimosa is 10 (fine) but they serve J ROGET?! The dive-y now defunct Peabody's in Montecito and Steve's, my local diner in SB walking distance from my apartment, served what my Michigan wine business friend calls J ROTGUTOn the upside, they have fresh squeezed blood orange to go with this bargain basement champagne. But I did get a laugh with the girls next to me ordered Mimosas and that's what they brought to the table. The Bloody Mary looked too adventurous and sophisticated for me--""pickled"" with jicama and other spices--so I played it safe. My spinach and goat cheese omelet was simple but truly outstanding. I have to try to lemon ricotta pancakes before I leave next Saturday. From 59th to 86th St is no big deal and then just 7 blocks walking and I forgot just HOW much I love the 70s and the 80s. Great architecture, people watching and window shopping. The service is great. I took much longer than usual to decide what I wanted and the server did not pressure me. Of course I did spend 35 bucks JUST on booze (three drinks) so it's not like I was drinking tap water the whole time. Love, love, love.",3
178,1,1/5/2016,3,1,"Bronx, NY",Roger C.,2,3.0,15,"Came here with colleagues as part of a work holiday outing. Good ambiance, good service. Not too many people but that was probably because it was pouring out, which worked out in our favor since even though it was a large group there was no rush to free up space. Overall the food was average. The muffin basket was good, the pancakes were okay, but not as good as expected given the high praise for the breakfast/brunch menu. The shrimp cocktail below average, the home fries cold. The one dish that did stand out was the Cream of Tomato soup. It was delicious and might be worth a return visit. Decent place, would give it 3.5 stars if I could.",2
179,1,9/7/2013,32,,"San Diego, CA",Audrey T.,13,3.0,228,"We were glad we visited Sarabeth's during a weekday morning - no line ups! Sarabeth's is a quaint and lovely little restaurant and has been a long-time favourite of the neighbourhood.What we liked about it:- decent Brunch selection- good bread choices- good jam!- good portionsHowever, the food didn't wow us. I ordered the farmers omelette but couldn't finish it because it somehow felt too rich for me. I did appreciate the healthy amount of cheese in it. My husband had the salmon Benny which was presented beautifully, but he noted that it wasn't a true poached egg. The two bites I had of it was delicious though! In summary, we thought the food was decent, but did not warrant their prices. The service was friendly and good though!",
180,,6/17/2015,7,,"Blythewood, SC",Carolyn G.,0,3.0,31,"Sarabeth's was the most expensive breakfast I have ever had in my life. Yes, the food was wonderful, but still not worth the price on most items. We ordered:1- crab cake Eggs Benedict@ $241- lemon ricotta pancakes@ $18.502- mimosas@$14.00/ea.2- Coffees@ $4.00/ea.By the time you add tax and tip to the bill, it was a few cents shy of $100.00.I was not mad about the cost because the food was really good, but if I go back I would order differently. The service was so-so. I could not even tell if we had a waiter or a waitress. One person took our order and another brought the bill. Had to request refills on coffee and water. In this price range, I expect attentive service, yes even in NYC.So my advice to future diners is: skip the lemon ricotta pancakes that everyone raves about (not that special). Go for the Eggs Benedict, it truly was the best I have ever had. This place could have gotten 5 stars on the Eggs Benedict, but the service and prices took it down to 3.",
181,,5/11/2013,189,,"Miami, FL",Ali M.,126,3.0,89,"I came here 2 times before. My first time was actually a great experience, my first time having egg Benedict's which I must say is incredible. However, after coming a second time and having experienced so many other egg Benedict's, I realized this place is not worth the 2 hour wait I had to waste both times. You can get better egg Benedict brunch for less the price and less the wait. I don't think it was worth the money or time. I wouldn't come again. It's just a famous place and it's not living up to its name.",1
182,1,12/5/2014,16,1,"Queens, NY",Jason C.,38,3.0,411,"The food here is really good. Although you will certainly shell out a good amount. While ordering brunch for two: 2 entrees, 2 mimosas, and 1 coffee was easily over $100+ after tipping.This place would do well to better manage the lines of customers that show up in droves to eat here. When you enter there is a pretty narrow area where the line of waiting to be seated and takeaway customers clash. It's pretty claustrophobic.I ordered the Crab Cake eggs benedict. The english muffins were thicker than the store bought ones most people are used to which was perfect. I hated the mush that was my crabcake, it was soggy breaded mess. The eggs were properly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Overall, not impressed and the salt in the wound was the price. a little more crab with the cake please.My friend ordered the toasted coconut waffle and said it was scrumptious. She's a picky eater so it had to have been good. Service was okay, although we were barely there for 25 minutes and we could feel the staff itching to ""push"" our table. Understandable because there is a long line, but brunch in 25 minutes while other tables around us had been seated for much longer astonished me.The food is great, but not sure if I am paying for less than excellent food and service that is rushing me.",3

I went with the red omelet.  This omelet had red peppers, tomato sauce, and cheese stuffed inside the eggs.  While the eggs were perfectly cooked, I felt like it was all peppers inside my omelet and not much else.  Was it tasty?  Yes.  Was it what it was described as on the menu?  No.  I chose a scone for my side.  I was given a chocolate chip scone with preserves.  The scone was good and the preserves were great and fresh.  The bloody mary's here deserve 5 stars.  They are huge and fantastic.  I asked for mine extra-spicy and they did just as I asked and I was pleased.  They also come with fresh vegetables thrown in, which was a nice touch.  I would come here just to drink a bloody mary, eat a scone, and hang out in their large bathroom.  What?",

A recommend if you love pouchy, runny eggs!  2. Sarabeth's famous tomato soup- rich, thick, mixed in with actual chunks of tomatoes.  I enjoyed it during my taste.. better yet, eat it with the bread that they give you!3.
