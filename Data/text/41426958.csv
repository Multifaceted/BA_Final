0,Erinlynn S.,"La Habra, CA",0,18,0.0,5.0,10/1/2018,Cannot day enough good things about this place. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed and taken care of. We flew in on a red eye and they were extremely accommodating with bottled water and coffee while we waited for a room to be available. Each time we returned to the hotel there was some sort of snack or goodie available in the lobby and David and Henry greeted us with a smile and knew us by name. It is a great location close to the subway and a short walk to Times Square.,,,
1,Carley A.,"Baton Rouge, LA",627,57,10,1.0,11/5/2018,"We recently stayed here and the experience was beyond terrible. First of all, the rooms are the size of a closet. I know that rooms in New York are typically small, but these were smaller than normal. Also, one of the the elevators was broken and we had to walk up 23 flights of stairs to get to and from our room. It would take 30 minutes or more waiting for the elevator. There was nowhere to eat breakfast because the space was so small also. Our air conditioner also broke and it was beyond hot in the room. We called the front desk several times and we never got service. I am a Hilton diamond member so I was extremely disappointed in the service. We had to move hotels after the first night because it was so unbearable to stay there. I ended up getting refunded, but it was after I called several people at corporate and made a fuss out of it. The staff there was not helpful whatsoever. I do not recommend anyone staying here.",,,
2,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,3.0,12/14/2017,"There are tons of awesome hotels in NYC, and this is what I would classify as an average one. This Hampton Inn is located near Times Square, and this is a great location if you're a tourist looking to explore.  Beyond that however, it's very average in terms of offering.The rooms are clean, but very small. The queen size bed took up a good chunk of my room and there was also a desk and large sized furniture piece serving as a tv stand and closet. Between all of that, there wasn't much room to walk. The bathroom was fine, but also small.One  one plus was the view from the room. I stayed on a high floor so had some pretty awesome views of time square and the surrounding streets. The rooms were also quiet with no noise coming from what is a very busy area.Overall, this is a hotel for convenience and price. Beyond that, I would say there are other hotels that offer larger rooms and many more amenities in the area.",7,3,4
3,Danny P.,"Falls Church, VA",307,525,189,3.0,9/5/2017,"I'm of the belief that a hotel really needs to do one thing well -- let me sleep well so that I can wake up and do the things the next day that I need to do.And this hotel does that just fine.It's not fancy, and you're likely to wait for two or three elevators to come and go before there will be enough room for you to get on one as the main lobby is super packed all the time, especially in the mornings, but it does the job.Breakfast is, as their signs indicate, also incredibly crowded in the morning if you're not an early riser, and there's not a ton of room in the breakfast area to sit so best to get there first thing.They also do that ""green"" thing where they shut off the a/c if someone hasn't moved in the room in an hour or two, which makes total sense when I'm in the office at 2pm, but not when I'm sleeping on sweated-through sheets at 2am. Make sure to buy a balloon before you check in.",1,3,
4,Michael T.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,33,16,1.0,6/7/2018,"If I could give zero stars I would.  I'm actually surprised Hilton allows their flag on this.  The hotel is in a great location but terrible sized. The elevators are slow and one was broken ( they knew this). The breakfast was overcrowded and disgusting (they know this).  My room had a broken toilet handle so the toilet ran all night.  They broke all the buttons off the ac / heater unit so you can't stop or alter it, my inner sheets had lipstick on them, the shower door was broken.  Plain and simple the place is a *hithole.  Check the photos",,,
5,Miles L.,"San Francisco, CA",29,33,1,2.0,5/5/2018,"Elevators were having consistent problems. In-room coffee station wasn't stocked for the majority of the stay, and was only rectified after the 3rd complaint. Shower drain was backed up, causing me to have to stand ankle deep in sewage.The location isn't bad if you plan to use the subway. If you plan to drive or be driven, it's a terrible location. There is major construction across the street, which is admittedly temporary, but 39th Street is a Lincoln Tunnel approach, so there will be heavy traffic on the street pretty much forever.There is also a hot dog stand garage next door. The operators don't pay any attention to what or who is in their way as they bring their carts in and out. This same building next door also has an unsafe scaffolding/sidewalk shed that is leaning toward the hotel on several bent supports.",,,1
6,Bella W.,"Columbia, SC",680,34,61,5.0,2/26/2018,"My mom and I stayed here for a few nights while visiting NYC. The location was good, the room was clean, and it was all around just an easy place to stay. Everyone that works here is VERY nice. We didn't have any problems during our experience. Our friends, who stayed in a nearby room, were also happy with the hotel. The front desk holds bags the morning of check-out. They actually held onto ours until 8 or 9 pm, which was so great and worked out really well. We also used their computer room one evening to print out broadway tickets we had previously bought online- super convenient. Breakfast nice, too....my mom would meet our friends downstairs, then later would bring up a muffin or banana for me while I got ready.",1,,1
7,Tom L.,"Chicago, IL",28,29,4,1.0,8/6/2018,"I'm never staying here again. The room was small and the high floor city view is a complete rip off as the only sights is another tall building next to it. To make things worse they only have two elevators in a 30 floor hotel and when I was there one of the elevators was working and the other was not functioning. There was long lines for the elevator and always crammed. To top it all off, on my last night there, there was flies in my shower. This hotel is hot garbage and if you are appealed by how cheap it is, it is cheap for a reason. It is the literal the worst Hilton I've stayed in my life and I use to travel and stay in Hilton's so I have been to at least 10+ different Hilton's. Stay away.",,,
8,Shilpa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,8,2,1.0,6/12/2018,"If you can have the worst possible experience ever at any hotel, this is where you should go! My parents who're not US residents and not credit card holders, were booked at this hotel by their tour and had a night's stay which was nothing less than a nightmare. They're tired after a long flight and all they wanted was to spend their pre-booked room and take next morning flight. But instead they're denied check in into the hotel since they did not have a credit card. They offered cash, I offered my credit card detail over the phone but no, my almost 60yo elderly parents were made to sit in their filthy chairs till 9pm instead of an entry into their already booked room. Only after my husband's uncle presented a card who reached there around 9pm all the way traveling for 2 hrs, they're allowed to enter the room which was nothing more than a filthy room with dirty carpet and barely minimum walking space! We recently stayed at a small hotel at a near by small city and the room was totally the other way around and way beyond the standards of this room. I could never imagine that a hotel can discriminate against elderly international visitors who don't have credit cards and offering their ids, cash, I offering mine over the phone. And the front desk people were so rude in even talking over the phone that I could imagine the plight of my parents. Even their tour manager talked to them but the front desk people were so rude and impolite! Totally disgusting and the most in humane experience I could ever imagine and to my sheer disappointment this was the first time my parents went somewhere in the US all by themselves.",1,,
9,Mindi S.,"Woodway, TX",108,2,1,4.0,4/23/2018,"I'm giving 4 stars because the hotel shuttle service was crazy expensive. I took the advice of the hotel staff and let them call their shuttle for my return flight. I was stuck paying the $60 ($70 with tip) fare to get from the hotel to LaGuardia via hotel shuttle when I paid $44 with tip to get from LaGuardia to the hotel via cab and via the same route which included a toll. Had I known there was such a huge price difference, I would have used another method of transportation. Shame on me for not asking the fare and for trusting the staff to be responsible with my money...Setting aside this irritating issue, I was very happy with my room, the continental breakfast, the service, and the location of the hotel. Our room was on the fifth floor, which was perfect for taking the stairs when the elevators were slow or full, which was often, but not a prob bc I like the extra exercise. I recommend asking for a room on a lower level so that you can take the stairs if you don't want to wait for the elevators. The continental breakfast was perfect. The staff was always friendly and greeted me with a smile. I appreciate that. As for the buffet, whoa. There are lots and lots of hungry people. You know what they say about buffets...and this one is free...it's like cows to a trough. It's every man (woman) for himself and everyone is gearing up for a busy day. That being said, not once did i see that the buffet was low on food or supplies. There was plenty of everything, including coffee. Kudos to the staff for staying vigilant about making sure there was enough food for the latecomers such as myself. The eating area gets crowded, so I recommend going early to avoid walking around aimlessly waiting for people to leave. We got lucky and found seating in the lobby. Noise in Times Square is awful. People, horns, sirens, garbage trucks, etc. I've stayed at some hotels in NYC and sleep is disrupted all night. My room was on the side of the building and not once was I awakened by street noise. The view was of another building but who cares. I needed a place to shower, lay my head at night, and rest. I'm not in the room for the views...The location of the hotel was convenient to everything: subways, Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller plaza, etc. Had it not been for the one mishap involving my money and my transportation, I would have given this hotel 5 stars bc they nailed it on everything. I'll be back and next time, I'll arrange my own transportation...",,,
10,Laura M.,"Tampa, FL",49,5,7,4.0,7/9/2018,Small room and hard to regulate temperature. Breakfast was good. Very convenient location within walking distance to port authority.,,,
11,Eagle N.,"Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands",9,156,23,2.0,1/26/2018,I give 2 stars as of how management and staff told a mis truth and said it was a Hilton that caused the issue. Upon a conversation with Hilton it turns out it was the property at fault.The rooms were clean and the typical size of many NYC properties.I found it helpful to have a microwave and mini refrigerator.The WiFi was sufficient for my needs.The breakfast was typical Hampton.I cannot recommend this property as of my negative experience. There are far to many other Hilton's one could select in the area.,,,
12,Gabbi G.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,8,0,5.0,9/8/2018,"We had originally made a reservation at a hotel a couple doors down, but our reservation was mysteriously ""cancelled"" without notice. Needing to book somewhere quick, I went online and made our reservation here. Everyone we encountered from the front desk staff to the breakfast and housekeeping staff were extremely friendly and upbeat. They all seemed to really enjoy working here. The hotel is very clean and our room was cozy. It was also nice having something new on the menu each morning for breakfast. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again!",,,
13,Mike W.,"Kokomo, IN",0,22,6,4.0,8/5/2018,Would have loved to give this place 5 stars but the elevator situation is not good. Only one working elevator for a packed house doesn't work too well. 30 minutes wait to take it down 21 floors for breakfast and then a nice 21 floor hike back up the stairs. Food was great. Needless to say we asked to be moved to a lower level the next morning and the staff was more than helpful and polite. I didn't mind using the stairs from a lower level. Very clean place and restful night sleep.,1,,
14,Jose A. R.,"Orlando, FL",414,199,429,4.0,1/19/2016,"This hotel was excellent. The location was great! The staff was super nice and very sweet. The place was under some renovations during my stay, but they ensured that my experience was excellent. There was no noise disturbance or anything of the sort.The rooms were a bit small and there was only two elevators which was kind of a bummer. However, the view was great! Overall, I had a really nice experience and I wouldn't mind coming back to this hotel! :)",4,1,3
15,Christina J.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",30,33,32,4.0,8/12/2017,"via mobile Pending reviewI really liked this quaint hotel in the middle of New York's craziness ... I have stayed a few times in NY before from The W, Hyatt Times Square, Candlewood Suites, amd now Hampton Inn .... I kid you not, this cute little spot beat them all .... Of course paying for something like The W you will get a big tall building and a room with more space, but honestly the price isn't worth it .... Here at the Hampton Inn your room is definitely ""cozy"", but this is pretty much the norm in NY, especially considering the actual building size ... They did a wonderful job in remodeling these rooms and piecing it together to give you as much room and functionality as possible ... Staff is very nice and welcoming .... Complimentary breakfast, and 24/7 coffee ... You cannot beat the price either, so affordable. With the hotel being 39th and 9th you have both sides of the street on non-stop bodegas, restaurants, grocery stores ... just get on 9th and you can walk from like 36th all the up past 56th with so many options ... Look up Hell's Kitchen and you will see that this area is dedicated to awesome eateries... I will most definitely stay here again when coming back to NYC!!",,,1
16,John W.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,285,151,3.0,4/25/2016,"This is a nice hotel in a great location. Close to all of the theaters, Times Square, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, Hell's Kitchen and public transportation.  Very nice staff. Room we had was very clean, well furnished and a really good size for a building that is very small overall. The complimentary breakfast was about the same as most other competitors in this price range, which consisted of a good selection of items in mediocre quality.The only downside about this hotel is that there are only 2 elevators for a building that has 36+ floors, so plan ahead for anything you have scheduled or for checking out on-time. Also; There was a bit of a wining sound that we heard during the day, so don't plan on getting any sleep if you have to during the daytime hours. If we could score a good rate for a room here, we would stay again, but will be considering elsewhere for a future trip to NYC.",,,1
17,Kimberlee M.,"Peabody, MA",0,2,0,1.0,6/9/2018,I did not find my experience here pleasant at all. First of all it is the tiniest most crammed hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff wasn't nice. They don't have a lobby bathroom and only have one for use in the basement which was clogged and disgusting. Then we went to shower and there were bugs all over it in our room on the 30th floor. Will never stay again. So overpriced. $400 for one night but it was Tony awards weekend.,1,,
18,Yoonmi D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/28/2018,"Front desk staff is very rude.

20,Cee D.,"Providence, RI",22,234,11,3.0,2/27/2017,"I would give the breakfast 4 stars, hot, clean and nice selection.  Hotel staff was mediocre.  I would not stay here again because the elevator was down for two days and apparently it happens frequently. So we had to wait for the one elevator that was working was caused us to change our plans.  We ended up getting the room for 1/2 off, but I would re-think staying there again.  Concierge was useless.  Had to ask 3 different staff members before I got the wi fi password.",1,,
21,Christopher W.,"Orlando, FL",119,140,44,4.0,3/21/2016,"We stayed here on our first trip to NYC. The location was perfect as it was only a few blocks from Times Square so after a long day of exploring the city it was always a quick walk back to the warmth of our cozy room. When I was there, the hotel was undergoing renovations. I wasn't informed of this at the time of booking but when I arrived at the hotel the front desk staff ensured me that noise wouldn't be an issue and if it was to let them know and they would handle it. Thankfully they were right. We weren't disturbed by the contractors at all and it is always nice to see a hotel taking the steps to keep their property fresh. I do have two complaints. One is the elevators. There are only two elevators and over 30 floors. So if you are there during busy seasons then you can expect to wait up to 10 minutes for a ride. Also, the housekeeping and maintenance staff don't have an employee elevator so it can get crowded if you get stuck in the elevator with a cleaning cart. I paid extra for an upgrade for a city view. It was disappointing because my city view was of the hotel next door which was also under construction.Other than those two complaints I enjoyed the hotel. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and I appreciate the attentiveness of the staff.",4,2,3
22,Collin I.,"Ewa Beach, HI",7,97,116,4.0,2/23/2015,"Hotel was very nice and clean. Room had a great city view. Spacious enough for 2 adults and a teenager, although there really wasn't a place to put your luggage. A BIG plus was the free breakfast selection every morning from 6AM - 10AM. I made the most of it everyday. The staff was very friendly. The ONLY downside was the location was a little far from a subway hub. Closest trains were the A,C,and E about a block up. No biggie for us, but something to take into consideration.Overall we really enjoyed !!",6,,1
23,Marc M.,"Overland Park, KS",9,83,25,5.0,10/25/2016,"Nice, clean hotel conveniently located near Times Square. While I have stayed at larger properties in the area, I do like and recommend this location for its simplicity and cleanliness.",1,,1
24,Gary C.,"Blacksburg, VA",6,19,4,4.0,4/9/2017,"This hotel was recently remodeled and looked great. As are most hotels in NYC, the rooms are small and the showers are a pretty tight fit. I'm 6ft 200lbs and my shoulders could basically touch each side of the shower walls. So, if you're bigger than me, it could be tricky to lather up. The staff was pleasant and the breakfast bar adequate, but if you're in NYC, I recommend getting out and trying local fares. The elevators are pretty slow and the wait times can be quite long. I suggest staying on the lower levels so you can take the stairs if you're in a hurry. We would definitely stay here again. It's a ten minute walk to the Broadway district and Penn Station. Plenty of Ubers. Also, it's bed bug free.",2,1,1

Came back to a 72F room. 4 separate visits by maintenance came in from 11 pm - 2 am to finally resolve the issue by replacing the thermostat...Con:- There are only 2 elevators at this property and the elevator jams up at peak hours...stopping at every other floor.- ""Warm"" water take a good 5 minutes from the really small shower...- Face towels were missing on the first night- Part of the housekeeper rubber glove was found on top of my bath towel...- Elevator sounds woke me up in the morning...- The mattress is very basic (bonnell springs) which means that the mattress is only good for 1 person (no motion separation)- ...the mattress was pretty stained and there was no mattress topper...Complimentary breakfast was helpful and the items changed daily. They also had a station with FREE hot beverages throughout the day.Wifi was complimentary but slow...tough to upload pics on Yelp!",6,2,2
26,Brian B.,"Chicago, IL",33,1103,999,4.0,7/23/2016,"I have stayed in hundreds of Hilton properties along with Hampton's all over the world and in general, they are usually all good. The diamond status gets you some extra perks usually like room upgrades and waters or snacks. This Hampton was very clean I thought, very good staff at the front desk and the breakfast was a little better than the average Hampton offering. Rooms a little smaller than a typical Hampton room but this is NYC so expected. The only annoyance at all was only two elevators for all those floors which meant waiting 5 to 7 minutes for one to show up that you can get on. So give yourself extra time to get downstairs each day. Otherwise would stay here again. Decent location right off 9th Ave. and surrounded by places to eat and general shopping.",2,,

Updated review","I've stayed at other Times Square hotels but prefer this one the most for its location, quieter than most but still very close to everything, especially the food in Hell's Kitchen. Their rooms were very nice and clean as they've recently renovated, not too small comparing to others in Manhattan. Don't expect Vegas style rooms here, nothing like the Venetian or Bellagio.  The staff was very helpful and polite. Complimentary breakfast could get chaotic/ though limited but edible. I think I've found myself a ""repeat"" hotel whenever I'm in NY again. BUT, please do fix the elevator situation. For example, separate service elevator(s) would ease up the traffic, especially around breakfast and check-out times.",1,,
47,Richard R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",14,21,0,5.0,5/3/2015,"I award 5-Stars based on superior location, extra quiet room on 25, and friendly staff (both at Front Desk & the breakfast room). This is a 'sliver' meaning 32 stories tall and only 6 rooms per floor. Shout outs to Mgr. Victor and Server Alexander.Our room couldn't have been quieter. Never heard a neighbor on the floor. Pleasant 20-something guests at breakfast. We used the A Train 3 times in 48 hours. It's right around the block on 8th Avenue at 40th. We bought 6-packs & Italian sub sandwiches on 9th Ave. and 39th. There's a cute Thai place on 9th we will try next time. And don't miss Tir Na Nog two doors east (open early & late) -- 212-760-0072. Super nice Irish bar staff and affordable apps like muscles in cream sauce with garlic toast or shepherds pie.Negatives: two slow elevators, small European style lobby with OK seating (but we got a room before 3:00 PM on a Friday). Will be returning in fall 2015.",,,
48,Brien M.,"Ballston Spa, NY",7,95,36,5.0,10/9/2012,"I was thinking of 4 stars but only because of the size of the room. Since absolutely nothing else was a problem and this may be typical for Manhattan, I went with 5. So here goes ...Nice young woman at the front desk. In our second conversation, she already remembered our last name. With a lot going on, that was a pleasant surprise. There was also a gentleman acting as concierge when we arrived and he was very, very helpful.Rate: I searched many hotel sites and referral services for a fair rate. Every place that I expected to provide a quality experience was way too high. Somehow I stumbled on this Hampton, a brand I always trust. Wow, the rate was much lower than others. Nice!Cleanliness: fine -- a few hairs on the wall of the shower but that's it. They push the cleanliness of their bedding and I believe the ads are right on -- very clean -- no worries. In other hotels I throw the bedspread on the floor because I don't think they get washed every time. Everything was also up to date and modern. I love the pillows.Elevator: we had no trouble and we were on the 26th floor.Location: Easy walk from Penn Station and subway stops. Safe enough neighborhood.Breakfast: One of the better hotel breakfasts in terms of variety. I've stayed in other chains with half as many items. The coffee was very good and available when I wanted an afternoon cup. Yes, they have the traditional cookie service.Wi-Fi: It was fast in our room and since I have an AT&T phone, there was no login on the AT&T router.I don't know what else to say. We were very happy with our choice and would go back without hesitation.",2,,
49,Diane C.,"Portsmouth, NH",23,17,11,3.0,4/29/2016,Room was clean and staff is friendly and professional so 3 stars.  We were on a short 3 day vacation with 2 pre-teens and the double room was just too small and we were told all the rooms are the same size so we were stuck.  The size of the room made it challenging to enjoy any downtime.  Breakfast was lacking in healthy options and this morning no egg option because the heating unit wasn't working.  I would have been very happy with a couple hard boiled eggs.  We didn't get deals on the room so for another 50 bucks or so we could have stayed at a more spacious hotel.  We won't be back.,,,

Wifi wasn't bad and was complimentary! I wish I had woken up earlier for breakfast to really try everything..by the time I got there the bacon was gone but they had cereal, eggs, French toast and you could make a waffle if you wanted. The eggs were a little off..but it's a hotel so I don't expect anything too great.Overall, I would come back again and recommend to friends.

52,Bryan P.,"Collingswood, NJ",106,132,5,1.0,1/20/2016,"The absolute worst service I have ever received from a Hilton brand property. No response from management so I assume they just don't care. There are TONS of hotels in and around Times Square. Do yourself a favor and book somewhere else. At least you may get service for your 6x6 room. Speaking of rooms, the shower was so small I couldn't turn around. Add the lack of service and you have an excellent example of a poor guest experience. Hilton Global has been great, this is obviously a local issue where a GM and staff have no clue what they're doing.",,,
53,Amy H.,"Weymouth, MA",0,13,4,4.0,4/18/2016,"Bought this on Hotwire for a reasonable 79.00 before fees. Not a bad deal for a quick one night stay in NYC. It's a decent location, for where it is, a few blocks south of Times Square. So, I wouldn't wander around too late alone. Rooms are smaller than your average hotel room, but this NYC on less than 100.00 a night. The hotel was very clean, and has been recently updated. Since I drove in, I was happy to pay the 65.00 for valet car service. Well worth it to me. My party and I were able to leave the car, leave our bags with the desk and envoy our day trip. I have to say that the staff at the hotel was fantastic. I interacted with Nicole on both check in and check out, but everyone was super friendly, extremely helpful and genuinely cared about making sure we had a comfortable stay.

After a long day walking around the city, the comfortable bed and well air conditioned room was paradise. It is in a great location close to times square and easy access to the metro.

61,Kylara W.,"New York, NY",0,26,0,2.0,6/3/2013,"I have to say I was disappointed by my stay here.  First, I arrived at 2:45 and had to wait till exactly 3:00 to check-in.  Check in wasn't guaranteed till 3, so fine.  At 3, I get my key and head up to the 19th floor.  As the previous reviews mention, there are only 2 small elevators for a building with 30+ floors and they were both busy with cleaning people traveling between floors with their carts.  I get to the room and walk in ... to a room that was clearly occupied!  Luckily, there wasn't anyone in the room, but their bags were there and it was not the king room I reserved.  Funny thing is that this is the second time this has happened to me at a Hampton Inn.  The last time it was in New Hampshire.  Anyway, I head back down to the desk. The man apologized and hands me a new key for a different room.  Back up again.  Now, the key doesn't open the door.  Back down AGAIN.  It's still taking forever to go up and down because of the cleaning people using the elevators.  The man hands me a brand new key and this time on my trip back up, the key finally worked.  By this time I was late meeting friends and upset.I headed out for a couple of hours and came back to pick something up.  Guess what?  My room key doesn't work again.  Another trip down and up.  This was the last time I had to get a key, but seriously?  The continental breakfast was awful.  All the breads were stale, old and I wondered for how long they had been refrigerated.  No delicious NYC bagels here.  I picked up a chocolote chip muffin and the chocolate chips had that opaque look about them like when temperature changes has made them go bad.  I took a small bite (sans chocolate chips) and I tossed it.  Not good at all.  I stuck to coffee and got the heck out of there glad that I had only spent one night.It gets 2 stars because I used Honors points so I didn't pay full price and the room was clean but I would never stay here again.  My friends stayed at a Residence Inn 2 blocks away for the same price as my room ($350) and that hotel was worlds better.",3,,

64,Shae C.,"Southfield, MI",109,18,2,2.0,4/9/2016,"I felt hoodwinked by the lady in reservations. I love to travel with my daughters. We decided to take a mini vacation from home (Atlanta) to the big apple. My 14 year old LOVES NYC! I booked a room at this particular Hampton Inn because of it's proximity to the heart of Times Square. The reservationist told me that the first day was $119 and the other 2 days was $179, parking was $55 a day (yikes!) and an additional holding fee of $20 a day would be added in case we partake in incidentals. It was all adding up, but I felt we still had a deal for a hotel in Manhattan. She asked did I want to be up high (for a great view) and I said yes. She put us on the 23rd (or something like that) floor. We arrived to check in and the hotel looks kinda tiny and cramped from outside. Upon check in we find out the $55 parking does NOT have in and out privileges at all! You leave and that's that! You pay another $55 when you come back. Granted it is a third party company and not the Hampton, but had I known it would have made a difference. We parked a little up the street and prayed the rest of the trip. The room, although clean and relatively modern was VERY cramped and our ""view"" was of the next building that blocked EVERYTHING! The thermostat was terrible. It was either cold as heck or hot as heck, no in between. We still had a blast in NYC, but when we return in June we won't stay here. Oh, another thing. They held $60 a day, not $20 like reservations told us so after checking my account online and seeing an extra $180 added (I was livid), and having to call and get an apology for the ""miscommunication"" and assured it ""would be released in about 3 days""...yea, I'm good Hampton Inn.",1,,

Updated review","Our stay was fantastic (very clean and modern room with a great view) until we ran into a snafu with the Valet Parking.  HOWEVER, the manager, Elizabeth, took control of the situation, got on the phone with the third party valet service and aggressively located our car (which we had begun to fear was stolen or wrecked) since we had been waiting for over two hours for it to arrive after calling for it. Turns out, our car had been taken to a different location and the delay was no fault of The Hampton Inn BUT not only did Elizabeth comp our valet fee for the troubles (after the first hour of waiting), she also comped our stay at the hotel too (after the second hour) and apologized profusely. At this point, I think she was more upset for us, than we were! It was a really nice conclusion to an unfortunate situation. We felt very well taken care of because of her concern and will book our stay here again:)",2,,

The day manager- Elizabeth - was very cool. I forgot some paperwork she help me recover. The food staff did a wonderful job providing breakfast. The breakfast manager, young woman - made every effort to ensure the food was fresh and well presented. Well done.Lastly, the room was clean, comfort, even though a bit small for me.

89,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,467,120,4.0,3/25/2010,"I have stayed at this Hampton Inn quite a few times, and they keep impressing me every time.In comparison to the DoubleTree in Chelsea, this hotel has outstandingly friendly service, clean rooms, new furnishings and a great staff.  Trust me, I have stayed at my fair share of Hilton properties, and this hotel is consistent with what they deliver.  And the price is usually very comparable to similar finds in the area.  The one warning, don't wander too much around 9th Avenue...the area by the Port Authority Bus Station can be quite interesting, and you may find your share of crazies looming around.  Head to 8th instead...much safer way and right down the Fashion District area!",2,,
90,Aaron P.,"Madison, WI",1,32,0,4.0,5/15/2012,"Pros: 1) The customer service was amazing.  The staff was always friendly and helpful.  Our first room smelled a bit of cigarette smoke, but the front desk immediately relocated our room with no problem.  The second room was smoke free.  2) The breakfast was outstanding!  It was crowded, but the staff kept the buffet stocked and the guests moving.  You could build a very reasonable healthy breakfast or go for the waffles.   3) The rooms were super clean.  There wasn't even any hard water on the shower wall.  4) Location was convenient to both the Port Authority subway station and the Time Square subway station. 5) We never felt unsafe coming into the hotel late.  There is a sketchy ""hunk show"" next door, but it wasn't annoying or obscene.  If nothing else, it was nice to have a bouncer sitting on the block at midnight. 6) There were normal hotel noises, but the street noise was not intrusive at all.Cons:  1) The view wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  2) The bathroom door did not fit in the frame.  It was very very difficult to fully close the door.  3) The elevator can be a bit slow.  Just plan for a bit of a wait.I would certainly stay here again as a very solid place to crash for a New York adventure.",1,1,
91,Van E.,"Houston, TX",354,47,0,5.0,9/7/2013,"My now-spouse and I stayed here the first week of August 2013 when we went to New York to be legally married after 14 years together.  It was perfect for us in every way.  I was agog at how stylish it was, from the lobby on up.  Our room was small, as most NYC hotel rooms are, yet the furnishings and decor were very attractive and comfortable.  It reminded me of a W or Kimpton.  Every inch of the space was maximized, too.  Our room's location at the front of the building on the 32nd floor afforded us good views of the Empire State Building and the Hudson River.  It was also extremely quiet.  We didn't hear any street, hallway, or elevator noise.  The complimentary breakfast was much better than those things often are and the coffee was better than decent.  That dining area was well done, too, with innovative measures to introduce natural-looking light into a windowless space.  The lobby was very pretty, with big windows overlooking the street and nice decorative touches.  Above all, the staff was just outstanding.  There was not a concierge desk per se; however, the front-desk personnel gave the sorts of tips and recommendations that concierges usually offer.  One of them even remembered that I'd injured my foot, and she asked about it.  We were completely open about our reason for being in New York--to be married (and to catch a show or two, of course)--and the staff semmed genuinely excited for us.  The location is very good, with lots of great restaurant choices just around the corner, and of course the proximity to all the theatres and the subway station makes it ever so convenient.  We'd definitely stay here again.",3,1,1

93,David B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,3,3.0,1/24/2011,"Good location, convenient to Mid-Town West. Very friendly desk staff. Room very clean, new and well maintained. Reasonable price, wifi included,nice flat-screen TV. Comfortable bed. Clean sheets. Room is very small. I was there by myself, so it was not too tight. I can't imagine it with two people in the room. Bathroom was generally good, clean and stocked with all essentials, but there was virtually no counter space and, worst of all, my shower only had hot water -- totally unacceptable! I'm sure that was an anomaly, but very annoying. I would definitely go back, but I'm checking the shower before unpacking.",,,
94,Scott S.,"Auburn, CA",5,211,0,3.0,6/26/2012,"Well I really didn't want to have to drive in NY so I booked this and we took the bus from NJ.Pros: Great location to Port Authority if you bus in as I would recommend (you can get GrayLine tickets there, walk to the hotel and drop bags) and Time's Square (we walked over after the sun went down and it was very cool). Cons: Same standard Hampton Inn service and amenities, just shrunk down like you would not believe - seriously, this is the smallest room I have EVER been in after 13 years of work on the road. I had booked 2 beds for just my brother and I, but since our Aunt decided to come along this room was too small for even someone to sleep on the floor. I went down to the desk (very good service) and got her a separate room. Love the location for a 2 day stay in NY, but I would only book again knowing how small everything is (seriously, take a normal room and shrink EVERYTHING by half - that's how small this place is). Pricey, but it is Time's Square, so...",,,1

97,Karin L.,"Toluca Terrace, CA",24,20,0,5.0,5/14/2014,"Stayed here for a quick, 2 night weekend stay. The Hotel is brilliantly located within walking distance and subway station to everywhere. The service was wonderful, with the front desk staff going beyond  the call of duty to make you feel welcome. Our front desk guys gave us great info on two nearby restaurants, depending on our food of choice, and both were excellent. (Mercato - Italian, Qi Thai fusion) and not overpriced. Yes, the rooms are small, but thats NYC for ya. For us it was big enough and had two very comfortable big beds, a great shower and was clean. We dont ask for more. Breakfast was of great variety and food and coffee, tea etc. plentiful and really good. There are 6 rooms only on every floor and 30 some floors. Last moment we discovered a wonderful flea market with tons of treasures, right next to Hell's Kitchen which is literaly next door. This Hotel is well-managed, well , well maintained, clean and central. Decent price. What more could you possibly want?",,,

The staff was super friendly and the hotel was very clean, the rooms were spacious and the price was awesome! It's located a couple of blocks from Port Authority, the culturally diverse restaurants of Hell's Kitchen, the Garment District and Times Square. The block it's on between 8th ave and 9th ave may seem a little sketchy to some but, we're from Boston so it didn't bother us at all. We will definitely be staying here again!",,,

104,Nicole P.,"Fayetteville, NC",24,43,4,4.0,12/14/2010,"Very nice hotel. Room was nicely updated and clean. Comfy bed. Nice hot breakfast in the AM. Only gave it a 4 because the girl at the front desk basically called me a liar, telling me that I did not reserve a double bed, but a king room. It was late I said whatever I will take the king. Then we get to the room and it's a double bed! Hello did she just straight lie!!! I went back down and I was like that's no king bed. She then says I know, it's a double. What the frick!! So my guess is your guaranteed a room if you check in late, just not the room you think you are supposed to get. Hmm. They know you are not going to schlep your crap around the city trying to find another room. Also the elevators here are terribly small, we waited for 10 minutes. Never got on. Ended up dragging our luggage 9 floors down. As far as quality of room and price($110 on Priceline) I would stay again.",,,
