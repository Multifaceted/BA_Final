My go to for breakfast is the breakfast burrito on wheat. The eggs are always cooked well and the ingredients seem fresh. For lunch I get the tuna salad or a panini. Today I got the roasted veggie panini and love it! Full of veggies and Swiss cheese. In addition to the good food, the staff is very helpful and nice. I'm here every week!",

This is one of the best-priced quick lunch or dinner options in Midtown, and the menu is huge. Yes, in New York, $9 for a large sandwich is a really good price.I order delivery from here for a working lunch or dinner at least once a week and have never had any issue. My order always comes out correct, even when I leave specific instructions. Is the food gourmet? No. Is it good? Yes. My go-to are the rice and chicken bowls (or salmon), or one of the wraps. Delivery is also always very quick. I work about 10 streets away and always have my order in 30 minutes or less. I'm rare give a place a high endorsement, but this one deserves it.",

I asked around the hotel staff at the place where I was staying for a good bite to eat for lunch and they recommended here and they sure didn't disappoint. I ordered one of the hot paninis that I think was called the creole and it was delicious and filling. Also the service was fast and friendly which is also very nice! Also I really did like how I got 10% off my meal for showing my key card at the hotel I was staying at! Very much appreciated that. All in all if I'm back in New York I'll visit again to try more!,

I didnt want cheese or meat just the egg on the bagel. Id would have been better off buying it from the outside vendors. This was ridiculous for just one egg on bread. I should have went to Frame up the block who charges less than 3 dollars for egg and cheese on a bagel. You guys need to really work that out.,2

I saw quite a few people in corporate business wear and given this location is right by the Times building (40th between 7th and 8th - also right by Port Authority), I figure there's usually plenty of businesspeople in and out, which means service is nice and fast. I got the Texas burger and it came out in good time, tasty and well portioned. Definitely filled me up! Another point to note is that this spot has two floors and most of the seating is on the top floor, which is HIGHLY air conditioned. I enjoy the cold, especially on a summer day in the city, but some may want to bring another light sweater or something in case they plan on sitting down for a little while. All in all, great spot, would recommend. Also need to mention that this place is SUPER clean, in case any one was wondering - friendly and efficient service is always a plus in my book, as is a nice eating area without other people's garbage around.",

16,,5/4/2016,230,,"Jersey City, NJ",Merica K.,203,3.0,119,This place is okay. I usually stop here for breakfast and have had an occasional lunch here. The lines move quickly and the space is really big. There is lots of seating on the second level which is convenient if you don't want to take out. They do breakfast and lunch catering. I have used the breakfast catering and they are efficient and the food is good. The portions are smaller but you order per head. The bagels are yummy but not your typical amazing NY bagel. The selections are endless here. It is a good spot to go if you have to feed multiple people as there are so many options for breakfast and lunch. They sell gift cards and do have occasional promotions. They have many coffee options and all are very good quality. They also deliver. Staff is friendly and helpful.,

(40th st and 7th ave)And I think I've collected enough suggestions to mention something.One major thing, is the seating area. Half of the seats have the air directly blowing on you. Not lightly, it's like sitting with the wind and you're not even outside, hair in your face and napkins leaving you in your time of need.Second, is that I prefer to purchase a gift card, instead of seeing daily lunch charges on my card. But the register ladies never know how to do it, and each time I ask for one, it feels like a big to do. I think they are only trained to do debit/credit card swipes and cash. Because when I use my gift card, it throws them off. Today, they weren't able to give me my balance when I gave them my gift card, when each time previously, I've gotten a balance on the receipt. I believe the issue is that there are a lot of inconsistently in the service. One time I received a different size soup with my soup and sandwich combo. And there is no line, apparently it's a game of who can skip who. Some days there are 2 lines, others one. The registers also have 2 sides, so some days, it's one side , other days both...At least they make their sandwiches fresh (in front of you) when you order it.",1

Burgers both turkey and beef are great....Pastas are good too and made in front of you..shrimp, chicken(grilled or crispy), bolognese, pesto, a la vodka,  plus many other choices.......but..........the guy at the pasta/burger station guy is extremely, extremely rude and it feels like you are bothering him whenever you order.They do microwave the food for the hot entrees which bothers me a bit...Its a bit off putting that when you order a piece of salmon, a guy throws it in a plastic container then into a microwave for about 2 minutes. Upstairs where the seats are there is a vent that blows a strong wind and makes your food cold in about 5 mins. They need to do something about that.",

A lot other less expensive places offer ""real"" hot items.Update upon manager reply: the food was microwaved by a staff manning the hot entrée section.

Both are made to order, fresh, and priced under $7 bucks in Times Square.Unfortunately, they have turned to ""mystery turkey meat"" for the turkey burgers. Why the change... ???This meat has the consistency of bologna and DOES NOT taste like a turkey burger. What happened to the usual turkey meat that was used in the past. I couldn't finish the burger, totally disappointed. Everything else is pretty much the same... clean, free wi-fi,  etc...Also, they eliminated their points promotion.

I eat at the hot food bar 3-4 times per week now, and with the variety of sides and main dishes, I never eat the same thing twice. Joey, who works at the bar, is the friendliest person I've ever encountered in the NYC food industry. And the food just keeps getting better - I can't believe the quality and quantity I get for under $10. I can't make meals this tasty and nutritious for that price at home, so I'll continue to eat here regularly. Previous review (from April):This place is awesome. It's hard to find high quality, healthy food in Midtown west without paying an arm and a leg, but G&G knocks it out of the park.I usually stick with the hot food bar. The cajun blackened salmon is super tasty, and you can add a starch and a vegetable and pay only $10. Healthy serving sizes, and everyone working there is really friendly. It's also sparkling clean.Definitely eat here - if you work in the area, it's likely you'll become a regular.",2

The dressing was an Asian dressing and I added olive oil..There was really no flavor to the salad and so I added the side of lentils I purchased and still was not good.I even added anther two spoons of the dressing that I got on the side and still NADA.You would think the bleu cheese I added to the salad would give it a kick but it didn't.

43,,12/17/2016,28,,"Manhattan, NY",William B.,1,1.0,6,"For my very first restaurant I've ever ordered form in NYC, it was a complete and saddening disappointment. We called to place an order, and proceeded to take 12 minutes in the phone with someone to order 3 separate orders. Mind you, we had ordered a medium-well bacon cheeseburger, baked ziti with a dinner roll, and a BLT with a side salad. After constantly asking ""Excuse me?"" 14 times, we finally had our order placed, and proceeded to wait the guaranteed 40-50 minutes for our food. Instead, we waited for 80 minutes, and received half of what we expected to receive. Instead, we came back to our ""premium"" New York hotel room with a medium-rare, soggy cheeseburger, with no bacon, a soggy baked ziti, 2 salads and a BLT sandwich. The burger was a complete disappointment, being cooked incorrectly, containing no bacon like ordered on the phone and half a soggy bun, and half of which was cooked with crispy, inedible mystery meat. Our ziti was a baked ziti, not a wet ziti, and sadly would have to be named the worst ziti I've ever tasted in my life. The fact that a BAKED ziti entered my mouth wet, not steaming wet, but completely made to be a wet pasta, was a shame to all Italian cuisine. And, to add to the mess, our dinner roll magically turned into a side salad on the way over, so much for New York City magic! Next time I visit, you won't be seeing me anywhere near Guy & Gallard!",

Dinner was better as it was much quieter and without the crowds.Overall, i would have liked to give 3 1/2 stars but the 1/2 designation is not available. I'm a tough customer but i find their food fresh and portions decent. The people behind the counter were consistently ok. They try to please. Same goes for the cashier who can be terrible in places like this. Here, she was quite good actually and i had even used a Groupon. Service with a smile was a surprise even as i used the groupon because they don't make as much profit.The large upstairs seating is great and they play CNN continuously. Having a bathroom with hot water and paper towels is an added benefit. The prices are about as expected for this type of place. not cheap but not terribly expensive. The days of a $5 full lunch are gone in NYC. It's more like $10 now.Still, if one wanted to bring a friend for a friendly lunch and chat upstairs, it's quite appropriate as the seating gives you a bit of privacy without someone sitting up against you.Howard S.",1
