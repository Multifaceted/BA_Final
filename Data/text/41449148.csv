1,Rich B.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,32,113,3.0,8/5/2018,"I've been coming to the Taz Cafe regularly for breakfast for a number of years now, as my office is literally across the street. Overall, it's been good to me, and is consistent, but is nothing to write home about. Let me first mention that the food, while tasty, is very greasy. A bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a buttery bagel with a generously-fried hash brown plopped in the middle of it can truly hit the spot after a late night, but it's not something I want to get used to. On the bright side, they do have a ton of different breakfast menu items posted with pictures on the wall to choose from, some healthier than others,and can make almost anything to order. Taz is also very fast, with attentive staff, turning around orders in just a few minutes even when busy, but this seems to reflect negatively in the quality of the food you receive. Definitely don't expect perfect fluffy eggs.I should lastly mention that the Taz is very overpriced. Two eggs with bacon and a hash brown runs for 7-8 dollars, which is well more than what it's worth. Random items off the wall are also going to cost you. I understand this is NY, but Taz does not deliver on the value standpoint. I am definitely happy to have a quick place for breakfast like Taz, but it's not somewhere I would go out of the way for.",1,1,1

3,Sarah R.,"Bronx, NY",33,2,3,2.0,10/19/2018,"Ok so I am a lover of the classic bacon egg and cheese and have pretty much tried them from every deli in the neighborhood. This one...not worth the ridiculous 6.50 price tag. The egg to cheese ratio is good but the bacon is pretty much non existent and chewy. The bagel was perfectly toasted which is why I gave it 2 stars. If you are in the neighborhood do yourself a favor and get one from Water Grill down the block, its 3.75 and totally worth it.",,,

Updated review","I gave this place another chance today and regretted it immediately. I paid $11.50 for a chicken parm hero that had ONE piece of chicken on it, the rest was entirely sauce and breading. Don't waste your money here, this is the most frugal deli in NYC.",,,
5,Surfer N.,"New York, NY",2,109,0,1.0,8/30/2018,"Great spot if you enjoy being ripped off for completely mediocre deli food. I got an egg white wrap this morning (small) and a seltzer and they charged me $12. When I raised my eyebrows at the cashier and asked if she was sure that was the correct price, she ripped the card out of my hand, swiped it, and didn't even reply. Completely rude. Nevermind this spot! Go elsewhere.",1,,
6,Karen K.,"Flushing, NY",36,17,4,2.0,11/9/2017,"I come here occasionally for a salad or sandwich on my lunch break. After today, I will NOT be returning. The cashier is rude and the workers here give you dirty looks when you're placing orders. Saw one roll her eyes at a different customer when she wasn't paying attention. Some customer service! Not worth It for subpar food. Never again. I'll take my business elsewhere, thanks.",1,,
7,Steffi J.,"Brooklyn, NY",289,172,371,3.0,11/30/2017,"Found this place when I was searching for a healthy lunch. The wait was about 20 minutes more than what was estimated. I ordered a Washington wrap with no banana peppers; it included grilled chicken, lettuce, chipotle sauce and was suppose to have avocado but I didn't taste it. The menu included a wide variety of offerings from smoothies to sandwiches to omelettes. Nonetheless, three stars here because it was yummy but for the cost and size of my wrap, I would try to find a better deal elsewhere.",,,

Updated review","Gave this place another shot because there was a long line at my regular deli. Immediately regretted. The place is CRAWLING with bugs. The counter, the floor, the coffee area. It doesn't help that they leave out huge gallons of Iced Tea and Lemonade. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. THIS IS A HUGE HEALTH CONCERN.",,,
9,Allyson P.,"New York, NY",0,17,2,1.0,10/26/2017,"The pricing is whack here. You substitute sausage for ham and add spinach to the western omelet and you find yourself paying $2 more. They don't even follow the pricing guidelines on the board behind them and the fight with the counter lady is not worth the effort of saving money. I just went to CAFE ARTE, ordered a Western Omelet with sausage and toast and saved $2.22 for the same quality of food. They charge $5.99 for an omelet platter with potatoes and toast, AND you get a free hot coffee with it. GO THERE. It's 2 seconds away.",,,

11,Florann E.,"Boston, MA",233,205,197,4.0,6/29/2016,"A coworker recommended this place for lunch. At first it was difficult to find, but once I found it, I just kept coming here for lunch. There really aren't any decent places to buy lunch in Wall Street. And by decent, I mean affordable AND delicious. This one is by far my favorite place to go to. I recommend their crispy chicken sandwich with lettuce, mayo and tomato. Top it off with a bag of chips and seltzer, and you're good to go. I'm going to miss this place since we're moving offices in a couple of days!",1,1,2
12,Jay G.,"Bronx, NY",0,12,4,5.0,3/29/2017,I love their salad bar. They have a great amount of items you can add to your salad and outstanding dressings. I always get the mix greens with a bunch of veggies chicken and avocado for just $9.25. Can forget about my favorite dressing Mango vinaigrette! Definitely the cheapest and best near by.,,,
13,Em A.,"Buffalo, NY",43,114,39,3.0,11/16/2015,"These 5-star and 1-star reviews make perfect sense to me.  Taz captures everything it means to be both at the exact same time.  I loved this place but I could see hating it if I'd been in a different mood.This place a mirror into your soul.  You get what you project.  If you're in a d-bag grumpy mood, that's what your food is going to taste like and what this place is going to feel like.  The layout stinks, the bathroom is gross, and the food is either too greasy or too bland.  I saw a foul mouthed harlot come in and she got terrible service and probably bad food.Alternatively, if you're the johnny-joyful type who maybe drank their way to staying overnight in the financial district then you're going to be so happy.  There menu has both greasy fix-me diner style food AND some healthy bland things that you might not throw up later.  You'll be thrilled to know that there's a bathroom AND seating.In summation, I guess either way you'll be pooping after your visit?",1,3,

16,Natasha R.,"Manhattan, NY",8,35,8,1.0,8/26/2015,Got food poisoning from a breakfast sandwich I bought on Monday. I live next door and usually will just walk someplace else because this deli isn't really that great... I shouldn't have risked it.,3,,
17,Prashant V.,"New York, NY",70,5,0,1.0,12/16/2016,This is one of the worst delis I have visited. A colleague and I (both from Deutsche Bank across the street) got two different chicken dishes to go. Both of us got terribly sick same day and the food poisoning effect lasted a whole two days. I strongly advise you not to visit this place.,,,
18,Kat K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,7,0,4.0,11/1/2016,This place is great!  Its not the place to go for your special off-the-menu sandwich.  Its where you go to get a good quality standard breakfast sandwich with coffee.  Kitchen guys are great and fast.  Been going here for years and I love it.Only took away one star because on occasion my sandwich bread will be stale. This doesn't bother me because I'm one of those lame girls that picks off half the bread but its worth noting.  Its not a frequent occurrence.,,,
19,Raphael J.,"Manhattan, NY",7,8,1,5.0,11/21/2014,I love the guys here. Friendly and courteous and they are able to make breakfast food anytime before they close. I love a place that's willing to make your order the way you like it.I was even short five dollars since i left my wallet at home and they said to pay back later next time. I love a place that trusts their customers and treats them with respect.Five stars all the way.,2,,
20,Sumiti U.,"Manhattan, NY",204,81,83,1.0,4/16/2016,"This place is awful. I live right next door and have really tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt but they have failed me every single time. I ordered a chipotle 'chicken' sand which a few weeks ago and it was literally hard chicken scraps thrown on a hard bun. Needless to say that was inedible. EVERY single time I order a simple breakfast sandwich from them they always manage to mess it up. All I ask for is SCRAMBLED eggs with onions, tomatoes and cheddar on a roll. Is that so damn difficult? Initially they would put the onions and tomatoes directly on top of the omelette (which I didn't order) as if it was a turkey sandwich. Wtf? I just went downstairs to get a quick egg sandwich and was very specific on how I wanted my sandwich. I unwrapped my sandwich and low and behold, a omelette egg sandwich, when I specifically said scrambled. And to top it off, they charged me 7 dollars for an egg and cheese sandwich with onions and tomatoes. Wtf? A bacon egg and cheese is $2.95. Why would an egg and cheese on a roll with 2 veggies be more than double that? I've literally given them the benefit of the doubt 10 times. This experience was definitely the last straw. I will always walk past this shitty establishment as they pay zero attention to their customers orders, food quality and like to randomly over charge their customers for a terrible sandwich.",,,
21,Johnny H.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,2,0,1.0,9/10/2015,"We ordered lunch from here today, my entire order was wrong to begin with, the quality of  the food was poor as well. The homeless person I gave the good too even complained about it. I would not recommend going to the establishment .",2,1,
22,Carrie C.,"Elmhurst, NY",6,43,25,4.0,1/24/2015,Had a salad here around lunch time.  They have a salad bar where you can chose 1 main ingredient and 6 additional ingredients for $8.5.  Had a spinach salad with chicken and it was very good and fresh.  You get a piece of bread with your salad too; ask about it though otherwise they won't tell you. I'd come back.,,,
23,Rebecca H.,"New York, NY",1,52,2,3.0,2/4/2016,"Really like 2.75 stars. Just eh. My first time here I had a salad which was soo good. Hard to mess up a salad, but it was. Second time I had a veggie burger which was pretty gross. Just frozen veggies thrown in with bad rice or something and slapped on a bun. Why even bother? Third time I went with a simple grilled cheese. Asked for wheat and came on white. No biggie, but the sandwich itself was terrible. Messed up a grilled cheese, I just can't get myself to go back.Also once I ordered delivery and had to pay in cash, and said so when I placed the order. Delivery guy showed up with absolutely zero change!",,,

25,D P.,"San Diego, CA",7,27,2,4.0,8/21/2014,"We order from this place almost every day because of the consistent freshness of all the items...the salads are amazing and fresh... and for a less than healthy treat, the pastrami sandwiches will make you moan as will any of their desserts. Two reasons I didn't give them five stars:1.  When we call over (more often than not) the staff has quite an attitude when ordering for delivery (we are a block away and would prefer to walk, but have meetings all day at time so require delivery).2. If ordering more than two items on the menu for delivery, they usually make a mistake ( forget the dressing, no special requests like no cheese is completed)..which is a bit frustrating at timesOverall the quality of food is what keeps us coming back and we've just tried to walk in as much as possible to avoid the delivery issues.",,,
26,tom l.,"Spencerport, NY",0,12,5,1.0,8/9/2015,"We ordered our food and the cook screwed up our order. He argued with us stating he didn't and said he would make us what we actually ordered but we would have to wait. To make it worse, he didn't make everything that was ordered.

27,Rich W.,"Queens, NY",846,1011,4494,3.0,10/26/2009,Great place for lunch because of the large selections and the price is reasonable.So far I have not found any problems like the other Yelpers concerning the other TAZ Cafe.This location is the same owner as the TAZ Cafe on 84 Williams St.  It is the same menu.My favorites- Panini; Milao & Tri-cheese Capri.,,,
28,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",686,1303,3044,4.0,11/4/2010,"Wow, this place is good!  I tried them today via Seamless Web, and I was quite pleased.  It's funny, you just know how good a meal is going to be by the care a restaurant takes in their packaging.  I have had leaking containers, food crammed into smaller (cheaper) containers, wrong orders, and so forth.  These are all leading indicators of the work ethic of the employees.  At TAZ, I am happy to report that they carefully double wrap their sandwiches and are careful about maintaining its orientation during the delivery so that it does not get crushed.  Better yet, the soup is housed in a lidded container shrouded in a plastic sleeve to ensure there is absolutely no leaks.  Well done.  Removing all of the packaging, I was taken by how good the food smelled. I went with a Cuban sandwich and chicken noodle soup (with tax and tip, about $11).  I was surprised to see healthy chunks of grilled chicken in the soup, and the broth actually had flavor.  The sandwich was so big and so good.  Very good quality ingredients in abundance working together to create a delicious sandwich.  I now have a new regular spot to rely on for deliveries!   4.25 stars",5,1,2

I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and it was ok. It was really oily and it just didnt wow me at all.....for $3.50 a slice of soso pizza, thats kinda steep for me...lol....I was eating at the seating area, and spotted their salad bar...oh man..it is really cheap!!

33,David K.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",268,198,552,2.0,2/26/2012,"THIS DEVIL IS NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT TAZ!As this is the closest restaurant/cafe to my office (aside from the cafeteria in the building), wouldn't it just be the greatest stroke of luck if this place was a dream come true. I can scarcely think of such dire weather which would keep from consistently returning to a place that serves good food and is no more than 20 feet from the Pine Street entrance to my building. At first it seemed that TAZ was an answer to our prayers. If you were starting your day and its breakfast that you want, then there are 16 options to choose from, so you don't need to worry about the same thing twice for over three weeks. There are even more choices when it comes to lunch as you can choose from soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and a full grill station. With so many choices what could possibly go wrong?I first learned about TAZ from one of my co-workers who swore that he went there at least twice a day. After hearing him come back raving from there for a week I finally decided to give the place a try. As I walked in past the pizza counter and past the salad station, I decided the stop at the sandwich carving station. At the time there was Corned Beef, Pastrami, and Turkey all of which was kept warm and moist on a steam table. I ordered a combination sandwich of the Corned Beef and Pastrami on hero bread. They shaved off a few slices of each and threw it on the grill. I asked if they could add some sauerkraut and the grillmaster said: ""No problem,"" and tossed a handful on top. He smeared a healthy dose of spicy deli mustard stuffed the whole pile into the sub. It was as good if not better than any similar combo which I have had at a kosher deli. I polished that sub off in less than 10 minutes and finally came up for air. A sandwich this good would surely be part of my weekly rotation, and I could not wait until next week to have one again.Unfortunately, as time went on things made a change for the worse. Within weeks they stopped serving Corned Beef. And even more recently, they do not have their Pastrami available everyday. So when their carving station was finally completely barren of my favorite deli meats, I was forced to select something else from their steam table. I went with the chicken parmigiana and penne with vodka sauce. I could deal with the fact that the breading was sliding off of my chicken cutlet, but I can't stand for gummy pasta. When I say gummy I mean that the pasta had as much texture as a spoonful of mashed potatoes. It only took one forkful of mushy penne for me to launch my lunch into the garbage can. Fortunately there were other options for lunch more appetizing than the full container which I chucked in the trash at that late hour of the day. At that moment the dirty water dogs seemed like a good idea as did roasted nuts which are known to be mixed by the owners with their own unwashed bare hands.Its a shame that this place has fallen in decline considering the raving reviews from 2 years ago. However, from personal experience this place does not have the same feel as it had in 2009/2010. If things took a turn for the better then I would certainly revise my review, but until then I will look to other cafes to get my weekly fix for deli sandwiches. Sorry TAZ, but unless you can bring back my old days at the sub station, you won't be seeing me come back too often.",5,5,5
34,Wendy G.,"Minato, Japan",240,722,1237,4.0,7/9/2010,"I really like their salad bar. Very tasty and healthy. I have their salad at least one or two times a week to detoxify my body. The fact that the portion is rather large even for a regular one, salad is actually a very filling meal too. I've tried a couple other salad places in the area(downtown financial district). This is my favorite.",1,,

36,Brandon J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0,5.0,12/9/2009,"Five stars (Contextually, of course.  It ain't Cipriani, but as far as places for a quick lunch in the FiDi with lots of options that actually have flavor go, Taz is tops)This place just opened and I can't stop going for lunch.  They've got a good variety so I haven't burnt out yet.  The menu for this place is longer than...well, it's long.  They've got brick oven pizzas, standard sandwich options, quesadillas, and a salad bar.  The place Taz really excels, though, is the steam table/grill/hot sandwiches.  They've got hot fresh pastrami, corned beef, and turkey breast every day.  The pastrami and turkey are fantastic and as far as I know this is the only place this far downtown with actual hot pastrami.  The steam table has chicken parm, which is great, all sorts of hot vegetables, including mashed potatoes which, while fake, are pretty decent. The grill uses actual fire (how novel!) and so the burger I had there actually had a nice bit of char flavor too it (but wasn't overcooked, it just tasted like it had actually been grilled instead of griddled).  The tuna melt was okay, but they don't actually warm the tuna first so it fell a little flat.  My favorite thing about Taz may be the fact that they have pudding and jell-o, which I love because I am secretly a five year old.The space is long and narrow so figuring you've got a lot of people who've already ordered milling about with no place to go, which leads to confusion about who has/hasn't ordered and whose turn it is.  My advice, when the guys shout out next, just go for it.  It's NYC, folks; you snooze, you lose.  Also, not that much seating, so don't come with a big group unless you plan on going back and eating in the office.",,1,
37,Sarah O.,"Chicago, IL",1,20,0,2.0,4/10/2011,"I ordered lunch for a meeting that I coordinated a few blocks away from Taz, and chose them for their menu. I had to call ten minutes after the delivery time to ask where the meal was, and then waited another half hour for it to arrive. After it got there, I realized that they had sent an incorrect salad - which meant our vegan attendees had no meal. I was very disappointed in their customer service, and the food was bland. Really wish we hadn't ordered from them, and will not order there again.",1,3,
