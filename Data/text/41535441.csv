I was recently back in the area and had to stop in to try the cheesecake to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was! The cheesecake is amazing but, like so many of the other reviews, the staff are not friendly.",,,
1,HonestyisKey N.,"Chicago, IL",2,155,9,2.0,11/16/2018,"The reviews are mostly true. The prices are awful, if they can't figure out what you got, they charge a general flat rate of about 20 bucks, and while there are some decent topping options for sandwiches and such, the flavor is bland. Honestly, it's a very ""New York"" establishment: some decent looks on the outside, mediocre flavor inside, for a terrible price. I spend a few months a year in the area for work, and come here for convenience, but each time a coworker or client shows me a respectable place nearby, I show up less and less. A great list of options however, and rarely full upstairs if a quick pricey deli lunch is what you crave for your wealthy family.",,,
2,Richy S.,"New York, NY",211,38,3,1.0,6/5/2018,"Overpriced, mediocre, and infuriating customer service. What else is there to say?I walked in for lunch today, and the man behind the counter by the sandwiches immediately barked at me to tell me what I wanted.  After I placed my order - a tuna wrap on whole wheat - he jerked his head impolitely to get me to go to the counter to wait for my sandwich.  Pretty demanding guy.And that's when I met HER, the absolutely miserable witch whose one mission in life is to extract as much money as humanly possibly from passerbys at the Majestic Deli.  This vile creature charged me $9.75 for the tuna wrap (even though their menu says it's only $6.95).  When the man handed her my wrap, she inspected its contents like a forensics specialist, just to make sure I didn't get anything extra.  After she discovered a little avocado on the wrap - rather than just letting it go since I already paid - she demanded an additional $1.50, which I gave to her because I didn't want to make a scene.  I politely asked for some tap water, and she yelled at me that they only had bottles.  Directly behind this woman was a huge stack of paper cups which were adjacent to the sink.  What does someone have to go through in life to end up such a shitty, unempathetic human being?  I almost felt bad for her...By the way, the sandwich was gross, and I finished it in two and a half bites.If it looks like a tourist trap, smells like a tourist trap, and tastes like a tourist trap - well I think you guys know.",16,13,13

The staff is rude, the food is NOT GOOD, and is over priced even for Manhattan and they rush you to order even when no one is behind you. I wish we had read reviews before we went. There are plenty small out of the way places that are so much better. We were in a hurry and took our chances. Please don't go here.",1,,

The prices are insane. Yes it's NYC but $50+ for 2 people is very overboard. The burger was decent. The buffalo chicken panini was crazy hot and I couldn't even finish it. My husband who loves hot foods even said it was excessively hot. Asked for salt for the fries and was given tons on pepper packets.This place is grossly overrated.,4,,

8,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",358,104,116,2.0,12/13/2017,"Slightly overpriced, and a $15 credit card minimum. I didn't realize this until after I already ordered my sandwich because the sign for that is only by the register and they have a huge deli window in between. I got an everything bagel, double egg, pepper jack, and turkey bacon with salt, pepper, and ketchup. That initially came out to somewhere around $4.00. However, once he realized I had turkey bacon he added $2 extra onto my order. I don't even know where these prices are coming from. It just went up so significantly. He also just wrote an extra $2.00 in the tip section to compensate for this discrepancy, but wrote it as $200... like excuse me. It's so close to my work and all I wanted was a warm bagel, but I'm living with some serious regrets right now. The food is very average definitely not as fluffy and good of a bagel as I've had from Tompkins Square Bagels. Will not go back to again unless desperate.",,,

The sandwich was pre-made and DRY even though i asked for vinegar and oil. The cookie was just CRAP and tasted as if it had been made weeks ago. For all of this I paid $15.20!!!! I am beside myself right now. Staff was surly and I did not receive a receipt even though I stood there waiting. I could have had a better lunch from ANY OTHER place nearby for less money.

11,Christopher S.,"Great Neck, NY",171,41,91,2.0,11/26/2017,"Came here for lunch today and got the chicken quesadilla and fries. It was okay the only real concern I have are the prices, which are outrageous and the portion size is far too small. The staff was very unfriendly to me and they seemed to rush me when ordering, which does not make any sense since there was no line at all. Overall, this is a tourist trap and I would not come here again for their prices are simply not fair to customers. For those that want to know how the food is the fries were nothing special and the quesadilla was a little too salty. Save your money go to a different deli there are plenty in Manhattan.",,,

15,Naresh S.,"Queens Village, NY",4,52,117,1.0,11/29/2017,"Do not come here. The place is way over priced. Before I ordered a half a chicken w/mixed vegetables I was told the price was $13. When I went to pay the price was 14.95 when I added a bottle of water ($2.25) the price magically went up to $18.45. When I asked why so much "" the guy at the register was rude and spoke very quickly and stated ""that's the price with taxes"". If you come here pay close attention to the price and ask before you buy or else your going to get taken advantage of. Ok back to the food now. The chicken was horrible no taste and was cold. The chicken looked good but tasted awful. I took one bite and returned the rest. The guy at the register was rude and told me I'm the only one who complained suggesting it was I who was having a problem. I ended up getting a salad and a bottle of water for $14.95. I believe the only reason this place it still open is because of all the tourists they over charged.",1,1,

Be prepared to be a bit aggressive when ordering, or a million other customers will push their way past you. Wide selection with everything from breakfast to burgers, wraps, salads, hot and cold sandwiches. Capicola Ham on a sesame hero was wonderful. Sandwiches come with a pickle. My sandwich was a great deal, but the real bank breaker was the cheesecake. I think it was nearly $12 a slice. That said, it was creamy and marvelous, every last bite! Well worth the price and big enough to share a slice. Honestly, my sandwich was so big i could have easily done without the cheesecake and had a perfectly satisfying meal. Plenty of seating and even a restroom available for customers! All around, great, I just spent a bit more than I was expecting to.",,,
21,Mary F.,"Bellmawr, NJ",102,5,0,2.0,6/17/2018,Definitely the kind of place where you have to know what you want as soon as you walk in or you'll be harassed to place an order ASAP... even if you're the only one in line. This was my first time in nyc & I ordered the Honey bee sandwich. It was incredibly overpriced ($12) but  being in downtown NYC I kind of expected that. The banana chocolate chip muffin was also dry and crumbly and also overpriced. I went there wanting to try a New York style deli but was severely disappointed in the value.,,,

28,Bill B.,"Reno, NV",62,87,121,2.0,9/18/2017,"This place was quite a disappointment.  It is a typical deli style restaurant where you go in, walk up to the counter, place your order, and then go to the cashier and pay.  First, I have to preface this by saying I am not from NY so I am still getting used to the way fast food restaurant servers talk to customers.  This place was not different...when I walked up to the counter to order, the ""cook"" asked me what do I want..I ordered the Charcoal Chicken Sandwich, which is listed on their menu as a ""hot sandwich.""  Then I walked over to the cashier to pay, and...nothing.  I just stood there waiting for the cashier to say or even ask me something.  There was nothing but silence for a good 20 seconds, as if the cashier was waiting for me to say something.  Then she finally asked me what I ordered.  I told her, and she rang me up, I gave her my CC, paid and then I just walked away...no ""thank you,"" or anything from the cashier.  I guess that is also NY'er.  When I finally got my sandwich (took about 7 mins), it was definitely not hot at all, and it turned out to be an extremely dry and totally flavorless.  I went to the cashier and asked for some mayonnaise and ketchup just so I could make my $12 sandwich (cost was with bottle of water) more palatable.  Not a place I will be going back to in the future.",,,

30,Troi V.,"Chicago, IL",1,6,2,1.0,3/12/2017,"Why the fuck is this place still open, I think to myself as I drink a soupy, mostly-milk ""milkshake."" Looking around, it's obvious - most of the people in there look too rich to know when they're being overcharged for terrible service and quality. I bought a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake, and it came out to about $25. Mind you, this is a not a nice restaurant. It's a shitty looking delicatessen, as the name implies. The prices were not all listed, and when I asked the cashier for an itemized receipt, instead of one that only had the total, he couldn't give me one. Hmm. Strange. The price for the milkshake and fries were a mystery, but the burger was around $9. This would mean that the fries and milkshake cost $15 between the two. Hmm. I ordered the vanilla milkshake. The cashier called out that he had a chocolate milkshake. He looked and me and asked me what I'd ordered. ""Vanilla milkshake.""""Oh. Well, uh, chocolate milkshake?""This guy fucked up my order, and then had the balls to try and pass his shitty mistake off on to me? ""Yeah, no. Vanilla milkshake."" What the fuck? How unprofessional. I get my food. There is NO WAY the fries and milkshake were worth $15. The milkshake, as previously stated, was basically just chilled milk. Not thick at all with almost no ice cream, except at the very, very bottom. The fries were tasty, but not enough to justify spending $7.50 on them. The cheeseburger was the only thing worth its salt, so to speak. Well-cooked, the whole shebang. $9 is still a little steep for it, though. More like a $6-$7 burger. In order to use the bathroom at this place, you have to ask for a token. Once you put the token in the door to use the bathroom, it disappears. You can't give it to your friends to use. I don't know why this pisses me off so much, but it does. Who else fuckin does that?Overall, avoid the fuck out of this place. They will overcharge you, and the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere will make you feel like you've been scammed. Because, well, you have been.",,1,

The prices are incredibly high. An eclair cost nearly as much as a burger. Suggestion; if the concierge at the hotel refers you somewhere - go elsewhere. The burger barely had flavor, just that of the light mayo & cheese but it was cooked right, not dry.Do yourself a favor if you don't want to feel extreme buyers remorse after leaving here - don't bother.

I bought one cannoli (which was stale) and a piece of baklava for a total of $15, which was absolutely insane. My party and I asked for our food to go, because we were only planning on being there for a maximum of 5 minutes before meeting another group of people elsewhere for dinner. When I and one other person in my group sat down, we took out one of our items out of their brown paper bags to munch on before we had to go, as we were all absolutely starving. The cashier gave us a dirty look and then yelled at us ""So you're eating it here? Why are you wasting my f***king bags?!"" And then yelled at us to leave the building, which we promptly did.

33,Michael P.,"San Jose, CA",20,53,106,2.0,2/21/2018,Unfortunately I didn't see all of the other reviews about this place until I was already here but most have a common theme about them: overpriced for the quality and quantity of food received. I would agree with that. My daughter and I ate here got apple juice $3.50 and a small water $2.50 along with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and some dessert and it totaled nearly $40. The sandwiches were mediocre at best and the desserts were not great either. I'd suggest saving your money and going elsewhere.,,,

Meaning whatever you want to eat, you'll probably find here in some shape or form. Fresh sandwiches, premade sandwiches, wraps, sweets, fruits, yogurts, cakes, candy, drinks, and of course for the healthy appetite: salads. Again the set-up here is appealing to the eye and there's plenty of hands on deck to assist you. So as you walk-in, you're quickly greeted and your order is taken. There is a plethora of choices and again, it's pretty easy to get carried away especially if you're hungry. Well our order consisted of two sandwiches, a slice of cheesecake, a water, and a hot coco. Our grand total of almost $40 surprised us but we hoped for the best.There is absolutely no reason that a traditional lunchbox sandwich should cost over $10. The turkey sandwich made ""my way"" was not a star and therefore reminded me of something that I ate back in elementary school. The other croissant sandwich that was ordered had water tasting ham with American cheese and made our tastebuds fall asleep. The cheesecake was worse than a slice that is sold at a gas station.Would I eat here again? NO. It's a tourist trap, walk on by and go see the lights of Times Square instead.",,,

I ordered the Pastrami on Rye. More like miles of pastrami. No grease or fat but perfect pastrami. I couldn't finish it but took it to go and ordered a few slices of cheesecake (they have so many varieties) and for $10 a slice, the portion is definitely enough for four to share.

But for one slice of tiramisu and one cannoli, $20. Again, a bit pricey.Would I go back?  With all of the deli options in New York City, probably not. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. There are so many to choose from. If I was walking by, all the other places in the area had a long line, & I was starving, I would go. But I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",,,

They have a wide variety of salads from garden, chef, Cobb, Caesar, Greek whatever you want they have it. Yes, it's 'pre-made' but it's made fresh that morning. All of the vegetables are crisp and you will never have a 'watery' wilted salad. The staff is always friendly, attentive and work quickly to take your order and get you to the register.

The wrap was listed at $10, so how my other purchases totalled $15 I'm still not sure. Nothing away from the menu board was labeled with prices that I recall so paying is something of a mystery. I expected the chicken caesar wrap to be a hot wrap with fried or grilled chicken strips with lettuce, tomato and caesar dressing. I received a cold chicken salad wrap that was not tasty at all. The grapes had bruises and mystery white spots that weren't visible from the exterior of the package, and the cookie was super dry and difficult to break pieces from without crumbling its mess all over the place. None of my family were impressed with the quality of their meals either, and my mother-in-law's eggs weren't cooked as she asked.

At this location, everything is overpriced for food you can get at half the price just 15 minutes away.

The food here is amazing. Simply delicious. You will not find better breakfast food elsewhere within a 5 block radius (which is expansive for NYC).The service is quick and the selection is broad. The only reason why I detract a star is because the prices at Majestic are quite high. Granted, we are in Times Square where prices are inflated and tourists are all too eager to pay. But you will certainly spend $15 on an omlette, pancakes, and juice. And as other reviewers have said, the pricing seems arbitrary and just depends on the cashier you get.Still, I recommend it.

I could get the same exact panini I got at Hot & Crusty for half the price. Most of their sandwiches start at about $8.00. They're all pre made so it's not even fresh!I will give it to them for having such a wide selection. The guys standing behind the counter kept watching me as I walked up and down trying to decide on what I wanted to eat. I finally decided on the Chicken Parmigiana. I got a bottled Arizona Green Iced Tea. How much did my bill come out to? Just about $15! The bread itself was okay. Decent but not great. The chicken was diced into small bits and it was pretty dry. There wasn't much of the spaghetti sauce so the flavor itself was bland. It wasn't nasty but seriously mediocre. This place was probably one of the worse places I ate at while in NY.

My sister stated that the man (stranger) had waited outside the secluded women's restroom and jumped face to face with her when she exited yelling at her and scaring her.  I yelled back and told him that we did, in fact, make a purchase and pointed it out on the table that I had just abandoned to rescue my sister.  He stated that the staff member that we asked about the restroom told him that we were tresspassing! As he continued to yell, every eye in the place was on him and you could hear a pin drop.  He stated that we were tresspassing and that he would call the police. I informed him on three occassions that we had made a purchase and he finally realized what I was saying and said, ""Okay"". My sister was embarrassed and scared and we complained to a police officer outside the door and left the area. This is my first hand experience at this deli and certainly my last visit.
