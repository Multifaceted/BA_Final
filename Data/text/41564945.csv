1,Stephen L.,"New York, NY",299,358,5535,5.0,11/3/2018,"Did you know you can book a Radio City Tour? I've been in NYC all my life and didn't know that, but for this weekend, I wanted to explore NYC from the eyes if a tourist, and I was not disappointed. I bought the tour pass 5 minutes before the tour began, bought it at 1:40pm and the tour was scheduled for 1:45pm.  For $30, you get a small group tour of Radio City, and possibly get to see a rehearsal, if there is no rehearsal going on, you get to go very close to the stage or on the stage.  As for me, there was a rehearsal going on and I was able to witness the flawless performance and rehearsal of the Christmas Spectacular.  I saw this show once before, but it was still fun to watch the rehearsal.Towards the very end of the tour, my group was lucky enough to take pictures with a rockette and the picture was then sent to me via email.  I'm not sure if there's always a rockette available for pictures, but this was definitely the highlight of my tour. If you're into theaters and want to see some the backstage stuff that goes on, including costumes, etc. you don't want to miss this tour.",1,,3
2,Kimberly T.,"Newington, CT",81,129,159,5.0,10/21/2018,"Saw Nine Inch Nails here recently and absolutely loved the experience. Finding parking nearby was easy (but don't be surprised- expensive!). Plus having Restaurant Row and plenty of bars within walking distance was an absolute plus. Location on point! Walking into this iconic theater, you are taken back in time.  The decor is dated, but I love it. There's grand staircase covered in a bright vintage carpet leading to the balcony section. There are plenty of bars to get your drinks before the show. The ladies room also had a vintage feel-- with a spacious make-up/vanity room leading to the actual rest room. This was perfect because it gave every lady her own mirror space, cushioned seat and counter-top to reapply lipstick, or as I did, put in some eye drops. Our seats were on the first balcony, and we could see the stage perfectly. In fact, I don't think there was a bad seat in our section at all. This place gives you a small venue vibe, but it's huge. We estimated maybe 3-5,000 seats. It seats closer to 11,000. Way off!  But that's how intimate it feels inside.  Our seats were also crazy comfortable. I remember sitting down like, ""Omg I have leg room!!!"" And the seats themselves are actually comfy to sit in. It seems like tight, constrained seats with no space to stretch out are the new norm, but I was happy to go back in time that night.  Tall people rejoice! Also Nine Inch Nails was amazing. Just thought I would mention in case you were wondering.",,,
3,Sara B.,"Jersey City, NJ",3529,650,4938,5.0,10/15/2018,"Radio City is an outstanding music venue! I recently visited for the first time in fifteen years - hopefully I don't let that much time pass before returning for another show.The acoustics are incredible and I have a feeling that it'd be difficult to find a bad seat anywhere in the house. I recently rewatched some videos that I took at the show and the sound is so loud and clear that it sounds like it's being played from a speaker right next to me.The layout also makes it impossible to have a bad seat. I was on the ground level but a little further back and all the way to the left and I still an amazing view of the stage. The theater isn't huge which I like. I remembered it being that way, but I think last time I visited I was just alot smaller. There are a ton of bathrooms which is also a huge plus -- sometime at concerts the bathroom line can be massive. Even at a sold out show there was never a wait. The line was pretty long for drinks but it ended up moving super fast. The staff here definitely hustles and is good at controlling the crowd.Overall this was a great concert experience. I'll have to keep my eyes on the calendar.",16,10,22
4,Brian L.,"Chicago, IL",87,598,43,4.0,10/16/2018,"Never thought I'd have a good reason to come to Radio City, but I did this past weekend.  What a stunning venue!The lobby and concourse areas are crazy beautiful with art deco decorative adornments everywhere.  Really, really pretty and jaw dropping the first time you see it.  The seating area itself is equally as impressive. My friend and I got tickets in the ""nosebleeds"" and by no means were the views bad, but it starts to feel like you're quite a distance from the stage.  As far as sound quality is concerned, I can not be the voice of reason; I have tinnitus and thus was using foam earplugs to protect my ears.  I might have had some cheap ones because it seemed extremely bassy.  I wasn't sure if those damn rock stars were just pumping up the bass super high.  I only determined it must've been the earplugs afterwards.  I've heard from others that the acoustics are amazing, though.  If you get the chance to visit the venue without paying an arm and a leg, I would highly recommend going.",1,,2
5,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,5.0,9/22/2018,"What a great venue. A friend and I visited RCMH for the Laura Pausini concert. Although we had seats on the third level, the view was not bad at all. The prices of the beverages were cheaper than I thought they would be (around 12 bucks for mixed drinks). I was fortunate enough to be in the area where the bartenders had a very heavy pour so the 12-dollar drinks were like 2-4-1. Since the concert was not sold out, there really was not a problem with crowd control (e.g. finding our seats and leaving the venue).",,,3

7,Brittany N.,"New York, NY",18,80,100,4.0,10/19/2018,"Gorgeous for a concert. Much more comfortable than a stadium with the velvet seats. We were on the mezzanine at the Troye Sivan concert. Spent most of the concert standing and dancing. Don't think the mezzanine was really meant for a concert like that because if you stood still for too long, you could feel the mezzanine shaking and could see the huge lights in the shaking up and down. Nothing fell though so that's a plus",,,
8,Amit R.,"Huntington, NY",246,110,388,4.0,3/8/2018,Came here for a J. Balvin concert.  Our seats were up top but we still had a clear view of the entire stage.The staff was very professional and accommodating.  There were bars setup throughout the venue.  Mixes drinks were about $14 and beers and wine were around $10.Worth checking out since it's such an iconic location!,1,1,1
9,Lourdes M.,"Bellerose, NY",199,704,1729,4.0,1/18/2018,"It was my second visit to Radio City but it was totally different feeling as the reason for the visit was for Christmas Spectacular Show. I had a spectacular experience indeed. The theater itself is massive. The seats were very comfortable. The theme color was very elegant. The decorations of the venue inside and out were very Christmassy. The vibes were fun and vibrant. Everyone inside the theater was all smiling and was in happy mood. The joy that the show has given to everyone was awesome. The show was spectacular indeed. The sound system, the choreography, the entertainers, the costumes and the background were above and beyond to my expectations. Gift shop, photo booth, café, food stall, souvenir booth  are all available for guests pleasure. The restroom line( only in ladies)  was super long but don't be alarm, there are more than 20 stalls inside. The line ran very fast. The lounge room  was spacious. It was an amazing experience to tell you the truth. The show lasted about one hour and half  with no intermission. On your visit , Get your self ready in terms of snacks and should have visited the restroom before the show starts. It will be very cool  to have a photo taken with The Rockettes- memories that will last a lifetime. Regretted that I just watched the show now. Highly recommended.",2,2,2

I've been here for a concert as well as for the Christmas Spectacular and had good experiences as a whole. The venue is located in midtown near Rockefeller and not far from Times Square so either you take train , taxi ..... or get here with ample time if you drive to account for traffic and navigating to find a street the NYPD will let you turn down during rush hour ( which starts at 3pm)  literally took me an hour to drive around and find a parking garage 5 blocks away. Doors opened at 7 for my 8pm show and had no line nor any major problems trying to leave at the end .",16,9,14

I was blown away. I'm not going to spoil the show with details but let's just say the rockettes can dance, and sing, AND they have some cool modern affects like a 3D movie!Pro tip: if you want to see the formations sit back further in the theater but if you want to be emerald in the show, literally, the show is around you, sit in the close sections like GG!",1,,1
12,Kim S.,"Lowell, MA",230,281,4167,3.0,12/12/2017,"It's one of those must do in NYC. I wished they didn't allow camera, phones, etc. Throughout the performance of the rocketts, people showed up really late, took videos, talked, got up a few times. It was very distracting.  Also, show up at least 45 minutes early to get in line, through security, use the bathroom, get a drink and find your seat.The Christmas Spectacular show itself was great and I enjoyed it very much! Citi card holders get an additional discount on merchandise! Thought that was pretty cool!",1,,
13,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1511,3604,16305,5.0,10/17/2017,"If you have a bucket list, Radio City Music Hall best be on it. What I've seen here has given me some of the most marvelous wonderful memories I have. There is no way anyone can ever forget its Christmas Spectacular, the dancing of the Rockets, the sounds of a recital on its massive mighty Wurlitzer theater organ, or some of its shows. I still vividly remember and can never forget a 1983 Peter Allen ""I Go To Rio Show"" which opened with tap dancers on the wings of a massive mock-up of a jet passenger plane as it was simulating a flight to Rio. As music halls and theaters go, Radio City is a one of kind. With its 6,000+ seating capacity, it truly is the ""The Showplace of the Nation"" with no others like it anywhere. Beyond all of that it represents a huge achievement of the people New York who rallied to save it from a plan of reckless ill- conceived demolition as announced to take place by Alton G. Marshall. I remember it we, and even to this day would like to kick Alton in the butt for ever having thought of doing such a thing. Grrrrrrhhhh!",8,2,6
14,Erica L.,"Taunton, MA",127,126,266,5.0,11/25/2017,"Beautiful Theater.First time visiter and I was impressed. Came for the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular. From the security outside and entry lineup to the staff inside everything was quick and stress free. Once you enter be prepared to be wowd by the decor. Huge tree in the center, a beautiful large staircase and dimmed lighting that just adds to the feel. There are food stands on each floor, and i  the grand lounge which is first room you enter there is a souvenir shop and food as well.On the website it mentions that souvenirs are available on each floor but as we entered up to our 1st mezzanine seating we did not see that option. Only food vendors. Once you enter your mezzanine, which go ny aisle. You can find your aisle right on the ticket, dont be confused by this as i was when i entered. I searched for my seat section/row instead and i was confused lol later asked for help and the employee guided me right to my seat.Seats are wide, comfy, and allow plenty of leg room. Views in almost every seat seem to be great. 3 mezzanine sections, we were mezzanine 1 section 1 row J seats 109/110 which were great.We couldnt see the performers faces too well but we could see every movement, leg kicks, costumes and hear the songs perfectly. In addition the wall decorations during the show were visible too so overall great theater.Food wasnt too bad as far as pricing. We got the special for $22 which was 2 bottled drinks, and a  bucket of popcorn that would later be a souvenir. If you thinking of doing a show, try to see one here. Comfy and beautiful.",1,,1

16,Lateefah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,138,171,5.0,11/3/2017,"I am so happy that I finally was able to come to Radio City Music Hall for the Glass Animals concert. Living in NYC for 2+ years, it only took forever. If you are in the city, seeing a show here is a must. Getting in was really easy and there were no crazy lines or stress. Note that you cannot bring a camera with a lens into the Hall but they are nice enough to tag it and lock it in a cabinet for you after the concert is over. Radio City Music Hall is a grandiose three story venue with original art deco decor. The quality and maintenance of it is amazing. On each level you are able to find a bathroom and a food/drink stand. I suggest getting a beer or a well drink, rather then the overpriced cocktails and wine. Before you buy tickets, I suggest using ""where to sit services"" and reading ticket reviews because, apparently there are some areas of the mezzanine that block the view of the stage. I think it is from the speakers. But other then that, you can sit all the way in the back and still get a pretty good view of the stage. Can't wait to come back for another concert!",1,,

I was at first a little turned off because they made us put our phones in these silencer pouches, so once you enter the building you can't access your phone anymore. It could be they do this based on what show your going to though. I was a little mad i couldn't take pics at this beautiful venue, but it allowed everyone to really have a good time instead of playing on your phone.Food and drinks were pricey as to be expected and tasted like any other mediocre snack food.",5,1,4
20,Joshua R.,"Mobile, AL",330,216,424,5.0,12/17/2017,"Radio City Music Hall, there's simply not enough room here to  say all the good things about it.  My fiance is a former dancer and she was not leaving New York without seeing the world famous Radio City Rockettes!  The theatre is massive and has many original features, the chandeliers are full of crystals, the carpeting a throwback to the 1930's and the seats are super comfortable.  Also located absolutely everywhere, are shops and concession stands so as to make it easy on the several thousand patrons seeing the Christmas spectacular every day. I don't want to go too much into the contents of the show except to say if you haven't seen it, SEE IT! It's an amazing performance by some very talented men and women and will definitely put you in the Christmas spirit!  Arrive a little early, it can be like herding cats to get into the theatre but you can leave your ticket on your phone, that's perfectly acceptable.  Before the show have your picture taken with a Rockette and then enjoy the show!  It's a very casual experience, even though the tickets don't reflect that, but all in all its a can't miss New York experience.",4,1,3

I always sit in the orchestra section which makes for easy entering and exiting. Seats are very comfortable (I prefer isle seats very important for bigger peeps).

I told the Yelp world how I had a couple years of dance and ended up in modern dance instead of tap. I spent years wanting to learn tap dance. What other reason would I go to Radio City Music Hall but to see the Rockets in the Christmas Spectacular. It is a beautiful Velvet Curtained Venue with a wonderful history. When my daughter bought the tickets for my Christmas gift I was so excited. Let me just say whenever I see the Thanksgiving Parade on TV and the Rockets perform I get teary eyed. I don't know why. I think I may be sad that I was short, never learned to tap dance, and missed my calling in life! Well you can imagine when I was sitting in the World Famous luxurious Radio City Music Hall and they came out in the soldier costumes and danced, I couldn't contain the tears. I was there At Last. I was right up there every high kick and smile! If you feel the way I do, you must do whatever you have to do to attend the Christmas Show.

We arrived 15 minutes before showtime and were taking off our coats when the show started; hundreds more were behind us, which meant hundreds of people missed the start *and* disrupted the show as they entered.You'd think they'd never done this before, rather than doing this 4-5x a day around Christmas for decades.",,,

I have a new appreciation for Radio City Music Hall the show, the sets, the dancing. It was an absolutely wonderful show. First class New York City show great place to take kids for the holidays although pretty expensive. (over $100 per ticket in the mezzanine) They have modified the show to make it a little bit more modern but they have some of the classic Rockette dancers including the toy soldiers which is amazing to see. The coordination between all the dancers. Radio City Music Hall in itself is an absolute spectacle. I definitely recommend taking kids here, the show is an hour and a half long but there is no intermission so I would suggest getting popcorn as well. As expected after the show the ladies room was with a very long line they only have 6 or 7 stalls upstairs. But it was definitely worth the money, class act new york city show!As a tip, if you can't afford to go to the show, it is actually available on Netflix for free during the holidays!",,,

We each went through several check points and felt  thoroughly vetted but the line went swiftly and the security guards were friendly and accommodating. It was good to feel safe while having such a lovely time. My only observation would be that I wish that they offered a slightly better variety of food in the venue. We had to settle for a hotdog and popcorn for our dinner. I wish they had a few extra options. Perhaps a little cheese and crackers said that they offer on airplanes would be a nice addition. The lines were long but manageable at the various bars. If you get them all Moet and Chandon champagne it comes in It really cool plastic gold chalice type wine glass. The glass cost $22 but it was worth it. I was the envy of all other beer drinkers near me. I collected three that night and cart of them home for souvenirs.     The actual venue is so beautiful with comfortable velvet seats I truly believe there's not a bad seat in the house. We sat on the second level mezzanine right near a talented sign language station. I was mesmerized by their ability to sign the  songs and thought that this was a neat much  needed inclusion to the concert.   Everyone who worked at radio city was very friendly and helpful not too bossy. It was a really easy going experience. I highly recommend seeing a concert at this venue.,1,,1
41,Aveeda G.,"Parker, CO",199,364,1637,4.0,9/12/2017,"I've always dreamed of being able to catch a show - any show- at Radio City Music Hall. Such a beautiful (and actually quite large) theater. Classic decor like red velvet folding seats and true orchestra seating all persist, unchanged from past decades. I came on a bus from Northern VA for 10 whole hours all the way to NYC to catch Dave Chapelle during his month-long residency at Radio City Music Hall. Per Dave's request, cell phones were STRICTLY prohibited. We were all given little green pouches and instructed to keep our cell phones in there the entire show. The pouches sealed by the same kind of security tags you see on department store merchandise. This was serious business. There is a cell-phone room inside the theater though for emergencies and I assume this was also heavily guarded.Getting inside the venue itself was a bit chaotic and was the only hiccup really for me. We were told in an email that the first 100 in line would be receiving a gift and then we were directed to one particular door for entry. My friends and I counted and we were 35-37 in line - excited for this present. As soon as they started getting ready to let us in, they had people crowd the door completing losing this numbered organization. Needless to say only one of us got a present (Dave Chapelle hat) and there were more than a few people upset at how this transpired. There were apparently also two other doors with people in line with hats allotted for. Not very organized at all, I'm actually surprised there wasn't more of a riot for this.Overall, I had an unforgettable time here. Long, unbearable lines for the bathroom and expensive, weak drinks aside, not much could have really ruined my time here. Dave Chapelle and his special unannounced guest KENDRICK LAMAR absolutely made my life. At the very least, my summer.",1,,

I am really looking forward to attending another event at this venue.  Iconic.",,,1

44,Matthew K.,"Lynbrook, NY",303,238,1715,5.0,7/27/2017,"Radio City Music Hall only has 3 reviews only Yelp? GASP! Growing up in New York City, I always knew of Radio City Music Hall as one of those iconic theaters known around the world. I first attended the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular when I was a young kid (twice, in fact) and I had such fond memories going to see it with my family. Then, yesterday evening, I ventured back to Radio City Music Hall for the first time in over 15 years to see Hans Zimmer Live. What a more fitting venue than RCMH to write my 100th review, and how could I give it anything less than 5 stars?I'll admit that we had a rather spectacular experience on this recent visit. We had purchased 3rd Mezzanine tickets because we (or really I) really wanted to see this show but did not want to drop $250+ on orchestra or 1st Mezzanine tickets. When we showed up, security very efficiently moved us through the line and into the lobby. We grabbed a quick snack and beverage and then journeyed up to our mezzanine seats. Upon arrival, the usher said to us, ""well, I have good news: either you can keep your seats, or you can go talk to my manager over there for a complimentary upgrade to orchestra seats"". Sure enough, we went right over to the manager and traded in our 3rd Mezzanine tickets for a couple of orchestra seats in row T (row A would have made the experience even more incredible, but row T did just fine). It seems that perhaps the show wasn't fully sold out, so I would not expect this preferential treatment again, but it was still a pleasant surprise.For the most part the staff here is very friendly as well (not the friendliest, though, which I have to give to the staff over at Aladdin), and prices at the snack stands are what you would expect for a theater like this ($6 for a water, $15+ for an adult drink, etc.).The acoustics at RCMH are also terrific, which is of course important when seeing a concert (or the world-famous Christmas Spectacular, which I remember loving as a child and will definitely need to see again in the coming years).What also makes RCMH such a classic venue is the artwork and the architecture. This theater is beautiful! The lobby is magnificent with its grand chandeliers, gorgeous murals and grand staircases. The theater itself is certainly showing its age (and still has old-fashioned theater seats) but it's such an icon that I wouldn't have it any other way.Such an icon deserves 5 stars in my book!",2,2,1

Well one is miss a Giants game and two is see the Christmas Spectacular featuring the Rockettes. Well since the Giants took out Eli, they took me out out of the game. My brother got the tickets and asked if I wanted to go with his family. I said yes, I mean those tickets are expensive. First let me say that ""Radio City Music Hall"" is a modern marvel. It is beautiful outside. It is designed to attract your mind and imagination before you even step foot inside. The line was long and the wait seemed endless. I guess a lot of Giants fans had the same idea. Heading in I was amazed with the architecture. High ceilings with beautiful statues inside. Entering the main room I was completely taken back by the stage. The low lights and atmosphere added to my enjoyment. Now the show was the icing on the cake. All those beautiful woman on stage dancing in unison. I was speechless the entire time. The way they moved seemed like art and I was grateful to go. I'm glad the Giants are doing bad. Otherwise I would have missed out on this huge opportunity to see ""Radio City Music Hall.""",43,23,41

56,Ellen T.,"OSBORNVILLE, NJ",17,2,0,1.0,2/8/2018,"Radio City Music Hall  security staff horrible. But it goes deeper than that. Let me explain. I took my 11 year son to see the Christmas Spectacular on 12/30/17 to the 10:30AM show. This was the weekend it was wet and snowy in NYC so when we arrived to line up they allowed us to go into the basement lounge instead of queuing in the snow. So my son and i walked down stairs and the lounge began to fill very quickly to the point that it was like we were herded down their like cattle. Not only is this not safe but as someone who suffers from bad anxiety when in tight and crowded places I ended up panicking and needing to get out of the crowd for a few moments so i proceeded to go up the steps with my son. I am headed off by a security guard who proceeds to yell in my face that i need to ""take my ass back down the steps"" because i was not allowed up in the lobby. I tried to explain that i was having a panic attack and he just kept screaming telling me that i couldn't stand off to the side even though there were A LOT of others doing just that. He scared my son so my mom instinct kicked in and I conceded but he kept yelling at me as i was trying to calm my son down so i ended up yelling back to protect me and my son from more verbal insults. I ended up needing to take medication to calm down enough to even enjoy the show. And this is where it gets even worse when i didn't think it was possible. I get sent  a survey from RCMH asking about my experience so i filled it out honestly. I get an email from a Nicholas Murray who is the coordinator for disability services for guest relations for RCMH/Madison Square Garden who invites me to call him to talk about my experience. So i call him and he seemed sympathetic enough. Apologized. Said he was going to do an investigation. Etc. etc and he offers to send me and my son two VIP stage door tour passes for RCMH to make up for the bad experience we had. So I gave him my address and about a week later the passes arrive. I notice however that the passes have an expiration date of 12/31/17 just one day after the show we went to. I think it's an innocent mistake and i reach out to Nicholas Murray by email and phone asking what to do or if new passes need to be sent to us. This was on January 10th and 11th and Loe and behold my email and my phone call were ignored. No response. Nothing. The coordinator of disabilities services whose sole responsibility is to see to it that the way i was treated doesn't happen to others who suffer from visible or invisible disabilities can go to their venue and have a good time ignored me after promising to make good on the bad experience both myself and my son had on 12/30/17. Nicholas Murray and RCMH should be ashamed of the way my son and I were treated at the show by their staff and then after when we dismissed and ignored when we were promised that things were going to be made right.",3,,

No apologies , updates or explanations provided whatsoever. When I asked when are we going to be let in and that they are 10 mins late than the scheduled time, the staff said they cannot proceed until they are cleared then he deliberately blocked me from entering twice when all the people were allowed to enter. Inside, people literally rushed to get seats since it is open seating. With still plenty  of seats in the front , a staff was preventing people from taking those seats and directed them to seat in the back. The staff needs to be really retrained in regards to customer service because that is what their job really entails. They became staff sergeants with egos so big as if they own the place. Without the customers, they will not get paid and they really have to remember that!!!!",3,,
