0,Tara S.,"Roselle Park, NJ",165,303,67,4.0,9/7/2013,"Great location, a short walk from Port Authority. My boyfriend and I found out last minute that we had to stay the night in the city because of an early morning call for a shoot the next day. So we jumped on Priceline.com and found this hotel for a super cheap price. Even though the room was prepaid, I felt like the staff was still welcoming. We got a room on the second floor because we checked in half an hour early, but it's tucked away enough that I don't think the street sounds will bother us. Free WiFi is always a plus, and you can upgrade it to better service for a fee. They have a Keurig coffee maker and only offer one tea, one coffee, and one decaf pod but I'm sure if I call the front desk I can get more. Not a lot of shampoo either, so I'm glad I brought my own. Overall it's a nice room, nice location.",3,,
1,Vicky K.,"Mahopac, NY",0,24,0,1.0,10/28/2017,"Where to begin...Arrive, reservation is wrong, although promised twice, now ""impossible"" to have adjoining rooms for our family.  Next, check in to this micro room to find blood stains on bedspread.  They move us.  Upgrade they say....to another FILTHY room w dead and live moths everywhere.  No coffee.  And if your visiting and want a view, not here. This hotel is a dirty prison.  THEN at bedtime we discover the toilet doesn't work. We call the desk for help and a man arrives with a plunger.  He hands it to us and leaves!  No toilet all night.  No toilet at all.  THEN as we're leaving, there's a lady at the desk.  We hear she left for the day. She returned. Opened her room door.  Finds someone else in her hotel room.  All her stuff is gone and there's no knowledge of what they did with all her luggage n belongings. What is that?!  Hands down worst hotel I've ever stayed in.",,,
2,Nicole G.,"San Jose, CA",217,17,1,5.0,3/16/2018,"This is an excellent location, you can walk to Central Park, Times Square, Port Authority, etc. all within 20 minutes or less. Nearby Subway station (although I barely had to use it since you're so close to everything). I've stayed in a number of hotels in the area over the years and this hotel has the largest and nicest rooms. It's the most like a ""normal"" hotel than the other alleged ""4 star"" hotels. Very nice, friendly, and helpful staff. Rooms are very quiet as well, so you won't hear outside noise.",,,
3,Jeff K.,"Boston, MA",195,569,30,2.0,3/20/2016,"Two yelp review pages for this hotel? It's ok.. all the negative reviews here are spot on. No cell phone service in the rooms, elevator sucks, people are nice and location is great.",,,
4,Venkatesh S.,"Austin, TX",0,3,0,2.0,7/8/2017,Average hotel. Only reason(s) for giving 2 star is it's location. For the price paid there was not even a water bottle in the room. One morning I was shocked to see a cockroach on the bathroom sink!Would definitely not stay here again! Would not recommend this property.,,,
5,Angie L.,"Chicago, IL",20,5,1,1.0,1/31/2017,"This is the third time I have stayed at this location. Terrible housekeeping. I stay here because it is one block from my office, so it's very convenient because of location. They have a Keurig machine but do not supply coffee. When I call down stairs they act like it's a big hassle. The guy who brought the coffee pods up was nice though.",,,
6,Linda V.,"Hauppauge, NY",67,17,10,3.0,1/29/2017,"The hotel it self is pretty good, great location, clean but the customer service was horrible. We waited well over an hour to get our car out from their valet parking. One person after another kept blaming it on someone else. I think the hotel would do a lot better with a better staff!!!",,,
7,Arsalan K.,"Jamaica, NY",3,18,0,5.0,3/28/2016,Great location. Close to Times Square and MSG. Walking distance to Bryant park and Empire State Building. Helpful staff. Satisfied.,1,,
8,Matt R.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,16,32,2.0,2/21/2015,"Hotel is what you pay for, very very small room but modern. The people at the front desk are understanding and willing to help. One plus about this hotel is the outstanding and helpful valet man. He was great with suggesting the perfect places for us to go and see in the Big Apple.",1,,
9,Donis M.,"Potomac, MD",29,98,314,1.0,8/22/2012,Rude staff. Very unfriendly and not at all helpful from a Marriott hotel. Front desk staff is terrible. Next time in NYC will stay somewhere else.,2,,
10,Cara H.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,854,574,5.0,6/26/2012,"Great location! Walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, etc. Super close to subway, I think its 42nd and Bryant Park or 6th ave subway. There is a small gym, coin laundry, free wifi, breakfast and coffee. Small, but very clean rooms and helpful staff. There is no hotel bar, but Croton is right next door and open late.",1,,
11,Amanda K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",521,923,274,4.0,2/12/2012,I stayed here for a business trip since our NYC office is literally across the street.  The rooms are a bit small but the beds were very comfy.  The people at the front desk were nice and welcoming.  The only downside is the cell phone reception can really stink but I hear that's common in parts of NYC.,2,,
12,Stephanie S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,26,2,5.0,5/26/2015,"I came to NYC for the first time expecting rude New Yorkers. I was blown away by the friendly, courteous staff willing to help in any way possible. Ada at the front desk was so sweet and so eager to help. George, with security, helped us to recover items my sister accidentally left in her safe. Every thing that she left was recovered. Gabriel at Nosh was so nice and helpful. I just can't say enough how pleasant our stay was. Located close to Bryant Park, and walking distance to Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, and all the grayline bus loops, it was very convenient. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone coming to NYC.",1,,1
13,Jeff F.,"Boston, MA",414,1530,13,3.0,4/19/2009,"Pros: good location, decent room, half block from Jamba, one block from a gym you can get a discounted pass to.Cons: Cell phone reception stinks, internet speed is usually slow and the phones in the rooms usually are aweful (in case you need to fire up speaker phone when your cell phone reception is bad)I'd recommend another property",1,,
14,Sarah P.,"Cleveland, OH",0,2,0,1.0,5/19/2013,"The staff is beyond rude and is not courteous or helpful at all. The front desk staff made every process of the check-in and valet of the car incredibly difficult. No one had a sense of urgency to help anyone. Every time we asked a question, we got a look from the staff as if it was a burden. You did not receive a hospitable welcoming at all. This morning when we checked out, one of the three elevators (servicing 30+ floors) was out. We waited 15 minutes until we had to take the stairs 27 floors down to even be able to check out. We had to wait a long time for everything. We were told that it would take 30 minutes to get our car once we requested it. This is NYC, they have to be able to anticipate a lot of people coming into the hotel. Definitely do not recommend staying here if you are planning a long stay. Luckily we only stayed one night.",,,
15,Kate P.,"Houston, TX",3,224,1,2.0,4/12/2012,"Business travelers: do not stay here. Go somewhere nicer. THERE IS NO AT&T CELL PHONE SERVICE IN THIS HOTEL, PERIOD. Not 2 bars. Not 1 bar. My phone literally says ""No Service."" When I called the front desk to ask about it, they basically said, yeah, AT&T cell phones get no service in our hotel. Not acceptable. There are 3 elevators servicing 30+ floors, no banks, so you can imagine what the wait times are like (awful).When I checked in, they put me in a room with two double beds even though my reservation clearly said ""king."" When I had to go back down (waiting forever for the elevator again), I got no apology. I realize that errors like this happen all the time, but they shouldn't, and that doesn't make them okay. When I asked how it happened, the clerk merely responded that they 'were trying to move too fast.' Well, I was the only person checking in at the time; I'd rather you take your time and get me the right room. The hotel isn't overtly dirty, but the bottles of toiletries are very, very small and low quality. My room looks out over an air shaft. Okay, it's New York, I know, views are of sides of other buildings more often than not, but it's something to be aware of when making your choice of hotel. In fairness, there is a Keurig machine and K-cups in the room, which is always nice, and there is complimentary coffee in the lobby.",,,
16,raul z.,"Huntington, NY",495,306,70,4.0,11/16/2008,"Located just a few steps from the Fashion and Business District, the Courtyard Marriott is a rather small, yet elegant hotel with more like an upscale motel feeling.  The lobby is rather small.  Two coffee machines in the lobby as well as computers are available in the elevator area, which can get quite crowded in the mornings.  The room is clean, comfy and includes free internet, a coffee machine and an HD television as well as a docking station for an Ipod.  However, the furniture looks all scratched.  It is rather beat up and needs replacement.  The lighting in the bathroom is very low making it hard to see yourself in the mirror.  However, overall the room has all the amenities needed for an overnight trip to the city.The express checkout is a voicemail system where you leave your name and room number in a recording, leave the key in the room and you are done.  I did it but it gave me an uneasy feeling of not actually being checked-out...  wish it had a system like the Hilton Hotel where the check-out process is done via the TV system where you can view your bill and check-out completely.  However, the process is fast and guaranteed to be checked-out by the time you leave the hotel.The Final Verdict:Location:  4.5 out of 5.0Lobby/Reception Area:  3.0 out of  5.0Staff friendliness/responsiveness: 4.0 / 5.0Room Decor/Ambiance:  3.0 / 5.0Room cleanliness: 5.0 / 5.0Room Amenities: 4.5 / 5.0Bed Comfort: 5.0 / 5.0Check-in/out Speed: 5.0 out of 5.0Room Price Value:  3.5 out of 5.0Total Score:  37.5 / 45  ( 83 out of 100% or B Grade)Final Comment: The hotel is good for the location catering towards the business clientele on quick trips to that part of town.  Good, clean and comfy rooms with amenities that the business traveler needs... including the price which is $300 for a night... yikes!",3,1,2
17,Brian G.,"Sutton, MA",8,16,28,3.0,1/23/2010,"Good location, recently refurbished rooms and free WIFI. Very good place to spend a couple nights in the city.",,,
18,Karen S.,"Bedford, MA",0,70,0,2.0,12/28/2009,"Just returned from two disappointing nights at this hotel.  On both Sunday and Monday mornings some of my fellow travelers as well as others I spoke with complained of having cold showers because there was no hot water to be had.  The elevators were also painfully slow and, on Monday morning, one of them was out of service.Several of the buttons on our phone didn't work (also a complaint from another guest), the in-room coffee maker was broken, housekeeping never replenished our coffee supplies (we did quickly receive a replacement machine), and one of the bulbs in our room was out.  We were told the hotel was awaiting a shipment of lightbulbs and it was due in tomorrow.As previous reviewers have noted the internet access is SLOW as molasses.  One of the public machines was broken during the time we were there.  And on Saturday night the fire alarm went off on a false alarm.I overheard a guest in the lobby be informed it would be 30 minutes before their car could be retrieved from the parking garage by the valet.",1,,
19,Jess O.,"Gainesville, FL",2,16,6,3.0,10/15/2008,"This place was nice, the room was a decent size, the beds were comfy, the staff was friendly, great location (within blocks of the Empire State Building, Herald Square, Times Square, Garment District, Bryant Park, Grand Central) decent restaurants around, the restaurant/bar downstairs should be skipped but that's a different review.  My main complaint was the price, it was a bit steep but I knew it was to be expected, it was definitely a nice place so I didn't mind paying a little extra, but they could have given a few perks for staying here.   My one perk I would suggest is free wifi in the rooms, it was kind of silly only being able to get wifi on the mezzanine level of the hotel, but I will give them props of having a computer and printer there for guest to use for free.  We were on the 18th floor and had a pretty decent view.  The room size was pretty big considering we were in NYC.  We had a basic room and there was plenty of room for the 3 of us without us having to walk over each other too much.  I will probably attempt to stay here on my next visit.",,,
