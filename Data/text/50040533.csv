My first time here, I tried the Ginger Brûlée Ice Cream- texture was hard, small scoop. Did not taste fresh. Second time:Strawberry Ice Cream- fresh, milky, soft, and fluffy with real bits of strawberry. Scoops were big too. I loved it. Everything a strawberry ice cream should be.",5,2,2
1,Oscar A.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,64,43,5.0,10/16/2018,"This is my favorite ice cream I've had to date! Perhaps it's the way it's made or the fact that all of the ingredients are local/farm-to-table, but there is something special about the bold flavors and soft, creamy texture of this ice cream. My favorite is the Cookies and Cream shake - I get it every time I visit Chelsea. Note: There is a second standalone location which only offers soft-serve ice cream. Come here if you want the traditional stuff!",,,
2,Dianne A.,"Weehawken, NJ",310,40,74,4.0,9/20/2018,"Let me start this review off by saying that I am a carnivore. I loveeee meat! However, when I come to Creamline, I order the impossible burger every time. Every time the burger arrives steaming and aromatic, for a second, just one second, I consider becoming a vegetarian. Of course, right after that I realize that I am only kidding myself because even though their impossible burger is better than most beef burgers, I will still probably eat a steak tomorrow. If you need reassurance that you CAN eat vegetables (or at least vegetable based imitation meat) then you need to give this a try. You can tell people you turned vegan for a whole meal! I took off one star because it took a while for our order to arrive and it was kind of chaotic in there.",1,,
3,Nataly N.,"Brooklyn, NY",285,427,1177,2.0,8/2/2018,"Stopped by to try some boozy shakes. The experience was a bit underwhelming. For $13, the shakes were not so boozy, but they were obnoxiously sweet. I'm a huge sweets person (can eat up to 8 pastries in one go), but even I had to pace myself in order to swallow this mixture... not due to the amount of booze (I couldn't taste any), but due to sweetness saturation. Not sure if the food is worth another trip to try, but the boozy shakes were ""once and done.""",4,1,
4,Noah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,158,430,4.0,7/27/2018,"Very good spiked milkshake! It was a real treat in the heat! The shake didn't have an overpowered sweetness and the liquor didn't overpower the shake. Very balanced on both sides. At first sip, my body was all like, ohhyesssss lol I feel that the spiked shake is strong enough to give you a decent buzz that you'll enjoy (:",1,2,1
5,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,4.0,6/15/2018,"Come to this place if you're in search of a nice and juicy burger made with grass-fed cattle and delicious milkshakes. This location in Chelsea Market is usually crowded due to its popularity and its hype, but there is another location in Chelsea if you don't want to deal with the crowd.The go-to menu item here is the Creamline burger. The burger was fresh and made hot off the grill. The seasoning in the burger was somewhat lacking, in my opinion, but the onion, lettuce and tomato made up for that. The malted chocolate milkshake was delicious and provided the perfect remedy for the warm Spring day.Overall, I'd highly recommend Creamline whenever you're in Chelsea Market and looking for a decent burger.",1,,1
6,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,203,100,5.0,6/28/2018,"This is such a great option if you're in chelsea market and are craving a burger & fries! Came here for a sponsored event and got to try a couple of things on the menu--all of which were absolutely amazing! I tried the cheeseburger, the buffalo chicken sandwich, and the honey butter chicken sandwich. Out of the three, I would say that the honey butter chicken sandwich was my favorite. The chicken was so crispy & the honey butter glaze was life changing! You could tell that the ingredients were high quality and that this was a step up from your avg fast food chicken sandwich. I would highly recommend the honey butter chicken sandwich--it was unique, flavorful, sweet, and salty! We also had the regular fries and the sweet potato fries. The regular fries were solid, definitely can't go wrong, but I enjoyed the sweet potato more. They were really crispy, but soft on the inside & the sauce that it came with was so flavorful and complemented the fries perfectly.We ended the meal with a vanilla milkshake, which was really creamy and delicious and also the fried oreos. OMG the fried oreos changed my life!!!! They were sweet, but not too sweet & came with this delicious home made whipped cream that was so light and flavorful. You cant come here and not get these.Overall, such a great option in Chelsea market! All the ingredients are fresh, local, and high quality!",,,
7,Too Much Lovin C.,"Beacon, NY",107,5,3,3.0,11/3/2018,I was told this chicken sandwich is amazing I give an ok at nest the French fries could have been fried a little linger to give it a better crisp the spice is nice on the the chicken with buffalo sauce and the bread is soft and just melts in your mouth but the chicken patty itself seems like a school lunch,,,
8,Sam W.,"Weehawken, NJ",286,75,104,4.0,6/2/2018,"After spending a rainy day at the Whitney this MDW, my brother and I were starving! We went up to Chelsea Market to examine our myriad options before noticing a man carrying a bright pink milkshake. We followed where he came from and stumbled upon Creamline. Right away the place looked busy, but not jam-packed. They have two lines, one for food, the other for just ice cream and milkshakes (boozy or otherwise). The line for desserts - long; for food - short.My brother ended up ordering their cheeseburger with egg, whereas I ordered the grilled PB&J. My brother loved his burger; he said it reminded him of the classic taste of a McDonald's burger, but elevated with egg. My PB&J was rich, messy, sticky, sweet, crunchy, and everything in between. I couldn't finish it, but I didn't mind since the taste was that great! Since we wanted dessert at another place later on, we decided to forgo shakes, but I'll definitely come back again, even if it's just for the food!",1,,

10,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,88,27,2.0,4/16/2018,"I was convinced by the friendly gentleman in the entrance that Creamline had amazing soft serve ice cream. I waited in line for 10 minutes to order, then about 15 more for my ice cream cone. It cost about $6...a complete rip off. It had less than a cup of ice cream. 75 cents extra for sprinkles...I could count them in the cone. I complained and then guy at the front offered to ""see what he could do"" for me...but with 25 minutes already wasted I was out of there!",4,2,2
11,Soniya C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,1,5.0,11/5/2018,"WOW!! What can I saw about this place?! They are hands down AMAZING!! I came there a year ago and I was walking around and noticed how good it looks. I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich Honey Butter & Pickles and that was an explosion of flavors. A year later my dad went to NY, and I told him the only way he can come home (Arizona) is to buy me my favorite food from NY. He came home with my Fried Chicken Sandwich Honey Butter & Pickles and some Fried Oreos. Creamline is such a unique type of food, they have so many options on their menu, you can't go wrong at all. I can't wait to go back to Creamline to try more of their foods on the menu.",,,
12,Charmaine C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",18,114,113,3.0,6/10/2018,"The two cookies & cream shake was decent! The milk they used tasted amazing. They use all natural ronnybrook farm dairy here. The two cookies part is because they use two types of cookies, the typical dark Oreo one and a light brown one (not sure what type). I also echo what previous reviewers have said about the cookie pieces being too big at the end! This shake should come with a spoon to scoop those up... Sadly, the bottom 1/3 turns into a super sweet cookie-filled sludge that is impossible to drink through a straw.Would have this again, but please share it with someone as it's probably your whole day's allotted calories in a shake.",,,
13,Darren B.,"Newark, NJ",134,43,12,4.0,8/16/2018,"Before we made it to the Highline for our walk, we stopped by the chelsea market for a quick bite. Out of all the restaurants and food joints we saw this one caught our eye first. So obviously we had to try it out. I can't say I was disappointed; the burgers and the sandwich quality here is very good. She got the cheeseburger, I got the buffalo chicken sandwich, and we were both pleased with our choices. The meat on either sandwich was obviously freshly made and everything about either sandwich/burger seemed right. The only couple complaints I have are about the size of the sandwiches and the messy sauce. Seriously my finger tips got covered with buffalo sauce and the tray didn't come with napkins. Lmao a tad embarrassing, but I'll be back if I'm ever in the area",,,
14,Mike B.,"Oceanside, NY",0,5,1,2.0,10/20/2018,"Ordered a burger, fries and a shake, $21... went here for an early lunch while at work and was the 3rd or 4th person total who ordered for the day; took over 25 minutes to get my food. The fries were salted to the point they were barely edible, burger (a whopping 4.5 oz)  was overcooked and not just fast food type well done like cooked to death but the shake was awesome. Several people who ordered after me got their food first, I think they forgot about me at one point, Much better options in Chelsea market, never again. I will say though the staff was very friendly and the place was clean, not much else positive.",,,

16,Rosalie L.,"Irvine, CA",141,123,148,4.0,7/1/2018,"Creamline was definitely a great experience at Chelsea's market. David was friendly and hooked it up for my party. Pretty much all of their alcoholic shakes are delicious. The staff will give you recommendations on which drinks are their best-sellers. The drinks definitely creep up on you so just wait for it. They are a little pricey though so be prepared for that. Also, tried their ginger ice cream that had candied ginger bits and was pretty tasty! Didn't get to try any other their other hot foods but it looked pretty poppin'.",1,,
17,Tian G.,"New York, NY",28,167,267,5.0,6/26/2018,"The restaurant locates in the Chelsea market and can be easily spotted. You order food in the counter to get a number and then wait for it to arrive at your table. Everything is local sauced and the sauces are made in-house. Everything used to serve their food is compositor. And they do care about the environment in every possible way - good spirit!Came here during the Yelp event. We starte off with some nice beer, very refreshing for the summer.Their fries: produced from non GMO potatoes. It is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with the right amount of salt.The cheeseburger: the bun is very soft and the beef still juicy. The portion of the burger is good as well.Sweet potato fries with maple honey syrup: fantastic! I love their crispy sweet potatoes. The sauce that comes with it makes it even better! Very flavorful yet not over-powering. Definitely prefer this more than the regular potato fries.Baffulo chicken sandwich: personally I don't like baffulo sauce, but luckily their sandwich don't have too much of it so I am happy. The chicken is crispy.Honey butter chicken sandwich: I enjoy this one a lot! Their bread even has some sweetness in it. The fries chicken is glazed by honey butter, and it tastes wonderful! The honey butter sause really kicks in with the chicken.Fries Oreo with whipped cream: a nice touch on the sweet desert! The batter outside makes the cake less sweet  and it just looks fantastic! Really warm and delicious! A great combination indeed.Milkshake: simple and tasty! Overall a really good comfy food spot! Given that this is a yelp event and the service team is really attentive&active, a five star for Creamline!",1,,
18,Christine S.,"San Francisco, CA",213,95,31,4.0,1/17/2018,"Impossible burger. The burger for non-vegetarians that is vegetarian. I heard about this burger first in some sort of documentary/special about lab-produced burgers that are environmentally friendly. I recognized the name upon passing in Chelsea Market and stopped in to try. As said on the Impossible Burger site (yes this burger-extraordinary has its own site):THE BURGER FORMERLY KNOWN AS PLANTSRemember the best burger you've ever eaten? Our dedicated team of top scientists, farmers and chefs spent the last five years studying it from cow to bun. Then we identified methods and ingredients to naturally recreate everything -- the sights, sounds, aromas, textures and flavors. The result? This impossibly delicious game changer of a burger.Because we use 0% cows, the Impossible Burger uses a fraction of the Earth's natural resources. Compared to cows, the Impossible Burger uses 95% less land, 74% less water, and creates 87% less greenhouse gas emissions.WOW, how could you not be behind that?! The bonus is that it tastes extremely comparable to beef... the kind of comparable that makes you truly believe you could give up meat. You can message the Impossible Burger Company on their website to bring this ah-mazing veggie burger to your establishment, in case you're interested.I clearly enjoyed the burger and the sweet potato fries (the maple-cayenne mayo is A+), I also enjoyed the  music and vibes in the place (fun, mostly classic jams and very easy going). The only thing keeping me from giving Creamline 5 stars was the fact that no one working there even knew what was in this original burger and why it is so darn special. What a shame!!!! They should at least have some sort of signage States these sustainable-Burger-facts!",1,,1
19,Candice C.,"Joint Base Andrews, MD",107,38,72,3.0,9/25/2018,"I give this place a 3.5. It was tasteful, the food tasted well cooked and seasoned. Fried oreos were freshly made and I appreciated the temperature I love my food hot. The reason I give it a 3.5 is because 1. The wait time was a little ridiculous. 2. The price for this small burger was also quite ridiculous. I understand eating better means spending more money but sheesh. I thought it would be a little fatter, ya know bigger patty and what not. All together not a bad place though, their menu is extended and even the soda machine was cool to me. I would go back to grab a bite but not somewhere I'm really pressed to go back to",,,

Updated review","Creamline is a stellar example of what customer service should be. Here's why: The last time I came to eat here, I ordered their Turkey burger combo. After sitting down at a table waiting for my order to arrive, one of the staff members approached me to let me know that they no longer had any turkey burgers left. Insert sad disappointed face. Not only did he offer me a complete refund but he also asked if I would like something else instead. I choose to get their fried chicken sandwich. Shortly thereafter, he brought my food over (combo with the fries and fountain soda which are btw- all high fructose corn syrup free! Clap it up!) with my refund. I was utterly speechless. I had no idea that they had this kind of policy in place. Most places you go to that don't have what you ordered either give you a refund or ask if you'd like something else (without giving your money back). Moreover, the employee which I believe is the manager apologized for the inconvenience they caused. Apology accepted, good sir. I'll definitely be back.",1,,
21,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,4.0,11/17/2017,"Awesomeness! Met up with a friend to catch up and I suggested this place. I recently learned about the place-- seems relatively new, I could be wrong because it's my first time eating at Chelsea Market.Upon entry, I noticed it's reminiscent of Shake Shake-- not an overly large menu, but just enough to appease the average person. We both went with the cheese burger and a boozy milkshake. I initially went with drink with Kaluha, cannot wrong call the name, but since I didn't want to wait for whipped cream I switched to vanilla sickle. My buddy really liked his, and I enjoyed mine as well.The burger was excellent-- I thought the fries were a tad small for $5 bucks but again, the burger was excellent.I would definitely recommend this place and would return. I usually don't spend almost $30 bucks for a burger, fries and a milkshake, but for good quality, such as this, I can make exceptions.",6,4,5
22,Margarita M. R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,75,101,5.0,9/3/2018,More like DREAMLINE! Finally had the IMPOSSIBLE BURGER. Better than a beef chargrilled burger anytime! The all plant patty is juicy and meaty. Loads of umami. Maple cayenne mayo with my sweet potato fries? Yes please! Super nice staff. I've been here twice and loved everything. Fried Oreos. Wow.,1,,
23,Olivia K.,"Queens, NY",80,151,359,4.0,12/5/2017,"Creamline is a burger shop with the tag line ""From Farm to Tray"". To me, the burgers aren't any super special. They do offer a non-meat option, which can appeal to some. It definitely sounded interesting. They also offer shakes, which is also a selling point here. The good thing about going to the Chelsea Market location is that they offer a Chelsea Combo, which includes a burger, fries (sweet potato/regular), drink/shake (+$3) coming out to about $17/$20 with a shake. I personally got the option with the regular fries & two cookies (nilla wafers/oreo crumbs) shake. With this option, it's quite filling. But it's worth the value. Definitely recommend if you want to try everything. The only thing about the Chelsea Market location is that their seating is fairly crowded. I came on a Saturday and it was quite busy even after typical lunch hours. Luckily, someone offers us a seat fairly quickly. But you do have to wait around for people to exit before finding seating. Otherwise, it's a good food option for upscale fast food.",1,,
24,Julianna A.,"New York, NY",127,14,5,3.0,6/3/2018,"The honey butter fried chicken sandwich was flavorful. Light fried savory chicken, combined with the sweet honey butter on a soft roll. Fantastic! The strawberry shake on the other hand... left me unsatisfied. I paid the extra buck for the malt, didn't do much good. The milkshake consistency was off, as thin as water.  The strawberry flavor was very light and left me wishing for more. Don't break the diet for this letdown.",1,,
25,Frankie I.,"Chicago, IL",281,42,8,4.0,9/15/2018,"Visited this Creamline location while walking through Chelsea Market and decided to go in for lunch. The menu is very appetizing from burgers, to chicken sandwiches and tenders and even grilled cheese. Ordered a burger and grilled cheese for lunch, finishing off later with a milkshake. The cheeseburger was good but certainly not the best I ever had for $11.00, especially being not very filling. The grilled cheese was very tasty and comes with tomato soup to dunk it in. Overall think it was beyond what I expected in taste for the grilled cheese and was underwhelmed with the burger's size and taste. Finally the Shake was tasty, fresh and quickly made.*Side Note, the water is not available to the public via the soda fountain, you receive a small plastic cup and have to go up to the bar and ask for refills which is a real inconvenience when the workers are busy and running around*Overall I would give this place a 4.3/5.0",,,
26,Bailey A.,"New York, NY",1,67,3,3.0,8/27/2018,We have eaten twice here and both times I was not impressed. The burgers don't have a lot of flavor and are dry. It is also pretty expensive for just a burger. We are water drinkers too and when you ask for a cup of water they give you a teeny baby cup so you have to keep asking for a refill. The sweet potato fries are really good though. That was about the only thing I liked about this place.,,,
27,Courtnee N.,"Redding, CA",155,43,5,4.0,8/17/2018,"If you're looking for a place within the market that is casual and tasty this is the place!

If you can't find a table you won't really be missing anything extraordinary. I noticed that they did have deep fried Oreos on the menu (my kryptonite) but I didn't order them because the line was insanely long but they looked amazing!

They also serve Ronnybrook dairy products such as shakes and ice cream which I am a huge fan of. So let's get down to why this place didn't hit the spot. Staff doesn't give a rats ""ash"" about you. It's like I went to them and said ""hey your ketchup machine is broken can you fix it"" they gave me two packets of ketchup instead that we're stuck together by something gross gd knows what and walked away... I ordered the burger fries and a shake which was a combo.. I would asks about that if your ordering all three it's cheaper then ordering them separately but cmon why are you so rude and indifferent to customers. The shake was not impressive at all there's so much better shakes in NYC I was expecting something out of this world because ronnybrook farms has amazing dairy products. I got the vegetarian burger which has that ""fake meat patty"" cheese tomato ketchup and mayo. It was alright I mean very similar to bare burgers version so eh... fries were not worth it they didn't have the crispy exterior soft interior I look for. I don't recommend this place go get los tacos instead. p.s $2.50 for a bottle of non-brand name water. For $2.50 I better be getting essential or Fiji water.",1,,

I went here with my mom and was visiting from out of town. I ordered one of the liquor-infused milkshakes and my mom got a bottled water, but asked for a cup of ice. The kid working the counter said ""in a minute "" to my mom in kind of an attitude. We got our stuff and sat down. The kid left and never got the ice. There was another teenager employee, walking around bringing people their food. My mom asked him for the ice. He kept making more milkshakes and never brought my mom the ice. Finally, after asking the fourth time for ice he replies ""were very busy in here"" and was very rude. I paid way too much money for a milkshake with a shot in it , to be treated like this. I love the concept here and I feel like this place could really take off if they were more customer friendly and actually tried to make an effort. Nobody in the restaurant looked happy. The man next to us asked for something that he never got either, so he just finally ate his meal without it. I wouldn't recommend this place and it really is a shame, with the quality of products they offer being that top notch.",2,,1

36,Sabrina Y.,"West Hartford, CT",125,28,19,5.0,7/15/2018,"Sure, you can get a milkshake just about anywhere that serves a burger, but how often do food spots specialize in spiked shakes? They have a bunch of different flavors to choose from and trust me, you're gonna taste the alcohol and you're gonna get a little buzzbuzzed.What can go great with a spiked shake you ask?? Fried oreos, duh. God, I hate waiting every year for the Big E to get fried oreos, and now that I've found Creamline, I don't have to. The best part of my experience was Paul. Paul is an attentive, helpful and extremely pleasant. He helped me choose which shake to get (I was stuck between the Mocha one and the Chocolate one, because honestly they seem like they'd be the same thing) by explaining the differences between them, which ones were popular, the alcohol in each of them, etc. I was also indecisive on the fried oreos, but praise jesus he suggested getting them because I definitely needed them.I'm one of those people who ask a lot of questions, and Paul didn't seem to mind at all. He didn't rush me, or make me feel annoying. He made sure I was happy with what I was ordering. He even checked to make sure I liked my food. He didn't have to do that. He's a really great noodle. Through out the hustle and bustle that is New York, Paul treated me like a person (not just another order). His sincere attitude literally made me feel great about myself. I went to a bunch of places that day, but Creamline is the only place I'm writing about, and its because of Paul.

37,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25525,5.0,5/16/2017,"zOMG I seriously love Creamline - both the location within the Chelsea Market and their new(ish) brick & mortar in Chelsea. This location is kind of my favorite because it has more seating and the BEST (seriously) boozy (and non-boozy, lol) milkshakes ever. All of their milkshakes, butter and creamy sauces are made with Ronnybrook Dairy which is the crème de la crème of the dairy world. Milkshakes aside, Creamline's chicken offerings are no joke. I love their hot honey sandwich and their chicken fingers - but my fave thing of all is their buffalo chicken sandwich. It's a perfect size to leave you full, but not leave you feeling gross. All of their chicken is locally sourced from farms that raise nice clean chickens...aka no pink sludge or weirdo pesticides in your food. Just deliciously juicy AF chicken goodness.There's also an all day breakfast menu here with delicious pancakes, breakfast sandwiches and more. I could rant all day about Creamline - if you haven't been, definitely go pay them a visit.",4,4,3

I found the burger to be of high quality and flavorful. This visit I also tried the sweet potato fries and they were meaty and crispy! In my prior visit, I found the regular fries to have a nice salty taste.  There was a debate regarding the chicken sandwiches with most preferring the buffalo and some (like me) preferring the honey. In this round, the honey was a bit dry.  However during my first visit, I had the sandwich with no sauce and found it nice and juicy with that crunch! Finally, and most importantly- FRIED OREOS!

40,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,3.0,4/19/2017,"Skip the food and just stick with the ice cream and shakes! Service is super friendly and the space is big enough to house people who want to sit and enjoy the food. They also offer beer and wine at good prices. I came here with one main mission which was to try their boozy milk shakes. You pick the shake you want and they add a shot of whatever liqueur you think would go with it. We got the two cookies and cream shake with a shot of amaretto liqueur. It was delicious. The almond taste paired perfectly with the shake. It was $15 which is a bit high but kind of expected since shakes themselves alone cost around $6. Add a shot and it would add up around there. Maybe if it was a dollar or two less, it would be more appealing since it is only one shot of liqueur. As for the food, that was a letdown. I got the grilled cheese with tomato soup and the fried chicken sandwich covered in honey butter. The grilled cheese was nothing special. The tomato sauce tasted like marinara sauce. The fried chicken sandwich was fine but with the plethora of food options in Chelsea market, I would opt for elsewhere for fat calories.",10,3,4
41,Janice L.,"Staten Island, NY",81,33,169,4.0,1/19/2018,"My initial thought at encounter was ""it's so similar to Shake Shack,"" but turns out (imo) to be better than Shake Shack without all the grease.

42,Corey D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,2,1.0,6/1/2018,"This place is a total ripoff. Don't waste your money! Smallest burger I've ever had! I've seen bigger sliders at bars. Seriously so upsetting. It's just not worth the price. I figured I'd warn the masses. Tasted fine, but wow, what a disappointment.",1,,
43,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,4.0,4/24/2017,"A pretty exciting new burger and sandwich place inside of the Chelsea Market. They also have a second location I think on 7th avenue in the 20s somewhere. I was hearing pretty rave reviews of the place though so I was glad to check it out. Fair warning - they get insane lines around lunchtime. Have not had the chance to try their actual burgers yet or what I hear is one of the better buffalo fried chicken sandwiches you can find. But I did try their all day breakfast selections! A breakfast sandwich on an english muffin with free range eggs, cheddar cheese, and turkey sausage. It was pretty good, it didn't quite blow me away. To accompany it I tried their cheese fries which were above average and made with real cheddar cheese melted down. One of the best parts about Creamline (they do sell beer) but they also sell alcoholic milkshakes. The options: Vanilla, Chocolate Fudge, Strawberry, Honey, Cookies & Cream, Peanut Butter, and Coffee. A variety of liquors are at the bar though they don't really have any set combinations on a menu, you kind of just pick a booze and pray that it melds well. I went with Peanut Butter and asked what they personally would mix into it and they suggested bourbon. Go hard or go home? Right? They were pretty wise with their suggestions. It was fanfreakingtastic. My friend had the oreo with I think baileys or some pussy liquor. But it was also really strong and tasty as well. This is like an ice cream soda shop gone naughty. I approve.",2,,2

Such great customer service. Probs going to have my next birthday there. You the best Creams!",1,,
47,Anant D.,"Fairfax, VA",13,23,68,4.0,1/18/2018,"VENUE: It's an open-air restaurant in Chelsea Market with a classic diner feel. There are standing tables, bar seating, high tables, and regular tables. It's a nice venue in Chelsea Market, but probably fills up quickly during peak hours. From my experience and observations, the restaurant seemed LGBTQ+ and POC friendly.GENERAL: Creamline prides itself on being locally sourced and all-natural with their burgers, fries, and shakes. My friends and I only ordered the shakes, and it's pretty cool because they have some alcohol infused shakes aka Boozy Shakes. THE FOOD: I ordered the 16 oz. Two-Cookies Shake. The two cookies seemed to be crushed Oreos and crushed wafer-type cookies. The milkshake was absolutely delicious - nice and creamy. I definitely do recommend. Do it was frustrating that the cookie pieces got way too big for the straws towards the end (ended up just scooping them out with the straw, which was delicious). My friends ordered the Honey Nut Boozy Shake. Unfortunately, they were out of Amaretto (it was a Thursday late afternoon... I guess they sold out but slightly disappointing nonetheless) and they replaced the Amaretto with some other liquor. My friends said it was strong, but probably would have tasted better with the Amaretto. The boozy shake idea is a cool concept though and it's priced the same or cheaper than a lot of NYC cocktails so can't really complain too much about the almost $13 price. You can do custom combinations too (one side of the restaurant is literally a bar with milkshake offerings). Plus it comes in a nice cup (that's actually plastic). That was both unexpected and cool. Shame it's smaller than a regular shake though. ACCOMODATIONS: They have vegetarian burger options.  OVERALL: Overall, I definitely recommend! If you're in Chelsea Market, a shake plus some mini-doughnuts from the Doughnuttery make perfect desserts. You definitely will not be disappointed with the creaminess! And of course, the Boozy Shake concept is pretty cool!",,,
48,Ben W.,"New York, NY",514,772,435,4.0,9/25/2017,"Good quality American staple inside a tourist food mecca.And I attribute our wait to the fact that everything tasted fresh. We were part of the late night crowd and opted for a cheeseburger, honey butter chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries. Even though it was past 8PM and most of the tourists had left, the wait was still a good 15 minutes for our food.My chicken sandwich was okay. The honey butter however was soooo tasty, I kept licking it off the wrapper. Unfortunately, the chicken was overcooked and actually not that crispy. Maybe it was flattened out too much? The burger on the other hand was delicious. The meat tasted so fresh, and all the ingredients in combination were so tasty. My only note is that the sesame seed bun almost cheapened the flavor for me. I didn't appreciate it, and the seeds kept getting stuff in my teeth. A plain potato bread bun would really let the burger shine in my opinion.Sweet potato fries were pretty good, especially the accompanying maple dipping aioli. I just felt for $5 it was a bit overpriced for the portion. Good quality overall though!",2,1,1
49,Nicole M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",37,20,46,4.0,7/5/2018,Can I just start this review by saying how AMAZING THE POUTINE WAS. JESUS I COULD BINGE EAT THESE FRIES ALL DAY. To be honest I was kind of scraping my fingers on the bottom because the cheese and gravy was that good. The fries had their own flavorful seasoning & I kept stealing off my boyfriends plate !! The Burger was so good and juicy and the egg paired perfectly with it. The egg costs extra but I feel like it's totally worth it. I'm coming back for sure and I can't wait to bring extra money to buy more milkshakes !! Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because seating was somewhat difficult & I totally understand it's chelsea market and you can't take up the size of an actual restaurant. But guys come here and enjoy a burger you'll love it ! Xx.,,,

They also ran out of cheese right after my sandwich was made, so my partner's chili cheese fries were brought out with no cheese. Would have been an A+ experience if not for it seeming that they were running out of a lot of big menu items. The fried Oreos and boozy shake was great!",,,
52,Martha C.,"North Miami Beach, FL",284,119,86,4.0,4/1/2018,The sweet potato fries were good. The chicken sandwich was definitely good.... when it was hot. Unfortunately the kitchen which amazingly turns out orders blazing fast sorta missed on my first one which was cold. But a new piping hot one appeared at my table in no time flat with apologies. And it was lovely. Seating is like most places in Chelsea market a hit or miss occurrence but my friends and I were able to politely tablestalk seats at a high top. I'd definitely love to try their burgers (meat and vegan) and maybe on a day after a reeeeeally long run the fried Oreos.,1,,1
53,Emily J.,"Manhattan, NY",199,144,283,3.0,5/23/2017,"This review is for the regular ice cream only! Visited this place right after a trip to Los Tacos No. 1 as it was across from it. There were only a small selection of flavors (vanilla, blueberry, coconut almond, ginger were the ones I remembered) but the sample of coconut was good. The only thing I didn't love was that it was already sort of melty and I prefer my ice cream much colder. My friend and I both ended up getting the blueberry which was good - not too sweet or artificial tasting. The flavor itself tasted like I could've bought it in a Breyer's pint, nothing super special but still enjoyable.",,,

57,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",342,242,298,5.0,2/21/2017,"I came here after going to Los Tacos, and just needed a place to lean. I was so full I thought I was going to die. So my friend and I leaned on one of the standing tables, when someone asked me if I wanted a sample of their ice cream. I couldn't imagine eating anymore, but it was free and I couldn't turn it down. I tried it, and it was heavenly. I don't know how that they did it, but it was perfectly fresh and tasted so much like vanilla. I took a quick lap around Chelsea Market to prep my stomach for round 2 and promptly came back. I ended up sharing a cookies & cream shake, a chicken sandwich, and fried oreos with a friend. All three were amazing. The fried oreos were very very doughy, but tasted amazing. They were soft and chocolatey. We got the chicken sandwich with the hot sauce and honey butter. Maybe it's the sweetness of the butter, but it wasn't too spicy (I have a low spice tolerance), but at the perfect note of heat to it. It was very tender and delicious. That milkshake though. That was amazing. Perfectly cookie-y and that vanilla ice cream again. I loved it. There aren't enough good things I can say about it. You're just going to have to go and try it out yourself.",3,2,2

I had never heard of Creamline before but I figured grabbing a burger would be quick and easy. After perusing the menu in a glance, I had settled on the buffalo chicken sandwich. Pleasant surprise #1 was the swiftness at which my meal was prepared. Within 1 minute of paying, the food was in my hand already. EXCELLENT. When I got back to work to eat, surprise #2 was that the meal came with fries. The best surprise of all was how delicious my chicken sandwich was. I normally can't tolerate spicy food well and although the sandwich had a good kick to it, it didn't upset my stomach. I don't know why but I still find myself craving for it til this day. It was that good!!",3,1,2

The chicken was also moist. The grilled cheese was nothing to write home about. The tomato soup wasnt the best either. Both kind of bland.

I upgraded my drink to a chocolate shake for only $3 and it was well worth, considering that their shakes are already $7! It's a little busy on weekends, but people come and go. They have an ample amount of seats, and even tables to stand around in case there are no seats left.

76,Alexandra K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/31/2018,"Awful. If 0 stars was an option, that's what the team this afternoon deserved. Wasted 40 minutes waiting for food that never arrived..with no apology. I ordered with no line ahead of me; a chicken sandwich with fries. I knew something was wrong after 20 minutes and seeing tourists who had ordered after I did get their meals first. After another 15 minutes of waiting, I walked up to the counter again and waited patiently to speak to someone. After catching numerous eyes but with zero acknowledgement, someone else asked what the hold up was. The only answer anyone could give was ""one of our fryers went down a moment ago. Sorry for the inconvenience."" I saw at least 6 sandwiches (maybe mine up there, too) sitting in the cold window, looking sad and greasy. If fries were the issue, at least deliver the sandwich! I work in the industry so I understand that equipment can malfunction, but at least communicate to your guests. I immediately asked for a refund, now running late to work, and the gentleman who came up after me  said ""Hey, I've been waiting 30 minutes..."" He was immediately taken care of, apology and refund given. Then the counter person moved on to the woman next to me and asked her what her order was so she could refund her when she hadn't asked! Mind you, I've had almost no interaction other than ordering with the counter, if I had been rude I would understand this treatment but I hadn't so I dont get why I was not only blatantly ignored, but didn't receive an apology just thrusted a receipt with $0 as the value (so we will see if I am actually refunded) and ""If you're unhappy, call the number at the top."" I'm assuming they thought because I look like a teenager and have a backpack, that I wouldn't complain? That doesn't make sense but that's the only reasoning I can think of! Very disappointed and left an extremely hangry person.",,,

I mean the line was out of the designated area into the walkway, but there's got to be a reason for a long ass line right? + GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH: (5/5) but make sure to get it with their TOMATO SOUP! Dip the cheesy grilled cheese sandwich into the tomato soup for a taste of heaven! Perfect on a cold winter day. + BURGER (5/5): so good. The sesame bun was so soft and the meat was juicy and tender. I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. Nothing special about the burger, but just that it satisfies any burger craving.

The manager came and explained us that float is a new item and the cashier didnt know that float is made of custard + root beer but not soft serve. As an exception they gave us root beer and soft serve seperately and even an order of fried oreos as we were very disappointed.On the flip side, the taste of the icecream was good as the milk is local and tasted absolutely fantastic.",2,,2

The chocolate sauce was made with real dark chocolate and it was pretty special, you can tell that it's made from real chocolate when it hardens on the ice cream.

We were excited for their cheeseburger from some of the reviews here on Yelp. When they served us our lunch (finally - we waited around 30 minutes), my husband's bun was saturated with the blood and juices from an essentially raw hamburger patty (extremely rare). It was beyond disgusting and ruined both of our appetites. When we asked them to put the burger on the grill for a bit longer to cook (very politely may I add), the lady working at the grill acted very put out and rude. The fries were just average. Even after the burger was cooked more thoroughly, it was average AT BEST. I have had McDonalds cheeseburgers that have tasted better. Save your time and money and avoid the Creamline in Chelsea Market! This was not worth the expensive price. We left extremely disappointed.",,,

The sandwich was good but would say it's nothing out of the ordinary. The burger and the tuna melt that my friends ordered looked quite good though. Also got a side of fries, which were decent as well. We each tried the different soda drinks they had there. I got the lemon lime one. It was refreshing and good.

I got chicken tenders from Creamline, which is something I usually fancy, but they seemed very run-of-the-mill. Main pain point? The chicken tenders could have used a bit more crisp -- but they didn't do anything wrong. They just didn't really wow me. I eyed my friend's chicken sandwich which was lathered up with honey butter, and she said ""this is like crack"", so I imagine that's not a bad menu item to get. and shouldn't have added 0.50 cents to the bill for asking for a bit more sauce... needless to say, I didn't exactly cream myself over this meal, but Creamline is pretty decent for a lunch meal (and fuel for the trek on the Highline).",2,1,1

Unsure if the cost was due to its location being inside a giant tourist food spot or the quality, I still raised my expectation.

But the soft serve here just blew my mind with the perfect amount of creaminess. This has to be the best soft serve I've had(and cost me the most). and now Im not sure if I'll still opt for ice cream when the alternative is Cream Line.

I was a little upset that I had ton share it with my daughter but the baby has to neat too :P (We fed her other things too, I'm not a horrible parent!). This fell apart through for me at the Tomato soup. I just found it too sour, even in the amount I got. This was also partly my fault. What was I thinking! Hot soup during a hot summer!!! (Come On Isaac! you are better than that!). It was a bit on the greasy side, but so are most GCS!Fries - I had issues with these fries. I HATE it when I get fries that are not double fried. These frieweren't double fried. I don't know if that is their policy or the person on the firer doesn't know what they are doing. but I think there is nothing worse for a french fry when it isn't double fried. Once to cook through/blanche and the other the crisp up!Milkshakes - This was a saving grace for this place. i hate milkshakes that are over saturated on sugar and cream. They've got a good balance going on for the Coffee milkshke and I'll definitely have it again.Pancakes - When my wife told me that their pancakes were dense I kind of scowled and was upset with the concept. She couldn't finish all three so I decided to see what she meant. It's odd but I found it a GOOD type of dense (i feel weird just typing that).

On a recent visit I saw the ample seating at Creamline and decided to stray from my regular standbys and give a new spot a try. So many things on the menu sounded amazing, but I narrowed it down to the buffalo chicken sandwich and definitely made an excellent choice. It was a lightly fried chicken breast, smothered in hot sauce with a cooling ranch dressing and nice leafy green lettuce on a fresh bun. The sandwich was a little messy from the sauces but the taste was everything I was craving. I was pretty stuffed from the sandwich but I couldn't resist a little ice cream on the way out. The server recommended the soft serve and I'm really glad she did. The rich, creamy vanilla was in another league from the typical Mr. Softee we all know and love. I added honey and almonds and it was pure perfection. I'll definitely return to Creamline the next time I'm in Chelsea Market to work my way through the rest of the menu.

Creamline also carries a unique line of bottled soft drinks.

The staff was super-busy, but took the time to make sure our order was correct and even proactively set us up with a to go bag for our chips.There was even a unique spirit amongst our fellow diners. Naturally, it was very crowded and I noticed that people were inviting others to sit at their tables so they wouldn't have to stand and eat.We were only there for about 45 minutes as we enjoyed our break from sight seeing, but Creamline in the Chelsea Market definitely stood out as a pleasant respite from our days journey around the city!",1,,
142,J T.,"Parsippany, NJ",146,29,3,4.0,1/16/2017,"I usually give most places 5 stars so long as everything goes smoothly, but there was something about this place that didn't leave me 100% satisfied. Walking in, I have to say, I loved their branding - their menu is posted on a huge chalkboard-type board right above the registers, so you have to give it a brief peruse before ordering. On this particular day, it was a Friday, but surprisingly there wasn't any ridiculous line or wait. I went up to the cashier and ordered quickly, and afterwards noted that he was pretty impersonal and, not unfriendly, but just somewhat cold towards me. He may have been having a bad day, but I still think it's possible to be a little nicer. (Then again, it's New York City and Chelsea Market is bustling as usual. I can't expect the guy to be grinning from ear-to-ear while taking my order, in his defense.)I went here with some friends, and we all, aside from only one of us, ordered the cheeseburger and the fries. It took about 15 minutes to get to our table, and it was definitely a good burger! Cooked nicely - not too dry and not too pink - and had a standard mix of ingredients commonly found in cheeseburgers: pickles, ketchup, and cheese among them. The fries were also good, hot and fresh out the frier. The other thing I didn't fully enjoy about this place was the seating. There were 4 of us, and it was a little difficult to find a table, as there was a seat missing at one of the open ones and the dining area is difficult to navigate as the tables are placed so close together that it's a bit cramped. So I wouldn't suggest this place for large groups definitely.Other than that, my experience was a-okay! Nothing mind-bogglingly special, but definitely worth a stop if you're looking for something to eat. I may even find myself back here to give one of the milkshakes a try. So all in all, a nice little place amongst all the others in the Market.",,,2

144,Mir P.,"Santa Ana, CA",134,63,62,5.0,11/23/2015,"First time trying out Creamline in Chelsea Market in NYC. Loved it so much! With limited time in the City on a brief visit from the West Coast, we have to choose our stops wisely.The three items we ordered (see photo) included the tomato soup with cheese sticks (really a grilled cheese sandwich cut in quarters), a corndog and two scoops of creamy chocolate ice cream sprinkled with coconut and chocolate nibs. We were not disappointed. All were tasty and fresh, and I must say that the corndog had an original taste with the heirloom cornmeal crunchiness and all-natural beef hotdog. It's not the smooth, perfect corndog you may be accustomed to eating, but that's what makes it great! There's beauty in this tasty, imperfect dog. On another note, the tomato soup was tangy strong but yummy, and the grilled cheese was prefect--very comforting.I have to admit something though: What drew me in was the unhomoginzed whole milk in the cooler calling my name. Creamy goodness never tasted so delicious. There were other milk choices in the case, so you can have your dairy low-fat, chocolate or as a drinkable yogurt in various flavors and in different sizes. Mmmmm, so good.",3,,

Although the food was okay, it didn't really have any oomph to it besides the fact that the cheeseburgers are made with really good meat. I ordered cheese sticks with tomato soup and the soup was more like thick tomato sauce instead. I have had better. Cheese sticks weren't really sticks, they were grilled cheese cut in half. The Mexican cola is expensive but really good. The fries, on the other hand, super super oily it looks and tastes like it has fat goozing out of it. I didn't want to eat the fries.",1,,

I would bite this amazing burger and then eat this sad little once fried fry. If you are a fry snob (like myself) you may be a bit disappointed. Just go for the burgers and ice cream.

153,Kashonda D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,2,5.0,6/28/2017,"Wandered through Chelsea market today to grab dinner and with all the yummy options we luckily stumbled upon Creamline. Two words: Soooooo GOOD! We ended up ordering one thing from every part of the menu because we couldn't decide if the golden crunchy friend chicken strips were better than a burger and if fried Oreos were better than their boozy shakes. Happy we tried it all because we still can't decide. Everything is fresh and from local farms too . Hint: try the turkey burger w/bacon, sweet potato fries, fried Oreos, and any (if not all) of the boozy shakes. You won't regret it! But, yours thighs may :/",,,
154,Industry G.,"New York, NY",113,5,19,5.0,8/19/2016,"Me and some friends met up at Chelsea Market to do what we do best: eat. None of us wanted to fuss around menu wise, which is why happening upon Creamline was pretty much perfect.The space is bright and clean, and screams burgers and shakes as soon as you walk in. After being told by my friends to focus and move ahead being in a bit of a daze checking out the ice creams (I'm a little obsessed with dessert), we went on to check out the menu towards the main counter.I got a cheeseburger with extra pickles and bacon, because America. One of my friends was feeling more surf than turf, so she loved that they had a tuna melt option and went ahead and ordered one. Another got the Buffalo chicken sandwich. Another went grilled cheese and tomato soup. We loaded up the table with fries and homemade potato chips and dove in head first.I have two standards of burger: restaurant and fast food. While I love both, I'm partial to my fast food burger, hands down. I don't want my burger complicated with tomato confit and onion marmalade and all that nonsense. I want to taste my childhood in every single bite. I want juicy beef. I want melty cheese. I want the heat from the burger to assimilate the slight brine of several pickles and the sweetness of the ketchup. Throw some bacon in there too because gluttony is delicious. Put all of that between a sesame seed bun, and mission accomplished. I know, I know: it's just a burger. Creamline, however, is one of the few places that has officially nailed it in my book. Depending on which area of the city I am in, I have a few go-to places I frequent if and when the burger crave hits me. Needless to say, if I'm anywhere on the west side of lower Manhattan during such an occurence, I'll be making a trip to Chelsea Market.I tried a bit of some of the other things we got. Tomato soup (give it a minute or two, it does come out pretty hot) and grilled cheese was great. So was the Buffalo chicken sandwich, but my favorite of the others was the tuna melt. It's a good size sandwich, which is great if you are starving. Pull it apart and the melty cheddar and pickles reveal themselves. Also apparently it's pole caught in American waters, which I love. Sustainable, cruelty-free awesomeness (which seems to be one of the main themes of this place). Fries and potato chips were great. Crispy and slightly salty, begging for a little dip of ketchup. We got two of each which was the perfect amount for our group of four.We saved the best for last and hit up the ice cream station. Friends got some soft serve, a cookies and cream shake, and an order of fried Oreos. I got a peanut butter milk shake because I'm obsessed with peanut butter. All delicious, but the Oreos were something very next level. I'm used to the ones you get at the local fair that were fried hours beforehand and have since gotten cold and stale. These came out gooey and otherworldly. I had to ask them what their secret was. I spoke to a member of the staff, and they told me that they dip them in their homemade pancake batter and fry them to order. The bar has officially been raised.I'll be back for sure.",1,1,

The best part of the burger is the bun. The salted caramel shake is literally vanilla with a splash of caramel. The price is okay, giving the fact that you're on Chelsea Market but there's so much more to try in the same floor. Service was relatively fast and the cashier was somewhat friendly, obviously this is New York.I don't know, I don't tend to give such a poor rating but sadly I was too dissapointed.",2,2,1

We also split a cookies-and-cream milkshake, an order of potato chips, and fried Oreos. Everything was great, but we really enjoyed the potato chips and the Oreos. The chips were fresh, crispy, and not overly salty. The soft-serve also looked really tempting. I'm planning to try that the next time I'm in the area.",1,,
165,Stephanie W.,"Richmond, IN",39,78,22,3.0,3/14/2016,"I really wanted to like this place, given their use of wholesome, locally-sourced ingredients. And if the employees had acted like they gave a crap about customer service, this would be at least a 4 star review, because the food was delicious. Alas, poor service has knocked this review down several notches.When I walked up to the counter, I was not greeted by the young employee behind the register. Instead, he stood with a frustrated look on his face, almost as if he was annoyed to take my order. When I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich, he quickly interrupted me to say that they were out of bacon. Fine, I'll be happy to substitute sausage.I waited for 25 minutes to get my food, which I felt was excessive, given the lack of a crowd at the time. I saw several employees eating their food at the counter before I got mine, which made me wonder why their food took precedence over paying customers.The vanilla milkshake I ordered had obviously sat for at least 20 minutes of my 25 minute wait, because it was incredibly melty. However, the taste was rich and creamy, which made up for the consistency. My breakfast sandwich was delicious: the sausage was well-seasoned, the English muffin fluffy, and the egg yolk runny.However, while I was eating, an employee cleaned the bar next to me, moving my food to do so. Again, I feel like I must reiterate that the establishment was NOT crazy busy. I felt like I was being rushed to finish my meal and leave.My experience would've been fantastic if the customer service had been a little more customer-focused. I will not be back next time I'm in the city.",3,,1
166,Michael J.,"New York, NY",1,62,4,4.0,4/25/2016,"So I came to creamline after hearing about the burger, I ordered both the burger and the grilled cheese with tomato soup.The burger was $8 which is fair and is a very thin salty patty perhaps coming close to those in and out patties. It was a decent burger but a little plain and too salty although the bread quality is high and goes well with the patty. The burger being just okay is what keeps this place from being a 5/5.As a side note on one of the sites (eater maybe) they said the grilled cheese was good. As such i tried it and it was absolutley delicious. It was a very traditional one but great bread grilled at the right tempurature and the cheese is melted just perfectly and goes very well with the tomato soup, make sure you get it.They seem popular for their shakes but I didnt try it so cant comment.",1,1,

My better half got the buffalo chicken sandwich and a milkshake. Lucky for me he let me sneak a few tastes of both, bc they were amazing. I would highly recommend everything we tried- and next time I'm there I plan to order the fried chicken (looked incredible on my neighbor's plate :).",2,,

169,Professore P.,"Manhattan, NY",111,53,279,5.0,2/21/2016,"I'm only going to rate one of their items on their menu here. Others can explore the rest. Creamline's chocolate malted (or any other flavor for that matter). My generation grew up on Malteds. America went to Malt shops. You've heard of Malt shops and seen it in the movies. Actually, Malteds were even more prevalent in my dad's generation as American's accompaniment to a burger. Unfortunately, thanks to MacDonalds and others, for that few cents that they must make in savings, they chose to only market shakes. So, we're left with a  generation that only knows Shakes. They don't even know what a malted is. So it is really hard to get (or even find), a good chocolate malted in NYC.(Now, for a good marketer, reading this, and realizing, this was America's favorite drink years back, and the only reason it disappeared was, heavy marketing on the less expensive Shakes ... hmm ... maybe you'd like to come up with a malt shop).Baskin Robbins Is CluelessAnd now, Baskin Robbins branches who market Malted is extremely tiny print on their wall menu, like they're embarrassed they haven't taught their workers how to make one, I guess they don't have internet access as to what the recipe is  ... What Baskin workers call Malteds, is malt powder with ice cream and milk, leaving out another major key ingredient, the chocolate syrup.I don't know exactly what is in Creamline's formula, it's a white, ice creamy substance that flows out with a thick consistancy into a plastic cup (before the malt powder .50 extra and chocolate syrup and is whipped up in a traditional soda counter mixer to a perfect, thick necktar of chocolate godliness. But whatever their formula  is, they 'nailed' it. My one and only criticism is, Creamline's plastic cups are too freaken tiny. I want a large malted. For $7, heck charge me $10. but as I walk out of your store, out of Chelsea Market and get two blocks away and hear my straw sucking the last few drops and debating on going back, you could have just sold me a larger size. Okay, now that I've ranted a bit, my palate is drooling. I'm gonna walk down to Chelsea market  right now and get me another. Gotta stop writing these reviews. They make me hungry.BTW: Their service is excellent also. One of these days I'm going to look at the menu and try something else. :)",2,1,2

I am extremely disappointed!!!This place WAS great when they first opened... almost a year ago. I ordered a breakfast sandwich from them in which it came on a freshly made biscuit in a small cardboard like box since it was to go. It was amazing! The sandwich tasted freshly made minus the warmed up sausage. They had hot sauce and ketchup packets on the side to grab and go. Since coming back a few weeks/months their breakfast sandwiches came on a HAMBURGER BUN, but still in a normal to go box and hot sauce and ketchup on the side. Still tasted freshly made. Now I just walked over to get a breakfast sandwich since our office is across the street and I must say it was TERRIBLE!! First off, I couldn't even find the ketchup and hot sauce packets to grab and go when my order arrived.  So I asked and the young boy handed me hot sauce in a to go plastic ramekin. All is well until I get to my office 2min later and my sandwich is in a wrapped up mcdonalds looking wax wrapper. Ok I understand you're saving on making fresh biscuits, to go tuppers and ketchup and hot sauce packets. But when I opened up my sandwich. It was a mess!! I literally had to put my sandwich together because my English muffin top and COLD sausage were off of my egg. My egg was fried and whatever they were making prior to my egg, there were small burnt pieces stuck to my egg. My cheese was all over the bottom of my wrapper. Very disappointed! My colleague ordered an oatmeal and half of the small 10oz looking cup was all toppings and filler. Don't order either breakfast sandwich or oatmeal!!! If you're going to skip out on everything months after your opening, at least make it presentable. Your store is in an office based building with fashion offices all around you. These are big brand headquarters. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and I will definitely not be returning and I will be sure my colleagues know not to come and order food from your place. I would rather seamless from the bagel buffet as they never disappoint my colleagues and I.",,,

I've definitely enjoyed far better milkshakes at other places for the same price or less. Absolutely do not think it is worth it to get one here.In addition, I was with a friend when we ordered and ordered our milkshakes separately. However, before my friend's order they were bringing out a shake that someone had apparently ordered and left before picking up; the employee taking my friend's order seemed to realize my friend was asking for that same flavor milkshake, whispered something into her colleague's ear, and that employee took the left-behind milkshake into the kitchen and came back out with (seemingly) the same shake a split-second later--to sell to my friend. We definitely had a strong suspicion they gave my friend a leftover milkshake. Really sketchy behavior and definitely NOT okay.",,,

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and the hubs ordered the classic burger with egg and bacon. They were good but nothing to write home about. Decent average burger and chicken sandwich but bad service. I am between 2 and 3 stars but bumped it up because of their use of farm fresh ingredients,,,
187,Brendan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",203,5,1,5.0,6/24/2016,My cousin works at Google so when I'm in this hood I try to snag a free lunch there but after trying the cream line burger and cookies and cream shake it's definitely worth skipping the free lunch. Holy shit the double patty burger was delicious and messy and the cheese was melted perfectly and tasted super fresh.  The biggest surprise was the chips and fried Oreos. The Oreo melts inside its fried shell and becomes a chocolate gooey godsend.,,,
188,Derrick M.,"New York, NY",26,92,83,3.0,3/7/2017,"Really good malted chocolate fudge shake. Quite expensive for a shake that is quite small. But what else do you expect from a place in the Chelsea Market. I also like my shakes thick and asked the guy to do so but he definitely didn't hear me because it was like drinking milk. Good, but not thick.",,,
189,Buddy H.,"Manhattan, NY",19,22,0,2.0,1/19/2016,"I want to like this place.  I really do.I've eaten here 4-5 times and usually for breakfast.  The service here is fast, but I was shocked when I received my breakfast sandwich before even walking away from the counter.  Upon getting to my desk five minutes later, I discovered that the sandwich was cold and that at some point it had been sitting under a warmer for an extended period of time.Early on in my experience with Creamline I ran into chunks of fried fat in my (sometimes-burnt) chicken biscuit (when the biscuit was still on the menu).  There are significant challenges with consistency here.The service is always pleasant.  Sadly, the food isn't.",1,,
190,Nina B.,"New York, NY",0,8,3,5.0,6/30/2016,"Just so so so good. The cheeseburger is absolutely delicious, and it tastes even better knowing it was sourced from local beef. We also had the griddled PB&J and the chips, both fantastic. The fried oreos were earth shattering. EARTH SHATTERING. Far beyond the fried oreos you find at a carnival or whatnot. The two cookies and cream milkshake was like Ben & Jerry's Milk and Cookies ice cream but even better because it was Ronnybrook dairy. Definitely not the last time I'll eat there and everything we ordered I would love to have again!",,,
191,Caroline J.,"Biloxi, MS",50,13,15,4.0,12/1/2015,"Nice atmosphere, with a lot of choices. I went with the simple tomato soup and grilled cheese. It's a classic and they didn't disappoint. I would come here again.",1,,1
192,Samer H.,"Manhattan, NY",138,168,2,5.0,10/3/2015,"Mmmmmm. While everyone else in NYC's food scene is resorting to obSCENE food combos, deconstructed foam dishes, and PR, this place just wants to make food. I really love their attention to local products. I got the corn dog. It was perfect. Menu is very American, and down to earth. Think of it as simple food done very well, rather than complicated food done mediocre. Glad this place opened up. Can't wait to try their burgers and homemade ranch! Also one of the employees, Steve introduced himself and was very nice. The whole staff was great. Will be back!",3,2,
193,Emily F.,"Goldsboro, MD",0,2,0,1.0,3/25/2017,Terrible service. Waited 15 minutes for someone to walk in a refrigerator and bring out a pre-made salad. So rude. Didn't even apologize for making me wait for no reason. People with cooked food that ordered well after me got their food before I got my salad. Will never eat here again.,,,
194,Renee H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,0,5.0,8/24/2017,"I've eaten a few burgers in my time and I have to say that the Cheeseburger I had here was excellent. Nothing fancy just a great combo of fresh bun, salad and perfectly cooked burger patty  Would 100% recommend.",,,
195,City K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,86,5,3.0,1/19/2017,"Service friendly. Sweet potato fries don't taste fresh. Dry, cold and has been sitting out in bin too long I am guessing. Iffy about recommending this option among all the other great eateries inside Chelsea Market.",,,
196,Kelly S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,9,1,5.0,9/26/2016,Most amazing burger!! My mom was a fan of the fresh half and half that she brought home for her coffee. Getting a milkshake next time I come back!,2,,
197,Canny F.,"Knoxville, TN",666,1589,7123,3.0,1/13/2016,"I tried the Ginger creme brulee and I wasn't sure what to expect. If you like ginger, order this. It's basically ginger ice cream.",,,
198,Natalie H.,"Ithaca, NY",0,19,11,4.0,6/12/2016,"Tried the Cookies and Cream milkshake. Their milkshakes are made with soft serve,  not hard ice cream,  but the soft serve is very good quality with lots of buttery dairy flavor. The milkshake was strongly vanilla flavored and had a lot of cookie chunks and crumbles. My friend like the Buffalo chicken sandwich, which had alot of sauce and a big piece of fried chicken. Hard ice cream servings are generously sized. The restaurant area in Chelsea Market has a clean and spacious seating area. They were giving out free soft serve samples and let you test ice cream flavors before you buy.",,,
199,Hunter P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",87,8,3,4.0,1/31/2017,The ice cream shakes are delicious. The fried Oreos  are very donuty to the point you can't really taste the Oreo but still interesting. Burgers/Fries were good but not shake shack quality. Solid 4 stars.,,,
