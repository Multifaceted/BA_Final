0,Phillip R.,"New York, NY",0,19,0.0,5.0,11/8/2018,"What a hidden gem! Down a steep staircase, into the foyer, with a single table for a large group.  Then down the long corridor to a glassed-in solarium with the other tables and the bar.  A quiet, intimate space, perfect for a date or to catch up with an old friend.Welcoming staff makes me feel right at home.  Then the menu - WOW - limited menu of taste explosions - perfectly balanced combinations you never thought of, but once you taste it, it's obvious.  Been there (There) 3 times and just have to try the whole menu.  Standouts - in-house cured (steelhead) trout, duck breast, cucumber salad.  Did I mention the trout?Some great house wines and Karl really knows how to pair them with the food.  Of course, now I'm here and not there.  But when I was there, I felt like I was here.",2,,
1,Alies V.,"New York, NY",1,33,0.0,4.0,11/14/2018,"Four stars for this lovely new restaurant as I would love this place to be successful (and more crowded!), it looks beautiful, cozy and well styled, with nice furniture, and a very European, pretty look. Owners are super friendly and engaged. The starters we had were very nice, especially the dumplings that the chef sent, though on the small side. The mains were nice too, but it is currently a very limited menu. The duck was amazing and in-line with the starters, the crispy chicken was nice and very crispy indeed, but didn't necessarily fit with the rest of the menu. We thought USD 98 for a two-person Cote de boeuf was a little steep for the LES....",1,,
2,Cecillia X.,"New York, NY",498,42,41,4.0,10/26/2018,"Super cute tapas place in LES! Entering the restaurant is even fun--you go down a narrow hallway and emerge in the cozy dining room with high ceilings, impeccably decorated. Servers are incredibly nice, too. My friend and I came at 8pm on a Thursday, and even though I had a reservation, one could have walked in, as well.Great wine selection--I had the pinot noir from Bourgogne, which was excellent. We ordered the wagyu tartare with shishito peppers, cheese selection, fried chicken, and bread. The wagyu tartare was a standout--the shishito peppers really gave it a nice kick. The fried chicken was also delicious, if you like extra crispy skins (which I do). The sweet sauce that the fried chicken comes with compliments the chicken beautifully.Only reason I am taking off a star is because the fried chicken took forever to arrive, and we had to inquire about it twice. Not a super big deal; there may have been some confusion as to when we wanted dishes to come out.For the 3 small plates, 1 entree, and 2 glasses of wine/each, it came out to ~$65 per person. Would visit again!",,,
3,Christopher X.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",34,7,9,5.0,10/21/2018,"Nice new upscale casual hole in the wall spot on orchard street in the LES. Innovative menu with unique recipes and extensive beer/wine menu.The main dining area is tucked away in the back along with the bar with an open roof. Very cute spot and great for dates. Ordered the fried chicken with a spicy strawberry sauce; one of the best I've had in the city- the breading was crunchy rather than oily/crispy , almost like tempura. And the meat was tender and juicy, not rubbery or dry at all not even the white meat, probably bc they use high quality organic. Ricky the owner is personal and enthusiastic and recommended a good local beer to pair the meal. Had my eye on the duck as well will try next time. Highly recommend as a regular dinner spot for anyone in the neighborhood.",2,,
4,Ely L.,"Bronx, NY",6,34,4,4.0,11/10/2018,"Had dinner Friday night at There, where we had some delicious flavorful scallops, an incredible fried chicken main dish, with super crispy skin yet juicy and well seasoned/marinated meat, and super yummy duck breast. I had some great wine recommended by Karl who was super sweet and helpful when picking our dishes. I knocked a star because the wait for our food was long (kitchen was busy pushing out a lot of orders at once) but does not stop me from wanting to go back and I'm sure they will get a hang of it. Congratulations and wishing a lot of success to There!",,,
5,J C.,"Los Angeles, CA",209,7,3,2.0,11/10/2018,"I went with a large group. We ordered almost everything off the menu. The server did not advise us to order more food. The portions are way too small and the pace of the food coming out was extremely slow even though the restaurant was only half empty. We all went to get grilled chill around the corner after we left, we were starving!",1,,
6,Bryan E.,"Manhattan, NY",5,5,0,5.0,11/8/2018,"This place will be on the Eater hot list in no time. Every dish was outstanding and flavorful. Our waiter, Karl (sp.), was great and set us up with a great bottle of wine. Highly recommend, and get in before it's too busy!",1,,
7,Jill A.,"Naples, FL",32,6,1,5.0,10/20/2018,This is a wonderful new Asian fusion restaurant in the lower east side. Great ambiance. Fantastic food and wine. Highly recommend the duck. Wait staff was exceptional. Will go again.,1,,
8,Magaly A.,"El Molino, Mexico",0,1,0,5.0,10/13/2018,"I LOVED this place! They just opened this week and I came to have dinner on Friday night. The place is really pretty and luminous. Food is amazing, I had the buckwheat salad and the fried chicken and they were both delicious. They have a great selection of wines and beers. Servers are very professional and friendly. I am definitely coming back, can't wait to try everything on the menu!",3,,
9,Alison P.,"Boston, MA",125,1,0,5.0,10/27/2018,"I came here with 3 out of town friends for a 30th birthday dinner and was blown away by the service, decor and food. Our server Karl went out of his way to make the evening special, starting with balloons tied to a chair as we walked in and ending with the creme brûlée trio with candle to celebrate the occasion. We ordered: the cheese plate, shrimp, smoked trout, duck confit, scallops, and fried chicken and everything was thoughtful and delicious. There were surprises along the way like the sweet-savory hot sauce with the chicken and the fruit sauce and Camembert on the cheese plate that made the experience even better. The decor was adorable as pictured with a cool greenhouse roof and the space made it easy to have a conversation. I'll definitely come again and was happy we choose it for our special occasion!",1,,
