A very ""nyc"" spot as the food is tasty and the space is very aesthetically pleasing.To start we shared the roasted sweet potato, which was delicious, but WAY overpriced considering we didn't even get a full sweet potato...For the main course my friend and I had the salmon and the trout. Salmon was delicious. Trout was good, but I did not expect it to be breaded.I would go back for brunch, but not my first pick.",,,
1,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,11/4/2018,"We came here for brunch on a Sunday and waited about 45 mins for a table at 115pm. The place was absolutely packed. Brunch options here were pretty run of the mill and none of the dishes had meat included, but available for a massive surcharge. I went with a burger instead since it would be the most filling. The morris burger was surprisingly delicious, which was a well balanced burger albeit a bit difficult to eat due to it's thickness. Service was really slow in refilling the water here. I had to constantly ask for refills, which was a huge pain. Overall, good decor and food, not so great service.",2,1,1
2,MK M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",270,335,93,3.0,9/29/2018,"It's ok. Something I thought intriguing from the outside but once your inside and actually experience the vibe and the food, there is something Off putting about it. The hostess seemed distressed and tired, so did myBartender, and then I ordered a chicken sandwich $18 from the bar menu and it was a cole slaw sandwich basically. See picture below. The flavors were good but after realizing I'mEating fluffy bread and a side salad with coleslaw, I wasn't gonna be filled. Why this sandwich is 18 dollars I don't understand. So for glass of verdicchio, the sandwich, and a gin/tonic by bill was 44 dollars. And let me just say I'm not being negative, I just didn't feel that the experience, the staff, and the product lived up it's price range. So I can do without it. It would be a good place for drinks and impress someone as a business lunch orDinner, but as a foodie, I don't think it's worth it.",1,,

Also the bar is really prettyCame here on a Sunday, around 1:30 pm. They were still offering brunch and of course lunch. We were seated promptly as there was plenty of space. The service was pretty quick too and the staff was attentive. The food was just okay. First off, the menu is small. We got the mad morris burger which came with bbq sauce, bacon, cheese and an onion ring. Also came with a side salad all for $19 which is a lot if you don't even get fries with that. I ordered it medium and its came well done and dry. I'd skip the burger We also got the veggie eggs Benedict which were also just okay. Came with a side of home fries The best thing we ordered were probably the vinegar fries which were good but cost $10!! Cocktails during brunch are $15... To sum up: cute place with amazing interior but the food is just okay. I would say to come here for drinks and check out the restroom!",,,1

Beers were okay as was wine but nothing special The menu is all over the place as has comfort food specials like meatloaf, to international influences dishes like the mussels.     The mussels were okay but a bit cloying.  Fries were not that hot when came out which is problem with shoestring fries.  The website talks about curated alcohol and think the rest of the menu needs the same as has multiple personalities at the moment.  Being a mini version of Cheesecake Factory should not be a goal.",1,1,3
7,John B.,"New York, NY",774,374,653,3.0,4/19/2018,"Came here for drinks only so haven't a clue what the food is like. I was exited to taste the jalapeño infused tequila but sadly the la Dona tasted more like weak watermelon whilst  the gimlet tastes of just lime juice. If the tequila has been infused then pour more of it for 16 bucks a pop. That being said i like the bar and the ambience , it feels like a good scene and the bartenders are very friendly. Make sure you check out the toilets  ,  it looks like a retirement home in Florida. ! Love it or hate it it's a talking point.",,,
8,Leslie H.,"New Rochelle, NY",156,90,69,4.0,7/14/2018,"Great food, good service - overall a really great night.The space is quite small, and was fairly loud as we were led to our table to the back left that was completely sheltered from the noise. A perfect table for the 6 of us.We started with a bunch of appetizers to share - charred broccoli, scallops, rock shrimp fish cake, blistered tomatoes with ricotta, and tuna tartare. All were delicious. The broccoli was underwhelming, but the rest were fantastic.Our first round of drinks were all well received including the prosecco on tap! Later on in the evening I tried the rosè on tap, which I didn't care for, but the waiter swapped it out for another prosecco which I appreciated. For mains, 2 had the skirt steak and both loved it. 2 shared the pork chop and fried chicken (special for the night) and both were enjoyed. Lastly, the trout and roast chicken were both fantastic as well.Overall a really nice and delicious night. Thought the bathroom was kitschy - especially since they made a hashtag specifically for it, but it was definitely something to talk about.",1,,1
9,Jasmin O.,"Jamaica, NY",13,151,450,5.0,7/29/2018,I absolutely love this place. It is very quaint and the service is excellent. The drinks are to die for and the food was on point. If you are in this location and would like something different from cafeteria I would definitely suggest this place. The ambience was wonderful!  A+ plus service with a A+ smile. I will be returning here again very soon.,,,
10,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,186,541,4.0,1/4/2018,"A nice option in the neighborhood.  I came here with a group of 5 for dinner in the middle of the week and was able to grab a last minute same day reservation, which was great.The space is pretty small, but in the summertime they do have outdoor seating.  The service was good and the food was generally on point. I am disappointed by their wine by the glass selection.  We all tried different types of red wines by the glass, and honestly none of them were very good.We shared an order of deviled eggs for the table.  I thought these were awesome.  The pimento cheese and pickled peppers on top were delicious and the hint of spice was perfect. I ordered the salmon for my entree.  I thought it was cooked very well.  The skin looked crispy but didn't have that nice crunch that I was hoping for.  The bok choy was cooked well and the sauce that was on the fish was tasty. For dessert we shared a couple things for the table - one was banana flavored and the other was a pecan pie.  Both were quite good, but I preferred the banana.This is a nice spot for a casual meal, and I'm sure I'll be back.",1,1,1
11,Jaana S.,"Glen Head, NY",298,166,165,4.0,6/6/2018,"After seeing an instagram of Motel Morris's bathroom, I knew I had to come here. I know that's a weird reason to decide to go to a restaurant but I'm glad it happened because Motel Morris was a delight. It's poppin, super lively, upbeat, and crowded, without feeling congested or too loud. Most of the people in there were young and on dates, but there were some older folks as well. Everyone was honestly very friendly, patrons included. It was just that kinda atmosphere. This is a really good spot for a date, or to catch up with a long lost pal.The menu was all over the place. There were southern comfort foods like buttermilk fried pork chops, but there were also international dishes like soba noodles. I don't know what was going on but it made it very confusing. I ordered a spring fever cocktail (yum) and took the advice of my waitress and got the daily special: fried chicken with a side of watermelon and feta salad. I would never order this on my own but I went for it and it was tasty. I really loved the chicken as it wasn't too greasy or heavy. I felt like I was still at a nice restaurant instead of at a KFC which is good because my drink and entree brought my grand total up to about $50. I wasn't too pleased to be spending that much on dinner but hey that's new york city for ya.Don't forget to go to the bathroom. It's chic but understated.",,,2
12,Bria D.,"New York, NY",2,62,41,1.0,4/1/2018,"The drinks here are fabulous! I ordered the Wildflower because I'm a gin fanatic, and it was refreshing with all the yummy citrus with some potent flowery taste. We also had a smores sundae, which was quite tasty with charred marshmallow topping some chocolate ice cream. So why did I give this place 1 star? Because I had one of the worst, ill-thought dinners of my entire life and the worst dish I've had anywhere in the world in my adult years. As my friend said, eating at a place with ""Motel"" in the name was a red flag! The first time I came here, I had the Brook Trout and it tasted like tap water and nothing else. This time, I made the mistake of giving them another try by ordering buttermilk chicken with potato salad and a boiled egg. We ordered on a whim, never having eaten here before and came to regret it 6 minutes after we ordered and the hostess set our plate down in front of us. What in the watered-down Southern dish was that? The chicken was not the buttermilk fried idea I had in my head. It was beyond dry to a crisp and completely unseasoned, despite having a dark brown batter. In fact, that dark brown batter did nothing to add flavor; it just tasted burnt. The potato salad was not tasty at all and was so salty that it was mostly inedible. In fact, we confused the wait staff when we asked for our checks not even a quarter of the way through the meal and the sweet man who took our plates asked each of my friends and I if we wanted to take anything to go. The answer was an adamant ""no"" but I was very grateful that I wouldn't have to look at it anymore. Several times throughout the meal, I nearly choked on the dry meat. It wouldn't be worth it to die at home over dry reheated food. This is barely an attempt at southern cuisine. However, if you come here for drinks, you will not be disappointed.I noticed in the reviews (which I wish I read before) that the owner, Sam, refuses to acknowledge that the food here is sub-par. There are so many complaints about the food lacking flavor or that a dish was dry and the responses are also lacking flavor, much less a care in he world about the aforementioned. Because of that, I'll likely never return here, nor would I recommend support to a business that routinely fails to meet it's customer's needs. The waitress was kind to offer us the sundae on the house, so I hope I was able to show my appreciation in my tip because I certainly cannot give higher stars due the inedible meal my friends and I were served. We left hungry and dissatisfied.",2,1,

15,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,8/28/2017,"Motel Morris has a complicated relationship with Americana. We've got low-key offerings like eggs and burgers, as well as the requisite Pepto-Bismol pink bathroom (with its own Instagram hashtag, no less). However, the space looks more Scandinavian chic, with lots of wood, understated colors, and mid-century modern vibes.I made a noon reservation on Resy a couple of days before, but when we showed up that wasn't necessary. Reasonably full but had our choice of seats indoor and out. Sunny space playing the indie rock hits of 2012; starting off the day with some Vampire Weekend ain't bad.We started with iced coffee and ginger tea, which were served quickly. I went for the huevos rancheros, while my friend had the ricotta fritters. It came out maybe 15 or 20 minutes later.I've had better huevos rancheros. The beans were a bit soupy, but you can't really mess up eggs and cheese, so I was happy. The ricotta fritters were halfway to beignets, and the rhubarb compote was on point, but there really needed to be more of it to offset the dryness.This is a supremely useful spot in the aesthetic desert of Chelsea-- would work well for a friend catchup, date, or parent dinner. Prices are typical for New York (no, I don't want to add avocado for $4), but you can get out of here for under $20 if necessary. Service is very well trained and polite. We were in and out in under 45 minutes, and they were happy to let us linger after we paid our check.Even though I wasn't wowed by the food, my overall experience here was so pleasant that I would return.",2,1,
16,Liz L.,"New York, NY",0,37,15,5.0,6/17/2018,"Beautiful, chic, retro interior with a perfect noise level and soundtrack. Tuna tartare is delicious and perfectly seasoned. The burger is to die for. Service is always charming and available but not overbearing. Wine list is great and the cocktails are divine. They have a tv in case you are with sports fans, but on closed caption - so (today) you can both watch the World Cup and have a conversation.

19,Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",197,206,3152,4.0,8/20/2017,"Honestly the best restaurant within a several block radius.  Despite having a high density of restos, this area at the same time has a shortage of high quality food.  So what you really pay for tends to be a nice outdoor space to sit, with some mediocre food to go along (*cough* Cafeteria).  Motel Morris is finally changing that.We had, on waiter's recommendation:- Pierogies with lobster and shiitake - really good, came in a glorious plate of liquid butter.- skirt steak - tried a piece from my friend's plate, pretty good.- salmon in a ponzu reduction with bok choy.  The fish was grilled to perfection - crispy skin and the oily belly area.  Sauce and veggies all went perfectly.  Really good balance of various elements in texture, flavor, and presentation.- cheesecake - was also very good.  Perfect degree of crumbly-flakiness.- drinks were not bad - did sound more interesting than they tasted - for instance my passionfruit green tea + vodka drink didn't taste enough like passionfruit or green tea.  But that might just be me being picky..  Other reviewers said chef is from Red Cat.  This place feels more casual/trendy but food is just as good.  Fun decor.  Outstanding service all around, from waiters as well as other staff.  Surprised there wasn't more of a wait for tables.Review as of August 2017.",1,,
20,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,3.0,1/18/2018,"Those who live in this neighborhood know that there are surprisingly few ""interesting restaurants with ambiance"" in this area of Chelsea. You have cafes and casual American restaurants and some Thai places, but nothing inventive. So I was definitely excited when I saw Motel Morris open. My overall feeling of Motel Morris is come for the ambiance + vibe, but don't come for the food. The food is only okay and more overpriced than other spots in the area (with the exception of Fred's) and generally okay but slightly underwhelming. The dishes I've had here for brunch and dinner were lacking in flavor and intrigue - there was nothing that made me want to come back and order them again. But the restaurant itself is undoubtedly adorable. The interior decor is great, there's a super cute bar area, and it's definitely hoppin' at night. It's definitely a great spot for friends or a date. But you're paying for the ambiance, not the food.",,,

They asked if we wanted to pack up our leftovers since our whole table of 4 left everything half eaten, and we said, ""No thanks, it wasn't very good."" All they said was, ""OK."").  The PB&J&H French Toast was very dry.  One of the worst french toasts dishes I've ever had (and I order french toast everywhere in the city).  It was basically just toast slathered with peanut butter with honey drizzled on top.  Two of us got the shakshouka eggs and found it to be overcooked.  Another friend got the Huevos Rancheros, which although looked pretty, was actually very bland.We left our comments for management, but never heard back.  I do not recommend this place.Update in reply to the comment below: How very odd that none of the 4 dishes were ""executed properly"".  That's like 1/3 of the brunch menu.  So either the cook was out that day or it's always served like this.  I highly encourage chefs to taste their food before it's sent out.",2,1,1

Instead, you may have dinner at this buzzy restaurant with a yacht club-like feel. We sat at the bar and had food and beverage. The ""No-Tell"" is a sophisticated mezcal passion fruit drink that looks like orange juice and tastes like a good drink. It comes in a small glass with a large ice cube. The salmon is also very good. If you, like me, enjoy bok choy, sugar snap peas, baby vegetables and ponzu vinaigrette, then this is the fish for you. You can kill four birds with one dish, as the salmon is prepared with all of those items. It was a large portion, but I brought my appetite ha ha.

Updated review","Ok so after 2nd visit I'm upgrading to 4 stars from 3. The food was as tasty as before. The service was very good. No crying kids at dinner on a Tuesday night. Drinks were on point, though martini glasses are still tiny.  And the service still a bit rushed. But...We live a block away. And...We'll be back. This rating was difficult. Would say 3.5 stars. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and intimate. The food was tasty. The drinks were served in small glasses. My martini glass couldn't have been more than 3 ounces. The service was the most challenging. On the one hand the waiter was very friendly and professional. On the other hand, it definitely seemed rushed with the buzzing of servers waiting for you to take the last bite to clear the plate and move the meal along. Also, definitely a child friendly restaurant. If that is what you are looking for. It wasn't for us.  Its difficult to enjoy a night out when there is a 3 month old infant at one table and two preteens at another.   Maybe make one side of this tiny restaurant the kid friendly side?",2,,

I had their drink of the day and the vegetarian eggs bene. One of my friends wanted salad, so she attempted to order two items, and luckily the waiter told her that the eggs she wanted came with salad. They should state this on the menu!

31,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,1/17/2018,"I had been meaning to try Motel Morris for quite some time, but had either wound up going elsewhere or not being able to get a table at the desired time.  However, I was finally able to make it happen and was glad that I did.  When making the reservation on Resy, I noticed that I had my choice of either bar or dining room seating for most timeslots, but only bar stools were available for my desired reservation.  Typically, I prefer sitting at a formal table, as it tends to be more engaging, but at this point, I would take whatever I could get.  I arrived at the restaurant to find my friend already seated comfortably at the bar.  In fact, the U-shaped bar had a large number of stools that were all well-spaced and comfortable, so reserving one of the few, smaller tables was really unnecessary.  Also, our server was extremely efficient and checked in on us frequently, despite where we were located.  The kitchen was also timely with its food delivery.I started my adventure with one of their signature cocktails.  The No-Tell was a smoky and sour combination of Del Maguey Vida mezcal, passion fruit, green tea, and lemon.  It was served in a small cocktail glass with one giant ice cube in the center.  While I liked the flavor profile the drink was aiming for, I found there to a slight medicinal after-taste that was off-putting.  My friend was not thrilled with her Ruby Slipper either, so we switched to glasses of the 2015 Pinon Vouvray from the Loire Valley in France.  We both adored the crisp, bright white wine, which had a fantastic smoothness and balanced acidity.  In fact, we even shared a second glass!When it came to the food, my friend was just getting over the flu and was out for the first time, so she wanted to enjoy an elaborate meal, ha!  For that reason, we wound up ordering a decent amount of food, starting with the Crispy Fried Oysters.  I typically do not like fried foods OR oysters, but I indulged her in this selection, given her post-sickness fervor.  This appetizer was actually spectacular!  The three large fried oysters had a delicious and crisp batter.  They were served over a generous mound of celeriac slaw and covered with a creamy horseradish bacon butter.  Essentially, the celery had been coated in this spicy dressing that was packed with homemade bacon bits.  It was decadent and heavenly - definitely worth the calories.  We also shared the Wild Mushroom and Fontina Gratin, which was my favorite part of the meal.  A lengthy, thick slice of country white bread had been grilled so that it had a crispy crust, but the center became perfectly soft underneath the substantial bundle of woodsy mushrooms and gooey cheese.  My mouth is watering at the memory!   In addition to the shared plates, we each selected our own entrée.  I went for the Grilled Brook Trout, which was a wide, thin filet that was served skin-side down and topped with shaved brussel sprouts, pepitas, and smoked paprika.  A seasonal brown butter pumpkin purée had been spooned onto the plate as an optional spread.  My fish was moist and flaky with a delicate skin.  The crunchy slaw on the top was delicious as well.  However, while I enjoyed the sweet puree on its own, I did not think the whipped pumpkin did much to enhance the dish.  In fact, my friend had found her Seared Tuna Au Poivre entrée with its parsnip purée, lobster vinaigrette, and shaved fennel salad to be somewhat convoluted, and I felt similar about the overwhelming and feuding flavors of my dish.While there were some minor improvements that could have been made, we were mainly thrilled with our meal, as well as the fantastic service and creative menu options.  Plus, Motel Morris had a casual, yet trendy and refined vibe, making it perfect for our girl friend gossip session.",2,,4

34,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,6/6/2017,"One visit in, I'm a fan. The wife and I popped in for brunch after a mega animal adoption event at the Metropolitan Pavilion. I dug the vibe here, with the French chanson/jazz soundtrack, pretty and clean upmarket diner decor, and overall unpretentious feel. And on Saturday at noon, there was no wait for 2 people.The brunch menu looks great, with all your favorites (and mine), such as the mouthwatering shrimp and grits. It's definitely on the watery side as one reviewer notes, but I was into it. Prices are reasonable for 2017, and the portions are decent. Cocktails are uppity and pricey, but probably worth a shot. Also, our food was hot (seems like that might be an issue for others?). My wife ordered the veggie benedict, which, kale aside, was pretty dang tasty.Booze with brunch will set you off three dollar signs.",5,1,2

A bit pricy but yeah rents here are ridiculous for businesses, especially restaurants. But I ordered a couple glasses of Cabernet Franc and their Sunday Special Chili Mac and Cheese: worth the $19 they charging for it. So I'll bitch about the price but don't take it personal , that's just me Motel Morris. Beautiful people in a chill mood. I like that.",,,

The food smelled amazing... and that's what initially attracted me to eat here. We ordered the 1 appetizer of pirogies, 1 side of malt vinegar fries & the roasted chicken entree. They do daily specials as well & on Wednesdays it's baby back ribsThe pirogies... omg yum! They come served with 3 because it's an appetizer but the server asked if we wanted an extra so we could each have 2. It comes in a lobster sauce that is so flavorful & rich but not heavy! The malt vinegar fries, talk about addicting. My friend & I couldn't stop munching on these fries! The fries themselves are very thin, not like thick cut - but still really good! The roasted chicken entree, I want to say the crispy skin on this chicken... you could hear the crunch when you cut down on the chicken, I was shocked roasted chicken had a crispy element. The service was quick & the hostess was friendly. It gets very crowded here especially on a nice day.Lastly, the bathroom is so cute! It's very retro and has a pink theme with a mirror that has a cute # at the bottom. I'd come back here!",,,

It was the Saturday night before Easter, but we were able to snag a reservation for 3 on Open Table that morning.Once we arrived, we were seated right away at a 3-person corner booth.To start, we got an order of the pierogies. Were they up to Veselka standards? Not quite, but they were still good--and the chunks of lobster that it came with were tasty.For my main course, I decided to go with the crusted tuna. This dish had good flavor, but was definitely a bit on the smaller size despite the higher price point. Both of my friends opted for the trout and it was much larger in comparison, so something to note if you're wanting something a little more substantial.For drinks, I stuck with the Kitty Oshea's which was pretty good as it had a nice touch of sweetness to it.Overall, this place seems to already be firing on all cylinders. All of the food was great, and the atmosphere was very lively. It did sort of empty out after 9 or so, but I imagine it will be a popular spot to grab a bite this summer.",3,1,1

Maybe, house made as this is American comfort. It's hard not to compare the food to Cafeteria. I would say overall, there is more value at Cafeteria from the biscuits to the size of the food on the plate.

Quiet night- bartender ignored us while he left the bar to chat, laugh and goof off with a bunch of girls. They were rowdy to boot. Took a while to get two drinks. Mine was served with a mint leaf that was half black and holes in it. I've never seen that in my life. He never checked on us in over 35 min. Couldn't get his attention and the girl working walked by us a few times. My attempts to get her were useless. Finally a bus boy just took our empty glasses. Couldn't get him to get us another drink and I was going to just leave since we couldn't get him to give us the check. Finally my boss stormed out and was fuming. When asked for the manager the bartender said he was for the night. HOW DOES SOMEONE ENTRUST THEIR BUSINESS TO SOMEONE LUKE THAT??? He apologized profusely but that didn't change a thing. I'll never go back. It was the last of the neighborhood places I didn't go to because I never heard great things- never awful- it's just a default spot. Sadly it was major miss.",,,
44,Susanna G.,"New York, NY",0,54,0,3.0,9/5/2018,"The decor is really nice, the staff was sometimes cold but always attentive, and the food was pretty tasty - so my three star review comes mainly from the price. I'm not one to avoid pricey meals, but the cost of this one is just not really worth it. The food is pretty good, nothing remarkable, and it's a simple with smaller portion sizes and all SO expensive. For example, I got the sweet potato appetizer - it was literally two slices of sweet potato (maybe 1/4 of a potato) with some olive oil, plain Greek yogurt, and salt - and it was $10. That's just too much. I'll only keep going to this place when I can expense it - it's good for a business meal because there are varied dietary preference options and it's spacious and quiet.",,,

48,Laura D.,"New York, NY",44,4,0,5.0,1/5/2018,"Came here today with a group of coworkers for a belated holiday lunch and we all had such a wonderful experience. We tried a variety of appetizers (tomato soup/grilled cheese, fries, deviled eggs, and a mushroom toast item). It was a good thing that we got 2 baskets of fries for the table because they were gone nearly as quickly as they were set down, with everyone remarking on the tasty seasoning. I was surprised to learn that several of my coworkers had never tasted deviled eggs before (what?!), but this was definitely the place for them to try them for the first time.For entrees, almost everyone got something different, so we could all see that everything looked delicious. When the person next to me got his chicken sandwich he gasped aloud and said to himself, ""That's like a whole chicken!"" I opted for the hacienda salad just because something fresh and healthy sounded good and the bowl was practically brimming over with tomatoes and black beans and avocado. Instead of just being a boring 90% lettuce, this salad had the good stuff in every bite. My boss got the huevos rancheros and I was more than a little jealous of how that looked--guess I'll have to be back for brunch someday!When the desserts arrived, the minty ice cream and the gooey pecan pie were lovely, but nothing really mattered beyond the butterscotch banana pudding pie. You could see everyone eyeing each other thinking that the shared bites better not go too quickly! I would gladly go back just to have a slice all to myself, which actually, might not be a bad idea...",,,

We ordered a few apps to share--the sweet potato was a standout and while the salad was good, there was a slight bitter taste to the dressing. For my entree, I ordered the fish and chips which was very good and my friend ordered the salmon which was great. The ambiance inside is very cute, and definitely has  a classic spin on the old school motel setting, but in a fresh new way. Would definitely recommend coming here if in the area!",,,

He stinks. No stars for Gene.Gene will never know the Spicy Tuna Crudo. That's his loss. It was delicious. And better yet, someone else paid for it.Gene will never enjoy the Sweet Chili Charred Octopus which I was supposed to share but deliberately kept in close proximity so that I could have more than everyone else.Gene will never know my wife, who is amazing and who had the Massaman Curry Mussels, which she raved about. She lived in France for seven years so she knows good mussels. She also knows how to say ""You will die unloved, Gene"" in perfect French with a Parisian accent.My ten-year old took his fiancé here on a date. He thinks they'll get married someday. I hope they do, because she's very smart and she's not a vegan. They both had the Kale Spaghetti. My son finished it. The girl ate as much as she could, but in fairness she weighs three ounces.I had the Sautéed Skate Wing on one of my visits. It was great. Do you know why I've been here several times? Because it's not a dank, vegan miseryplex filled with pouty-faced, one-star-giving, unappeasable jobbernowls.Now, let us discuss the Hand Cut Steak Tartare. Bane of vegans everywhere, and rightly so. I've had a lot of tartare and there's good tartare and there's bad tartare - just like there are good Genes and bad Genes. This is excellent steak tartare. Sriracha potato chips, nice touch.The next time I go, the Chicken Fried Buttermilk Pork Chop is on my list. Not on my list? Gene.By the way, I was a miserable vegan myself for seven long years.

The pasta was overcooked and had no taste.  The waiter provided lovely, friendly service and the ambiance and decor is chic.

60,Timothy C.,"Manhattan, NY",15,44,0,3.0,4/26/2017,"Really wanted to like this place, but there are definitely better places (food-wise) in the area to spend your money. The pierogies started off very nice, but one becomes quickly thrown off by the fact that there is also a piece of lobster on it. It's quite unclear how the lobster pairs with the pierogies, besides helping to increase the cost of the dish. On the other hand, the steak tartare is overpowered by the mustard. The same faults I found in the pierogies were magnified in the octopus. The octopus by itself was nicely tender and charred, but the inclusion of the chili sauce and bean puree caused quite a clash of flavors. The pork chop was also cooked perfectly. It would've been perfectly fine by itself, but was deluged under various garnishes. The base dish is fine, but they try to overcomplicate the food which leads to a poor experience. Octopus does not need to be accompanied by chinese sausage. Drinks are good, and decor is on point. I hope that they will adjust the menu and make the dishes more simple, but the place is packed, so what do I know.",4,,

We got these amazing mussels that we couldn't stop eating, we basically licked the bowl clean as the broth was so delicious. We were all in the mood for burgers and ordered off the bar menu instead of the menu that was on the table.  Their burgers were the best we all had,  perfectly cooked and juicy and the toppings were so tasty also.

Awesome design and character to the finishings and atmosphere they are going for here. Food was impeccable! We were a group of six and ordered just about every starter and mid-course meal on the menu. Tasteful selection and presentation of menu items.     Oversized onion rings & parodies are a must order! I thought the skirt steak entree was delicious until I took a bite of the breaded pork chop. The chefs know what they're doing back there. Beer selection was great with options for everyone.

Loved the decor, very retro feeling and all around good vibes. As another reviewer mentioned - the tables were all empty but the hostess was only seating people at the bar. It started to feel pretty crowded as people were standing directly behind us ordering drinks while we were trying to enjoy our dinner. I get there were probably reservations but holding a table for over an hour while the bar is overly crowded isn't the best experience for guests. Our server was great. He was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The food itself was solid, nothing mind blowing but good enough to come back.

So many wonderful little touches like family pictures on the wall, accent lights and of course the ""grandma"" pink bathroom. If I wasn't already in love I asked my server where the name came from. You should ask when you pop in. It makes you love it even more.Ended up reserving a table at 7:45 on a Tuesday for 5 people. The place was packed. The food was highly recommended and it didn't disappoint.  Started off with a bottle of wine for the table and the octopus, tuna, and mussels to start. I ended up having the trout which was to die for. While the rest of the table all tried something different. Everyone loved their dish and we all couldn't help sneaking bites from each others plates.

We were accommodated at last minute with a cozy, but spacious booth for our party of five (only one orphan, though - I'm dating myself with this reference). Anyway...the drinks were tasty, the food delicious, the service was attentive but not cloying, and the atmosphere relaxing and stylish. We had a number of appetizers and then shared a few plates of the Saturday night fried chicken special (served with a tasty kale salad), with some sides (get the fries), and chased it with two desserts - the banana butterscotch pie (YUM) and Arlene's Special (pecan pie a la mode) - also YUM. After a couple of our party left to hit a Broadway show, the rest of us moved to the bar to free up the table (our idea - no urging from the restaurant), and we were readily accommodated.

Our waiter was an Australian gentlemen that was SO friendly and always making sure we had everything we needed. I started with the sparking Rosè on tap - very unique and it was so so good! Not too sweet, not too dry. The highlight of our meal was the ""everything bagel"" crusted tuna - it was the best tuna I've ever had. Salty, so soft and fresh, with a perfect side of rice and grilled avocado. We also had the Curry mussels which were cooked perfectly and packed with flavor. For desert, we had the butterscotch banana pudding pie - this was to die for. We ate the whole thing and left happy and content. Will definitely be coming back soon.Go to Motel Morris for great food, great vibes, and great service!!!",,,

Super cozy dining room.Really local feel with everyone chatting to their neighbours at the bar.Bar staff are knowledgable and pleasant. Hostesses, servers and bussing staff also.Love the decor, it truly feels like a labour of love.I've eaten quite a bit of the menu and everything was delicious but I've a soft spot for the mussels, burger and onion rings. Good god those onion rings.Excellent wine and cocktail list.Can't wait until they start serving brunch.I really can't fault the place except I'm looking at a solid 7lbs gain by July at this rate!",,1,

Each dish was clever and delicious but must have been not easy to create. Hats off to the chefs. We had a tuna tartare for an appetizer and the trout for dinner. Well done. Perfect for a work event, a date or meeting with friends.",,,

Updated review","I really wish the food would be as stellar as the aesthetics. Stopped by for lunch and got the shrimp and grits and the grits were (1) Luke warm and (2) soupy, and not the chowder kind. I'm from the south and shrimp and grits is a staple in my diet. Never have I had it with such fluid consistency. The flavors of the shrimp and sausage were 'meh' at best. 4 stars for beautiful space2 stars for foodVery unlikely that I'll be returning.",,,
81,Lindsay C.,"San Diego, CA",2,6,1,2.0,9/1/2017,"I ate lunch at the Motel Morris today and need to say it was less than I expected. Fortunately we had a young and profession server that tried to make things right and we appreciate her energy and enthusiasm. The hacienda salad was soaked in dressing complete with hard avocados, brown iceberg lettuce and parmesan cheese instead of cojita cheese. My friends spice tuna crudo came out like coleslaw with some chunks or tuna. I feel Motel Morris for the prices they charge should take a look at the quality of food coming out of the kitchen.",2,1,
82,Sherry M.,"London, United Kingdom",0,11,0,5.0,1/16/2018,"I pass by this restaurant every day on my walk to work, so when we were in the neighbourhood looking for dinner the other night, I thought it was a good time to check it out. I was a bit concerned, reading reviews, that we'd have a tough time getting a table without a reservation, but they were able to seat us right away. We had a show to catch, so we dove right into the mains. I had the pork chop and my friend had the brook trout. We were both DE-LIGHTED with our selections. The portions were excellent, there was not need to grab a burger after dinner if you know what I mean. Not only was the pork chop deliciously cooked, but the added sweetness from the dates was just stunning. Our waiter was attentive and helpful with our selections. I'm so glad my daily commute walks me by here. I will remember Motel Morris and will definitely come back.",,,
83,Nicole J.,"Denver, CO",88,19,4,4.0,5/12/2017,"These days in NYC it's impossible to get seated when your whole party is not with you yet. but Motel Morris was totally fine with it, so that automatically makes me like them! Prices are reasonable, drink menu looked good (I had a beer so can't comment on the cocktails but they looked intriguing) and service was friendly and not too pushy. I had the grilled haloumi salad, which was delicious, a little spicy, but a great starter. For my entree, I wasn't too hungry so I had the Tuna Crudo which was refreshing, really enjoyed the papaya and black sesame.Overall a great experience and would love to come back when I'm a little hungrier! A+ on the decor.",,,
84,Crystal D.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,2.0,7/31/2017,"I was really excited to try Motel Morris after hearing of it's opening. Great vibe, great location with a known chef. Sadly, my experience was anything but exciting.Yes the location, decor and staff were all notable...but the most important thing a restaurant should stand out for fell extremely flat...the food. We ordered the BLTA salad, the tuna crudo, and the pappardelle pasta. The crudo is more like a papaya salad and was lacking in flavor, and the pasta had to be sent back because of its overwhelming lemon cream sauce, which swallowed it whole. The staff was very accommodating and super nice, but the food left much to be desired.",2,,
85,S P.,"New York, NY",0,67,0,4.0,10/2/2017,"This place was a mob scene full of dreadful infants when it first opened, but it is settling in. I live around the corner and can sometimes actually get a seat at the bar at 8 pm now to have dinner if I am so inclined. The tuna crudo served as if it were a Friendly's sundae is a delight. Rest of menu with nightly specials is just fine. Glad to be finally glad it's here.",,,

87,Roman Z.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",2,5,0,5.0,11/26/2017,"Although Motel Morris hasn't been open for very long, I recently went for my third time - on Thanksgiving. It was my first time going out for Thanksgiving dinner, and in typical Motel Morris fashion, I was extremely pleased.Making reservations was super easy - Motel Morris uses Resy, which simplifies the reservation process and allows the restaurant to keep in touch with me day of in case I'm running late. I was in fact running a few minutes late that day, so I texted them. They got back right away and confirmed, letting me know it's A-OK.As usual, the staff was incredibly nice and welcoming. We were seated and got menus right away. The staff was also really patient with my million questions about the various dishes that day. We settled for a grilled lamb appetizer (not particularly Thanksgiving-y, but it's hard to pass up lamb here) and all had the turkey dinners with an extra side of turkey sausage stuffing. Everything was delicious - it tasted homemade, which to me is one of the highest compliments are restaurant can get. What tied the experience together is the fact that we were never made to feel as if we had overstayed - I always appreciate this in NYC restaurants, especially on Thanksgiving. Motel Morris makes dinner more of an experience rather than a transaction - kudos!FWIW, the other times I've been there have been spectacular. My favorite - the pierogis with octopus. I must have ordered three or four of them.",,,
88,Kimberly Y.,"Manhattan, NY",192,25,1,5.0,10/10/2017,"We've lived in Chelsea for over 6 years. Restaurants come and go very quickly on these blocks, so I was ecstatic to learn when Motel Morris opened up. We've been on the hunt for our go-to and we've found it with this puppy. Distinct charm and details from the moment you walk in and amazing service. We always go on Monday for the lobster pot pie. The crust is buttery, inside is creamy but not overbearing and the lobster is cooked perfectly. Did I mention they have two types of prosecco on tap? And lightly dusted malted fries? Highly recommend cruising by! They are pretty packed everyday, so I recommend coming in a small group of four or less unless you've managed to get a reservation for a large group. We've only had reservations once and have been walk ins other times, but they've always been accommodating and very nice.",,,
89,John R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",109,24,5,5.0,11/18/2017,"If you a place to bring a date or a friend Motel Morris is a cool place for dinner or just to grab a drink. I brought my mother here to grab dinner and I was not disappointed with the quality of food nor the ambiance, its a motel themed place, but the decor is not too ostentatious. We all had incredible dishes starting with the tartare and sweet potatoes (highly recommended) and then entrees. None of us were disappointed with what we got. The cocktails that they had were also delicious. I will definitely be back!",,,

Pricey, so couldn't make it a habit, but great for a treat.",,,
93,Anne U.,"New York, NY",3,3,0,5.0,7/12/2017,"I work a block away and am a big fan of The Commons so I was excited when Motel Morris opened in the neighborhood. The vibe is perfect and the food is solid but the real selling point is the bar. It's sleek and cool and ideal for those weeknights when you just need a cocktail or a glass of wine or some really good lighting. Plus the bartender there is great. Matt is really friendly and attentive, and he makes an old fashioned that is just right. I've brought a ton of people here from coworkers to my family, and everyone loves it. This strip of Chelsea is a culinary dead zone and there's nothing in a 10-block radius that comes even close to here. So happy to finally have a go-to spot in the area. Feel free to stay forever, Motel Morris.",1,,1
94,Gabriella K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,199,0,2.0,4/14/2018,"Cute looking place with capable staff, but the food is just underwhelming.  My steak arrived practically raw, sitting over a bed of soggy fried potatoes and watercress, all drenched with a slimy pepper-garlic aioli.  Pretty much inedible.",,,

96,scott c.,"New York, NY",62,80,0,3.0,8/8/2017,"Beautiful looking bar for the area but my food pretty was rough around the edges. Kale salad feels merely obligatory (tip to chef: try massaging the kale in lemon juice to soften it up, if you feel you have to have it on the menu). Fish entree was inexplicably topped with shaved parmesan (yes, fish and cheese), which worked out about as well as it sounds. Decided not to take my chances on dessert, and my waiter quickly snatched my wine glass away with a good gulp left in it. When he returned I complained, and he just kind of shrugged like what do you want me to do, comp it? Nope it's cool. I'll just take it out of yer tip, thanks.",,,
97,Tom M.,"San Francisco, CA",47,2,0,2.0,5/15/2017,"After reading some good reviews and seeing smiling faces through the window, I took my wife here for Mother's Day. I must say the Vodka Giblet at the bar, served by the pleasant bartender, was very good; and the accommodating staff was helpful in finding us a table.  We ordered the salad recommended by the waiter and it was superb.  But the raw hamburger with mystery items disguised as Beef Steak Tartar was tasteless, and the Brook Trout was tediously bland.  Took most of the trout home and gave it my cat.  Even he looked up from his bowl before slowly eating it.  All and all, the restaurant was not worth the $123 tab for two.",3,1,
98,Cinesina C.,"New York, NY",52,80,36,3.0,7/22/2017,"Really nice restaurant, nice decor and now they also have outdoor seating. It was very lively when I came for dinner on a Friday night but unfortunately the layout and sound system don't allow for good conversation at your table. Guests are literally steaming at each other because the overall place is so loud!   Shared a few apps (do NOT order that spicy tuna dish, not sure who prepared it but must have been someone in love, completely wrongly seasoned!!) the skirt steak, the chicken and the fries. It was good but not great. Most sauces were overpowering the dish and created some unbalance. I didn't eat dessert (and I normally always do!) because the dinner was too rich for a Summer night.Be sure to check out the bathroom behind the tile wall. As I said decor and concept are very well thought through!",,,
99,Joseph S.,"New York, NY",0,39,9,5.0,6/9/2017,I had the fried chicken sandwich and the sweet potato - both were delicious....but save room for Mom's Cheesecake - it's one  of the best in the city.,1,,1

We met the owners before they opened, and we were happy to see something new come into our neighborhood. Unfortunately, the restaurant needs to work out the kinks before we will go back. First, the prices are high for the product that you receive. I had the seared tuna entree for 27$. A small piece of tuna by any means. And a quarter cup of rice. My husband had a burger, which was priced at 19$. And that didn't include fries which were an additional 6$. We ordered the appetizer of deviled eggs...and never got them. The server said ""I forgot to put them in"". No apology. The drinks are 15$ each. And no bread before the meal is their mode of service. We did receive bread tho after asking for it. I hope that they listen to these reviews and try to amend the prices accordingly.",2,,
104,Jesse N.,"New York, NY",1,16,3,2.0,8/11/2017,"Visually pleasing tasty food but the portions are tiny! Also $15 cocktails that were very small, had one massive ice cube, and virtually no alcohol were very disappointing.

He really made the experience great for us. Matt was always really attentive, entertaining and made some delicious cocktails. Always made me want to go back.

Lobster pierogis?! WHY NOT! Also must try the octopus and the tuna crudo. See where I'm going with this? It's all money. Came back for dinner later in the week...Skirt steak, awesome.

113,B P.,"Greenwich, CT",56,17,0,1.0,6/23/2017,"Was very excited to try Motel Morris but ended up sadly being very disappointed.  Interior is nice...but food lacks all flavor and was ill prepared. Sweet potato - it was a slice of blandly roast sweet potato on top of a glob of plain yoghurt. No taste. Labne and crudite toast - soggy bread, more plain yoghurt with some bizarre noodles type vegetable strips on top. No flavor and the the ratio of zoodles to soggy bread was about 6 to 1. Onion rings - they screwed up the coating so they brought them to the table anyway and apologetically said that they were on the house. It was like my nine year old made them. inedible and why wowuldnt you just remake them or say they ran out. Why bring out some greasy onions covered about 30% with coating and no test or seasoning. Came with aioli that also had no flavor or taste. Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich - must be the same nine year old working the fryer. Chicken was super greasy, no crunch. Not salted. Zero flavor. Remoulade had no taste as well. Very disappointed as the menu and the space both looked so promising. Go to red cat.",,,
114,Dana S.,"New York, NY",0,37,1,4.0,10/4/2017,Unbelievably creative menu!  So glad the fried oysters made it on the menu permanently - its for sure my favorite.  The Wednesday ribs are about as good as any BBQ places in NYC and their wine collection is diverse in style and price.  The only dish I did not LOVE is the tuna - the spice overpowers the tuna to the point of not being able to taste anything else.  I have to try the lobster pot pie the next time I go on a Monday - the gentleman next to us had it and it looked so flakey buttery and decadent.,,,

Today, we finally got a table outside. Now, when it comes to sidewalk seating, restaurants typically fall short of good service. (At least that's what I find here in the city) NOT this place. From the moment we sat down, there was water and a waitress asking to take our drink order. Shortly thereafter, she was back asking if we had any questions in regards to their menu. We ordered the Massaman Curry Mussels as an appetizer. Omg.. soooo good!!! Our dinner was a roasted chicken and Saturdays fried chicken special. Everything was cooked so well and tasty. LOVED the fried chicken and it's accompanying dipping sweet & spicy sauce. I will certainly go back as it was worth the wait:) Speaking of wait, The Wait staff alone was pretty damn awesome",,,
118,ALEXIS W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,1.0,1/3/2018,"Unfortunately, despite the nice time we had on NYE at Motel Morris, my friend and I both got Food Poisoning from our dinner.  About two hours after eating we were both extremely ill and forced to go home early, ruining our night.  I will spare you the details, but it was definitely food poisoning from something we ate (not alcohol related), which was the Scallops, Risotto, Lobster Pot Pie, Treviso Salad and Pot De Creme.  I called the restaurant to let them know what happened, and the manager actually suggested that we both had a stomach virus.  Really?  A virus that kicked in at the exact same time, two hours after eating at MM, and lasted the exact same length of time?  I don't think so.  She then proceeded to tell me that all food poisoning cases take 36 hours to present themselves, which is also false, and in many cases can take from 2-12 hours (google it).  We absolutely would have given them another try had the management not completely blown me off and pretended like I was crazy for suggesting that there might have been contaminated food in their kitchen.  I only hope that others didn't share the same fate.",1,,

Only thing we'd change would be the sour sauce under it to perhaps something a little more simple...but everything else was great with it. We had the tuna entree which was, in my opinion, a really nicely sized, perfectly seasoned, entree with just the right accompaniments. We'd get it again! We also had the BLT&A salad with lobster.
