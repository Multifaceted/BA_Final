It did not disappoint!Every attention to detail was made to ensure we had a memorable experience. From the Friendly host, to the Sommelier helping us choose the best wine, to the amazing team of wait staff, the experience is of the highest caliber you can receive at a NYC establishment. But oh the food!  This is a meat lovers dream. The Duck Flambé, the milk braised pork shoulder and the lavender steak were out of this world. To top it off for desert Chef Angie Mar has a bone marrow creme brulee that is award winning. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. Just go. You won't be disappointed",7,2,5
1,Chloe C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,4,5.0,10/7/2018,"I am incredibly surprised at the yelp rating for Beatrice because I had an spectacular experience. I imagine that if heaven had a kitchen, whoever the chef is would be one of the cooks. Everything we ordered was phenomenal - absolutely phenomenal. I am a meat eater, and I found even their harvest carrot/vegetable appetizer to be incredible. And the pate was so smooth. The burger was cooked perfectly (and they only reason I got the burger was because my dining partner is a vegetarian and getting the meat plate would be too much). Everything was so good we didn't want to leave - so we ordered the tea, which came in its silverware set. We were so full but because everything was so good we also wanted to try a dessert, the creme brûlée was a fair treat but made for a better one for my spoiled pup because it came in a marrow bone. My taste buds were so distracted I forgot to order wine but the specialized cocktails at the Beatrice are not only delicious but artistic. The service was also impeccable, everyone was genuinely kind and our waiter was a very sweet guy who took his time with us through the menu. (Sometimes my friend and I get written off because we're young women, so we notice the attitudes quick... little do they know we're serious foodies) One of the best restaurants in NYC.(Don't come here if you're going to nitpick the menu - the chef works hard to make the perfect combination of flavors, including the ingredients and its paired sides. For places like this, you're here to let the artist to show you his collection, not work on a commissioned piece.)",4,,1
2,Eric L.,"Durham, NC",194,22,4,5.0,8/15/2018,"My dinner here started off with a salad as my appetizer. It was so fresh it felt like the salad was literally pulled from the ground just minutes ago. The house sauce tasted great and was in the perfect quantity. Not overpowering at all. Complimented the vegetation quite well. Next was my entree. The 45 day dry aged burger was phenomenal. One of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat and bun just melted in my mouth. The caramelized onions and truffles added beautifully to the taste. My dinner finished with a goat cheese cheesecake. It looked so good I had to try and I wasn't disappointed. The rich flavor stood out to me against all other cheesecakes I've had. The quantity was good too, not too much and not too little. My only complaint is that it is a little hot in here but maybe that's just me. The service was amazing and I felt well taken care of. If I lived in New York I would come here more often.",2,,1
3,Rezarta T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,2,3,5.0,11/11/2018,"We went to The Beatrice Inn this past weekend it was six of us. The sitting took a while however the manager was very kind to offer a free drink. The vibe is amazing and I love these types of restaurants in the fall/winter time. The sommelier is exceptional. She remembered me form a month ago and knew exactly what type of wine I like. She even spend time talking to my husband to understand what he likes. The Sommelier is very knowledgeable, professional and pleasant. Service could be better overall . Food is amazing if you like to eat meat. Pork was amazing and not to be neglected. Food is a bit heavy however works best to share especially if you are a big group.",1,,

Fries was good though.Duck Pie - my entree, the pie itself was very thick, and not fully cooked, so it's kind of disgusting eating it the wet dough. The duck has a lot of fat, felt more gross as I ate it.

5,Gus S.,"Philadelphia, PA",164,331,697,4.0,9/1/2018,"This spot was very elegant and swanky. The cocktails were very impressive, especially the Big in Japan. The service was top notch. The chicken liver pate appetizer was the best pate I ever had. The fried dates were ok, but not great. The roasted duck was definitely the star. The duck was $120. It was a whole large sized duck that was definitely enough for three people. It came with fingerling potatoes, which was delicious. My buddy and I were extremely full. Though the steaks were too expensive to order, the duck was decently priced for New York City.  Do not come here unless you are ready to spend over $125-$300 per person. But it is definitely a memorable experience.",3,1,
6,Anne W.,"Brooklyn, NY",166,202,185,5.0,6/11/2018,"--Bar Review--Beatrice Inn is like, suuuuuch a quintessential West Village bar. It's in the basement level of a townhouse that was built when America was fresh and new. It's a got a huge wood burning fireplace, which ups that cozy factor to 100. It's intimate without being crowded. I recently sat at the bar for cocktails and had the most helpful fun bartenders. I ended up ordering a Big Poppa, which is such a fun drink! Gin is perfect for spring and the gold liquid was super pretty (though it did stain my lips!). I will definitely be back for more drinks and hopefully try some dishes as well.",2,,2
7,Abul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,293,148,4.0,12/5/2017,"So... judging from all the gripes on here, people are mostly upset that this place is expensive?Their menu is online! With prices! Were you too lazy to look it up? Or did you just stumble out of your NYU Psych 101 class and accidentally end up here when you thought you were going to Mamoun's Falafel?Here's the deal, the decor is classy NYC/speakeasy w some modern touches (neon, etc). The music was a great combo of classic rock and old-school hip-hop.The corkage is steep (probably the highest I've ever seen). But we still brought some good bottles with us. The aforementioned (in another review) Somm took the liberty of opening them and making sure they were not corked, and then decanting them for us while we got a drink at the bar waiting for our table. Later in the evening when we ran out of our wines, she recommended an excellent bottle that paired perfectly with our meal and followed the natural progression of what we had previously.The food. The food was absolutely on point. Excellent. And most importantly, not stuff you have at most other ""chophouses"" in NYC.The burger was solid. (Got the regular not the fancy one)The Sea Pie is one of my favorite things. Is it rich? fatty? salty? yes, yes, yes. (If you don't like these things may I suggest a reservation at abcV instead?) This thing reminded me of a cassoulet in pie form. Just delicious.Then came the duck! Beautiful presentation and cooked to perfection.All in all, would definitely go back (especially if someone else pays - or for a special occasion).",18,11,11
8,Jason L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,2,0,2.0,10/28/2018,"Horribly pretentious wait staff. Food is okay at best and way overpriced. Steaks priced at $800-$1,000 are a sick joke. Don't waste your time or money.",2,1,1
9,Emily L.,"New York, NY",394,28,92,5.0,8/7/2018,"I agree with Abul 100%. This place is not cheap, but we know this! It's a nice spot for a nice, slightly more expensive dinner. I had the dry aged burger and it may have been the best burger I've ever had. The service was amazing and the food was definitely worth the price. Chef Angie even stopped by our table and gave us some special whiskey she'd had hidden away somewhere (this was about 2 years ago). She was so nice and so cool, it just made me love the place even more. It's definitely about time for us to make another trip over.",2,1,1
10,Bjorn P.,"New York, NY",22,659,667,5.0,4/4/2018,"I loved Beatrice Inn. Came for a birthday. Dropped mad cash. BUT the food is phenomenal and the service as well. We had the following:- Ribeye (aged 60 days)- Cabbage- Bone Marrow creme brûlée- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder- Duck- Yellowtail carpaccioEverything was delicious with the ribeye, yellowtail and duck being the standouts. Drinks were left belt and the wine options also excellent. Will definitely come back!",3,,
11,Mark D.,"Sag Harbor, NY",3,37,40,3.0,1/25/2018,"Really wanted this to be a five-star experience but it wasn't.  2 of us went for what promised to be one of the best steaks in the city.The food: Sure, I can be a big shot once in a while so why not get the highly touted 50 oz. tomahawk steak for 2?? Answer... $14 an oz = $700 for the steak!!  Add tax and tip: $900.  And no, you don't get the rest of the cow, naming rights or a plaque over your seat.  So I opted for the only other steak, a $85 cote de boeuf with crustacean butter.  Interesting and complex, I did enjoy it.  The langoustine however (think shrimp cocktail) was $25 a piece which I thought, hey I am a big shot... so I'll buy 2, was close to raw, and I thought were disgusting.  Waiter didnt ask if I enjoyed them or I would have said so.  The Yellowtail app was nice, if you like truffle. I don't, but ordered it anyway on the waiters recommendation.  The $17 chicken liver pate app was my favorite part of the meal.The service:  Seemed fair enough, a bit spotty, so wouldn't win a spot on any ""best"" list.The place: Loved the vibe.  Don't like squished tables which I had but worked past that and still loved the vibe.  On the walk out got hit with another wall of truffle smell.  Think walking past the perfume section of a department store during the holidays.  Go if thats your thing.  It's not mine.",5,1,2
12,Jeff L.,"Rego Park, NY",1262,137,1720,5.0,1/20/2018,"This was an amazing meal for 7 of us.  Our friend had gone before to try the crazy $600 steak with some friends.  He said it was the best steak he had.  We had some repeat orders, the pork shoulder, the dry aged burger.  Again he said it was incredible! We loved the pork shoulder it was so soft and tendered, we had bo siam at momofuku a few years ago and this was even better than that large format.  The large format was the Sea Pie, not sure why its a sea pie since it doesn't have seafood, but has smoked boar, lambshank, pork and a duck leg.  The way this is made was monstrous.  We still had left overs with everyone trying to finished it off slowly.  The crust was so good.  Crispy and flaky you can dip it in the pot and it melts with all the flavors from the meat.  As a appetizer we got the two 45 day dry aged burger.  This was tender!  I think i would come back for a whole burger myself.  The first bite you take you don't even think its a burger, the the cheese and mushrooms melt in your mouth!We also got 60 day dry aged cote de boeuf, we actually got two of them one medium rare and one rare.  This was very good as well the blackberries really give it a nice kick and the butter was just a nice hint of salt on your tongue. The branzino is a breaded fish this was came out like a big giant gold fish, because the outside was a nicely colored yellow crust, they remove the bones and you see the lemons they use to cook the fish in.  This was a very light but savory choice.  We all devoured it in small bites. The duck flambee, I have to say I wasn't expected the show or the immense flavor from this entry but this is worth a order if you love duck.  We all know how peking duck is and we were just talking about it.  The first bite of the duck was just so crispy and juicy.  It had a sweet taste to your tongue, i'm guessing the liqour they use for the flambee, but because it was roasted too before it.  It gives you a best of both words. I probably never had a duck so tender and juicy as this one. Dessert Bourbon creme brulee bone marrow, this is a bit small but it packs a bunch of flavor and taste! Plus its in bone marrow! Remember to use the tiny spoon.Truffle Affogato was so good after a big and heavy meal.  The truffle on it too, but you know truffle isn't cheap we went with the 2 grams. So you can imagine a price for 7 people isn't cheap, but once in awhile a good meal with good company is well worth it!  We had a 5:30pm reservation it gets super packed later at night.  45 DAY DRY AGED BURGER  Red Wine Caramelized Onions, D'affinois, BriocheMILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER  Jasmine Rice Soubise, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, SageSEA PIE  Smoked Boar, White Wine Braised Lamb Shank, Pork Cheek & Duck Leg, Cannellini Beans, Cippolinis, Rosemary Crust, Herbed GravyROAST DUCK FLAMBE  Cherry Jus, Fingerlings Lyonnaise60 DAY DRY AGED COTE DE BOEUF  Marrow Blistered Blackberries, Charred Prawn ButterBRANZINO FOR TWO  Rosemary en Croute, Lemon",5,,1
13,Ryan P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",343,332,790,2.0,6/4/2017,"I came in for an early birthday dinner while in NYC for my first time. Treated myself to the awesome 120 day dry aged whiskey tomahawk. Although the steak was awesome, the lamb tartar was amazing, the service was a little lacking. My wife is GF (noticing the menu states - ""the kitchen is happy to accommodate vegan and vegetarian options upon request) asked about replacing the bread (that comes w the lamb tartar) with a vegetable. We were promptly told ""no, the chef doesn't do that"" we told them about her Gluten intolerance... and they still brought a huge plate of bread. Neither were the waiter nor the manager willing to ask if we could have a substitution. Apparently vegan/vegetarian can have different options, but allergies can't. Every time we asked about something, the response was ""this is the way the chef does things"" After spending over $500 on dinner, the least they could have done was give a side dish or some sort of substitute for the Gluten portion of her meal. Although he food was excellent I was very disappointed in the service portion of this restaurant.  I the future, I'll be taking my business to a restaurant that cares about the experience, as well as, clients dietary needs.",25,8,1

The paintings and overall vibe is just amazing- dramatic jungle-inspired oil paintings and warm dim lighting- trendy but cozy. We got seated on time in the dining area and had a great somm help us pick out some amazing wines. Oysters, chicken liver mousse, kale salad, tomahawk ribeye, poutine, two bottles of red later (and marrow creme brûlée), we were VERY happy little pigs.

17,Johnson P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,2.0,8/7/2018,"Here's the deal:The burger is really good (but priced at $38). The service is of high quality. The beer is reasonably priced ($9 - $15). The ambiance and location is really cool. But the steak is *incredibly* overpriced. We went with the $375 option for a 40 oz steak between some friends. The quality of the meat was presumably good (they even bring the piece over to the table for you to take a peek at before they cook it!) - but the actual taste was simply subpar for the price point... It was almost laughable. You could go to somewhere like Lugers and eat a steak that is legitimately 3 - 4x as good for about 1/5th of the price. Hilarious.How are they still in business? The reasons in the first paragraph. It was a really enjoyable meal (until the check came) - and that's why people probably keep coming back. It's a trendy, interesting, and alluring place, so if you have money to spend it could be worth it to you. Unfortunately, the meat is a total joke at the price point; it was so offensive I thought 2 stars was the fairest rating I could give.  I would come back for the experience and ambiance, but next time I'll stick with the very overpriced burger instead of the incredibly overpriced steak.",3,2,4
18,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1913,4.0,3/2/2017,"I came here for an early valentine day's dinner and this place was a perfect date spot. Situated in what looks to be a townhouse, this place is cozy with wonderful unique décor. I was at first nervous because their reviews seems to constantly bash on their service but fortunately for us, our waitress was very attentive and nice. We had to wait perhaps 15 minutes after our reservation but their bar area is great for some predrink dinners. Their bartenders were super friendly and put great care into making their cocktails. As for the appetizers, we started off with the IPA Battered Dates and marinated olives. Olives were nice and simple, salty drenched in olive oil. The IPA battered dates were delicious. Nicely fried on the outside, a good hint of sweet from the dates that were not overpowering, coupled with the acidity from the mustard sauce it sat on top of was perfect. Really well done and full of flavor that complemented each other well. As for the main entrée, we shared the cassoulet, a big pot of meat: duck confit, braised lamb shank and smoked pork cheek over cannellini beans. It was absolutely delicious. The beans softened and was the perfect balance to the salt the meats gave. Each of the meats were perfectly cooked and each of them had their own delicious flavor. It was easy to tell which meats you were eating, all so tender and easily pulled apart. Huge in portion, definitely easy to split between 2-3 people. All this food and it still didn't stop us from getting a side which was so worth it. We got the Tartiflette which is essentially sliced potatoes topped and covered with delicious cheese. So good. The cheese provided creaminess along with a good crust from the cheese being broiled. Amazing. I would come back just for that.",16,6,7

I knew that the place is not for the budget conscious and with that expect a certain level of service and meal. Branzino was baked in a pretzelStyle dough and served almost cold. The $85 steak had no sizzle, was luke warm and served like a $ 1 steak and eggs at a casino.

We started off with some cocktails & oysters, followed by the yellow tail carpaccio, perfectly seasoned with truffles, and the lamb tartar.Our table of four then shared the roast duck flambe, and the branzino. The branzino was excellent. It arrived wrapped in a crust that was so good, I was picking at fish-bones towards the end just to grab every last bite of crust left! It was plenty of food, but we managed to finish it. Really enjoyed the flavors of the duck which was perfectly cooked and topped with cherries that added some great tartness.

I made my choice and when we asked the waiter about gluten free options, believe it or not, he said the salad or a steak would be the one and only option. My daughter has severe gluten allergies and doesn't eat meat... he talked to the chef and again said those were the only options and that the manager would come talk to us... 15 minutes later as he hadn't showed up we decided to leave. The manager stopped me at the bar and apologized lightly.Now... in a restaurant in NY... can't the chef get the 50 dollar crab legs and grill them with lemon? the branzino for 100 bucks cannot be baked or grilled gluten free? a duck breast can't be sautéed with butter? The yellow tail for the obvious crudo could not be baked?The attitude of the staff at this place needs to be checked.

At this point well-aware of both big portions and the overall richness of the menu, many whole Animals featured and most Steaks or Chops offered as a full cut on the Bone, course two saw Chef Mar send forth a Cast-Iron Skilled filled to the brim with confit Duck, Foie Gras and Potatoes beneath a flaky Crust, each bite the definition of decadence yet at the same time well balanced by a ladle of Tarragon Gravy and plenty of roasted Onions.Torn between the Smoked Rabbit, 120-day Dry Aged Ribeye or Roast Duck Flambé for an entrée, the eventual decision made when the server explained that the latter was salt-cured for four days before being roasted and finished tableside with flames, those who love Duck are well advised to invest the $102 menu price on what very well may be the richest piece of meat in New York that is not from Japanese Cattle, the flesh cooking up crisp atop a ribbon of fat while the meat is juicy and pink with a flavor halfway between the Tea Smoked version served at Chinese restaurants and a really good piece of Ham.Chuckling at the Cheese Board, every item offered as a whole block akin to what one might find at Murray's, though here at 2-3x the price, Desserts at Beatrice Inn are recited rather than presented in ink, the $27 Banana Brulee Sundae with Chocolate-covered Cherries a bit spendy thanks to the Pedro Ximenez upgrade while the funky Bone Marrow and Bourbon Crème Brulee is definitely a better option for those who wish to continue building on a theme, though the Fried Apple Pie with Foie Gras Ice Cream and salty Duck Fat Caramel is certainly no less indulgent.",7,3,3
30,Boris S.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",27,4,2,2.0,6/2/2017,"Most expensive dinner for the most mediocre experience. Paid the price of a 6 star restaurant for a 3 star restaurant. First of all, this restaurant tries to present itself as a luxurious experience. Meanwhile it is located in the basement of a small block in the West Village. As many others, my friends (4 of us) and I saw a viral Facebook video about this restaurants' enticing 120-day aged whiskey soaked steak sprinkled with truffles. I'll admit right away that I was caught in this trap, because that was the primary reason for us visiting the Beatrice Inn. When we were sat down we inquired about their famous rib eye. The waiter was quick to sell us on how ""meticulously"" they prepare the steak and how mind blowing this experience will be. Nonchalantly he also told us that this steak will run us approx $700. We were caught quite off guard, expecting this to run us a maximum of $300. After much consideration we decided to just pull the trigger, expecting this to be the best steak we've ever had (and we are quite the foodies who have fancied many upscale steakhouses). Once another waiter brings out the cut to us, he tells us this is a 70 ounce cut and not a 60 ounce cut, which will run us about $970 and not $700. We were not happy, but the waiter was emphasizing that this was cut specifically for us and there is no other choice. At this point we want to make the best of it and expect to have a serious mouthgasm out of the (by far) most expensive dinner we ever had. Once the steak comes out already cut - we quickly realize that half of the 70 oz is just the bone. Additionally the edges of the steak are cooked at medium well (medium rare was requested). We've had bigger steak portions than this at 1/6th of the cost that tasted better than this steak. The flavor was good, but not close to anything extraordinary. One of us even needed some salt for it. The steak was masked with lots of butter and non-impressive truffles. I would've rated this place 4 stars if the bill was $400 instead of $1,400. For $1,400 I would've expected an insane memory with quite a story to share with my friends. What I'm left with is an ok dinner and feeling embarrassed to even tell my fiancée about how much I spent on this dinner. 3 words - don't do it",49,12,3
31,Tanya K.,"New York, NY",168,5,1,1.0,6/10/2018,"This star is for the amazing carpaccio and cocktails. However, for us, this place really did not live up to hype. Mostly due to the service we received. Our waiter was extremely snooty (we were a young looking but not young table) so he immediately treated us as such.  We had guests visiting from their honeymoon which we explicitly wrote on list of occasions and nothing was acknowledged or event done for It. Additionally, we asked if there was any chance we could have bread before we started (we were starving- don't even care if It was tacky to ask) but the waiter laughed and then never brought It out. We spent very close to $1K so it's not like we were cheap, we spend a lot of money on good food but even the food was half decent. All of our cuts of meat were extremely fatty- ordered pork shoulder and Cote de boeuf. The best things we ate were truly the carpaccio and kale salad. Oysters were ok, but at 48 for half a dozen- it's just not worth it. We ordered 3 desserts at the end; the side of vanilla ice cream we ordered in addition to, was the the saving grace. The creme Brûlée was inside a bone which is cool in concept but we got maybe two spoonfuls of it total. The other dessert I can't even remember which if It wasn't memorable, means something.Overall very disappointed in service and food.",5,3,1

34,Phillip H.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,4,0,1.0,11/14/2017,"Three friends and I were looking for a low key place to grab a drink after seeing a new photography exhibit in the West Village. We struck out on our first try, a very crowded dive that I wasn't really feeling anyhow. When we agreed to move on, my friend led us to The Beatrice Inn and I immediately voiced my approval. Candlelit stairs. A friendly but professional doorman. The feel of an old fashioned speakeasy. What more could you ask for on a Tuesday night in NYC? After studying the menu and getting some input from the bartender, I ordered and waited for my drink, the Voodoo People. Another customer  and I were oohing and aahing while watching the bartender mix my drink, when I half heard the bartender ask what I figured was a follow-up question about the cocktail preparation. I asked him to repeat himself and he said, ""Can you please give my guests some space?"" I was stunned, but looked to my right and realized that my presence was making the woman (who happened to be white) to my left uncomfortable. I'm a nerdy black professional from Mississippi who grew up in Iowa, and I've had plenty of experience with microaggressions, but this one hit a new low. I've learned to manage my customer expectations since becoming a New Yorker, but this behavior was hideous and uncalled for, and I regret ever setting foot into this establishment.

35,Ashley M.,"New York, NY",2,17,0,1.0,11/1/2017,"If you enjoy being physically threatened after an incredibly overpriced meal this is the restaurant for you. We actually had a lovely meal and great service from our waitress. Everyone goes into the Bea expecting a pricey meal. Ours came out about $400 for 3 people but that was fine. We closed out our bill and then decided we were enjoying the conversation and that we'd have another round of drinks. At this point our waitress sheepishly came over and informed us she'd forgotten to charge us for our last bottle of wine on our original check. Fine. People make mistakes. But it was only because we ended up sticking around for another round of drinks that they had an opportunity to address their mistake. And that's what it was on their part. A mistake. We expressed many times that we had no issue retroactively paying for the bottle of wine, but the way it was handled was shocking. The ""manager"" is a disgruntled man who has no interest in customer service. He was accusatory from the outset and completely ignored our point of view. He was also slurring all of his words as if he was drinking on the job. From a restaurant as expensive as this one you expect exemplary service, particularly from a manager.  What I got was a hostile man in my personal space asking if I wanted to ""leave the easy way, or the hard way"" at the end of a meal and a customer service situation that was totally mishandled. Do yourself a favor. Go literally anywhere else in the west village for dinner. PS relax with the upselling nobody wants so hear your convoluted story about Hemingway and $48 oysters.",24,7,3

38,Phillip C.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,0,4.0,6/18/2018,"Like at least a few of its patrons, I learned about The Beatrice Inn from an episode of Nick Solares' The Meat Show. Then I read some reviews, which concerned me. Lots of 2-3 star reviews, etc. I thought I would offer my experience to counter some of the others. First, you should know that the service is a little grounded in their ways. I had young children with me and although they were pleasant to the children, when asked if they had any options for children the waiter sternly said ""whatever's on the menu."" Not the best response. Although this wasn't a huge to do, the more upscale restaurants I've been to have done everything they can to be accommodating.Second, the food is really good. I and my family enjoyed everything we ate. The Pate, Duck, and prime rib (only on Sundays) were all excellent.  Dessert was great, too. There was some flambé pineapple upside down cake/tart that was delicious. Third, service wasn't bad. Busboys, etc were all very attentive and many of the dishes come with a bit of a show: duck and dessert were set on fire at the table and the prime rib was cut table side from a huge rib roast. Although I wasn't asked about coffee, which was a little annoying. Otherwise, it was a fine experience.I would recommend and I will be going back for that whiskey aged steak I've read about.",2,1,1
39,Nazary N.,"New Orleans, LA",260,125,383,4.0,7/29/2017,"Went here for dinner to catch up with an old friend after I saw the chef Angie Mar on one of my favorite YouTube channels (Sean In The Wild from Complex). Right away I'll say the restaurant inside is a nice upgrade on the classic steakhouses like Keen's or Peter Luger's - don't get me wrong those places are great and I enjoy them - but if the steakhouse as a concept is going to continue it needs to keep evolving and I think The Beatrice Inn is part of that evolution. Where once you might have conjured up an image of The Rat Pack now you get A Tribe Called Quest playing in the background and a cocktail called The Big Poppa. These are changes I wholeheartedly welcome. We had no problem claiming our reservation and the staff was super friendly. We were expertly guided through our meal by our head waiter - originally intending to get the tomahawk me and my friend decided instead on the 60 Day Dry Aged Cote De Boeuf with a side of Tartiflette. We started with the Chicken Liver Pate. The Pate was phenomenal - incredibly rich it came with a pool of fat sitting on top and an accompaniment of delicious blackberry jam and whole grain mustard. The mustard really helped cut through some of the richness of the pate. The steak was great - it was topped with roasted blackberries that added a nice hint of sweetness and lots of roasted garlic. The tartiflette I found a little too fatty for me (ironic considering I just praised the pate) but my friend really enjoyed it. That is however why this isn't necessarily a 5 star experience. What the kitchen does well, they do well - primarily meat and meat derivatives - but that can make the meal lack balance. It was heavy dish after heavy dish and knowing this I think I'll be back next time only if I'm feeling like a true carnivore. I'd also like to mention that during our meal Mar came over and asked each table how the dinner was going. I was a little too star struck to say anything but she was still present on our way out making sure the restaurant was going smoothly. I appreciate that dedication to a restaurant at a time when so many celebrity chefs are busy building empires.",1,1,1
40,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,5.0,4/26/2017,"KenScale: 9.0/10A former nightclub turned restaurant, the Beatrice Inn sounds like a classic nightlife trap where people just go for expensive but boring food before partying in West Village or Meatpacking District. After multiple chef turnovers, the restaurant hired someone who has quickly become a rising star in the New York dining scene. The chef, Angie Mar, has been known to have a few tricks up her sleeves when it comes to meat cooking. And dare I say, my wife and I recently had perhaps the best duck dish in New York City! I know that is a very bold statement, with a ton of restaurants in the city that cook excellent ducks, but unless we encounter something better in the near future, I am willing to stand by my 9.0 KenScale score (my wife eagerly agrees too). The restaurant offers meat-centric dishes that are best shared with larger groups of four and more. The prices are definitely on the high side but the quality of food really backs up the price tags. For appetizer, I was somewhat disappointed with the tiny portion of yellowtail carpaccio with porcini and truffle preserves on top when it arrived at our table, but the silky smooth texture of the yellowtail was absolutely wonderful with the preserves on top. Now let's get to the main part. The kitchen roasts a whole duck and then brings it in flames to our table for a little show. It is accompanied by potato fingerlings Lyonnaise, and we also ordered a side of pan roasted ramps with crispy duck egg and perigord truffles. In all my five and a half years of culinary journey in New York, I haven't tasted a duck quite like this. It is absolutely tender and juicy, while the seasoning is kept at a minimum to make the texture shine even more. Combine the meat with cherry jus on top throughout, and you have an absolute winner. The whole duck was for a party up to 4, but my wife and I were actually glad we were the only ones devouring this beautiful bird on the table, and did manage to finish off the entire plate! My wife, who has always been partial to duck dishes, declared she couldn't remember having a better duck dish than the one at the Beatrice Inn. The potato fingerlings served as a worthy side to the meat, and if you ever feel a little overwhelmed with the meat fest, add some roasted ramps that can really help neutralize the meaty sensation in the middle of our meal. Getting a reservation at the Beatrice Inn can be tricky, especially on the weekends, so advance booking is always highly recommended. The restaurant has a bar area on the entrance that gets really loud during peak times, but we managed to escape the chaos by sitting at the back dining space. There is full bar with some strong old school Manhattan style cocktails to complement your meal. I can't wait to come back to the Beatrice Inn to see what other fantastic meat dishes that the kitchen has in its roster. I sincerely hope the eye-opening duck is not their own strength. My wife and I agreed we should bring at least a group of six hungry friends on board to sample as many dishes as possible next time.",6,1,7

42,Liza S.,"New York, NY",20,37,10,1.0,4/29/2018,"Review specific to bar and management -Avoid wasting time if you actually want a drink and go to spotted pig few blocks away where you get a drink in minutes instead of waiting for bartenders to finish their conversations with friends. Came in around 11pm with a group of 5 people and waited around the bar for good 10-15min to put in drinks in while two bartenders avoided eye contact with anyone who wasn't sitting at the bar. One bartender looked like was having personal conversation the entire time. So we moved to kitchen side of the bar to try catching the eye on the bartender working that side. Incidentally that we got in the path of wait staff and were asked to move which made sense. By that time we've been trying to get drinks for solid 25-30min so I mentioned to the manager that I completely understand that we're blocking but the Bartenders are not engaging anywhere else along the bar to which the manager very rudely replied ""it's a busy night ma'am"" yet one bartender was Cleary enjoying social interaction for some time now. Our group plus one more were standing around waiting for to put orders in. We left and walked over to the Spotted Pig (alsoDelicious Food) where the bartender upstairs who started taking our drinks while still making precious order... and the place was packed to the brim!

No. We legit!Let me start out by saying that you must come here with a group. Yeah, it's all romantic and stuff but if you want to get the full experience here, a group is always better since they have such large portioned dishes.We came on a Thursday night (with a reservation) and the host and hostess were on their game! Usually when they give me the whole ""when your full party is here we'll seat you, now go sit your ass at the bar"" talk I'm not havin' it. The host and hostess said it in such a kind way that I said to myself ""don't mind if I do take my ass to the bar"".Did I mention I used to go to Beatrice Inn when it was a nightclub and I was also not of age? I digress... (they did renovate the old club and turn it in to a restaurant hence the new Beatrice Inn).Service:I ordered a lovely cocktail and the bartenders really knew what they were doing. I could tell by the garnishes that this place could whip up a mean cocktail and I was not disappointed. They seemed super enthusiastic and happy to be there which is always a huge plus.When we were seated, the waitress came over and also was super duper enthusiastic and boy did she know her stuff. I was wondering if they make you recite the entire menu and how each dish tastes / where everything comes from 100x in the back before each shift perfectly before allowing you to get out on the floor and waitress for the night. I will say though that she definitely sold us on many dishes that we most likely wouldn't have gotten if she wasn't so passionate about them.Decor:Beautiful. Romantic. Rustic. Quaint. Loved it! We asked where the painting came from and who it was by (I had seen the same gummy bear outside on the LES painted on a wall) and we were advised that the chef owned the work of art and she even came out to greet our table and talk about it / the food.Food:Welcome to the main event! We ordered:+ OystersEast and west coast - I don't eat oysters but my colleagues LOVED them and they are super picky about oysters+ Yellowtail crudoWith porcini and truffle preserves, citrus, and chili - so amazing!!!! A light must-order+ Lobster Saint JacquesChanterelles, charred lemon, sherry, and lavender - this was essentially lobster and cheese... say whaaaaa? Seafood and cheese? On the same plate? in the same dish? Yes. Was it good? Yes! I have honestly never in my life had cheese with seafood. I don't know who made up the rules that that was a big no-no but I think they were just lactose intolerant and wanted the rest of the world to miss out because this dish was prettttty good!+ Alliums & foie grasCountry bread, comte, and smoked bouillon - basically like a chicken pot pie but instead with foie gras - absolutely heavenly!!!!!!+ 60 DAY DRY AGED COTE DE BOEUF Marrow Blistered Blackberries, Charred Prawn Butter - Ohhhhh yaaaas...a perfect dish to share! It was marvelous.+ Truffle fries - Enough saidFor a table of 4, this was enough food for the table (maybe could have done without one of the smaller dishes or side dishes) but I can definitely say that it wasn't too much food or too little. This is where you go to eat if you want to eat with the foodie big boys!

We walked in with a few friends and asked if they had a table for us we wanted to have drinks and eat. She said let me check on that and we waited. Literally, next thing I know the manager is mumbiling in the servers ear and starring at us. Tried not to think anything of it... until it happened again. My friend asked if there was a problem and what's the reason for the attitude. The ""manager"" turned around and said you guys seem drunk and we are not sure if we can serve you guys. Seriously? We had a few beers before we went there... drunk? We weren't even close. One thing leads to another and we sit. We try to just forget about it and enjoy our night. We're on vacation after all. Now the server comes and he has attitude obviously because of what the manager told him. We started getting really uncomfortable and asked if there is a problem because we're not feeling welcomed and we can just leave. She turned around and said ""the door is right there.

Didn't taste good at all and the amount of truffle they give you doesn't even cost $5. Kale salad tasted sour.

The chicken pate was the best pate I've ever had. If you don't like pate, you will probably start liking it after you try this one. The veal carpaccio was over-seasoned in my opinion (you barely taste the veal), so I could have skipped that. But the branzino. Oh my gosh. The branzino was unlike any other branzino dish I've seen. They completely turn it into a pastry. Don't ask me how.I will admit the meal wasn't the healthiest, but I wasn't expecting that, so just level your expectations.Onto the drinks:We also each got a martini (which was fine -- nothing special). But we then decided to order off their cocktail list (the Hops on the Rocks) which was *awesome*. I highly recommend skipping your usual drink order and ordering off their cocktail menu. Plus it comes in a beautiful crystal glass that just adds something to the drink.Finally, the decor: It was intimate with the perfect amount of noisy, but not too noisy where you felt like you were listening in on your neighbors' conversation. The fireplace also adds a nice touch. They make you wait at the bar for your table (at least on a Saturday night), but even the bar scene is great.Overall, the meal was under $100 per person for a few drinks each, two appetizers, and a main course for two. The meal probably went for about three hours. (Note: many of the menu items are much more expensive than what we ordered. For example, there's a $120 duck dish, an $840 steak, and so on.)What I wish I had ordered: the kale salad. Sounds silly, but the table next to us got it, and it looked amazing.",3,,2
50,Samson L.,"New York, NY",333,29,36,4.0,4/22/2017,"Although we had a 6 pm reservation, we weren't seated until nearly 6:45 (two people from our ten-person party were running behind, but where they were going to seat us clearly wouldn't have allowed for other folks to sit anyway, so it would've been nice for us to have gotten seated first so we could get appetizers and drinks). When we did get to sit though (in a somewhat cramped space), the food and drinks did not disappoint. I had an American Pie cocktail, a mixture of apple whiskey, winter spices, and nutmeg. If it weren't $16, I probably would've had three of them. I also got the black kale salad, which was basically a kale Caesar salad. It was a bit too salty, but the kale had a smokey flavor which added a nice dimension to the salad. This might've been one of the rare greens on the menu. For my entree, I had the braised oxtail. The sumptuous meat melted off the bone and was served over a potato mash in a delicious Madeira wine sauce. It was the perfect portion. My friends had the milk-braised pork shoulder (might've been even better than the oxtail!), the beef cheek and wine-braised veal, the 45-day dry-aged beef burger, and the rabbit for two (a bit too dry for my taste). My only qualms were the delayed seating and spotty service (my friend had to ask three times for the beer they ordered, while everyone else got their drinks well before then). Aside from the slightly dry rabbit and salty kale salad, the service was one of my primary knock downs from giving five stars. Bottom line: Make a reservation, expect to wait a bit anyway, order a cocktail, and eat your weight in meat at The Beatrice Inn. Your wallet will feel a bit lighter, but it will be well worth it. Can't wait to go back!",2,,1

Got a reservation, gave them a credit card deposit, and showed up on the dot. No tables. The bar room was jam packed. No chance of getting to the bar. Could barely make my way through to the rest rooms. When I did, I could see that several tables were open. I fought my back to the entrance, and he tells me, ""They're not for you.""

Awesome company, awesome menu, awesome drinks, awesome waiters *stand up ovation* They have an intimate to semi-casual ambiance, with booth seats and smaller tables to accommodate date nights. Impress your date by bringing her here!Our waiter, Kevin, was very attentive throughout the whole evening our group was there, he also chimed in on our conversations occasionally with his humor. Our table had the specials of the evening, tagliatelle with razor clams, 48 oz steak (WOAH!) and several truffle burgers with duck egg. We had plenty of starters  and they were all fantastic but my favorite is the burrata! I would totally recommend getting it! The mixed bean side was a little on the saltier side (so was the tagliatelle) but was cooked perfectly, retaining the crunch. The truffle fries were to die for! Everyone loved the whisky infused steak especially the charred meat on the bone. For dessert, I'll recommend the olive cake and skip the profiterole. The cake was spongy and not super dense. Great way to end dinnerI'll definitely be back for more!",2,2,2
53,Allison A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,10/22/2018,"My husband and I came for a night out last Friday and I have to say it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! I grew up in NY in the late 60's early 70's. Back then service was a real thing! When you came to a nice restaurant for dinner it was special, they cared that you chose to come there. The service was lovely and the food was presented in a beautiful way. This was our experience at The Beatrice except the food was on another level! It was perfect! Each course was served on a lovely silver platter and plated out to you. The kale salad with the amazing honey tasting croutons was delicious and fresh! Next we had the pork shoulder with jasmine rice that was so tender and flavorful it literally melted in your mouth. The jasmine rice was almost like a savory pudding and so unique. Next was the pheasant served whole from a french enamel pot that was sealed with a pasty crust. The server opened the pot and showed us the beautifully cooked bird. Another server put in on a cutting board and transferred the cut pieces to a silver platter and draped it in the delicious juice and as a crowning touch sliced fresh black truffle on top. It was moist, delicious and filled with flavor like having dinner in an enchanted forest. The side were wonderful, potato gratin and a sweet maple infused squash with toasted almonds. For desert we had chocolate truffles and a coconut pudding with kind of a shortbread and roast coconut on top. Both out of this world. I should also mention the smoked manhattan cocktail that came in a covered platter and when it was opened smoke surrounded the drinks like a magic potion and they were great! All through the dinner the service was wonderful. The waitstaff was completely attentive and very nice but you never felt bombarded. It was a truly special experience. We don't go out often but we will be back soon with friends! I can't recommend The Beatrice Inn enough!",,,

You have to give massive props to a female chef who can rock a meat-heavy menu with such finesse. Not be be missed: - dry aged burger (well worth the price tag)- milk braised pork shoulder- champvallon de tete - braised ox tail- roast duck flambe- chicken liver pateFor the special occasions and expense account nights, I will always spring for the butcher's block which has never failed to impress. One thing to note is that this food is best eaten family style.

Some of us were not really hungry and we knew our limit. We made orders and was told they won't be enough for 6 ladies. Ok, so we order one more entree........ and we ended up cannot finish our food. Second, they cleared up the table without asking if we were done!!! Unbelievable!!! Some of my friends were full and put down their forks and knives but I was still eating!

Environment was cozy, music was a bit loud for me. Had the pre fixed dinner for 185. I must say this was one of the most disappointing expensive diner I have ever had. The food was 'ok' at best. Presentation wasn't great. The options for the thirds course was not flexible. My date wanted steak but I don't eat steak and the steak could only be made for two.

62,Zachary E.,"Tenafly, NJ",11,37,140,2.0,5/27/2017,"Very disappointed! After seeing the 120 day whiskey aged ribeye on an episode of the meat show with nick solares, it was immediately on my Radar as I love well aged ribeye. The menu said market price, which typical Means a steak that is not Kobe could run for a few hundred dollars, which is very expensive.  Well this is a new level.  A large steak was presented, a longbone ribeye with the short rib meat still on, cut about 2 inches thick. Very fatty, yet gorgeous.  They announced it was 63 ounces and cost $980! What?  I've had steak all over the world, A5 Kobe at cut in Vegas very expensive, but this is absurd.  A closer comparison in pricing would be the 240 day dry age at knife in Dallas which for a similar sized steak of the same cut would be about $200. The menu did not say this was a special breed of cattle.  Based on the marbling, I'm sure it was from a nice ranch somewhere is the US, but it was not Kobe.  Wholesale prime ribeye goes for @$10 lb.  I know you have loss in dry aging, usually about 30%, but Angie even claims this meat because of the whiskey and rags it's wrapped in does not lose as much weight as a typical dry age.  I think the price of what they ask for this steak is insulting. I'm a major foodie and love a fatty ribeye, this one was large, but much of it was large sections of fat.  To invite foodies into your shop with the promise of amazing dry aged steak, then presenting them with a $1000 ribeye is wrong.  Only absolute douche bags looking to impress someone wouldOrder this and go ahead when they find out the price.  63 ounces is a huge Steak, but with the amount of solid fat on it, would not have fed more then 2 by itself. We also got the duck which had great flavor, but disappointed in that the skin was soggy, not even remotely crispy. They also did it not cut the thighs or the legs well and it was difficult to cut on my plate as the skin was rubbery. Besides that, we switched to the coat de beuf which was much smaller then a typical one which could usually serve 2.  This was 1"" thick or less. The coat de beuf with the duck for two was not enough to feed 2 couples with small wives. That's in addition to a double order of the hamachi, a salad, and bland fried dates which tasted like pigs in blankets.  The are really just saying fuck you asshole with the price of the steak.  It's not on Wall Street, it's in the village.  Angie, make this right.",17,3,2
63,Dan F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,3,1.0,11/25/2017,"Don't fall for the IT-factor that they are trying to conceive. Took friends here to celebrate a 40Y birthday. The waiter oversold us HARD on how much food we needed for the 4 of us. Like he was on heavy commission. As we declined the $1,000 and $350 steak options (yes, $1k), he convinced us to get the special Sea Pie plus a baked Branzino and Salmon. We agreed after a long discussion. Who discusses with patrons like that? We already had put 4 apps in... The Sea Pie is a HUGE pot ($110) for the whole table. A lot of meat, beans and potatoes heated in the oven. That plus two entrés ($45 a pop)... Branzino was mostly bones and pastry. It was just an ridiculous amount of food and we could only eat less than half of it and when he asked about desert the birthday girl asked him to please go away. No Bday cake for her... Only positive was the female and very knowledgeable sommelier who found us some good wine she offered at discount as she could see how stupid this whole situation was. We left with a $600 tab and so upset that this special evening was shot. Food is supposed to be good, but this experience just ruined all of it. Leaving the restaurant, we complained to the manager/maitre  d, who DGAF. He even blamed it on the waiter (oh, he's new) and just brushed it off and sent us out the door. BEWARE of this establishment. I'm sure the Exec chef is talented, but the place is run like a Russian (no offense) strip club. Force people to spend as much and just get them out. So many other places to have a good and affordable experience in NYC... This place will probably not be around long.",14,3,2
64,Jacques R.,"New York, NY",449,112,59,5.0,3/21/2017,"This best kept secret restaurant is situated in a basement, difficult to find and used to be a speakeasy during prohibition. When you're  entering the space you still get that 1920's old school vibe from the  decor and the  waitstaff wearing long aprons and grey vest.The atmosphere is of a hustle bustle at the bar with a good selection of background music and an ecclectic clientele imbibing good liquor. Surprisingly enough when you're seated at a table, the effect is quite the opposite and you feel like you're in an oasis a calm attended by gracious staff and managers.Wine list is international, well designed short, concise and easy to navigate, and catered by knowledgeable  sommeliers helping you to make informed decisions. Signature cocktails are inventive with a lot of creative thoughts, try the Big Poppa made of Gin ,Truffles, Chartreuse, Eggwhite , Yuzu and Gold leaves. It'll knock your socks off...But the showstopper of this restaurant is the meat centric food. Items like lamb tartare, chicken liver mousse, dates stuffed with wild boar are offered as starters and these are incredibly executed. For main courses the Beef is elevated to a cult and treated  with different stages . Dry aging  varying from  30, 45, 60 days old and more, each prepared  differently instead of the predictable linear broiler process found in most steakhouses.The flagship steak of this establishment is their 200 days whisky dry aged Tomahawk bone in  ribeye, served with Truffles, vanilla, lobster butter, the meat practically melts in your mouth without chewing.If you like slow cooked and earthy casserole dishes, lamb osso bucco, pork shoulder, game pie, rabbit and cassoulet all are spot on regarding braising techniques, flavors and taste. The whole roasted  Canard a l'orange flambe tableside, is definitely a  tribute to classic Escoffier.What is pleasantly surprising,  is that the chef owner is a petite lady with skills that rival a lot of high profile chefs in the city.If you're a steak and meats connoisseur and looking for an outside the box unique experience, this is the place to go. Also be prepared to spend a bit, as top notch quality doesn't come cheap...",1,,

I love the street and location of the restaurant, it almost seems like a secret when you have to go down a flight of stairs to dine underground. When my friends and I arrived for our 7 o'clock reservation on a Thursday night, the place was almost ""empty"" but as our meal continued, the restaurant filled up. We started with a bottle of red. They only offer a very few wines by the glass, so bottle it was! We started our meal with a bar snack of fried dates. They we're overcooked and tasted burnt, but the presentation was pretty. Also kind of comical that for $7 you get 3 bite size pieces. Good thing there was only 3 of us! We also started with the burrata which was excellent. It was sweet and savory, served with blackberries and garlic! I would've never paired them together, but it worked!After asking the waiter for his opinion on the 2 very pricey burgers, we opted to get one of each: the $23 grass fed burger and the $38 45 day dry aged burger (yes you read that price right!) They were easy to compare side by side since they were served the same exact way with cheese and red wine caramelized onions. If I didn't have the 45 day dry aged burger next to it, I would've thought the grass fed was pretty awesome and delicious, but the 45 day dry aged blew it away. The meat was much more tender and ""melt in your mouth-like"". It was a blend of short rib, beef and more and it was noticeably tastier. But as I said, only noticeable because we did the side by side taste test! To top it all of we had an order of the truffle fries which were plentiful served in a huge dish with some plant-esq garnish on top that wasn't edible. But the truffle fries were amazing. We barely touched the huge pile of fries on the plates with the burgers. Talk about French try overload! The portions of fries were not slim. Enough about the food, the service was good too, but nothing to rave about. This burger doesn't top my list, as far as favorite, but it's high up there on my list!

I found Beatrice in on a video about dry aged steaks. If you follow my instagram or yelp reviews -steak is my thing. We began our meal with Lamb tartar mixed with a smoked egg yolk. I didn't know what to expect since I've always had Steak tartar. It was served with buttered brioche bread (I think) and it was excellent. Really very enjoyable. LAMB TARTARE / 19Smoked Yolk, French Blueberries, Walnuts, Black TruffleWe moved on to the Kale Salad. Crisp and the croutons were very good too. For my taste, I would like the dressing to be more saturated with flavor but I know that takes away from the taste of the kale (which is specifically chosen over lettuce for it's distinct flavor). I'm not a professional chef but I do know why chefs do what they do. :) BLACK KALE SALAD / 16Grilled Bread, Parmesan, Smoked Caper DressingNext came the meat pie. Wow.... the crust outrageous. The meat and veggies inside were amazing. Flavor was outstanding - and really on point. I love how it was served - with a bone marrow. (I don't eat bone marrow - but my friend does - and he said it was buttery and delicious). SHORT RIB & MUTTON PIE / 34English Peas, Pearl Onions, Fingerlings, Suet CrustMy friend's main was the Beef Cheek which initially looked like Onion Soup.

Unique in its presentation and very rich on the tongue. 60 DAY DRY AGED COTE DE BOEUF, KANSAS / 67Marrow Blistered Blackberries, Charred Prawn ButterI will most definitely return and will try their famous Whisky Tomahawk Ribeye. Must admit - it's very pricey but the prep time is 120 to 160 days of aging process. That alone SHOULD triple the price of the 30 day aged steaks you commonly find on restaurant menus. It's approximately 63 oz including the bone. Meant for 4 people though I could probably split it with a friend. The cost would be around $700 for this steak.

I dont know what the regular menu is like but the cinco de mayo menu was horrible. So bad I had to look for another place to wash down the taste of the food. It may be mediocre at best but the fact that we paid over $300 for our meal made every dish worst. I want to say that considering what they served, I would have had a better dining experience at Benny's Burritos. Your cinco de mayo was very pedestrian and I refuse to come back based on what you served me for those prices. The Guacamole was just avocado, nothing else.The most decent dish was the chicken oysters. The lamb shank was over cooked and the sauce was overly peppered. The wild boar was drenched in chili sauce you forgot what you were eating.To top it off you're servers had no idea what the hell you were serving and couldn't recommend anything - maybe because they too thought it sucked.

80,Justin C.,"Manhattan, NY",167,20,0,2.0,2/13/2017,"We ended up stopping in for cocktails while waiting for a dinner reservation at Cafe Cluny, which is a fantastic spot right across the street. Because the cocktail and bar experience was highly enjoyable along with the fireplace, we vowed to return to try the burger on the next dreary winter night. Fast forward to this past Friday. We arrived for a 9:30 reservation and had to wait an hour. It was Fashion Week and apparently this was THE scene. That's cool. The maitre d' did the right thing and comped us a truffle ceviche. We then ordered the pork shoulder, the burger and roast carrots. Though crowded the food arrived relatively quickly but they added potatoes au gratin that we didn't order. Because the entire restaurant is underground and slightly claustrophobic, especially when seated in the back room, it was a total fiasco trying to communicate anything.For that reason, we didn't complain. Had we complained, however, this is what we'd have said: The burger bun was completely stale. Literally inedible. The burger was so drenched in cheese and onions that you couldn't get any real sense of flavor from the meat, which I like to be the star. The pork shoulder was not terrible but very dry. The potatoes were also drenched in cheese but ice cold inside. Like they took it right from the walk-in and threw it on our table. The roast carrots were good, so I'll stop my complaint there but the rest of the order was so intensely rich, which coupled with the claustrophobia and sweltering heat, really zapped my appetite. After reviewing many of the positive comments on Yelp I noticed something that had also dawned on me whilst observing the packed crowd waiting to be seated - this place is for tourists... That is why they can get away with charging $38 for a sub-par burger. I am all about dining experiences and think that $650 for two at L'Appart in Le District is a steal considering what you get. This just isn't an experience I'd want to replicate regardless of the price.",9,1,3

82,Brian G.,"Staten Island, NY",6,58,9,2.0,3/24/2018,"I will start out by saying the whiskey steak was delicious. But that's as far as the positive part of this review goes. Forget about the price, because you get what you pay for. And it was well worth it. That being said, I'm extremely disappointed in their upper management and hostess staff, our waiter John was on the money the whole time, but the entire rest of the staff slacked and lacked restaurant professionalism, specifically the management. Their serving skills are embarrassing, especially at those prices. The hostess could not have been any ruder, most of the staff just stood up against the wall talking to each other, whoever was running the floor was nonexistent. We didn't mind paying an exorbitant price for dessert, but it would've been nice to know before hand that ice cream with truffles would have been $75. I'm far from cheap and quite generous with my clients, but I was overly embarrassed. After four rounds of drinks, they didn't even offer us a free drink or coffee. Definitely the most expensive meal per person I've ever spent. It definitely not worth it. It's sad, because the chef was a wonderful person and we really liked her. She was the whole reason we went to her restaurant.",3,2,1

88,Joshua F.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,101,18,3.0,2/8/2017,"We came here for my birthday dinner on a Tuesday evening. My excitement about this place has been brewing since the September opening, but we have been too busy to come in so this was a great opportunity to try this talented chef's menu.We had a reservation for 7 PM. The subways were fucked so we called the restaurant and told them we were running about 15 minutes behind if that's ok. The hostess said it was cool, and we went on in the taxi.When we arrived we waited about 5 minutes to be greeted at the door. The bartender indicated a hello after a few minutes and we had a laugh because we were waiting at the host stand for what seemed a long while.We then were seated at a table. We were greeted by a female server- she was nonplussed and offered us truffles. As we were waiting for our water, the music was 80's and SOO loud. I usually don't care about music but it was really odd that they were playing Aha's Take on Me repressively loud and so on and so forth throughout he meal. I don't ask to turn music down because the manager should just know what's going on.The female server came back and offered suggestions on cocktails- we ordered.We received our cocktails- it took awhile, but it seemed to be the style of service here, which didn't bother us at all.On to the menu:We ordered the cherry tart for 2, the chicken liver mousse, then the cotes du boef for 2 with the carrots and potato sides.I must say the food was really good here. I'm a fan of this female chef taking on such an institution in the city. What a badass chef that works with meats and game-y pies and such. My respect is high for a chef like this who is changing the lay-out of the typical male dominated mea-centric scene.The service after we took our order was non-existent. The server was assisted by bussers and a runner, but she never really checked in, and we had to flag her down for a glass of wine with our entrees. We would have ordered a bottle of wine but it seemed difficult to even get a glass so we decided against it. I get it that it's a Tuesday and we are not he highest check in the room because we are only two people, but why do I have to think like that?After our entrees (which we ate everything, it was so delicious), my partner wanted to get dessert to do the candle thing and we got the bone marrow creme brûlée. It was fantastic! Different and just the flavor components were delicious.All in all, we left satisfied but I'm less worried about my subpar service experience and more irritated that a FOH is not on their game as much as the chef is. This chef deserves an amazing front of house! I feel as if the FOH is disrespectful to this chef and needs to recalibrate the level of service and hospitality as the food is at such an iconic NY institution.",2,,1
89,Jonathan H.,"New York, NY",57,113,86,5.0,1/19/2016,"My review here is a  heavy reflection of those two items:Beatrice Inn 45 Day Dry Aged Burger(red wine caramelized onions, d'affinois cheese, brioche bun)READ: THIS BURGER IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!BUT BOY O' BOY WAS IT FOR ME!Wow. The best way I have been describing it to people is to imagine the consistency of best Steak Tar Tar you have ever had and then somehow keep that together while cooking it top a perfect med- rare. Even some of the people at my table looked at it (and tasted it) and were turned off by how rare it APPEARED.  That is it though, it was perfectly cooked. The consistency of the meat was like no other burger I have every had.  I simply loved it but I can see how if you aren't ready to embrace something that is different than anything else you have ever had how this could be off putting. Having said THAT, I am thinking about going back down there and grabbing a bar seat solo right now, just to have the burger. Milk Braised Pork Shoulderhen of the woods mushrooms, soubise, sageTHIS IS FOR EVERYONE!Mass appeal here as Chef Angie Mar's favorite dish does not disappoint.  This has just become my favorite piece of Milk Braised Pork Shoulder I have ever had, jumping over the Purple Pig's in Chicago (Have it if you are there!).  Nothing wrong with a piece of pork that literally falls apart and makes the Wagyu dish at the table seem tough to chew (it wasn't).Another dish I would come to have again for sure.The apps were all passable with the Scotch Egg being very good. The one low of the dinner was that our server seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but at work.  I get bad days but leave that shit at home. We were your FIRST table of the night so it's not like work was getting you down either. Just because you are a sour puss, don't bring the rest of the world down on a Friday night, bro. Caught Chef Angie Mar for 30 seconds and she was a delight.  It's how people make you feel that is important sometimes and 30 seconds with her on the way out reversed all the bad energy from our server.

Unfortunately, for an empty room, we were seated tightly next to another party, with no one to our right or beyond. It wasn't until an hour later that an enormous reserved party was seated behind us that we saw any reason for this but nevertheless seemed like poor practice. The f&b however more than made up for it. We had a few rounds of the other woman cocktail which was wickedly delicious, and ordered the salmon, pork shoulder, scallop and uni heirloom salad for the table. Everything was scrumptious, gorgeously presented, and well paced.

Then the following things occurred and we will no longer be dining at Beatrice Inn:1.  It took an hour and a half for our food to arrive.2. We let the server know that my girlfriend has a chicken allergy. One of the dishes we were served either had chicken in it or was cross contaminated with chicken because my girlfriend was in the bathroom THROWING UP before our bill arrived.3. I spoke with management and they indicated they were very sorry about what had happened and ""they would take care of us"" for our next visit. When I called to confirm the reservation, management said ""we would be required to order a salad and an entree"" at a minimum. This is very disappointing after we had already spent a lot of money on her bday dinner that had very poor service and horrible food poisoning. It feels very misleading to be told ""we will take care of you"" by the restaurant to later be required to order a minimum.

95,Chuck1e L.,"New York, NY",64,19,59,3.0,10/22/2016,"Came here for my birthday dinner and reserved the ""whiskey"" dry aged tomahawk steak. Now let me start by saying I had high expectations for this steak, being a carnivore and a whiskey drinker I figured this should be awesome. But first let me talk about the starters we got. Ordered the truffle shaved ""lamb"" tartare, didn't taste like lamb at all. Small portion compared to the chicken liver pate, about a quarter inch of ""schmootz"" (chicken fat) on top. Came with a side of berry compote and fresh ground mustard. This was probably my favorite dish of the night since it make you nostalgic of Jewish delis. We also ordered carrots and I think a potatoes pie? Both were well done, carrots still had a good crunch with a note of herbs and butter. Cheese potatoes with a crust on top came our piping hot and was very filling. Now to my week long waited and heavily anticipated main course. So this bad boy is 42oz of beef, like most tomahawks it comes with a handle bar and warning label. So excited when we got it, and the waiter make you feel special when other tables ask ""what's that"". (Fancy snob tone) ""oh that's the 120 day whisky dry aged tomahawk, they knew about it and had to reserve it in advance. You can't have that but here's your alternative of just a regular dry age steak."" Ok, so back to the meat. I really really really want to fall in love with this meat. One for the concept of combining my two favorite flavors, meat and whisky. But at last she did me wrong... 1. Couldn't taste a hint of whisky, I was looking for some type of peat wooden barrel flavor. Or at least something that told me this cow had a good time before it met the fire. 2. This was a tough SOB to chew, and I have canine incisors bred from years of meat eating. I kept gnawing on connective tissues and silver skin. We had to trade our fancy pearl handle butter knives for old fashion steak knives with teeth. 3. The price, I mean wow. I've had wagyu in Japan at comparable price and that meats in your mouth like bone marrow butter. This was nothing comparable, imagine price of regular dry aged 120 day times 2.5The main reason I'm writing the review is not to gripe but hoping my experience would help other diners have better ones. The staff was superb, attentive and charming. Mater'd came and checked on us and our waiter Josh was very knowledgeable and funny. I may come back, but I'm def skipping the whisky tomahawk.",7,1,

One of the most satisfying and hearty meals in a long time. Chef Angie Mar is passionate about what comes out of her kitchen and everything was fantastic.We started with the scotch egg and buratto cheese. Both were very good, but the entrees were the stars!We didn't know if the three of us should all get the famous 45 day aged burger so we decided to share three thing:The 45 day aged burger is a contender for the best. One third was a tease. Need to get back and have my own. It's incredible.The pot pie was also delicious. I did not pay much attention to the menu so I don't know what it is called or what was in it. Does not matter. Tender meat and topped with a pastry crust that will have you talking about this dish. That good.The last entree was recommended by our server, Elliott, who was knowledgable and welcoming, along with the whole team. It was Chef Mar's specialty which is some type of braised pork shoulder. It is absolutely delicious. It s a huge portion, along with the other entrees so come hungry.Also had the chance to meet Chef Angie Mar and she was great, even slowing down on a busy Friday night to welcome us.And she sent over a perfectly cooked winter squash!Loved this place.

97,Dennis N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,2.0,11/2/2017,"This is a tough place to review. The food is good, comes in large portions, tastes and smells fantastic. Some of the plates are appropriately priced, others are absurdly over priced.  The 160 day aged steak sells for $14/oz and comes as a 70oz serving for 3 - 4 people. That's well over $1,200 including tax and tip. Their new menu includes a $48 oyster plate (I can't recall if it's a half dozen or full dozen) which they try to sell it as homage to Hemingway. I suspect it has nothing to do with the writer, and is just a ploy to upsell to customers who like the writer. We ended up spending over $200 per person for an appetizer and entrée each, and some drinks.The real ""kick in the teeth"" in the experience though, was that once we asked to speak to the manager about an issue with the billing, he was immediately rude. The manager did not seem to want to speak to us, which I have never encountered, let alone at a restaurant that charges that much for a meal. He didn't apologise for their billing mistake, and actually became aggressive towards our group for wanting to speak to him. He claimed to have offered us a round of drinks, but if he had, it was through slurred words. By that time, we wouldn't have enjoyed staying any longer. He chose not to reduce our bill by a round of drinks as an alternative - that's his prerogative and we paid without resistance. I don't know whether he was drunk, or whether that is just his management style, but it has no place in a restaurant that charges that much for the experience.",6,2,1

Kudos on atmosphere. Cocktails were amazing, a gold-dusted, egg white based white truffle gin Big Poppa, and a smoked Manhattan whose presentation under a cut crystal dome was a delight. Food is pricey but on this visit the black kale salad with smoked capers was stunning and a huge portion. The dates were tasty but somehow didn't live up to the description. We opted for the menu pie of venison and trotters, topped with a whole lightly roasted marrow bone; and the special chicken and leek, in a lighter cream sauce. Both were tasty if over-salted (but we use very little salt at home so palates may be skewed). One would have been sufficient to share. Our neighbors on both sides were friendly and chatty. The frequent visitors to our right shared their duck, which can easily serve 4 (which at $120 is not bad per person) and was astounding: crispy skin, the meat medium-rare and moist and flavorful.

First - the upselling is so over the top it's a turn off. (and we've been to many a 4 store $$$ dinner!)   The server begins the night with his silver platter of truffles and telling us the chef recommends you add it to everything! (I'm sure she and the restaurant's accountant would love that!) - then he starts telling us about the tomahawk steak which only when I ask does he happen to mention is $700.  How transparent.   Then the bottle of wine we order is not available and naturally a bottle $20 more is suggested - a fine establishment would have given us the price of the original bottle - not a big deal - but it's the principle.  On to food - the kale salad was mediocre and super salty.    Then we shared the oxtail and the cote du boeuf..  First, the oxtail was not a dish that should have been recommended to be shared - in total - there was probably 6 ounces of actual meat in the whole dish (the rest was fat.)    The Cote du Boeuf had a funky flavor (hard to mess up steak!) - we ordered a side of roasted carrots - while it was mentioned they were roasted with some anchovies - we assumed it was a touch to add uni flavor - instead the carrots were dripping in salt and anchovies to the point that out of 5 sophisticated eaters - not one of us could finish a single carrot.All in all - the only ""good"" (and the bar was low that evening) dishes were the chicken liver pate and the burger.   They must have asked us 4 x if we wanted more wine - (no we said the first time we didn't -thank you!).Finally the waiter who had been hovering over us (since we were an early reservation & he clearly wanted to flip the table) dropped the check, then stood over us as we reviewed the bill.   Literally STOOD OVER us.   As a side note - we were seated somewhat near the bathroom and although we don't know what had happened - they must  have dumped an entire bottle of industrial sized bleach in there at some point b/c every time the door opened - our nostrils burned with chemicals.I'm completely mystified about why this place gets any love...  just the usual case of the ""Emperor has no clothes"" hot spot.   If you care about food or service - stay away.",6,3,1

Updated review","This place is amazing from start to finish. A gorgeous restaurant with a good looking crowd is always a great start. The service was fabulous from the moment we walked in the door and consistently stayed that way the entire evening.  And as for the food.... Divine. Chef Angie Mar is widely considered to be a rising star and for good reason. Believe the hype, everything we had, EVERYTHING, was nothing short of exquisite. The only reason I finally stopped eating, was because my body couldn't hold any more food.  I honestly can't even begin to describe how great an experience eating here is.  They have a devoted fan in me!!!!",,,
106,Anna C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,3.0,12/31/2016,"Food was excellent, drinks were good. But they really need to communicate their reservation policy more clearly to people.We were late for our reservation due to a train issue (totally uncontrollable) and I called twice to let them know, they didn't mention their policy of only holding tables for 15 minutes, so when we got there we couldn't sit in the main room and had to sit in the bar! It was a birthday dinner so we were very disappointed about that.  I understand the policy, but my issue is that they absolutely should emphasize this if people call and say they will be late. That way people can decide what they want to do (we could have gone elsewhere), rather than show up and be annoyed and feel forced into eating there.",2,,
107,Maria D.,"New York, NY",97,82,9,5.0,1/8/2017,"This place is amazing! ...and I'm saying this after only coming in for drinks. I decided to check The Beatrice Inn out after seeing a video of their smoking Manhattans. How could I not??? So last night during the snow storm was the perfect night to see what was what with these drinks. I was not disappointed. The presentation of the drinks was fantastic. How often are you served a drink on a dish with a glass cover that is filling with smoking rosemary??? The presentation was phenomenal. the only disappointing part of the Manhattan was that it was not as smokey tasting as I had hoped it would be, but that's ok. I went on to order two more drinks (Purple Rain), so clearly I was not dismayed. I only stayed for drinks on this visit, but I will definitely be back again for dinner! A couple things to note about The Beatrice Inn. 1.) The entrance is hard to find (I almost walked into an apt building). When facing the building, it's to the right of the sign and down the stairs. 2.) The atmosphere is dark and romantic. Great for a snowy date night. 3.) It gets crazy packed! We got there around 6 and the bar was practically empty besides maybe 4 other people. But by the time we left around 7:30 - 7:45, it was totally packed.

109,Karen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",248,9,2,5.0,9/12/2016,"Wow, what can I say? This place is such a classic NYC spot with a hugely modern twist. You can tell that a lot of thought and care is going into this establishment from top to bottom. The ambiance is low light with late night hip hop tunes and amazing cocktails, try the Gin & Yuz! Then you eat the food... omg this new duck they are spinning is out of control. But before you get to the duck try the carpaccio. If you have any room in your stomach the pineapple glacée is the way to finish the meal! Damn!You also might see a celebrity or two so bonus!",5,,1
110,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",193,212,4275,5.0,11/7/2016,"Beatrice Inn is a cozy West Village chophouse that's headed up by Chef Angie Mar, who made her bones under April Bloomfield and other big time chefs before striking out with her own meat-centric restaurant. Actually, you may recall an earlier experience I had with her food at Meatopia last year.  She was roasting wild boar that day, and it was delicious.Just thinking about the fucking awesomeness of that day again gives me a chubby... If you haven't seen it, jump out to that link above and scroll through some of the pics. It was a meat eater's heaven.Anyway I've decided to treat this review as a kind of ""sneak peak,"" since I know with a high degree of certainty that I will be back again in the near future to try other items, and also to make sure my wife tries what I consider to be one of the best dishes in the city (I hope the suspense is killing you).Another caveat I will mention here: I was struggling with whether to categorize this as a steakhouse or just a standard restaurant that happens to be very meat-centric. You'd think that after rating over 100 steakhouses and 60 steaks at non-steakhouses, I'd have a better grip on this shit. But Beatrice Inn is a different kind of joint, and it threw me for a loop because it's not just about the beef; it showcases a shitload of variety in terms of animal proteins. It may not matter to avid readers who actually pay attention to my words over the numbers, but squeezing this review into my ranking system yields an artificially low score due to the constraints of my imperfect ranking system. Another reason I decided to treat this as a steakhouse is because what Chef Angie is doing is pretty unique, and she's kicking some serious ass in a world that's heavily dominated by male chefs. Now, you know me: I'm not one to get all ""women's lib"" when talking about female chefs, but aside from Ruth Fertel (founder of Ruth's Chris), she's really the only other woman that comes to mind who owns/operates a restaurant that is almost 100% meat, steak, animal carcass, etc.Last caveat: I was dining with a large group of people when I came here, most of whom I did not know very well, so I would have felt awkward taking my time shooting photos of everything the way I normally do. No one wants to eat cold food! Next time I will make sure the photos are more numerous and better quality.So let's (finally) get down to business...Flavor: 8This flavor score is an average score between ONLY the two cuts of beef that we tried; the 60-day dry aged cote de boeuf, and the 20-day dry aged wagyu hanger steak. It does not include the other items we tried, like the duck and pork shoulder, which I discuss below in the ""other meats"" section. Once I return to try more beef items, this score is likely to shift upward, since I saved one item that I really want to sink my teeth into for when I return with my wife (the 127-day whisky dry aged tomahawk rib eye, as seen on The Meat Show).But anyway, back to the delicious shit we actually did try.First the cote de boeuf:This was served with roasted garlic, marrow, blistered blackberries, charred prawn butter and thyme. It had a really unique woody, smoky, charred flavor to it that grew on me as I continued eating. I had never really tasting anything like it before. It was well-rested and cooked to a beautiful medium rare with minimal grey-banding and hardly any myoglobin ""bleed out.""Since we shared this with a table of seven, we asked the kitchen to slice it up, which they gladly did for us.While there wasn't much spinalis dorsi (fat cap) on this cut, I didn't really expect it due to the long dry-aging time. Remember: dry-aging beef causes it to lose nearly 30% of its weight, and then you have to trim the bark off, which, unfortunately, sometimes happens at the sacrifice of some cap meat.The real star of our beef entrees was this 20-day dry aged wagyu hanger steak. It seems that this was the table favorite for the beef.Dedicating less time to aging this cut is smart, since the hanger itself isn't very big to begin with; any longer and you may risk having to trim off too much bark. Also, with a cut like hanger, which is normally pretty well-marbled to begin with, you are really doubling down on the intensification of flavor that you get from the dry aging process. The result for this cut is amazing. It's one of the best hanger steaks I've had. It was super tender and juicy, and perfectly cooked. The beef flavor really stands out here as well, since it was wisely prepared in a more simple manner, with shallot butter and thyme. After all, they don't call this cut the ""butcher's steak"" without good reason!you can read the rest of this review on my website - it's much longer with tons of detail.",3,,

114,Josh A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,3/31/2017,"We arrived for our 9:15 reservation right on time and I was told that my table had been given away because I didn't call the restaurant to confirm. When I made the reservation these instructions were not given to me and nobody from the restaurant called me to confirm. The hostess was really quite mean about it despite it clearly being the restaurants fault. She said, ""just go stand in the bar"" and left it at that. She then told us we would get the next table and then we watched her seat two more parties before us.We finally sat down around 10pm. We went to order the ""Butcher's block"" steak to share for the table, but I thought to ask what the price was before we sent our waiter off with the order. He told us and we just started to laugh. It was $770 for a 70 ounce tomahawk steak ($11/ounce). The sommelier brought over a bottle of wine that was different from what I ordered because they were out of it and he found something similar. I asked him what the price was and he seemed put off a bit as he didn't know the answer. I said ""your waiter just told me the steak was $770, so hopefully you can excuse me for being curious about the price of this bottle!"" We ended up getting burgers (a steal at a mere $38/each) which were pretty solid but not as good as the Black Label burger at Minetta, which I happily pay $33 for. We also very clearly ordered tap water but then saw a $24 water charge on our bill at the end of the evening, and got a little bit of an attitude when we asked them to remove it as they informed us that they had been pouring us bottled still water.The vibe in the bar room here is quite nice and the food, while overpriced, is actually pretty tasty if not a bit too heavy. However, I haven't been treated so poorly at a restaurant in all of my 13 years living in New York City. It's as if the owner here has instructed his staff to treat people like crap to try to set the tone that they should feel privileged to be inside, not unlike the old Beatrice Inn nightclub where you were likely to be told ""sorry, private party"" by the doorman when you showed up. Do yourself a favor and go to Minetta Tavern or Chumley's if you want this kind of food/vibe in the west village but prefer to be treated like a human.",5,,

So it started off great, but after we sat at the table for 20 minutes after ordering drinks from the bar, I began to have my doubts. I had the aged beef burger which was really good, but the service was so slow. I don't mind taking my time with a meal, but give me a drink, some bread, or even a saltine cracker.

116,Emily V.,"Chatham, NJ",1,2,0,1.0,3/28/2017,"Keeping this short and simple - We ordered the Tomahawk steak, and what we received was a large concentration of fat rather than meat.

The hostess was pleasant and seated us right away. Our waiter walked us through all the options and seemed super enthusiastic about the food. To start we had the yellowtail  carpaccio and the black kale salad. The kitchen also sent out the IPA battered dates for us to try. All of the above were amazing. The yellowtail was fresh and light, the battered dates with boar had a delicious mustard sauce which was amazing, and the kale salad was tasty as well.Before our mains the kitchen also sent us potatoes au gratin with truffles! These potatoes were the stand out of the evening for me. Creamy with a crisp, browned crust on top.For our mains, we had the 45 day dry aged burger and the champvallon de tete, along with herbed truffle fries. All were outrageous, the burger was cooked to perfection and my friend couldn't stop raving about her entree (beef cheek). We passed on dessert as we were so full and still had plenty of fries to bring home.At the end of the meal, I happened to see chef in the dining room and got to thank her for the wonderful food/evening.Service, ambiance and food were all exemplary.

The app we had was a special of the night which came with ramps, smoked butter, and a duck egg on toast. I'm not sure if the egg wasn't fresh or if the smoked butter was too rich but it kept me tossing and turning  all night since I felt uncomfortably bloated. I don't have a sensitive stomach so something must have been off. However, our entrees were solid. I had the scottish salmon which came with a crispy skin and my boyfriend and the 45 day aged burger which was one of the best burgers that I've had. We also got a side of the roasted carrots which were randomly delicious and had a nice rosemary flavor. We got the chocolate cake for dessert and it was pretty awful.

Updated review","Used to live a block away and loved coming here (after they replaced the initial chef after reopening). Having been away from NYC for 8 months, came back for my gfs birthday for dinner. They had taken salmon off the menu (why we all came instead of waverly), had no New Zealand Sauvignon blanc (another couple was complaining at the bar about the wine menu as well), and the service was bad. When asking for the halibut medium rare (which we did not want but it was the only fish option to be had at all), we were told the chef refuses (with no apology authentic or phony, just a no, you cannot). When asking to substitute bacon for something else, we were told the chef refuses. Also no appetizers anyone wanted, so we all ordered the same mediocre, generic kale salad.It seems the chef has a real complex and it's hurting the dining experience (as exemplified by the fact that the place was not nearly as busy as it used to be). Once the halibut came out and it was literally too tough to cut through, we asked could we please send it back and have it done less well, nonetheless came for a birthday and they did absolutely nothing (i.e. Not even happy birthday mention), nor would permit us to order the fish we did not want anyway to cook less well done (two of us spent over $300 total for the miserable experience and there were six of us total, so a decent bill in a vacant basement venue in summer). I will return ONLY once the chef had been replaced.Such a shame (I should note that the couple that ordered the chicken liked the chicken, but they also saw no app that they wanted, nor did our friend who also was stuck with the halibut enjoy hers - she also mentioned salmon and other dishes being on their online menu that were not actually offered - or see an app that she wanted)",3,,
134,Alexandra E.,"New York, NY",1,8,2,4.0,5/4/2017,"I have been to Beatrice twice in the past month. Each experience has been pleasant. Food is good, but very rich - lamb tartare is my favorite. I recommend ordering family style. Drinks are great as well - I really like the Oaxacan Smash. Atmosphere is cozy, music - has been 80s/90s, but it really works for the environment. Only thing that I think could improve is the service (hair in food first time/rushed hostess second time).I will definitely be back.",,,1

136,Nestor P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,0,2.0,2/7/2016,"Notwithstanding a very great burger our dinner was a big disappointment. Perhaps it was the high expectation we arrived with, after reading some of these yelp reviews, and our penchant for rustic old world west village spots with history (i.e. Waverley Inn, Chumleys) that set the bar high...or maybe this place is just a schizophrenic mess. We were told the bar would be open at 530. We walked in at 527, because it was freezing outside, and the hostess suggested that we leave and come back. For real. Upon realizing we weren't keen on going back outside she motioned for us to sit at the bar and unapologetically explained the bar wouldn't be opened on time.Then the music started. Probably the playlist of someone on staff more appropriate for a pool hall...think I heard Nirvana or something like it, but a total clash with the atmosphere of this beautiful bar and fireplace. We wondered how it could be possible no manager on staff would correct this. We are taken to our table in the back zebra room, something this tacky and flamboyant Id expect in a trendy cuban restaurant on south beach. Ok, someone's on crack with a lot of money and a terrible esthetic. Moreover, the room was freezing and had to be herded back to the bar area where we were ignored for awhile and then we just seated ourselves.But the food was great.",5,2,1

Both the ""manager"" and the lady that seated us gave attitude from the minute we walked in the door and it appeared that everyone there hates their job.

Anyway we'd finished our food and went outside for a cigarette only to meet, what can only be described as a clinically insane member of staff. Her male friends saw my friends dog in her bag (who was also visible in the restaurant and at one stage attempted to walk over to the hostess so she was not hidden) and came over to pet her and lavish some attention on her. Said employee was not happy attention was no longer on her and boy did she let us know. She went off on one ""how dare you bring a dog into a restaurant"", ""what type of ppl are you"" etc etc she then stormed into the restaurant and told the manager. AT FULL PITCH in front of all the other diners; ""either those two bitches leave or I do"". I'm not even merely exaggerating this story. She stormed out. Manager came to speak to us, clearly taking her side at which point my friend showed him the dogs service badge.Profuse apologies started, admittance that said staff member was crazy and was to be fired etc. The only attempt to make up for this excruciatingly embarrassing situation was a glass of wine on the house.Poor response, insane staff, ok food....

My butt was straddling two cushions. My boyfriend got up to politely ask the hostess if we could be moved to a table in the dining room. She said all the tables were ""committed."" He said we had a reservation. She mumbled she would see what she could do.5 minutes later she tossed a drink menu at me on the table, and made no eye contact.We walked out. Walked out. Never done that before. We aren't picky diners. This is the first time we've ever asked to move tables at a restaurant.

The huge problem was that the restaurant charged different prices on the check vs what appeared on the menu.  We were uncharged on the steak $7 more and $4 more on the glasses of wine; such small increases - wonder how often they do that with other customers. Ironically, a food blogger just posted the same incident happened to them two weeks ago.  Terrible experience. Had to send back our waiter twice to amend the charges.  The restaurant was unfazed by this - not even a manager stopped by to apologize. So embarrassing.",6,1,

Ordered sole for 2, it came out very greasy and salty, definitely not worth the money. Expected so much more from this place especially in NYC where the competition is very high. If you are already there, you are better off hanging by the bar and going to another restaurant. Would not come back and would not recommend. There are so many other places where you can have a much better experience.",3,,

I didn't know whether to casually smile every time the woman at the table next to mine stole my napkin or just let it go. We were the first people in the restaurant and they sat us just behind the hostess stand and next to the fireplace. The hostess was new and this was obviously her first night as the awkward and much older sommelier was grabbing at her and attempting small talk between itching his crotch. Have some couth, you're at the front of the restaurant. I didn't know whether to offer the poor girl help or wait for the team from 20/20 ""to catch a predator"" swoop in.Our table by the fireplace seemed perfect at first but within 20 minutes we were removing layers of clothing. I didn't know a hot yoga session was included with the meal. We asked the hostess if she could lower the flame and even with it barely on, the whole space felt like a sauna.Our server, Derek, hovered our table like we were going to dine and dash. I asked him several times, as he came creeping by, telling us the specials for the millionth time, if we were holding up his table and he'd smile, roll his eyes and walk away. Take a hint...The special for the evening was the chefs ""famous"" pork shoulder. Save yourself the disappointment and $50 as it was all fat and oddly chewy.I got the burger and while it wasn't the most expensive burger on the menu, Derek kept pushing the expensive burger, even after I ordered, like a used car salesman. For dessert, the caramel creme brûlée was watery and cold just beneath the oddly thin shell. I ordered the chocolate cake hoping that would save dessert but the tiny sliver of cake did not resemble the outrageous price. The only appeal of this place is the location and random star sightings but this is NYC. If you're looking for good food and a memorable experience, I suggest you keep looking.",10,11,3

The bar was deafeningly loud and while we were waiting over a half hour for our reserved table, we had to also put up with blaring  music in the bar (which the chef requires, we were told). And then the noisy bar crowd moved on to the dining room so we never got much relief from their voices  while we dined.  Definitely not a pleasant evening; One suggestion:  maybe they could use some of their hefty (I assume) profits to have the building repainted!  In fairness I should say that the reservations woman  and the sommelier-service manager were extremely pleasant if not productive!",2,,

Transcendent 60 Day Dry Aged Cote De Boeuf, Kansas, with blackberries, was our crispy, meaty, fatty, main course (fine to share). Delicious Romaine & Spring Herb Salad with dill dressing, and Herbed Truffle Fries, to go with: both disappeared quickly. Dessert was some sort of crazy bananas and ice cream with wine from the 1980's poured over. Can't seem find it on online to give you the proper name, but also delicious. Bottle of South African cabernet. A very special Father's Day dinner from my lovely wife. Had been on my bucket list for years (cocktails only visits several times before). Wait staff very professional/friendly/accommodating (my wife has Celiac disease, and we had no difficulties/experienced no attitude). Yes, it's expensive, but worth it.

We decided on one of the soft cheeses, which we couldn't hear the name of as it was a little loud around us.  When the cheese arrived it included three pieces of toast, which we finished quite easily with the first half of the cheese.  We needed to ask for a second order of toast in order to eat the second half of the cheese (how else were we supposed to eat it?). So when the check came we were surprised to see that not only was the cheese $65, but then they charged us an additional $3 for the second order of bread!  I wish I would have taken a picture of it.I eat out quite frequently and have an idea of what restaurants charge, so we were a bit surprised by the price of the cheese...I would have expected $40 dollars (ish)as it wasn't that big, nor did the waiter offer what the price was as he brought the tray to our table.But to then be charged an additional $3 on top of the $65 just felt like the restaurant was nickel and dining us for what could have been a very special evening.   Sorry to say that such a small detail had such a big effect on our dining experience.",5,1,1

Our hostess was very rude. When she asked how everything was our only negative comment was that the carrots were undercooked. They were roasted but crunchy. She said ""that's how the chef makes them, maybe you've never been to a restaurant before!"".  Maybe we let it slide but she keeps on about the carrots as the table was cleared.

Recently dined here Saturday night and I will not be returning simply because of the terrible staff.From the hostess to the sommelier - I have never experienced such terrible service. The hostess was outrageously inept. She sat a party of 5 people at a table that was so tight we had to notify the manager and have our seating changed. Additionally the sommelier made numerous horrible wine suggestions and was  a total snob when we explained what we were looking for.The only redeeming factor was the food -- which was delicious but the experience was truly ruined by the WORST SERVICE EVER.Will not be returning and I urge readers to explore the other delicious restaurants in the area - do not waste your time here.

An overpriced scallop crudo, less then one scallop sliced thinly with the precision of a drunken idiot was sloppily placed on a plate smothered with olive oil and a few micro greens.  A huge disappointment for a $16 appetizer that took 75 minutes. Then came the $38 skirt steak, a traditionally cheap cut, cooked simply with a cherry reduction which while reasonably tasty did not impress. The small portion of meat was smothered entirely with butter in a failed effort to hide the complete absence of culinary talent. The portion was small and for that price the cooks (a chef would not be the appropriate title here) should have selected finer ingredients. In fact, the whole menu consisted of poor ingredients including pork, chicken, and chicken liver appetizers in an almost vulgar display of an in your face ripoff. For good eats go elsewhere.",13,2,1

The restaurant and bar are beautiful and nice for a date, but it looks like they can seat larger parties, too. I really enjoyed my dishes (and my friends dishes!), especially the pork shoulder, halibut and the dry aged burger (a splurge at $38 but WHOA it's worth experiencing, absolutely rivals Minetta, even surpasses if you want to take it there). The starters are delicious too, I loved the beet and smoked ricotta salad and the fig/leek tart (the crust is rich and flavorful). Keeping with the elevated comfort/classics theme at dessert, the bourbon creme brulee is haunting my dreams and the apple-sage pie is delicious. Dining aside, I wish the wine list were more approachable. I know they're trying to appeal to a certain clientele, but if you're like most people, it's almost impossible to order a bottle and not strain your budget. I really believe a talented beverage director can create a list with a variety of nice wines and price points, not just wines to impress your date. Can we update this Beatrice??",3,3,1

193,May Y.,"New York, NY",55,42,0,1.0,1/12/2013,"The interior has the same look and feel as the Waverly Inn - not a big surprise.  The bar area has very low ceilings and can get very loud, warm and claustrophobic -- expect anyone taller than 6'3'' to hunch over.  It is trendy and you will be amongst a hip crowd - maybe even a have a celebrity sighting or two.  But that and the decor are probably the only things this place has to offer. Food and service, which are the core of what a restaurant should be about are a freakin JOKE.  We had a 9:45pm reservation on a Friday night and did not get seated until 10:15.  Fine.  Whatever. Then as soon as we sit down the sommelier knocks my head over with his elbows and gives a half-ass apology.  My head is throbbing and he actually thinks it's funny...says he'll ""make it up"" to me, which was mere lip service.  Not even a glass of wine on the house for taking a hit. And the food.  I mean - trust me, I went it to it with absolutely no expectations because of all the bad Yelp reviews, but this was beyond.  We ordered:* Shrimp cocktail - more like a shrimp salad, four pieces of medium sized shrimp smothered in an oily cocktail sauce like dressing and cherry tomatoes. *Wedge salad - literally half of a whole romaine with (again) cherry tomatoes, blue cheese, sliced picked onions and croutons which were basically their dried, stale bread with no seasoning* Farro kale risotto - DISGUSTING.  Just a plate of what looks like barely cooked farrow swimming in runny, heated up cream and shaved parmesan.  There was nothing  that even slightly resembled a risotto.  They probably threw in 3-4 little pieces of kale, so for all of us kale fans, it was a huge disappointment. ** Amish chicken - BLOODY - we cut the chicken into four pieces as we were going to share.  The center was not cooked and actually had some bloody parts.  We sent it back expecting a newly cooked chicken. They literally just took the same four pieces that we sent back, reheated it and brought it back to us.  I took one bite and put my fork down - it was way overcooked, dry and salty.** Fries - crispy but way too salty - we had to send them back also.  So finally the dining room dies down and we ask to speak to the manager.  I bring to his attention the chicken incident and the getting elbowed HARD in the head.  He just looks with a pompous, blank face and at the end goes, ""would that be all?""  They took the fries and chicken off the bill -- as they absolutely should -- but we did not receive any apologies or even an attempt to make us happier with the usual dessert offer or a round of drinks.   We still spent $250 before tip between four of us and left hungry and sober.Seriously appalled at our experience.  Every one of us at the table agreed that they're going to have to turn things around or this place ought to go out of business soon.",27,7,2
194,Lela R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,49,10,5.0,9/24/2014,"My friends and I accidentally discovered this place on a search to look for a friend! When we walked downstairs, we were greeted by the most energetic and well dressed man! His energy was contagious! We definitely headed right on in and to the bar. The bartender made some pretty good drinks. He definitely knows what he's doing! The restaurant had a staff full of amazing looking men who were also extremely kind! We stayed for an hour or two, bought a few rounds of drinks and then headed out! I will definitely come back to this place for a drink on a mellow Saturday night and even a bite to eat! The menu looked really good!Cons- The bar area is extremely tight. This wouldn't be the ideal place for a large group.  But it's intimate enough to bring a friend to catch up with or a first date.",,,
195,Jun H.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",4,1,1,5.0,3/20/2014,"So good. Ever since their new exec. chef, Angie Mar, took over the food has been just excellent. Fun and seasonal, definitely learn about the specials as those are always what keep me coming back. Also it's such a great spot, glad it was revived as a dining experience. I've had power meetings, romantic meals, and also Sunday evenings are now a fun little secret hangout. If you chat up the manager he can probably fill you in.",1,,2
196,Patty A.,"Yonkers, NY",1,8,4,4.0,10/4/2015,Beautiful place. I loved the atmosphere the music was nicely mixed. The dessert was deliicciouussss I enjoyed that part so much. The charcuterie dish was great the steak tartare was my fave out of that dish. All around had a great meal.,,,
197,Jamie B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,17,0,2.0,4/19/2016,"Great Reception, bar service, and drinks. We were very impressed by the host who managed to find a table for us on short notice, and who checked in with multiple members of our party afterwards as well. Unimpressive showing on the 48-day aged burger as well as overall service.If The Beatrice Inn wishes to live up to expectations, it needs to improve its table service. There are two burgers on the menu (one priced at $24, the other at 38$). We were told that the 24$ burger was sold out, and so the only burger option was the higher priced burger. I would think that a busy restaurant would be prepared for a Saturday night rush, and felt that I had almost been scammed into ordering the more expensive dish. After our orders were placed, the server informed us that there would be a wait, and so we *should* order appetizers, adding to the feeling of being pressured to order more than I wanted to eat. This didn't strike me as being appropriate to a well reviewed New York restaurant. With the wait in mind, however, I asked if I could have the fries that would have come with the burger as an appetizer.  The answer was a flat out ""no"" (perhaps another pressure tactic to get me to order the truffle fries appetizer?), with no apology or explanation. When the burger arrived, it was very good. The patty and toppings were delicious, as was the brioche bun. The fries were cold, and the ketchup probably came from a Heinz can. I don't mean to be nitpicky here, but if you're going to charge 38$ for a burger, the whole plate should be spectacular--it's part of the feature gourmet burger experience. I have had similarly priced feature burgers at other restaurants which were actually better, and had the benefit of touches liked herbed fries with homemade ketchup etc.To be completely fair, I should also note that my companions had the pan roasted chicken and the pork shoulder, and both were impressed with the quality of their dishes. As good as my burger (itself) and their dishes were, we all agreed that we would not be returning to the Beatrice Inn anytime soon.",3,,

199,Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",212,574,10,2.0,11/25/2012,"As I have fond memories of summer 2008, the re-opening of the beatrice is something I (along with countless others) have been in eager anticipation for.  We live across the street, so along with cluny being next door, I was thrilled that we'd have two classic spots on our block.  Back in Sept, we were calling incessantly, trying to find out when they'd open up for reservations/the general public (at times we debated going in person, to see if we could get in or make a resi, but never actually did..).  My boyfriend passed by walking the dogs one night, and saw that yes, it was now open to the public, so we made reservations for the following week (they only take them one week in advance, which is great, as clearly anyone would be able to get in at any time, and with large parties, it's usually a nightmare to get a big table at a non obscenely early or late hour).  We made reservations for 6, at 8:45 pm the upcoming saturday night, and while we didn't know what to expect food wise as there is no online menu, we had high hopes (especially given the chef coming from per se), and knew we'd at least have great company.I was surprised the space goes so far back, as its underneath an apartment building, so much more spacious than I'd imagined.  We walked through the entire place to our table in the far back room, and the lit fireplaces were perfect for the freezing weather.Our hostess was sweet enough to snap one photo with a friends camera phone, and I tried to shove my camera at her from the far end of the table, as she'd said photos aren't permitted (so clearly was going to be the only one accommodating photography), but unfortunately she got away before she heard me.We asked our server to take a photo, who adamantly refused (not politely), saying it was against policy, so naturally I had to say the hostess was kind enough to take one, but likely that went unheard as well....they have no cocktail menu, and none of us had a chance to even look at the wine list prior to being rushed to order drinks.  As everyone clearly wanted to take a look at the wines, I told him I would need a minute, which he acknowledged, but still lurked there, expecting everyone else to order our bottles without looking at the list first.  One of my friends was certain he recognized the guy, and needless to say, none of us were too pleased with his service throughout the meal.I ordered the halibut, as did another friend (who shared it with his boyfriend), boyfriend ordered the scallops, as did another friend, one got the chicken, and also a margarita at one point which was apparently horrid.  My fish, sadly, was pretty horrid as well.  Very dry, tough, and not very well cooked (meaning not cooked well, as it was certainly overdone rather than under).  Also, there were no substitutions to be had, but I did ask for it without almonds (as honestly there was little on the menu that appealed to me, both entrees and apps, and everything that accompanied the fish were things I wouldn't choose to order).  One friend may have liked her chicken (can't recall), and the scallops got a ""so-so"" all around.Pros - location, decor, hostess, fireplaces..and the fact they didn't rush us, aside from the wine ordering, at any point throughout the meal.Cons - listed above, the service, lack of cocktail menu, lacking food quality...I certainly hope it shapes up in the near future, as I'd love to return, if only for cocktails, but alas, without a cocktail menu, that won't be likely to happen...",11,1,1
