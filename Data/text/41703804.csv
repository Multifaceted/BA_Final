0,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",209,93,335,5.0,10/12/2018,"Came here for business lunch Thursday around noon. The ambiance is classy with a modern, chic twist. Dim lighting, spacious area, bright red leather couches, white linens. Feels upscale. A nice treat for a date, business meal, or a friend gathering.The service was superb. Our waiter was very helpful with menu recommendations. Our water glasses remained filled to the brim at all time. To boot, all waiters, male and female, were ridiculously good looking. Super Model level. It was oddly distracting. Customer service requires a level of affability, so it's expected that your waiting staff would be likable. It was my first time, however, seeing such distinct face control standards at a restaurant. Now about the food. The prices are on the higher side, but are in the heart of midtown, top tourist area. Plus, the food quality definitely was worth it. They receive all their fish fresh every morning, so going with a fish dish will never disappoint. For appetizers, we got skillet fried shishito peppers ($17) and honey goat cheese flatbread ($18). The peppers were served in a skillet and were full of flavor. Very tender. Perfect texture. All shishito pepper lovers will appreciate this dish. Undoubtedly the highlight for everyone at the table was the flatbread. The soothing contrast of the crunchy and soft and savory and sweet was on point. The sweetness of the honey paired perfectly with the savory cheese and warm bread. Very distinct flavor. Seems like drizzling honey over fresh dough and melted cheese is a fool proof move. We devoured this pie, which resembled pizza Definitely get this while you're here! This place has rocking burgers, so that's always a good choice if you're torn between options. Salads are huge-especially if you order toppings such as shrimp or fish, you'll be looking at a ginormous plate that you'll likely have trouble finishing.I got Halibut ($30) with cauliflower leek pure, sherry vinaigrette, and bean ragu. Wow--every element on my plate was perfectly executed. The fish was one of the best you can get in the city. You could taste it's freshness. Pristine white color, delicate fillet that was falling apart at the grain after the slightest touch, tender texture. Perfectly seasoned to highlight the taste of the fish. The crunchy shell was a treat to bite into and hear that slightly perceivable snap of the top coat of seasoning that was masterfully pan fried. The cauliflower leek pure was a heavenly cloud of flavor. The fluffy, creamy texture was out of this world. Give me an entire bowl of that delicious goodness! The bean ragu in tomato sauce pairing was unexpected but it worked really well with the fish and the pure, adding a very pronounced, earthy kick to the delicate pure and halibut. Enjoyed every single element of this dish and licked my plate clean. Branzino ($26) with grilled vegetable couscous and Roasted organic chicken ($27) with truffles parsnip pure, cauliflower, and carrots were some of the table favorites as well. Both looked and tasted spectacular, so highly recommend trying those as well. The portions of the aforementioned three dishes looked medium to small at a first glance. Maybe because they were served on humongous white plates, which usually makes the food look smaller in comparison. But they were very filling and each one of us had trouble finishing our meal. We didn't have space for dessert, even though dessert wine and cocktail selection looked very enticing. Overall, a solid option for any kind of meal when you're feeling like treating yourself to something nice. Enjoyed my experience and will be back again!",1,,

He made us feel very special like the queens we are. Tourist numero dos here. 5 stars for NYC's best server Handsome Nick M. Also here's a shout out to manager Chelsea the ""not model"" but she SHOULD BE!Tourist #3. ITS MY BIRTHDAY!!! But that aside, this place is da bomb. The creme brûlée - wow. I hated the purgatory eggs (aptly named), but Chelsea took care of it for me. Handsome Nick M is cute as hell. Order the crab mac and cheese. Mike drop. Tourist #4. Look, it's tough being the last act. Tourist number 1,2 and 3 made some excellent points, but I'm not sure they got across the true Personification of handsome Nick M, the true maverick of bottomless drinks, protector of virgin virtue, and a gifted thespian. He seemed really into us, but you never know with these actor types. Either way, I raise my monocle in his honor. Top. Drawer.",,1,1

3,Jay G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",49,126,425,4.0,9/19/2018,"Gorgeous, yet pricey midtown Manhattan bar and restaurant. Can't lie though, food was delicious & drinks were on point. Our crew of 9 ordered:A tower of oysters (everyone said they were great)The burger (good)The lobster roll (great but not as filling as it should be)The short rib pappardelle (amazing. Mutiple people had bites of my pasta and I still left full and smiling)The sliders (solid)The lamb chops (devoured in seconds. Could've used an extra chop tho)Our original bartender was great. Shout out to Cara. When she left, this nervous looking guy (didn't get his name) took over serving us for the most part (altho all bartenders will get you drinks). He was cool tho and seemed less anxious once we started talking about the Yankees. Shout out to him for not making a fuss about taking the creme brulee off the bill (check in gets you a free dessert).I don't go to many midtown spots near MSG with prices like this, but I gotta give props when the food is good and the drinks are tight. I might be back for a Knicks pregame session",2,,

It was private, spacious, and comfortable.Looking over the menu we decide that we are going to split a bunch of apps, and Mom and Brother got some main courses too.The apps:1) Butternut Squash and Honey Ravioli- Incredible2) Babaganoush- Delicious, with awesome bread and chive cream cheese toSpread.3) Elote Corn Dip- This was just alright, weakest of the apps in our book.4) Honey Goat Cheese Flatbread- Awesome, super flavorful and delicious.5) Veggie Burger- Didn't try itThis was a very wonderful experience. The waiters kept coming over to fill the water. Check in with us. Even take a picture for us and we all had a wonderful time.5 stars. The way a restaurant should run!",1,,

7,Winny L.,"New York, NY",23,140,1440,4.0,7/1/2018,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner celebration! We had a fairly large group and made reservations (make sure you do for big parties). We were seated in the main dining area with a long table. Wow, the bar is nice too and plenty of tv screens with all sports channels on. Overall the service was great and luckily not too busy that evening with other parties. Choose the beverage of your choice...malbec for me to start off the evening. :)  Appetizers to share included: charred spanish octopus, blue crab mac & cheese, ten spiced wings, korean ribs, elote ""street corn"" dip,parma flatbread and sausage & pepper pizza.  Entrees: Bershire pork chop, Monfish osso buco, lobster roll w/ chips(mmmm delicious - highly recommend), bucatina & clams, short rib papparadelle, kickerbockers (3 sliders), Penn6 Burger, branzinoHad a little issue with the short rib papparadelle -4 ppl ordered this dish and only 1 person had an ok amount of short rib. One person complained about lack of short rib and the manager remedied, but the other 2 people didn't (only complained at the table amongst friends...but they should have raised the issue as they didn't enjoy their dinner w/ a lack of short rib). Maybe it all the short rib went onto 1 persons plate...dunno. Hopefully not an issue next time.Sides: Sweet corn puree (delicious), spicy broccolini and sriracha roasted cauliflowerDessert: Yelp check in: 1 free dessert for the table...it was the strawberry shortcake.

The peppers and octopus are 2 of my favorites! The vegetable pot with coconut curry broth is delicious and perfect on a cold night. They make a great Manhattan too!

Small, fresh and the fruity/spicy vinaigrette was delicious! Blue crab Mac and cheese was a bit too filling but still very tasty. The corn bread was my favorite. Typically when you think corn bread you think dense, thick and filling... not this one. It was perfect, airy and I need to learn how to make it at home. The micheladas were good as well. Not the best but still fairly good.",,,
12,Scott M.,"Morris, IL",0,31,21,5.0,11/16/2018,Great atmosphere!   Get yourself a reservation before you go.   The bar has a good beer and whiskey selection. Try the cheesesteak egg rolls as an appetizer they are delicious,,,
13,Lena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,149,88,5.0,2/6/2018,"WOW! Where do I start! This place was amazing! I started with a old fashioned which was superb. We had a group of 5 so we got several dishes. All of which were amazing.Maplebrook burrata- amazing. Fresh cheese on top of perfectly flavored drives tomatoes. Only down side is that there wasn't enough bread to scoop up all the goodness. Yellowfin tuna tartare- delicious!  Highly recommend! I will be dreaming about this. And the plantains were a great touch. Blue crab mac & cheese- you really can't go wrong. It was decadent and everything you want from a nearby $20 mac and cheese. Skillet fired shishito peppers- good but if there was anything I could pass on out of what we got it would be these. Bacon Brussels- so good! If you are looking to add a little bit of greens to your meal this is a great addition. And who doesn't like bacon! I got the lobster roll which was great and very large! It came with house made potato chips which were pretty salty Others in my group got the New York strip and really enjoyed it as well as the pork chop which was definitely the largest entree portion at our table. If you think wow this group could t eat more, well you're wrong. We had dessert. Chocolate lava cake was good but a little smaller and less gooey than we expected. S'mores Sunday was beyond belief amazing and I want this in my life all the time. It was all types of glorious. Just get it okay. The trio of sorbet was also refreshing and delightful. Now please excuse me while I go hibernate in my food coma forever.",2,1,
14,Simon R.,"Manhattan, NY",212,93,140,5.0,6/29/2018,"Absolutely love Pennsylvania 6. They offer a 2 hour bottomless brunch which comes with one entree that costs $17 dollars or less, and your choice of: Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Aperol Spritz, or Bellini.My favorite item on the brunch menu is the chicken and waffles. The chicken is not your typical (chicken wings or thighs) that is served in the south. Here, it's served as chicken breast and fresh Belgian waffles. I loved the Bloody Mary as my drink of choice. The specialty drinks are quite refreshing as well, especially the Penn Sixer. I highly recommend anyone who like tequila to try this, you won't regret it !They also have a raw bar but I've only tried the oysters. Definitely recommend the West Coast one's over the East Coast one's, especially the Kumamoto oysters. My favorite !This restaurant is in a perfect location for those who travel in and out of NYC. Located 2 blocks from the subway A/B/C/D/E/F/1/2/3 trains, as well as Penn Station and NJ Transit. Also if you're on your way to Madison Square Garden, you can stop by here for a drink on your way there, since it's only a block away.",,,1

17,Ross H.,"New York, NY",347,106,436,3.0,10/28/2017,"Came here on a Friday night with my girlfriend to grab a drink and watch a game at the bar. We were looking for somewhere that was nice, and didn't really want to go to a sports bar. We walked in and were surprised as to how large the venue is, as well as how there were not many people there.We sat at the bar, and ordered two martinis, and a burger. The Bartenders were very attentive, and the martinis were solid, just expensive, which was expected as the location is walking distance to MSG. The Martini I got was called ""The Gotham"" and was whisky based, with a brandy cherry. Definitely smooth but was a little syrupy in a way.The burger was solid, but didn't come with anything besides ketchup on the side so I asked for some Honey mustard. Nothing special, I was honestly expecting it to be a high end burger with some aioli on it or something. The fries were good tho and had good seasoning.All in all this spot was nice, but really nothing special, I don't think I will end up going back because for the price i can for sure find other locations that will be more interesting, but not a bad option for a nice place to go pre a game at MSG.",,,1
18,Vanessa G.,"Miami, FL",166,15,13,4.0,9/4/2018,Ended up here after walking into the unbearable heat next door at Friedman's. It was very nice inside and the food was pretty good. We tried three different plates. The chicken and waffles was very tasty and had this nice gravy on top of the fried chicken. We also had an eggs Benedict and juevos rancheros. We enjoyed all our plates. The only thing is we felt our food was a bit cold and they left it out for too long. Other than that the food was very good. They also have Great brunch prices with the unlimited mimosas. Good service. All around a nice experience.,,,
19,Amanda K.,"Kenilworth, NJ",138,234,40,3.0,8/2/2018,"It was a lunch rush and our server had to be flagged down 3 times which is why there's only 3 stars.  In addition, my tuna salad was rather bland.  My client ordered a burger and we were all jealous.

The food wasn't outstanding, but definitely still quite tasty. However, the service was exceptional as we had very attentive servers who were constantly helping us and were very kind. Overall, the service mixed with the food and the atmosphere definitely makes me want come here again. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good meal at a reasonable price this close to the garden.",,,
22,Ben D.,"South Orange, NJ",74,203,1310,3.0,2/28/2018,"For pre MSG events, pre Penn Station train, delayed train or post MSG events, this is the go to place in the neighborhood.  Great raw bar turning out a nice selection of oysters to go along with any of the beers on tap.  Cocktails are executed decently but definitely not a strong suit here.  Solid offerings on the menu (blue crab Mac n cheese is a stand out) but playing it safe with a burger, while not phenomenal, will get the job done.",,,
23,Brynn M.,"Floral Park, NY",110,3,1,5.0,6/26/2018,"I've come here a few times and it's always a good atmosphere. The bartenders are great, always happy to see returning customers. This place has lots of TVs so you'll never miss any of the action in any sporting event. My favorite appetizer on the menu is the tuna crudo. Between the presentation of the plate and the quality of the tuna, you can't go wrong. The Penn Sixer cocktail is also a refreshing summertime drink I tell all of my friends and coworkers to come check this place out. It's definitely a hidden gem !",1,,

We had 6 adults and two kids and every one loved there brunch. Service was fast and friendly as well. I can't wait to return. Had to take away one star bc there's no changing table in the restroom and that's a problem eating there with a toddler. Any place with a kids menu should have changing tables. I hope they change that soon. Other than that, amazing experience. Can't wait to go back and try more. We loved how close it was to the 33rd Street path station.",,,

35,Joe L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",146,362,1025,4.0,4/9/2017,"My brother and I went here for dinner before going to the Rangers game.It's your basic sports bar/pub.  Sports events were playing on a bunch of big screen TVs, and most of the people there, including my brother and I, were wearing Rangers jerseys or hoodies.  I'm guessing if we were going prior to a basketball game, everyone would be wearing Knicks apparel. I will state two negatives:1--the service was slow.  We had arrived about an hour and a half before the game and, like our fellow patrons, were on a tight schedule.  I think it took about a half hour to get our appetizers, and the main course came about 15-20 minutes after that.2--I hate to sound like a grumpy old man, but the music was a bit too loud.  They were playing 80s music, which I love, but my brother and almost had to shout to hear each other.  It wouldn't hurt to lower the volume a bit.That being said, the food was really good.  My brother suggested starting with the roasted pepper appetizer, which was a great call.  The peppers were wonderful.  Likewise, we both ordered the house burger, which was really good.  I had French fries, which were delicious.  My brother substituted carrots for the fries.  I had some, and the carrots were cooked the way I liked them, with just enough crunch (I don't like carrots that are overcooked).  OK, my brother's substitution might have contributed to the delay, but the appetizers should have been there much earlier.I will add that although our service was slow, the staff was very nice.  The hostess came to us and did apologize for the slow service.  And when my brother asked for the substitution, the waitress basically said, ""it shouldn't be a problem.""The prices were on par for the area:  not cheap, but not overly expensive.  Basically, Penn 6 is a great place to hang out.  While I thought the music was a bit too loud, there was still a fun atmosphere, and it was great to see multiple games at the same time.  Sports fans will love it.  I will definitely recommend going there, but allow for slower service, or go when time isn't a factor.",4,1,1

Updated review","This is a follow up review. After receiving poor service/not at all from my last visit and posting a review, I received a message from the restaurant apologizing and stating that they were not quite sure what happened the day but that they would look into it. They also said they would leave me a gift certificate to come in and try them again, which was nice. I did just that, and received much better service/attentiveness, and more importantly the food was great too! I had the blue crab macaroni and cheese and it was delicious! My boyfriend had a burger with fries which he really enjoyed as well. I came in for lunch, so will be going back to try their dinner. Looking forward to it.",,,

38,Maulik M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",321,297,885,4.0,8/16/2017,"I've visited Penn 6 a few times with colleagues after work or just to catch the game on weeknights. It is an EXCELLENT space - very large, and high ceilings, and well-designed/ quality materials, with a WALL of TV screens and I like to sit at the bar to have a beer and burger or pizza while I watch a game.Most recently I met some colleagues for an early business dinner. The service and the food were all very good, but not exceptional. Everyone enjoyed the appetizers and entrees (I had the veggie hot pot). The service was very attentive but not overdone. They didn't have Guinness on tap but offered a ""clone"". It was good enough for me to order 2! I was disappointed with dessert: They have one of my favorites on the menu (ricotta cheesecake) but were out of it when I ordered. I was surprised since we had an early (6:30) reservation. The hostess compensated with another selection - on the house. I appreciated it but was still disappointed that they would run out of a dessert so early in the evening.The one issue, I guess is that it is actually NOT CROWDED (never seems to be, except right after work/happy hour) so it feels a bit ""empty"" sometimes - also the kitchen closes at 10:00pm, which is too early. The food is OK, slightly better than average, nothing amazing, but not bad; and the prices are not too terrible.",6,4,4
39,Devine G.,"Teaneck, NJ",1,35,8,2.0,8/20/2018,Nice location and pretty atmosphere. Food was b a s i c (i didnt kno huevos ranchers could be so bland!!) the french toast had literally a drizzle of carmel (not dulce de leche as advertised) but the actual toast itself had little to no flavor. The meal btwn the table was the burger (basic af and had to ask for lettuce and tomato). The mac and cheese was heavy on crab but again legit lacked any sort of seasoning or flavor whatsoever. The drinks off the bunch options were unflavored and basic buuuut the Bramble off the regular menu was pretty good. Better broozy brunch than most 20 somethin dives but nothing exciting.,,,
40,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",383,633,1398,4.0,2/1/2017,"I love the look of this place. It's very Midtown looking -very big, super long bar and a mezzanine over looking the restaurant! We ate upstairs and sadly the M-F 5-7 happy hour oysters are only available at the bar... Before receiving the ordered food, we are given a warm roll of bread with butter and it's really a bonus, every restaurant should warm up the bread before bringing it to their customers. We were in a pizza mood so I ordered the goat cheese, honey, red onion and pistachio flat bread and the hubs ordered the tartuffo pizza with mushrooms and an egg on top. Both were super delicious and filling! Our friend ordered the cheese burger with fries and she loved it! We shared a chocolate desert with caramelized bananas and peanut brittle. I think the description was much better than the actual dessert. Has the chef seen what a caramelized banana looks like? Here: 3 slices of nana with burned off sugar on top. That's not caramelized bananas, it's a thin layer of caramel on top of a cold slice of banana. Also.... it says peanut brittle, still looking for it! Service was pleasant, check took way too long to come to us -wanna be paid or what?",5,3,4

Both were great. The chicken and waffles were breasts rather than thighs and wings, and the waffles are thin. The chicken was well-breaded and the food wasn't too heavy. It's a chill place but lots of tvs so probably crazy Sundays during football season. We even did the free breakfast promotion. Great place.",,,

Not a bad deal! Mimosas and bellinis were great. I had the biscuit & gravy entree that was good, but simple for something around $17. The service was great and the bathroom was clean (always appreciate that in Manhattan!) my sister got the chicken & waffles which she really enjoyed, but for what it cost she expected more chicken. She decided to have dessert at 11:30am and tried their creme brûlée, which she said was ""absolutely bomb"". We actually planned on going to Friedman's right next door, but there was such a long wait outside, we decided to come here instead. Good choice!",,,

I'm glad we gave this place a go. It was very mellow on Sunday and it was perfect for chatting. We started at the bar while waiting for our friends. I got a house red wine which was delicious and my bf got Jever pilsner which they have on tap! Our bartender lady was great!Dinner: We shared tuna tartar - goodI had Atlantic salmon - delicious and perfectly cooked although I was not quite fond of veggie mix it can with. They were a bit tough and had a strange sweet thick sauce on them. My friends had an organic chicken, the vegetable hot pot (vegetarian dish) and a lobster roll. They were happy. The service was quick and friendly. Overall, it's a great spot for dinner before Knicks. It's less busy and crammed than Lugo. We will come again.",3,,1

They took my bags and stored it in a closet as to not crowd my table which is very much appreciated ( lots of travelers i guess ). Food and service though after I was seated thought was the complete opposite. I ordered the eggs in purgatory and the frittata, Tried both the salt content on both dishes lead me to continuously reach for the water, whats worse was the waitress was incredibly neglectful instead choosing to socialize instead of refilling my water, as i sat dieing of dehydration and excessive salt intake. Eggs in purgatory tasted like they just doused the thing in salt and tomato paste, incredible one dimensional and sour for my taste.overall skip this place if you're looking for a quality meal you won't find it here",4,2,4

But during football season, we stay at ""our"" team's bar on Sundays during brunch -- and don't get me wrong, it's a blast. However, on our Bye weeks and other Sundays when our team (Chargers -- I know) isn't playing we like to try new places. That's where Pennsylvania 6 comes in. My pal Jason was watching ManU in the morning and wanted to stay nearby. Thanks to the magic of Yelp, I found Penn6. And boy, we are glad I did!First of all, Ashleen (hope I spelled that right!) behind the bar is top notch. Not only is she beautiful, with great hair and a winning smile, but she is GREAT AT HER JOB. Very knowledgeable with drinks, dishes, and recommendations. J chose the French Toast and I had the Steak & Eggs. Literally the ONLY complaint J had was his French Toast wasn't as crispy as he likes it. That's it. Otherwise, everything else he loved. I am not exaggerating when I say that was the BEST steak I've ever had at a weekend brunch in NYC. OMG SO GOOD. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The eggs were plentiful and just how I like them. The potatoes were delicious. I even liked the greens (and that's big for me!). I will heartily recommend this place for a great brunch. Love that there were big screens at the bar to catch most of the games, too! PS I want to add that the gentlemen employees we encountered were lovely, as well! I'm sorry I didn't catch their names. PPS Due to Yelp's ""checkin"", we got Free Dessert -- OMG the chocolate lava cake does not disappoint!!!",,,1

We ordered the tuna tartare to start - a must have! We also had the burrata...yum. If you're an Italian food lover, you know burrata has to be served creamy and just right. That's exactly what we got. I had the short ribs for dinner. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. Paired with the polenta, it was excellent. One of the people in my party had a food allergy and Simon was able to adjust his order to make his meal enjoyable. We were also checked on a few times to make sure everything was okay which I definitely appreciated. I would highly recommend the Super Tuscan they offer by the glass - it pairs with the short ribs quite nicely. Overall, I had an excellent experience and felt welcome from the moment I walked in the door.

One of our entrees was a little over cooked so the manager who had come over to see how our dinner was, I believe his name was Simon, made sure to get it remade. It took about 15 minutes but it was definitely worth it. After it was remade, he had come over to our table again to make sure we were all enjoying our entrees, and even offered a dessert on him, to which we declined, but appreciated either way. The server, Edgar, did a great job making sure our drink glasses were not empty. Upon leaving, the manager gave us a drink ticket so we can have a round of drinks on him during our next visit.

Updated review","I don't usually take the time to leave reviews, but I was so happy and impressed with this place - I had to! I had over 30 people I had invited for my birthday dinner, and the place before I came here, started giving me trouble because of the fact I have food allergies! I was so upset, that I canceled my reservations with that place, googled for a place nearby, found and called Penn 6. I asked if they could take my large party of 30 within the hour and accommodate to my allergies. (I knew it was a large task at hand and was completely ready to hear no - but they said yes!) They told me to come in with my party, and they would have the table set up for me when I would get there. They had a ton of Gluten Free options (not a fad, celiac runs in the family) and they even prepared a few dishes with Gluten Free in mind. They were so mindful, they walked me through what I could and could not have and what they could prepare specifically for me - so that I wouldn't feel left out of my own birthday. They made the Blue Crab Mac and Cheese without bread crumbs and with gluten free pasta for me (delicious!!) And I also loved the Mapplebrook Burrata - super delicious. You have to try those two items. The Staff was super friendly, and kept wishing me a happy birthday. They kept the drinks filled, and my guests happy. The Manager that helped us was Julie. I loved her vibe and genuine concern with making sure everything was going well with my party.  She even told me about how she has close friends with similar allergies, so she understood what I had to go through.With the attentiveness to detail, and honestly just making my birthday an easy and fun celebration, this is hands down going to become one of my go to spots in the city. Thank you Penn 6!!",,,
68,Abennett73 ..,"Elmwood, New Orleans, LA",197,7,2,5.0,2/4/2018,Thank you YELP for introducing me to another great find!! We did The Social brunch special and were so happy with that choice. Croque Madame was the best I've ever had. Huevos Ranchero was amazing. Great flavor profiles and amped up versions of these without changing the heart of the dish. Also added Baby Dutch pancake to split. Lemon curd with this was perfect touch. Mimosas was not too sweet and came at perfect pace. Coffee was good and strong. We found our new favorite brunch place.,1,,

It's only available at the bar M-F 5-7pm, so come prepared to wait a bit for a bar seat, because they will be filled with happy diners.You don't get to choose your oyster; they bring out 12 of the same kind for $1 each, but I have no complaints about their oyster-of-the-day decisions because the oysters were perfection. Chilled to the perfect temperature, with a delicate combination of sweet and salty, and didn't taste like ocean. Served with very slippery tiny bottles of Tabasco, haha. The ambiance inside is very crowded and busy, but you are well attended to by your server. Looks upscale, but fun instead of stuffy.

We both started with an onion soups the cheese was amazingly meleted and the soup came out pipping hot, one issue I would say was it was on the blander side but the minute you put a little salt and pepper in it , it was great!

I had a lobster roll and while the lobster salad was really flavorful I found the bun to be a little too dense and hard. I wish it was a buttery, light and fluffy.

They have a coat check which was great since we were traveling with luggage. We were seated at a window table that we both loved since we love people watching. About the food: I ordered the granola parfait which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! It was absolutely fantastic and the perfect amount of food. My only wish would be for a few more blueberries since they were so delicious. I also ordered a cappuccino which was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the brunch pizza as well as the lobster mac and cheese. Both were perfection! He also ordered a Bloody Mary that he asked to be extra spicy.

It's great to drink a few beers here and hop on the train. And don't hate on dining in this part of Midtown, Keens is also in the area, one of the best Steakhouses in NYC. Hey, if Chelsea can make a comeback so can Penn Station!Anyhoo, I walk in and am quickly seated. Not too many patrons, no reservation is needed. The restaurant is large and decorated smartly with dark woods. Very long bar to drink a few cold ones.I check in on Yelp and there is a 20% app deal. Yay!!! I ordered a few Oysters and asked if they could be 20% off, not a problem I'm told. Excellent.They bring out a huge ice tray with my Oysters and some shaved horseradish. Nice presentation, but the Oysters? They had a bite, a grab, I didn't get the feeling it was the freshest being served to me. Dang.Now I order the ""Penn6"" burger. Dry aged, Pat Lafrieda dry aged beef, I am jumping up and down to get this sucker! The burger comes out, and the presentation? Wow!The burger is huge, fresh baked bread, lots cheese melted on top. Its a burger heaven up in midtown!Here's the issue. I ordered the burger medium? Man.. this sucker came out raw. I mean, Fred Flintstone cave man raw. And then the fries? It had a baby shrimp in the cup, about the size of a dime.The manager comes out, apologies up and down and brings out another burger.I start eating it and its raw in the center. It was really good from what I ate around the center. I call the manager over and show him what's happening. Again, total professional, takes it away and sends me a huge Oyster platter with clams on it. I'm kinda full, I had one or two more Oysters. I ask for the check, they gave me a full credit for the burger and I bolt out. I wanted to love this place, the manger was a true professional and the place is centrally located. When i come back it will be for the French Onion soup my Yelp Bud Frannie wrote about. I think I've put in my chances with the thick burger they make atPennsylvania 6 NYC",7,2,1

It was a bit thick but it was smooth and airy like a pillow when you put it in your mouth. The portion was a good size and it comes in a cute little jar.  For our entree we decides to get the Royal Plateau which consists of 18 oysters, 8 shrimps, 12 clams, crabs, and one whole lobster (meat only). Everything on that raw platter were succulent. There were also fresh grated horseradish, which goes really great with oyster. We also ordered the hand cut fries and that was a great finishing touch to a great meal.

Huge TVs on every wall, a nice bar, & blaring music but then a high end white tablecloth vibe on the table service half. Very dim lighting (every table was using cell phone light to read the menu- you would think the management would see that as an issue), higher mains pricing ($30 range), and excellent food. Service though was more on the bar vibe - we ordered a burger to share & a large salad. The waiter said ""do you want me to have that cut in half?"" We said yes. So they brought one plate with the burger cut in half. Not even a second plate. Very strange. Then they came & cleared our plates while we were still eating off them! Yes, we were 95% done but really?? And no, there was no one waiting for our table - they were only about 25% full. The  burger & salad were excellent but the atmosphere & service were sorely lacking.

107,Paul W.,"Orlando, FL",76,16,22,1.0,11/15/2017,"On Sunday November 12th while spending the weekend with my two 16 y/o boys in the city we ended up at Pennsylvania 6 for breakfast. I say ended up because it was never our first choice, the boys had done their research and had opted to go to Friedmans next door but when we arrived, there was a 45 min to an hour wait and there were people standing outside like crazy, so the hostess/ host recommended Pennsylvania next door. To our surprise when we got to Pennsylvania 6 it was the complete opposite, that should have been my red flag, the restaurant was literally empty , maybe only three tables occupied and there  was a family of 6 ahead of us 4 adults and two kids, that was just about to be seated. After a brief wait we were seated and our server Eric came  over and introduced himself he was a very affable young man. We submitted our orders the boys both did the two eggs any style and I the herb omelette along with an order of pancakes the boys both did an order of hot chocolate with house made whip cream and I ordered earl grey tea. Soon after we were seated, maybe 5 minutes, people started pouring in and before we knew it the entire place was jam packed. Well after sitting there for about 30 minutes we reached out to our server to find out how much longer it would be before we would be served our meals he told us he would go check with the kitchen and he returned to tell us after apologizing for the delay that it would be out shortly, well after waiting for another 15 minutes the server comes back to us and apologized and then proceeds to inquire if the kids were interested in having a second cup of hot chocolate, the kids inquired if there would be an additional charge for refills, to which Eric responded by saying he would make it complimentary since we had encountered such a long wait. A few minutes later Eric returned with the hot chocolate and the side order of pancake and told us again that the food would soon be out. Well we waited for another 10 minutes and again reached out to Eric who told us he would talk to a manager, the manager came out and apologized profusely indicating that there was a mix up in the kitchen and everything had been sorted out and my entire bill would be comped to compensate us for what had turned out to be way over an hours wait. Another  7 -10 minutes went by and finally the meal came out . The meal was great and after we were done Eric brings me a bill for  $83.00, plusN/A charge of $8 for what I don't know, it showed a discount of $49.00 with a total due of $45.73 after taxes of $3.73 I gave Eric $100 cash as I never felt comfortable at this point paying with my credit card after my experience and the promises made it took him another 7- 8 minutes before he finally came back with my change with an excuse that the reason it took so long was because he didn't want to give me all fives so he had to go downstairs to get my change even then he brought me back $54 instead of $54.27 so again I was short changed. At that point I just walked out because I was so over my experience and the way I was treated I couldn't be bothered . I felt cheated and felt that the staff including the manager were inexperience, unprofessional and unethical. Eric's rating moved from a 10 when I first met him to a 3 or below when I was done.",,2,

My husband and friends came away pretty underwhelmed from the experience, though we did have some positive things to say.We liked:-The service. Friendly, prompt, attentive, gave suggestions when asked. -The wine. I forget what we had (a bottle of some red, haha) but it was great. -The flavor of the Berkshire pork chop. Just the flavor. -Burrata cheese appetizer. YUM.Did not like:-The garlic breadsticks we got at the start of the meal tasted like they were taken from a freezer pack and re-heated in the microwave. -Skilled fried shishito peppers (well, four of the five of us did not like them. WAAAAY too spicy - much spicier than usual shishitos, we all agreed)-The cut of the pork chop. The flavor, as stated above, was great, but they did not do a good job in the back cutting the meat. It was covered - I mean seriously covered - with huge chunks of fat that definitely should've been trimmed off. -The Knickerbockers ""wagyu"" beef sliders. This was particularly disappointing because I had read SO many good reviews about these sliders and was really looking forward to them. Ugh. First of all, the hamburgers (meat) did not have any real flavor at all - it was overwhelmed completely by the truffled aioli sauce. If you serve wagyu beef and people order it, it's because they want to taste really good MEAT. Not sauce. -One of my friends had the bucatini with clams and was completely underwhelmed. Additionally, after dinner, I had the most horrible stomach ache. I hadn't eaten anything for hours before dining at Pennsylvania 6, so I can only attribute it to the food here (my husband had one of my sliders and had a similar, but not as intense stomach ache).",,,

Updated review","Thanks to Melissa and Amanda (managers) for reserving an awesome half booth and half chairs for my pre-birthday brunch today. The hostess and Davina was nice to let me take the empty table as well. Our server Amanda W. was very attentive and had a wonderful personality. Drink: I ordered a Bellini...yummyAppetizer: Blue Crab Mac & Cheese...two of my friends shared and use the 25% Yelp Check-in for the dishFood: Steak & Eggs (3) was popular at my table...one of my friends got the medium steak with poached eggs, another friend got the medium well steak with scrambled eggs and I got a well done steak and sunny side up eggsBrunch Pizza (1),  Fresh Herb Omelet (1) and Eggs Benedict (1)Everyone at my table really enjoyed their dish a lot!! Yummy food with good company always makes everything amazing. I was surprised with a Molten Lava Chocolate Cake with fresh strawberries and vanilla icrecream and a cute pink candle! All my girls sang happy birthday to me. I felt pretty special during brunch! Thanks a bunch to Davina for making sure everything went smoothly. Definitely a wonderful spot for Brunch and Dinner!

The food was great, the mimosa was perfect, but the service was tired and unfriendly. The French toast are really good, lightly fried in funnel cake batter, so awesome! Served with berries. Really really good. The Eggs Benedict was really good, had a zest to it, served with small chopped pickles actually complemented the dish very well. The steak and eggs were really really good. Would definitely get them again. I mean eggs are eggs but these were really good. The service made it a bland visit. And thus, had to rate this a three, but, I might try this place again.",,,

I was dressed a little casually but that didn't seem to be a problem. Most of the other diners were dressed casually as well.They started with serving us a piece of cranberry walnut bread, which was great. It came with some butter that had salt on top, which I love. I ordered the croque Madame, which has become one of my go to brunch items. Theirs came with a side salad. I thought the whole dish was really yummy. The eggs were cooked perfectly on top and the Gruyere cheese was not overpowering, which I liked. They also use whole grain mustard, which is always a treat!Bf ordered eggs in purgatory, which was eggs in a bean stew with cheese and crostini. It was also good. We ordered a side of patatas bravas, which tasted like they was covered in marinara sauce. They weren't bad, but we didn't eat much of them because the portions were large. Our server was attentive.",2,,

My friends and I were pleasantly surprised by how empty it was compared to the one next door. We were in a hurry so we settled for this.Penn 6 is a surprisingly cool and classy restaurant. We got the Eggs in Purgatory, Eggs Benedict, and Pizza Brunch. The food came at a timely fashion which worked out nicely for our tight schedule. These entrees were all sizable portions but the prices were at the higher end ($14-16 per entree). Our waiter was friendly and came in to check in once in a while. Heads up, there's free wifi if you need it. You just have to ask for the password.  Funny story, we were a bit worried about three times plates/glasses were dropped and shattered near the back room/bar around during the course of our meal...

And he is fine with it, so I use his tomato.I was going to order a second beer anyway, so this is fine, but in hindsight, this passive aggressive attitude from the server is really terrible...  she clearly heard me, even my friend commented on it, but she chose to serve me another beer that would increase her tips instead of giving me the simple tomato slice I asked for (and on a $22 burger, seriously, should you have to ask for a proper tomato slice?)So don't eat here.  The food is overpriced and the service gives you passive aggressive attitude if you only order $20 burgers and don't spend more money there...",,,

Food came out fairly fast so that's good if you come in with an appetite. The space was a bit tight where we sat as lots of people walked back and forth.

Soccer was playing and there were afterwork folks drinking.Soup and sandwich- $9Corn soufle- $8The onion soup with gruyere grilled cheese dripping into the soup was a clever takeoff of French onion soup and a delicious one.

Spacious, classy space with a massive wall of TV's and great food to eat while you watch (they even make a Cobb salad interesting). Just had a workday lunch there, got a quiet booth for a business conversation. Our server, Kathy, was helpful and attentive but not in-your-face, and the manager, Chelsey, couldn't have been more welcoming and chill.

I've worked the NYC market for many years and have been to my fair share of bars and restaurants.

137,Adelin N.,"New York, NY",4,20,2,1.0,2/2/2016,"This place is horrible. I visited this place with a friend and I was so disappointed to say the least. We ordered steaks which had to be sent back twice because they weren't cooked to our liking. Finally, they come out a third time and the food runner had no idea which one was which. We ended up taking w.e was given to us at this point. The waitress sucked big time!! I believe you can get better service at a fast food restaurant compared to the service she provided. She was never around and when she finally came around I told her I didn't like my drink. Her response was ""that's a first"" as she walked away. To pay the check was another ordeal. We asked her for the check and it took at least half an hour for her to get us the check. Was it busy? Not at all!!! There were only three tables occupied, ours included. Instead this person was having a conversation with some guests that were seated a few tables away. And this is where things got good; after talking to them for about 10 minutes, she took a seat next to them and continued their conversation!  I thought it was a joke of some sort. I really couldn't believe what I was seeing. My friend picked this place and kept apologizing to me. I almost felt bad for him. I'm surprised this place is still I'm business considering all the great restaurants NYC has to offer.",,,2
138,Diana C.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,44,16,4.0,11/5/2014,"I won some vouchers to eat here from a fundraising event. I rarely ever win anything so you can guess I was completely ecstatic. I dined here several weeks ago on a weeknight with a girlfriend. It was rather loud but we were still able to have decent conversation. In terms of food, the blue crab mac and cheese is an absolute must!! Each bite gets you a kick of crab flavor entangled in oozing fontina cheese and if you're lucky, it has a piece of burnt crust. We also shared the wagyu knickerbockers which were cooked medium rare, just the way I like them. The honey-goat cheese flatbread was a favorite as well. The flavor of the honey, cheese, onions, and pistachios satisfied my sweet and savory taste buds. Today, I came back for a late lunch and the place was more on the quiet side. We were offered bread this time and to our surprise, the bread was warm and crispy, perfect with some olive oil. Of course I ordered the mac and cheese once again and the same flatbread. The bf ordered the tuna sashimi salad which I highly recommend -- fresh fish and good greens. Service was up to par and I never had an empty glass of water. 4 stars for Pennsylvania 6!",2,,2

The former Event Coordinator, Melissa, was one of the most helpful people I've ever come across in the hospitality industry. From the moment I put an inquiry in on the website, until the time of her departure at the restaurant she was both pleasant and professional. (Wherever you are Melissa, please know you were wonderful to work with!)The week of my brunch event, I called to change the minimum number of guests that I had signed a contract for. I worried that I would be charged for the sudden change, but the new Event Manager (Stephanie) and the GM Craig assured me that I wouldn't be billed and that they were looking forward to working with me personally the day of. The management team kept their word, as they were professional and courteous to both myself and my guests. They even let me keep the private loft area which was REALLY nice and had a cozy feel (I highly recommend for those interested in something away from the general public) and offered a unlimited mimosas option.Most of my guests, including myself, ordered the stout battered french toast which was surprisingly GOOD, and even the grilled chicken BLT had a great taste to it. The dishes that were shared (bacon + potato hash) were PERFECT. Although my reservation was set for two hours, the staff allowed us to stay an extra two because we were just enjoying one another's company and were deep in convo.Thank you Craig + staff for your kindness and making my event memorable.

I actually really like the Penn 6 in DC, and have costed many times for business and casual experiences with great results. This restaurant is something else entirely. First, all of my guests (5) received their food in a timely manner. Mine came out as a soup. I had ordered Salmon. Not even close. Usually I would just eat it anyways since I was with clients, but since it was a Friday during lent, I was avoiding meat and sent it back. The waitress repeatedly came up to apologize, which is fine, except she continually interrupted me as I was pitching my clients. She literally had zero awareness of my situation, which only aggravates me more. My fish finally arrives (after everyone else was finished) and is completely raw in the middle. Inedible. I took two bites and asked for the check. Waitress comes by to apologize more, interrupting me again. Finally, a bus boy comes by and breaks a glass directly under my chair. Not his fault necessarily, but simply the cherry on top of this miserable experience.",,,

The dishes I ordered during the first visit was the bbq ribs and pepperoni pizza. Ribs were somewhat spicy and tangy which I prefer it to be.

160,Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",272,331,315,3.0,5/12/2014,"I can't add too much to what reviewers have already mentioned previously. Pluses-- Very convenient midtown location, perfect for Penn Station commuters, including folks who might be Amtrak-bound- Great corporate venue for lunches or after work drinks- Spacious with lots of seating and a minimum wait: very efficient service! - Lots of wait staff that remain attentive and gracious the whole time you are seated- Varied drink/cocktail and food menu. Definitely appeals to a diverse palate and all preferences- again, perfect for a high end corporate function or rendezvous. Cons- Pricey/Overpriced, but not a big deal if you're using a corporate card ---see positives above! - Stuffy, Corporate Vibe--- great if you're there for work; not-so-much if you're not. I will say the atmosphere changes a lot, however, once the happy hour crowd disperses. Later on in the evening, it gets more casual and relaxed and actually kind of a pick-up spot - Not very ""personable"" or distinct. It doesn't really have a personality, which is OK- just don't expect it to be anything new and different for the area. Will I go again? Definitely for a work meet-up, if I need to jet to Penn afterwards or am meeting folks in that area.",1,,

166,Sophia C.,"Marlboro, NJ",223,126,120,4.0,3/3/2014,"The environment is nice. We went in the afternoon. It seemed busy and lively, but not crowded. Lucky for us, we were seated immediately. We were seated in a booth so we had plenty of room. We got the Penn6 green salad, Eggs Benedict, and the Penn6 burger. It was a nice looking salad, but it lacked color. I was pleased that it was full of thin, slightly crispy, fresh leafy greens. I'm not a fan of radishes but they sliced everything so thinly, I was not bothered by their presence. I was impressed with how lightly but evenly the salad was coated with the vinaigrette. It would have been a superb salad if they had some avocado slices and pine nuts thrown in there too. The Eggs Benedict looked very appealing to the eye. It came with two portions. Each had a crunchy, lightly toasted piece of what seemed like white bread, a slice of ham (or Canadian bacon?), and a poached egg with hollandaise sauce. The only thing that keeps me from wanting to re-order this dish would be how the egg white was not cooked all the way through, that there was some clear egg whites and an entirely raw yolk. I am very particular with my eggs and I like it when the egg white is cooked through but the the yolk still very raw and runny. Perhaps I am wrong to wish that my eggs were slightly more cooked because that might be the way you are supposed to poach an egg. That's just my preference. It was a great rendition of the Eggs Benedict and I'd recommend it to any one who claims to enjoy them.We ordered the Penn6 burger to be cooked medium-rare. It came with a side of thinly cut fries, which were crispy good. The bulk of the burger was yummy, but I had some small bits of the edge that tasted weirdly burnt and unpleasant.",1,,

My waiter, Brayden, was an incredible waiter. He was lovely, attentive and great at what he did. I ordered the organic chicken with truffled parsnip purée, cauliflower and baby carrots and it was incredible. The chicken was cooked just right and everything complimented each other really well.

Updated review","I still like this place; but maybe 4 stars is a bit of a stretch.  I described the room in my first review; nicely done.  Stopped in for lunch today with my sister.  Lunch prices are reasonable if you stick with burgers and sandwiches, under $20.  For a ""real"" entree you go up into $20 - $35.  What caught my attention this visit is that the hostesses and wait staff are all young and pretty and really polite and attentive but also verge on clueless.  Memo to management - seat the first guests near the front so that the place does not seem empty.  Also spread the tables around.  Why was the second table seated right next to us?  I was waiting for my sister to join me and would have preferred a table with a view of the hostess stand. The hostess had walked me back and back and back so I was thinking - why are we passing all these tables?Our server was nice enough but skipped a beat or two.  My guest had seen an item on the dinner menu - our server was nice enough to ask the kitchen if it was available at lunch but the response was no. No reason given - maybe the prep time would keep us waiting way too long - but it could have been handled better. Our server suggested a similar item from the starter menu - which was appreciated - my sister asked if it was a reasonable portion for a light lunch - yes - but when the order came out it was a bit skimpy - the server should have suggested a side order to round out the plate - and up-sell the ticket.  I had a burger which was nice enough but the french fries were a bit odd - tasty but tiny - like the potato chips in the bottom of the bag.Maybe I am being too critical about small matters but these were things that I noticed.  Still - I like the place - a very nice room - excellent beer selection on tap. Staff are very nice but need to be trained up just a bit more.",,,

When I first went to the bar it was kind of full, but the crowd quickly became crazy after I sat down. I definitely picked the wrong time to be there...I ordered a glass of Shiraz and the Yellowfin Tartare. Thanks to the Yelp check-in the appetizer is 25% off. Thanks Yelp! It didn't taste too bad either. The plantain chips were noteworthy, and I was given just the right amount. The Shiraz was unfortunately bland and sour.I think next time I'm waiting for the train I'll head down 32nd street and have a tea and pastry from one of the Korean bakeries. That would without a doubt be a better crowd, tastier, and cheaper.",8,5,3
179,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,3.0,6/7/2013,"I am glad they opened up a decent, semi fancy eatery near the dreaded Penn station area.  It works for the businesses who sadly sit in this area, but, I have to say, my chicken cobb salad was very underwhelming here.  Not to mention, it took some 30+ min to get it.  I came here for lunch with a client on Tuesday at 12:30- plenty of tables were available.  Sort of rotten that you do not even get points on OpenTable for registering.  My client and I started off with the fries as an app, which I must say were the best part of our  meal.  Not too heavy and well seasoned and crispy.  They were smaller- almost on the shoe string size.  Apparently the brussel sprouts are good- it looked like overall there was solid bar ish food with a step up; good burgers and lobster rolls, etc. My client and I both had the chicken cobb salad which was very blah.  The chicken was cut and plastic-y.  The lettuce not the freshest.  The bacon was fine (diced) and the avocado and blue cheese was all there but it wasn't inventive or tasty in any way. I'd come back for happy hour if in the area, they probably have good drinks, and big size TVs.  All in all, not worth going out of my way to return.  The place isn't that cheap either- mid teens for a cobb salad but well into the 20s for fancy fish dishes like the monk fish and whatnot.",3,,
180,Bramfy B.,"New York, NY",177,181,14,4.0,3/16/2015,"Like this spot. Brunch was good.  Jalapeño corn bread, crab Mac (maybe too fishy for some but loved it), salmon Benedict.  All were great in my opinion.Great brunch special $29 for unlimited bloodies and a brunch entree.  Bloodies were great and stayed potent even after my 5th glass.  Nice n spicy too. Sweet buzz for a sunday Good place to watch games tooI'll be back",1,1,1
181,Jeff F.,"Boston, MA",414,1530,13,3.0,10/29/2013,"Great option by Penn station. The Burrata, Carpaccio and Tuna Tartare apps are all highly recommended. Stay away from the oysters. Unsure how you can remove the flavor from oysters, but Penn 6 came up with one.",,1,

183,Emily P.,"Cape May, NJ",106,135,13,4.0,2/5/2015,"The ONLY decent place to eat/have a drink around Penn Station, and I make a point to come whenever I'm in the area. The fabulous thing about this place is that it's great for lunch and dinner, as well as drinks - truly a versatile spot. The atmosphere is impressive and classy without being over-the-top overdone, but the food and service really stand out. My absolute favorite server is Deana, who I've had two great experiences with now. She truly makes you feel at home and cared for in one of the busiest areas in the city, no matter how many tables she's handling at the moment. I have had less than perfect experiences with other servers, but never caught names - just not as spectacular as Deana. The food is quite good, and the oysters are fresh and delicious. Make sure to try a cocktail!",3,,2
184,Ghali A.,"New York, NY",41,57,221,4.0,7/24/2013,"This modern day, wanna-be, speakeasy offers a huge selection of awesome drinks, which is a direct result of highly committed bartenders (or mixologists) - my favorite? Maker's Old Fashion (see Jimmy and his mustache). It's a great neighborhood place to put your belly up to the bar on a comfortable bar chair, have a few drinks, and two dozen $1 oysters during happy hour. Trust me, I've had all versions of their oysters and the discounted oysters are just as good or better than the $4-$6 ocean creatures.But be sure not to shy away from the other food items on their menu (save the Tuna Tartare - not sure what their thinking with this one by adding way too much relish), especially these appetizers: Spicy Beef Buns, Burrata Cheese, and the Blue Crab Mac & Cheese. For dinner, you can't go wrong with anything. And for dessert, you better order the Drunkin' Donuts with peanut butter on the side - you'll love it. Guaranteed!I've never walked out unsatisfied and I plan to go back again and again.",1,,

186,Tonya R.,"Inglewood, CA",276,147,47,4.0,3/5/2015,"Came here for Brunch before an event at MSG and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a spacious venue and the staff members were so nice and helpful. We both opted for the brunch special $29 for a meal and unlimited drinks. The drinks are made nice and strong. I order the chicken on a biscuit with sausage gravy. I was expecting Sawmill gravy. While it wasn't that, it was tasty. My finance ordered the French Toast and it was delicious. I liked the place and plan to return intentionally :)",1,,1

188,Brad P.,"Arlington, VA",2,24,1,2.0,2/22/2015,"Wow, I thought we were on the set of Impractical Jokers. We went here for a late breakfast,  and ordered the salmon hash and omelet. A busboy came over and offered us breakfast rolls. We asked him if we could have some jelly for the rolls. He looked at us like we had four heads, but he offered to check. He came back and said, ""There's no jelly, but I can offer you olive oil."" We declined bc who in their blipping minds wants olive oil for their breakfast roll!! He then proceeded to pour the olive oil for us anyway. A few minutes later another busboy came over and just took our coffees from us! We said we weren't finished with the coffees; so, he said he would get us new fresh ones. We never saw him again.We called the waitress over, asked for our coffees back, and she apologized for the busboy -- saying he was new. She then told us there was no clean coffee cups, and we would have to wait for new coffees. We waited 10 mins before we were able to resume our caffeine intake.  Ridiculous! 45 mins later the food finally came out, and this review gets two stars (instead of one) bc the food was decent. I still wonder if they were filming Impractical Jokers. Avoid this restaurant and go to Friedman's. I hear they let you drink your coffee there, and they have jelly.",1,1,
189,Vincent T.,"Long Beach, NY",357,177,3,5.0,2/1/2013,"You cannot find better food within walking distance of Madison Square Garden & Penn Station.  Period.  Love the atmosphere, it's a beautiful place. Perfect spot for pre-game/post-game meals and drinks after MSG concerts & sports. Happy Hour. Dinner. You name it.  Recently tried their brunch, WOW.  Best French Toast I've ever had (sorry Mom), and Eggs Benedict was equally awesome.  I've tried a few of the Brick Oven Pizzas, they are so much better than the Pizza alternatives in Penn Station and nearby. The Parma (arugala & prosciuttio), Tartufo (black truffle & fried egg) or the 3 Little Pigs (3 types of gourmet sausage & brocolli rabe) were all great. Full Raw Bar with East & West coast Oysters, Clams, Lobsters, and Shrimp the size of a baby's arm.  $1 Oysters during Happy Hour, can't beat that! For dinner, the Beer Braised Short Ribs are so tender you don't need a knife.  Steak was also super tender and grilled to perfection.  Monkfish Osso Bucco is delicious. Blue Crab Mac & Cheese is some of the best M&C I've ever had. Desserts were on point too. Dulce de Leche ""Drunkin Donuts"". Fresh baked per order. Try em. No seriously. Now. Like 20 beers on tap, like another 20 in bottle.  Beer Nerd paradise.  They even have 750ml big bottles of Allagash Curieux, which is like heaven in a glass.  Oh, and yea, they have an LED TV Wall behind the bar reminiscent of the screen at Cowboys Stadium.  Eat your heart out Jerry Jones.  Ok I'm exaggerating...slightly.  Check it out for yourself.  It's brand new,  but this place is destined to be a Manhattan hot spot.",6,1,1
190,Sultan M.,"Saint Louis, MO",142,44,68,4.0,11/3/2013,"Found out of convenience while looking for Friedman's previously, Pennsylvania 6 was a nice little surprise. Bustling with a great mix of regulars and out of towners it was immediately the kind of place you can feel at home while ordering your first drink. Like so many places the quality of the bar was a bit erratic (experience had seniority and a lot of smoke breaks) but the drinks were amazing. Of note, the 31 Manhattan. A bit different than normal but a nice drink for a cold night. The food was interesting. Mussels were tasty but overlooked and the seasoning while designed (I think) to cover a mediocre selection. The Tuna Tartare on the other hand was excellent. Plus it's hard to go wrong with plantain chips Fun place, above average drinks and average food for the tl;dr",,,
191,David C.,"New York, NY",45,160,118,4.0,8/23/2013,"Went here with a friend and found this spot thanks to Yelpers!  This is a great spot near the Garment District.  The atmosphere is definitely suited for groups and happy hours.  I wouldnt call this spot that great for dates because the noise level is pretty high.On to the food.  We ordered the Tuna Tartare for Appetizer and this was delicious which you put onto the plantain chips.  My friend loved it and so did I.  Nice little dish.For Entrees I ordered the Beer Braised Short Ribs.  This was also delicious.  I was afraid it would be kind of dry, but that was def not the case.  Lots of flavor, good presentation, just fantastic.My friend ordered the Lobster Roll.  I didnt get a chance to taste it but she thought it was very good.  I cant vouch for that though.Overall a good place to eat, def would consider coming back again for sure!",,,
192,Gracie B.,"Jersey City, NJ",360,561,10,4.0,4/6/2013,"Good food near Penn Station? Yes, seriously. I'd been watching this place since it was under construction. I'd walk by, and think, ""that would be a good place to have drinks before getting on the train."" Well, one friday night, after an event nearby, we ended up here because Mexicue was closed. We were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome and quick seating. Once seated, we scoped out that they had $1 oysters soon and had a check-in deal for 1/2 off of an appetizer. This could work out well.And it did. We had the oysters and fried clams to start. They shave horseradish for you at the table. Yay. The oysters were good, but the clams stole the show. Juicy and fried perfectly, I could have been content just with them. I also ordered a burger. It was good. Would have been great, except it was way beyond the medium I requested and a bit dense. At the price point, I'd probably never order it again.Desserts looked great, but we were stuffed and needed to get to our train. Next time. Definitely next time.",1,,
193,James D.,"Yonkers, NY",8,36,9,4.0,5/18/2015,"I came here for a business lunch with my coworkers, and everything was on point.The food was a bit on the pricey side, but how much can you really object one block from MSG/Penn station?I had the crab/lobster mac n cheese and the margherita flatbread. Both were well prepared and had decent portion sizes. The staff was great when extra coworkers stopped by they pulled chairs up and didn't say anything about them not ordering.Nothing with the food really blew me away, but any place that doesn't nickel and dime you in the fashion district gets an extra star, and they checked my bag for free.",,,

The bartenders and hostesses were very friendly and welcoming. The bartender was very helpful when my boyfriend was deciding on a beer and took the time to let him sample and explain different beers when it was very busy during brunch on a Sunday.

I would recommend the Mai Tai. The oysters are and fresh and delicious. We ordered the tartufo pizza and the honey and goat cheese flatbread. They were both delicious. I would come back for the honey and goat flatbread. The ambience and decor is fabulous but overall this place is definitely on the pricey side and should have happy hour specials.,,,
197,Carrie B.,"Long Beach, NY",0,59,23,2.0,6/10/2015,"My experience was very inconsistent.  The beer selection, $1 oysters & Anna the bartender was great. My guest ordered an iced tea & it looked like it was the bottom of the barrel & tasted like it also. Anna explained that's the way their iced tea is but she took steps to dilute it by icing it down more.  Dinner was good except that the dinner rolls were hard as rocks & inedible. We had 2 staff members ask us how things were and when we mentioned how bad the rolls were they had no idea what to do so they just ignored the comment.  I had a yelp coupon for 25% off the appetizer which I showed the waiter. The crab Mac & cheese was amazing. I only ate half as we had more food coming.  I asked for all the left overs to be wrapped. When I got home I realized the yelp coupon was never applied and my crab Mac and cheese never made it into the bag. What a way to end the night :(The best thing about Penn 6 is the location to Penn Station. Unfortunately, I am not sure I would recommend it to friends.",,,
198,Jas N.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,6,0,4.0,10/2/2014,"Hunger struck. It was a quarter past seven and six tigers followed me in. My Pennsix adventure taught me three things:1) Spicy Beef Buns aren't a sexual pun. They're real. They rock. 2) Oysters impress. 3) This is not a bowling alley. The Spicy Beef Buns, covered in spices, surrounded by buns unleashed happiness upon my hunger. Calling it delicious would be an understatement. Oysters usually impress. They continued to impress here, not much more to say. Honestly it's only worth mentioning Oysters if they didn't impress. Then you become sick, vomits, green, the whole thing. Gross.I thought we were going to a bowling alley. It didn't look like a bowling alley but Noah insisted, ""Dude, it's a bowling alley."" He's convincing. Despite the lack of gutters, pins and the smell of that weird shoe spray, we had a good time.",2,5,1
