0,Ree R.,"San Diego, CA",0,60,0.0,5.0,7/4/2018,Great turkey sandwich. Price was soooo cheap I was skeptical while bringing it home. But the turkey was shaved thinly and great quality. The roll was fresh. The cheese was great and even the sliced lettuce was good. Don't know how they do it for such a small cost but it's a very good deli sandwich. Not the biggest sandwich but for me it's perfect size.,,,
1,Timmy L.,"New York, NY",679,74,4,5.0,11/22/2015,"Dependable and cheapI live in Brittany Hall right next to this place, so whenever I need a quick, cheap meal, I walk to 20 or so steps around the corner. The sandwiches are good and cheap, and while I've never tried it, the hot/cold bar always looks very appetizing. The most impressive thing about this place is the guy who makes the sandwiches. I will watch him memorize multiple complex orders after only repeating it back once. Amazing. It's got a convenient sitting area on its second floor as well, making it the perfect stop for some cheap burnable calories.",2,,
2,Tiffany W.,"New York, NY",248,292,175,5.0,7/2/2014,"Came here during lunch. This place is pretty busy during lunch hours. They have a hot/cold food bar and a deli. It works well when you place an order and the deli and then go online to pay and then you only wait a few minutes for your order to come out. Although you might wait a while to place your order.I had gotten the capri panini which was super good. I stopped eating panini's after the only time I had eaten them at a cafe back at school because of the amount of oil they use, but this one was super good. Flavoring was good and not soaked in oil. I give it an A+. Definitely will be one of my go to spots to pick up a quick lunch.",1,,
3,Real L.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,2/24/2016,This Deli is our go to place for our office. We use them for catering and miscellaneous orders on a weekly basis.Their service is excellent! The delivery guys are always prompt and we get our orders immediately after we call it in. Their buffet selections are all delicious and fresh. I've tried their fish and it was always cooked perfectly. Sandwiches are their forte. You can never go wrong with any of the choices.Definitely a five star worthy Deli!,,,

6,Irene J.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,57,240,3.0,8/7/2014,"Not good.  The guy who makes the sandwiches can't hear or speak English.  The Korean cash register guy (the owner?) is only slightly better at aforementioned conversational skills.  Also doesn't seem too happy that customers are providing him with business.  On top of that, because the sandwich guy didn't comprende even after multiple times, the owner didn't charge me for a second sandwich, panini to be exact and I had to pay another six dollars.  Which at first made me feel like I'm paying extra even though I was actually supposed to pay that initially.  Quite embarasing and stupid if you ask me.The only reason why I'm giving this place three stars is because it has an extensive choice of various snacks and beverages (not so much from actual legit food menu however).  And also because you don;t want to spend your time scouring the city for cheaper options (because you are not really going to find any) and you are in a rush to get back home to Brooklyn after a hard day of work, this is sadly your solution.",,,
7,Candy B.,"Forest Hills, NY",392,376,170,4.0,8/20/2011,"This place is great for quick meal pick ups. The hot/cold stuff is great (same as all delis) and they keep it stocked so you don't feel like you're getting the leftovers. The place is clean, always stocked and the cashiers move like lightning. The only thing i wish they did was label the food. I'm veg and sometimes I'm not sure of certain things so I skip it all together but now I know what to get so I'm solid. Thanks for asking. Chips, gum, ice cream, some basic OTC pills, baked goods, protein bars, pasta, the list goes on - you can get all this here.",1,1,
8,Erin H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,3,0,5.0,5/30/2016,"A good New York deli. Has a good selection of drinks and a bodega atmosphere. They do have dine-in upstairs, but it can be hot in the summer, so I'd advise take-out. The sandwiches were good and classic. There was a bit of a language barrier, but overall great service.",1,,
9,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",758,1660,36,3.0,5/1/2011,"For a late late night fix, this deli can score you a toasted bagel with everything on it, some vegan singapore glass noodles, and even some gatorade.  I don't know how gourmet they really are, and I've never eaten from the steam table, but they have a good selection and are a minute from my building.",,,
10,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,4.0,3/23/2012,"One of the many bodegas in the area, but they really pack a lot into a small space without feeling too cramped. I was in and out of the store in a jiffy!",1,,2
11,Alexa R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,3/26/2016,"This deli is awesome. Tons of kids from the nearby NYU dorm go all the time, and it's great because they're super accommodating late at night, it's always well-stocked, and the chicken parm sandwiches (*on a roll) are AMAZING. Also, the staff is wonderful. 5 stars.",,,
12,Scott R.,"Austin, TX",303,784,12,3.0,2/21/2008,"""Modern Gourmet"" is neither modern nor gourmet (Linda Richman of Coffee Talk would love the place).It's your standard (slightly outdated) pay by the weight buffet bar with a breakfast/sandwich station.I don't touch the buffet bar.  Cheap, honest sandwiches.  About $5 for your standard cold cut sandwich.  A lot of variations, too - like 6 different types of turkey.Their pre-packaged fruit salads are pretty good.  I like their sliced mango.Funny note is that they have absolutely the most laughably unreadable menu boards ever created.  They have a zoomed-in product photo as backgrounds with light white font for the names and prices.  I guess those boards cost a lot to make and they can't accept or afford to junk them and start over.  Good people behind the register and sandwich counters.Better choice than Bully's for a quick, non-modern, non-gourmet sandwich in the area...",3,4,2

Updated review","This place is good for a sandwich - not $5 like the other reveiwers have listed, more like $7 for whole wheat, turkey, swiss, and romaine. The guy who makes the sandwiches is super sweet, and so are the 2 delviery men. The owner, a older man, has the WORST attitude. My coworkers and I order from him everyday and they always seems to mess up the order and when you call back to fix it its a huge inconvenience for them - the irony! For example we were ordered 2 LARGE iced coffees and 1 sandwich. When the delivery guy came in we paid and realized afterwards that we were overcharged. When we called to correct the order the guy says he will try and get me a credit but he can't be sure. I asked for him to replace my small iced coffees for the larges that I ordered and he says ok and hangs up. 30 minutes pass and I ended up having to go there to get my large iced coffee and again have to deal with this man and his horrible customer service. He treats everyone like this and we order milk from his company every single day. Moving forward we will be ordering from Bagel Bob's on University Pl, they are cheaper and much nicer.",,,
14,Hannah C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,49,3,5.0,12/6/2011,"Good, fresh food, very fair prices, and Juan the sandwich maker is the nicest guy ever. They'll have you in and out of there in minutes. Special sandwiches of the day are excellent.",1,,
15,Jenn Y.,"New York, NY",129,50,13,5.0,1/13/2012,"Love this deli! This is my go to deli near work and they do a great job. I enjoy that they have a wide selection of beverages, snacks, candies, anything. Juan behind the deli counter is AMAZING, you can rattle off a sandwich with 10 ingredients and he has it down pat! Modern has daily specials during lunch time and they have speedy service. Highly recommended.",,,
16,Daniel K.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,485,6,4.0,9/9/2008,"I support this establishment because of  ""sandwich man"" one of the best sandwich makers I've ever come across.  This guy runs around like crazy and never makes a mistake.  You can shout something like turkey bacon hot peppers on whole wheat toast with mustard while he has his head in the deli case and he will never mess it up...it's why I go back.  Prices are fair as they don't charge an absurd price for what they provide.  I also love the pickles they provide with sandwiches free of charge.  On a side note, soup is really cheap (2.50) and if you get a small  salad(greens with a tomato slice) Ive come in at under 3.60 for soup and salad - can't beat that.",1,,
17,Jess E.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,56,0,5.0,6/13/2013,Great!  I brought in an order for 25 sandwiches that I wanted to pick up the next day at 8am.  I showed up at 8:05 and they were all ready and labeled - just as requested.  The sandwiches were normal deli sandwiches - nothing special.  Service was great and I will be using them again.,,,
18,Sebastian P.,"Chicago, IL",10,9,0,5.0,3/30/2011,"I love it, they have everything, they don't try to screw you at the counter, prices are fair for certain things, but i did the buffet and got a bunch of things and it was like 12 bucks so that pissed me off cause it wasn't that much food, so I never did that again.  But overall great deli, big sandwiches, fair prices, nice staff.",,,
19,Jason S.,"New York, NY",4,15,0,4.0,3/2/2010,"Consistant, solid deli. Nothing amazing but def a very good all around deli. Reasonably priced.",1,,1
