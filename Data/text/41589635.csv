0,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,11/10/2018,"This place is a really bougie rooftop bar, but it was easy to find seating on a weeknight. Cocktails were $21 a piece, one of the highest prices I've ever paid. They were definitely solid drinks, but you're definitely paying for the ambiance and the views. Hikari and Surrey cocktails were my favorite. Hikari was a toki and hibiki blend and the Surrey was a gin, egg white, frothy cocktail. Worth a visit especially on a warm summer night. We came in November and it was extremely chilly and rainy, so the entire outdoor area was unpleasant.",1,,
1,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",829,475,125,3.0,11/14/2018,"Well, this is definitely one of the larger and nicer rooftop bars in NYC. It is a bit of a trek out there with nothing much else around, so figure to spend your evening here or get there early before the lines.Amazing view and quaint pool of water outdoors and you truly get a full view of midtown behind you and the Hudson in front, but be warned the drinks were $20+ each. Whoa! You truly pay for the view and I guess there's no cover, but this isn't exactly a club where you have tables and bottles so check it out for the view, but you have been warned!",1,,1
2,Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,208,250,4.0,11/1/2018,"A classy rooftop lounge. Really liked it! Just a pain to get here because the surrounding buildings make it look like the middle of Williamsburg but in Manhattan...if that makes sense.Drinks are expensive ($21 for mine) so prepare to spend a lot and drink a lot!! The views are pretty nice to the west but the east is just another manhattan skyline with a sprinkle of light pollution :) I'm sure it gets more lit later in the night, but I left before 10pm so I hope to come back again.",2,,
3,Sama C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",541,145,230,4.0,9/29/2018,"Definitely great views of the city and the pier. On a clear summer night this place is where you want to be. Only thing is, bring a lot of money. The drinks are expensive. There are plenty of seats, but after a certain time of the night the seats get taken quick. And, the only bar there gets hectic.Plus:No cover to get in",9,3,8
4,Trina D.,"Orange County, CA",764,2184,8145,3.0,9/27/2018,"My friends recommended checking out the Press Lounge because it was a cool rooftop bar. If you know where Print is, you'll find the Press Lounge upstairs on the rooftop. There is no cover which is great but drinks are pricey ($20 and up). We found seats right away when we arrived. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. They have a 360 degree view of NYC so you're golden if the weather is good and the skies are clear. I ordered the Cardinal off of the menu and my friends ordered a bunch of drinks like the Whiskey Mule. The lighting on the patio is dark so I'm surprised if people are able to walk around. I can see why they use plastic glasses because with the darkened lighting and booze, you're liable to trip or drop your drink at some point. Our waitress went home sometime after midnight and we had another girl take her place. None of our used glasses were picked up at any point during the evening. This worked in our favor when it came time to settle up our check. We had been overcharged for at least one drink and we brought it up to our server. Two of my friends had settled-up their drinks ahead of time so we double-checked to make sure they didn't pay for extra. Turns out we were overcharged because we didn't order one of the drinks on the bill. The waitress tried to argue that we had ordered it and it might have been settled with our friend's check. I asked if it came in one of the glasses still on the table. None of them had been cleared and it was clear to us and our server that it wasn't one that was served to us. Score one for us! Other than that mishap, the night had been swell. The views were great and it was a fun night to be in New York City. We even saw a bride and groom taking wedding photos on the rooftop; only in New York.",11,10,10
5,Dhaval T.,"New York, NY",346,63,153,5.0,10/5/2018,Probably one of the best rooftops in the area. The views are mesmerizing and has a very lounge vibe. Irrespective of the days - this place is always packed and has a good balance between locals and tourists. Sometimes they can be strict on the dress code so make sure you are dressed in lounge clothes. Drinks are on the expensive side and there's nearly any food option. But that's the point you wouldn't really come here to eat! The amazing views of the tall manhattan skyline is enough to fill your heart.,,,
6,Sophie G.,"New York, NY",308,45,45,4.0,7/29/2018,"We came here on a Saturday at 5, and the vibe was absolutely perfect. It wasn't packed, everyone was super chill drinking a glass of wine and enjoying the view. My kind of rooftop bar - especially compared to others that are jam packed, no seating, and extremely loud.It was really spacious, a ton of seating available and the view is hands down the best. I thought it was better than Rockefeller center's view. Only bummer is the $20 drink price, but i guess that's just Manhattan for you. The area is also the best, but the hotel and rooftop bar itself are very high end. But the location is what gives it such a great view!",4,,2
7,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,4.0,8/14/2018,"I came here twice within the last month. Once was a 5 star experience, once was a 3 star experience, so I'm going to average it out to 4.The view itself is fantastic. Definitely one of my favorite views amongst the rooftop bars I've been to in the city! Even the inside area has a great view for days when the weather is too rainy or cold to properly enjoy the rooftop. Another great feature of the rooftop is the small pool area with seats around it, making it a lot easier to have a seat here than on many of the other NYC rooftops.The first time I got a great bartender who was very creative. The second pretty much only made drinks on the menu and wasn't willing to put together anything else unless it was very simple like rum and cranberry juice and had a bit of an attitude when asked what kind of liquor they have.But I didn't let that ruin my experience that was otherwise great, and instead stuck to ordering on the menu cocktails only from the servers walking around outside. They were particularly helpful.The wine by the glass list wasn't the best but had simple, straightforward wines if you are looking for that over a cocktail. But really, this place is all about the cocktails. I recommend the Veraz or the Cardinal.",,1,2

9,Carlynn E.,"San Francisco, CA",2,16,31,5.0,11/12/2018,Loved the feel of this rooftop. With a boujee vibe and a wrap around deck with views of both the city and the water. A definite must go to if you enjoy craft cocktails with a buzzing atmosphere. Not to mention the place was filled with intimate seating and tall table tops. Great place to mix and mingle.,,,
10,Sang P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",529,670,142,5.0,8/30/2018,"Awesome rooftop bar in NY. Drinks are pricey. The old-fashioned tasted pretty bad and it was $20. The view is amazing. It was also not very crowded at night. I didn't notice any tourists or many people with their phones out taking millions of photos. It's the NY skyline with a 360 view near HK where you can see the hudson river which is probably one of the nicest views in town, but you get over it fast.Pretty chill place regardless :)",2,,
11,Chad S.,"Naples, FL",87,244,635,5.0,8/20/2018,"No doubt, my favorite rooftop.  Place is on the pricey side (mixed drinks pretty much run in the $20-$30 each range)... happy hour non-exist... but the quality of drinks, speed of service and of course the exceptional view from anywhere ( even inside), make this a place that honestly, I'm torn on even sharing because it's so great.",4,3,3
12,J. K.,"Hoboken, NJ",11,22,0,1.0,11/18/2018,"I was here for an engagement party. This place ruined a fun time. First of all, we had a bar tab but the server made me pay out of pocket for no good reason, she claimed we ""overbooked"" our tab.The line for the bathroom was stagnant and a huge mess. Then I was attempting to leave and catch my Uber that I ended up missing because the jerk bouncer named Adam wouldn't let me on the elevator even though there was plenty of room. He claimed I was too fat. Then I missed my Uber, got charged a penalty and had to wait 15 min for a new one.What a disappointment.",,,
13,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,3.0,4/21/2018,"I feel torn about leaving a 3-star review because The Press Lounge has such potential.  But based on the recent visit I had, I'd say 3 stars is about right.Let's start with the good.  I've been to my share of NYC rooftop bars, and can say with confidence that the view here is one of the best.  On a clear night, you get a breathtaking panoramic view of the midtown skyline.  The light-up pool outside is very gaudy, but I could see it being a nice and unique touch during the day.  There's plenty of comfy couch seating throughout, and much of the bar is covered and heated in colder months.  Drinks are expensive ($21/cocktail), but made very well.Now on to the bad, which is mostly related to the service.  We visited on a Tuesday night, when they close at 1AM.  Around 12:30, a waitress came around to announce last call, at which point we ordered one last drink.  The drink arrived shortly thereafter along with our check, but then immediately afterwards, these two rude and abrasive security guys started barking at patrons to leave.  Why would you take drink orders if you're not going to allow people to drink them?  Not cool.",9,4,4
14,Melissa V.,"New York, NY",694,139,516,4.0,4/14/2018,"I will be back for sure!! We came here on a Saturday night and the view was incredible but way too chilly to be on the balconies unfortunately. It was a bit too crowded so we didn't stay long but I'd like to reserve a couch or something next time! There were other couples laying down on the couches with blankets which would have been nice.There is a dress code and the clientele seemed a bit older and classier which made the place pretty tasteful and not too rowdy! If there were a lot of tourists apart from us, I couldn't tell. Ideal place for a date night or with a small group of friends!",4,1,1
15,Melody W.,"San Francisco, CA",833,59,142,4.0,3/31/2018,"Gorgeous view up top.Heads up, they don't let folks with athletic wear up top. They almost didn't let me go up with leggings. They turned away my brother and my bf because they were wearing logo soccer pants. The guy at the elevator was nice, and said that he wished to let them up, just people up top would turn them away. When reaching the top, there wasn't anyone to enforce that. Hmmm... not the biggest deal breaker, just wish we knew prior.",7,1,4
16,Liz T.,"Teaneck, NJ",3,10,15,4.0,11/1/2018,"This place is reallyyyyy nice. Would give it 5 stars if the prices weren't so expensive. I get that it's the city, but there are cheaper places around. The waiter walking around was very attentive but she wasn't overbearing, which I appreciated. The rooftop goes all the way around the spot which I found really dope. My husband and I actually came here as a spur of the moment thing, we never heard of the place before... I literally discovered it on Yelp while he was driving. The music was somewhat of a jazz feel which was different from most of the rooftops I've been to, but I liked it. Another thing I like about this rooftop, is that one section is outdoors and has seating but is covered with a roof. I found that great for times where it begins to drizzle or when the sun is scorching! Overall, great place for pics and a good chilled time.",,,
17,Irish M.,"New York, NY",152,43,156,5.0,8/3/2018,This place is lovely and relaxing  I would come back again over and over.Lucky we get to seat a nice spot but it was a bit windy that day.,1,,
18,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,167,4.0,5/4/2018,"The views from this rooftop are amazing. This is totally a place you should take visiting friends or anyone you want to impress. It is perfect for a date night. Came on a week night and it was not crowded at all. There wasn't anywhere to sit, but that doesn't really bother me. The clientele is a mix of an older crowd and tourists. They weren't playing any music which I found odd, but at least you could totally hear who you were talking too. 100% would go back.",,,
19,Minh P.,"Annandale, VA",278,91,508,5.0,3/19/2018,"This place is a germ with the best city view. Love this place! Our plan is to come back here some time in the summer so we could sit outside and enjoy the view a little more. It was super freezing in the winter, though the view was so worth it. Love how they have heaters inside the place, made it much more comfortable and bearable.",,1,
20,Kimmy T.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",176,34,46,4.0,3/30/2018,"Cocktails.. $21. A bit ridiculous but think of it as an entrance fee to a beautiful lounge with gorgeous night views! I only had one drink because I'm the type to spend my money on food over liquor but I'd say it's a pretty penny well spent if I approach it like a cover to a bar. They don't seem to enforce you to buy a drink though, although it's probably encouraged, and the cocktails are good. The staff is super nice as well.Came in the winter, okay technically ""early spring"" but it was still so damn cold outside. Inside, there are fire pit looking things and heaters up above so it's nice and toasty inside. A great winter rooftop bar in my opinion! There is still access to the upper deck outside if you dare step into the cold (we did, and you should too).Oh, and bathrooms were clean too because I think drinks are too $$ for people to get properly wasted.",,,
21,Brigitte P.,"Long Beach, CA",165,100,199,5.0,12/5/2017,"YOU CANNOT BEAT THE VIEWS HERE! I almost feel like there's nothing else to say. Pictures may speak one thousand words, but even they cannot do justice to the nearly 360 degree breathtaking views of Manhattan from this rooftop bar! The drinks are solid, the small bites are delicious and the views are second to none. Seriously, you cannot go wrong here. Just check this place out already!",4,,
22,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",92,155,93,4.0,5/29/2018,"What a lovely atmosphere this place creates! After hearing all the positive notes from friends, I finally went on a weekend evening and found it to be spacious but still somehow intimate and definitely was not overcrowded. The views are of course, without saying, impressive. One of the better rooftop views in NYC. Seems frequented by actual New Yorkers. Hope it stays that way and the tourists can enjoy their 230 Fifth and such...Minus 1 star bc drink prices are $$$ and it's also super dim.",4,1,1
23,Christy L.,"Dallas, TX",85,46,88,5.0,9/22/2018,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been visiting New York City for several years and this time around I realized I hadn't been to a rooftop bar yet and put it on my list. I did a little bit of research about the best rooftop bar and landed on the Press Lounge. On the rooftop of the ink 48 hotel, this bar boasts the most incredible views of both the city and the Hudson. And it is SO CHIC. You don't have to be fancy to get in here (which is great for me because I commute into the city from Jersey so I'm not usually dressed up. I usually need to be in something comfortable for walking around all day) and this place is casual enough but it also feels very upscale. There is plenty of seating and places to catch a great (almost 360° view).  The only downside is this place is PRICEY. Don't plan to get a lot of drinks here unless you're looking to spend a lot of money. But definitely stop in for the view.",,,
24,Ben C.,"Seattle, WA",505,109,132,4.0,6/22/2018,"Pretty cool bar! Especially if you're staying in the Kimpton Ink48 hotel that it connects to as you can literally go down the elevators, make a right and go up the elevators up to this bar.The view is pretty phenomenal and captures a big chunk of the city. The cocktails are definitely a bit pricier than what they're worth so you're really paying for the view here. Think of it as a entrance fee and a free drink and you'll be happy ;)Regardless, I would recommend having a drink here as they're still genuinely pretty good but sip on it slow or you'll be running out of money in no time!",,,
25,Jenni K.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,255,277,5.0,10/8/2017,"I lived in the City for over 10 years and always tell myself every summer that I'll check out more rooftop bars, but I never do...the wait, cover charges, tourists...that's why. Before my friend and I headed over on Friday, I checked out their website and reviews -- no cover charge and usually no wait to get inside. I was a bit hesitant, but decided to try it out. My friend and I got there around 7p.m. and true to the reviews, there was no cover charge and barely a wait to get on the elevator. Once you get to the top, there's indoor bar seating as well as the outside area. We happened to get there right around sunset and got some spectacular views of the river! It wasn't too crowded when we got there but most of the seats by the edge were taken. But we still found a table that had a little fire going and ordered drinks there. Heads up, the cocktails are all $20. They also have beer and other options. My friend and I both ordered the HOEFLER (grapefruit) and it was pretty good. Not too sweet and on the stronger side. We waited for people sitting at the edge tables to get up (those tables have couches) for awhile. Fortunately, two guys who were sitting at the table nearest to us came over after asking for their check and told us they've save their table for us. It was super sweet of them, and probably saved us a headache of vying for a table as more people came through the night. They have a few food items on the menu, but we didn't try any this time. The venue would be perfect for a party. I'll definitely be back again soon!",7,,1
26,Danielle C.,"Ventura, CA",61,129,185,5.0,12/4/2017,"Wow this place is worth every penny for the views, drinks, and expereince. With incredible views, the lounge didn't have to do much to gain a large clientele. However, it's very apparent that they take as much pride in their drinks and food as they do their ambience. The drinks were inventive and had the right amount of alcohol. We were celebrating an anniversary and they made our night so special! We were also visiting from out of town and debating the iconic empire State or top of the rock experience. However, hands down, I would visit this place for rooftop views anyday! If you're wondering about dress code: my husband wore a collared shirt, casual dress pants, and dress shoes while I wore very nice dark fade jeans, an Anthropologie top, nice boots, and jewelry. I'd say that is the most casual you want to go.",1,,
27,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,5.0,10/4/2017,"I think this is now my new favorite rooftop in all of NYC. Amazing views on three sides - north, east and west side. You can see everything from Times Square to the Empire State (though it's a bit hidden) to the beautiful Hudson River (with full view of the Intrepid and other boats). Dim and dark up here so you can soak up the night sky, skyline and your anonymity. No dress code, casual, but some people dressed up. A mix of after work happy hour crowd and tourists. Good music. Good drinks. Very chill and relaxed up here, I think I actually saw a guy taking a nap on one of the couches. Speaking of couches, there's tons of seating up here. The space itself is quite large, probably one of the largest rooftops in NYC. And the center piece is a beautiful narrow blue pool. A fire pit completes the romantic mood. This place is amazing for a date but just as fun with a group of friends.What I love most about this place is the friendly service and the zero 'tude from the door staff. Never a wait to get in, no fake lines, no making you wait for show. They welcome you, usher you to the elevator and wish you a good time - what amazing customer service. I'm in love with this place.",7,1,3

Very laid back adult setting.  People having fun and connecting over conversation without obnoxiously loud music (around 8 - might change later in the night).

The views are amazing! One of my other favorite things about this spot was the the water canal in the middle of the rooftop that changes color.The cocktails are quite pricey ($20), but I've come to expect that from New York, so I wasn't to shocked. The cocktails are delicious though. My friend and I also shared a cheese platter and the best soft pretzel I've ever had in my entire life. If you're going during the week try to get here on the early side to get a seat. We got there around 5:00, got an amazing seat, and stayed for a few hours. I would definitely go back! :)",6,2,3

The view from The Press Lounge is incredible--definitely try to come here before sunset and stay so you can see the view in the daylight/nightfall.I like that there's an indoor seating area and an outside one. The entire space has sleek and modern vibes.

They're nice, attentive, no covers ever!!!!, and something charming about them.The bartender, Cidro, is the nicest and most efficient bartender I have yet to experience in NYC. I always take my out-of-town friends for a quick drink during their summer visits, mainly because of the awesome, unobstructed view and decently priced drinks that are great. The ambiance is what sets this place apart, you have the ability to have a conversation here with someone and that's what is missing from a lot of nice cocktail/rooftop bars.

43,Connie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1334,623,289,3.0,1/2/2018,"Even though it's a bar of a hotel, it's a pretty cool one at that. I'd come back again when the weather reminds me of much warmer, nicer days.DRINKS - Good and are standard prices, maybe like $12-16 each here.SPACE - There are a decent amount of seats that give you the view you want, but there are also lots of seats that won't give you that Manhattan view.VIEW - It's a great panorama shot of the city so kudos there! You're pretty focused though on Times Square, and you may peek to see the Empire State.Overall, it was a good time and not bad if you're in the area. But with so many rooftop bars that will give you better views of the city, I'd recommend going elsewhere. With the location being at 11th Ave, you'll get a closer view of the Hudson River than you will of iconic Manhattan.",5,5,5

I have experienced both lovely service and somewhat surly service, but I understand that it's tough to work towards the end of the night when people are starting to get sloppy. The cocktails are not as climactic as the prices, but you're really paying up for the bar, not the quality of the drinks. I did, at one point, attempt to reach out to The Press Lounge with an event inquiry. They may not have taken my inquiry seriously, but I never heard back from them. VALUE: 4 starsAs stated above, you are paying more than you'd pay at a traditional Manhattan bar because it's a gorgeous rooftop. But, as rooftop bars go, the prices are commensurate and the vibe is much nicer, so I'd say it's worth it if your goal is to be outside at a nice bar with a real view. AMBIENCE: 5 starsThis is where The Press Lounge really shines. I have not yet found a nicer rooftop bar in Manhattan. The view is exceptional, the seating is lovely, and they don't let it get too busy (hence the sometimes long wait to get up there).All in all, a great place to check out!",,,2

The moment I went up I just felt super relaxed and boujee. The view of the city is just amazing, and the ambiance is on point. The only downside was that my cocktail was $20 but I mean I was expecting that and after all it is a rooftop bar in NYC.Lots of indoor and outdoor seating area with a breathtaking views. Good for talking as well. If you have a bae, bring him / her here immediately.",4,1,3

47,Kelechi O.,"Manhattan, NY",179,82,277,3.0,6/27/2017,"Great date spot but the lights situation past nightfall definitely needs to be addressed. Came to The Press Lounge on a beautiful summer's eve and the view from the 16th floor rooftop is to die! To the east, you'll see clear across the water into NJ and to the west you'll see Times Square. However once the sun sets and natural light fades, it's basically pitch black in the covered patio and open air rooftop lounge. I literally had a whip out my cell phone light to review the menu and choose among the $20 cocktails. Not sure if the venue's management is using the lack of light to encourage guests to exit past a certain time but if I hadn't been a few drinks in, I would have definitely left. Ambient lighting is great but no light is a buzz kill.",6,2,1

51,Andrew T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",188,396,850,4.0,9/11/2017,"Super cool rooftop lounge on the 16th floor of a hotel. No cover to come in but there is a long line. With around 50 people ahead of us, we got inside within 20-25 minutes. When you exit the elevator, there are a set of stairs to your left that leads to the restroom. As you walk in there's a bar on the left and several couches all around. When you walk on to the balcony there are most lounge areas but it seems like they are always going to be packed with people. When you walk towards the end and outside of the bar area, there's a pool and it was a bit underwhelming because I thought it would have been bigger based on pictures but its pretty small but long. Nonetheless, it makes a great photo especially with the NY buildings in the background. Super cool lounge that I will look forward to come back to every NY trip I have. Drinks are stupid expensive. On average most cocktails are $20! What is this, Vegas? Bottled water is $10, which is outrages. Ended up getting a couple of drinks anyways because we were already there. Drinks were made pretty well but for sure what you are paying for is the view.",,,

The Lounge is located inside of the Ink48 Hotel. We went up to he doorman, but he informed us there was a private event and we couldn't get in until 1AM. He was extremely friendly and I was slightly surprised-- if you've been to other NYC rooftops, you'd know that's a rarity. Since it was about midnight and that means we would have an hour wait-- he provided us a few alternatives, but cautioned that if we didn't wait in the line, he wait may be very long. He wasn't lying; we got on the line where our friends joined about 15 minutes later. Just as promised, we were allowed up at 1 on the dot. Since we were in the front it was relatively empty inside and we were able to get some pretty good pictures and seats on the couch.Press Lounge has some excellent views, but they also have some pricey rates for drinks-- I guess that to is expected at any lounge, but I paid $25 (includes tip) for a signature cocktail.All and all, Press Lounge is nice rooftop that's sort of in a world of its own because they aren't clustered with a bunch of other rooftops nearby. They have an extremely courteous staff, and I would recommend this place.Tip: they provide blankets upon request. You may need them, it was frigid up there!",3,,3

We went out to see the view on the balcony just as a group was leaving so we were able to snatch up some seats! My bartenders name was Isidro and he was very pleasant and got me drinks quickly when he saw me come up to the bar. I bought a glass of prosecco for the bride and he even put in some extra cherries for her prosecco. The bar was packed but service was great! The view of the skyline was amazing on this MDW!

The few things you'd want in a rooftop lounge... and this place has them down.  Great spot to stop in at after dinner.To get some pictures in if you're a tourist visiting during the day...Or just want to enjoy a nice day admiring the beautiful skyline.I'd say that this lounge has one of the best views out of any other rooftop in Midtown (that I know of, at least)  The only places that have beat it are across the Brooklyn Bridge since you see the entire skyline.  But again, that's over the bridge so you can't compare the two.For Midtown. It's the best I've seen yet.",,,

But since it was me and my friends' lucky day, we actually got a couch. Cocktails are pricey 14-15$ but you are paying for the view remember?! Plus most bars in Manhattan charge you around 14-15 for cocktails. I was really impressed that most people did order just one round of drinks but spent hours sitting there and still the service was impeccable. They kept refilling water etc. The cocktails were pretty neat. The perfect way to end a touristy day actually esp if you have weekdays :)",5,,3

The person watching / motoring the elevators was racist. He made my group (Latinos) wait in line to used the elevator, but gave first class, like a scene from Titanic, to a group of Caucasians to use the elevators before us. I feel like I was threaty from the film of American X, where I had to bite the curve of the street. Now, I know how Rosa Park felt, as a matter of fact im sure the elevator monitor was the bus driver that asked her to get up.",,,

Got to cut the line for the elevator up since we ate at the restaurant. The waitress also let us bring our wine glasses from dinner up to the lounge so we didn't have to purchase more drinks. Lots of seating available but filled up quickly around sunset. Mostly young professionals however a few others. Not very touristy although everyone takes pics when they are on rooftop bar. Drink prices ranged about $12-$15/drink (see attached pic of menu). Bar food also available. Waitresses come around to take glasses and new orders! The 180 view was great! One side city and one side Hudson River! Definitely recommend checking it out but get there early if you want to watch the sunset!,6,,1

Win.win. The view is stunning. At night you can't help but be at awe at this amazing city. You truly see how alive it gets from the rooftop bar / lounge. I don't remember the drink , but it had maple syrup . It was out of this world. Honestly it was a perfect drink. The drinks will be a hit or miss as a friend of mine ordered an champagne type drink and it was just okay. Perfect for a date night. Take your jacket as it will get a bit cooler up there and make sure you give her your jacket and hold her tightI will definitely be going back there. Side note cocktails are around 20 bucks, but it's worth it in my honest opinion.",,,

I had a bubbly fruity drink in a champagne glass (forgot the name) for $21, which is expected because they've gotta pay rent. But I appreciated that the bartender didn't skimp on the alcohol.

We got there on a Saturday evening around 7pm and grabbed a decent place to sit for a group of 6. Not too crowded. The weather was great. Spent approx. 4 hours and the evening was pretty gorgeous.

We knew that with such a large group it would be pretty hard to find seating if we went later, so we showed up right around 5:00 PM. There were already a good amount of people sitting and standing around, and the sun was still up so you could still see the views all around. They came around to check on us more than a few times (but not in an overbearing way), brought over heaters when the night got chillier, and kept our seats open when we went to the railings to take photos when the sun set. Granted, we totaled a hefty bill (~$350) but the service, the views, the drinks made for a lovely night.

So I bought 2 small pieces of Harbs Cake in the box, the ID security guy at the downstairs said I can't bring it up with me, even I said I would not eat it for sure. And then I went to ask the restaurant at the grand floor, they really tried to help me out, but unfortunately Sunday they closed early so they can't help me to hold it. And then, I went to ask the front desk of the hotel to help. The reception of the hotel (yeah, the white shirt guy), he told me: ""THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I ONLY WORK FOR THE HOTEL. THE ROOFTOP IS NOTHING RELATED WITH US."" Excuse me??!! This is rude and doesn't make any sense. Even the restaurant was trying to help, seems you guys share the building. As the hotel, which is the main business of the building, being such a dick is not good for the entire building's business and image, no matter is for the hotel, the restaurant, or the Press Lounge. In the end, the rules here is: The rooftop has no dress code but can't bring any single piece ""food"", and they can't help you to keep it; the restaurant has coat check could help until they close; the HOTEL? WON'T DO A SHIT FOR YOU. :) So I think it's better somebody see my comment and fix this.",,,
78,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,615,558,3.0,2/19/2017,"So far west. This is a standard rooftop bar with nothing too amazing except the views of the city and NJ, which you can see at any high rise rooftop bar. Unlike many rooftop bars, the crowd and staff are not super pretentious. But, it has the other key characteristic of a rooftop bar and that is 20 dollar cocktails with low alcohol content. Just stick to straight liquor, wine, and/or beer. The space of the bar is nice with neon blue lighting on the outdoor patio. The place is all right but it really is not worth the trek unless you are staying at the hotel or are already in hells kitchen or Times Square. The service was a little slow but I attributed that to the large crowd and the fact that the majority of the cocktails have 6-8 ingredients in them. When did this trend start? What is wrong with having a 2-3 ingredient drink with ice being one of the ingredients? There was only one thing with the service that really hit a nerve with me. The bartender circled the suggested tip amounts on the check, I think this practice is a little rude. If someone is going to tip you 18%, 20%,25%, then they will do it; you don't have to point it out to the customer.",8,4,3

At last but not least, their (expensive) cocktails are delicious and the menu is regularly updated.Great atmosphere, great views, comfy couches and chairs, nice fireplace room.

Diverse crowd of 20-somethings, with everyone dressed for the dance floor. Music loud but not deafening. The inside space is impressive, but the outdoor space is where it's at. There's a shallow pool / fountain and lots of seating, with a view of the Hudson. Nice place to chill for a while. Long, gender-neutral bathroom line.Drinks approach $20 but the fancy one I got was decently made. There's no cover or drink minimum so I would imbibe beforehand and then check out the view.

97,Jonathan K.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,319,4,2.0,6/28/2018,"Beautiful view, but I would prefer to drink my $40 glass of whiskey in a glass, rather than a plastic cup.  Why serve high end / top shelf liquor in plastic?",1,,
98,David L.,"Garden City, NY",162,12,3,5.0,8/15/2018,"Beautiful rooftop bar in an amazing location with some of the best views of the city. I always bring visitors here and they always love it. You'll be paying a premium for your drinks but you should know what you're walking into and it's well worth it. You'll get a mixed crowd of locals and tourists but it creates a really good vibe for mingling and just meeting new people. The dress code is somewhat relaxed, business casual. Just don't look like a slob.",,,
99,Tiffany C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",559,71,184,5.0,11/7/2016,"Came for the reviews and left with a new favorite rooftop bar! I think that the Press Lounge has  one of the best, IF NOT, the best views of New York City. The atmosphere of the Press Lounge is wonderful and I cannot wait to be back one day! I also like this bar because of the non-judgment I feel exists at the bar. On a lot of Friday nights, a lot of NYC bars will have bouncers that will ensure that everyone is dressed to the nines and sometimes you feel almost intimidated walking into a bar. However, the bouncers here won't give you a hard time. All you need to do is find the hotel and take the elevator up! (Go earlier to avoid the line).DRINKS: The drinks are standard prices for New York City cocktails. But you get what you pay for. They are fancy and strong and these are one of those bars where you can get one or two drinks and slowly sip on them while enjoying the view. The bar area does get a little crowded so it takes a while to get drinks, but that's like any bar. ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere of this bar is something that I'll try my best describing, but I think it's hard to imagine unless you actually visit the bar. When I went, there were all different kinds of people there: old and younger just enjoying the atmosphere. There is an inside area where you can get table service and enjoy a dimly lit and trendy environment. When you go outside, there are couches and sitting areas for you to enjoy the night sky! I personally sat along a fountain area they have in the middle of outside area. Although it's crowded, it's never OVERLY crowded. Everyone here is pretty respectful and classy. SERVICE: The bouncers are nice and bartenders are busy. OVERALL: 10/10 would go again. Enjoy the nice views!",7,,1
100,Janay M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",4,10,16,4.0,9/13/2017,"Came here on a Saturday night, around 10 pm. It was pretty full and as soon as I got off the elevator I already enjoyed the vibe. It's chic but had a home feel to it ( I'm thinking it's because numerous people who sat inside and out we're lounging with blankets) I really wanted to check this place out before it got too cold out to appreciate the views. But as it turns out even when it's not so warm out you still can! They have heated lamps and fire pits! but! Let me tell you the views are amazing the rooftop wraps around so it's not like you have to fight people off to get a good picture. It's enough space for all of us to have a photoshoot LOL The drinks are $20 pretty pricey but expected, but they were just... okay. I'm not completely upset because the customer service and bar tenders were on point and really polite.  seating is easy and available, as people move around a lot. Waitresses come around outside as well to ensure you're okay or needed anymore drinks. Overall I came I saw I conquered. This place is cute and perfect to get a drink or two before heading someplace else. But if you have great company and conversation it's comfy enough to stay for hours",,,
101,Sunny S.,"Orlando, FL",108,108,31,4.0,11/28/2017,"Big fan of this place as an out of towner.  You get a phenomenal view of the city skyline and the place itself is very modern with some really great mood lighting (it is towards the darker side).  There are a lot of seating options - couches indoors and outdoors, a fire pit, some more casual seating, etc.  The drinks here are expensive ($15-20 a pop) but everything I had off their cocktail menu was great.  I also like how this place doesn't blast the music so that you can actually have a discussion with the people you are with.  The only problem I had here was that the servers were pretty slow, but it was a busy Friday night so I'll give them some slack on that.  Overall, definitely one of the classier/more modern rooftop bars I've been to, and definitely worth hitting up at least once.",2,1,1
102,Elana S.,"New York, NY",324,98,412,3.0,10/24/2016,"The Press Lounge has one of the greatest views of NYC skyline! Hands down. There is something about this location that makes whole midtown skyscrapers look picturesque together. Perfect spot for a classic photoshoot with the beloved NYC. It's easy to get in, no useless fuss at the door, no unrealistic prices and modest staff. There are mostly tourists there and that's because it's on the top of the hotel and located on the edge of Manhattan. Nice relaxing music accompanied with the killer sunset views makes you simply happy. The only thing is, it's often closed for private parties, so call in to check out the availability before you head there. It happened to me twice, I came all the way from midtown east and couldn't get in because there was special event going on those nights. It's not the trendiest rooftop or the crowd, but it's still worth a visit.",4,2,3
103,Carleen C.,"San Francisco, CA",207,64,97,4.0,1/1/2018,"I guess they are going for a Super dark vibe. No lamps or light source indoors which made it a bit of a challenge to get pass the large crowd in front of the bar, if you are trying to make it to the patio. Im not sure if that's because they don't want to lose the effect of highlighting the green fountain in the center.  If you are on a budget,  water is your best friend here. I ordered 2 vodka sodas which was $37.  It's a good place to start your night chill, this place is the spot. Still worth the long wait to just get relax with a drink in your hand and savor the sweet view of manhattan, especially on a beautiful  warm summer  night.",1,,
104,Gene L.,"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, NY",493,311,673,4.0,10/1/2016,"Of all the rooftop bars I've been to in the city, this one probably has the best views. Cocktail prices are high, even for Manhattan ($20 range) and are not even that great. Service was pretty decent, considering the amount of orders they are juggling with groups everywhere. Line can get long during peak times trying to get inside, but I've never had to wait terribly long. Apparently they have a dress code, but as long as you're not completely dressed like a scrub I don't think they care - never seen anyone turned away. This place is still one of my go-to places to take out-of-towners as the view is second to none.The other reviews pretty much sum it up: amazing views but expensive/mediocre drinks.",6,3,3

The weather wasn't easy breezy summer rooftop season weather so we froze a little bit on the exposed outdoor deck. However, we got beautiful 180 views of New York City and when we felt chilly we went indoors into the glass covered section of the rooftop which was super gorgeous. Drinks are expensive (around $15+ for a cocktail) but you don't need to buy anything to go up to the rooftop. Crowd is mostly yuppies, some college students, and tourists. I truly loved my experience here, my only complaint would be the slightly rude service I received from the bathroom attendant but besides that I would totally recommend this spot.",2,,

115,Andrew C.,"Las Vegas, NV",459,610,2044,4.0,10/13/2016,"This review is purely for the view and nothing that the lounge itself provides. My friends and I were recommended to come here for a beautiful skyline view by our friend who had came here a few months before we had. Located on the west side of Manhattan by the Chelsea area, it gave a different skyline view of NYC. Because of the lounges ""strict"" dress code of not allowing normal shirts and shorts, I had to go to an Express the day before to pick up a new dress shirt to use. Unfortunately I didn't bring dress/leather shoes but their site didn't say anything about not allowing tennis shoes/etc. Only thing mentioned that was not allowed, shoe-wear wise was flip-flops/sandals. We had tried calling prior to leaving our apartment in Brooklyn, before dinner, to confirm on their dress policy, but no one answered. Our original plan was to come here after dinner around 9ish 10pm. When we had arrived, we were told there is a private party that booked up the entire venue, and extended their stay and wont be done till midnight/1am or so. We decided to go to a nearby bar to have some drinks, but most important of all, kill some time until then. When we had came back a second time, we were told the party had finished but still were cleaning up, and wont know when it will be open. We had waited probably another 30 minutes or so before the security guard had told us it was open. There was another two groups of people who were waiting as well. When we had rode the elevator up to the lounge and went outside. Oh man, was the view nice. Luckily the rain had stopped this evening so we were able to go outside. The venue itself has a pond of a sort lit by a blue light giving it a nice ambiance outside. You can view the west harbor side of Manhattan from one side as well as the Manhattan skyline on the other. The view itself is amazing. Especially since there is no cover or fee, it definitely is worth coming up if you can. It is a bit away from any underground transportation but the walk is not that bad. The view itself, deserves a good 5 stars. Deducting a star because of the party and the troubles. My friends and I had fun having a little photoshoot. Got some nice pictures for us to remember the visit by.",1,,
116,Nevin B.,"New York, NY",0,20,0,4.0,7/1/2018,Fav spot to have drinks with friends or meet new people.  Everyone is classy and very nice. Drinks are typical for the city.  Only thing that I DON'T like is the music choice. every time I went there was jazz music / elevator type music playing. It's a lovely rooftop lounge why not play some newer music or top 40? Or at least music of people actually singing rather than instrumental only.,,,
117,Lori N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,18,0,3.0,9/16/2018,Service not the best. Took a long time for someone to come back just to tell us the person we had would not be helping us any more and didn't even ask us if we wanted anything else so we left.   View very nice!,,,

It was my first time here this last weekend and I wish it wasn't such a last minute decision to come or else I would have dressed to impressed, like most of the crowd. I came wearing rainbow (thong) flip flops and wasn't sure whether they would let me in. To my relief, the bouncers were all so nice and let me in without a problem. We waited about 30 minutes to get inside and the line moved pretty quickly! The views from the top are beautiful! But it did get pretty crowded, with only a few sofas and tables up for grabs for the early birds. The drinks are pretty expensive but that's expected from a roof top bar. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely return if I'm ever back in the area.",3,3,4

The first couple times the drinks were on point- definitely worth the $20+ but this last time, so disappointed. Drinks were watery, lacking discernable taste. Bland. Ordinary. Not worth ordering another. Sad, they used to make some crazy great drinks to go with the crazy great views. Even typical, non- specialty often ordered drinks were not great. I'd still go for the views, but I'd go with wine/ beer from now on. It's a roof top bar with extraordinary views and plain uneventful drinks. Service was good though, service staff was kind and prompt.",,,1
120,Elizabeth Y.,"Bronx, NY",138,484,256,4.0,4/30/2017,"I agree with everyone. The view here is absolutely amazing and one of the best I've seen so far. Even on a chilly and windy night, it's worth the view. They also have blankets and gas fireplaces where you can stay warm. Service was friendly and servers kept coming around to check in on us. Our fireplace went out with the wind, and they kept apologizing. I was slightly disappointed with the drinks. I ordered the Chilemango which was way too sweet for me, but not in a candy type of way. It tasted like Siracha or some sweet chile sauce that I just couldn't finish the drink. It's also super expensive here. $20 for a cocktail!!!! Not worth the price or taste.",1,,
121,Cmg G.,"San Francisco, CA",14,25,16,5.0,12/31/2017,"This place deserves 5 stars just for the 360 degrees view from the rooftop. The service is okay, does take the server a lot of time to fetch the drinks  but the wait is worth it. Nice place to wind down your weekend.",,,
122,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,11/24/2017,One of my favorite rooftops in the city. They have really good cocktails. I can just come sit here just for the views! Amazing city views! The dim lightings make for a very cozy romantic atmosphere. They are usually really busy so it'll be hard to get a table if you haven't maids reservations. But you can always just grab a drink and stand out or inside. This place should definitely be on your list of must visit rooftops. The drinks are slightly pricy than what you would get at other places. Ended up paying $43 for two cocktails.,,,
123,Henry M.,"New York, NY",490,188,838,5.0,11/15/2016,"This is arguably one of the most coveted places to spend a Friday night (assuming the weather elements wouldn't kill you and that the rooftop is actually open). On summer evenings, the place is usually crowded for one good reason. There are sweeping panoramic views across city and the Hudson River. To the east, you can see the dazzling lights at Times Square. To the west, there's New Jersey and the Hudson River.The drinks here are excellent too, which change with the seasons. During the winter days, they might use more cinnamon and there's been a time when we had a warm drink. The summer drinks tend to be straightforward refreshing. The menu always changes, so what you saw in July won't be available January or even next July. The drinks are all in the same price range, hovering around $15+. But you come here for the experience and nothing about the place is disappointing. Even when the rooftop deck isn't open, the space inside is really well decorated. There's plenty of seating along the windows and you could also sit inside where there's not much of a view. Great place to meet people, hang out with old friends.",,,

I've been to a few rooftop bars more centrally located with a view of the empire state building/world trade center, but this rooftop gives a different vantage point and you get more of a skyline view. You also get a pretty good view at sunset!They have outdoor and indoor seating, but it looked like part of their outdoor seating wasn't available since it was so cold - maybe they have more in the summer. If you like sweet cocktails, I highly recommend getting the stencil! It was delicious! Drinks are a bit pricey.. but with the ambiance and view, it's definitely worth it!!",1,,1

But once there, you can be assured that you'll have a good time.The service here is really good, and the bouncers let you in without much hassle. The rooftop itself is quite spacious and really well done. They have a lot of comfortable lounge style seating around the space and a great neon lit pool that serves as the focal point of the lounge.

127,Brian D.,"Portland, OR",133,292,1487,5.0,4/8/2016,"- Lights! Models! Guest list! -On my first trip to the Big Apple, I wanted to enjoy a proper cocktail on a rooftop with a view of the city. I checked out a few different options before deciding on this spot located in the Ink48 hotel.We had just finished watching a taping of The Daily Show, and made our way over here. Our girlfriend, who has connections, got us front row VIP tickets with no wait.  I'm not spending my vacation waiting in line for hours, OK! Anyway, we arrived fairly early in the evening before it gets too clubby. There wasn't a line to get in.  We walked into the lobby and were greeted by the bouncer/security guy at the elevator. He informed us they have a dress code, (which we knew), and certain items weren't allowed. My girlfriend with the ""connections"" was wearing flip flops that apparently were one of those items. He said she wouldn't be allowed without a dress shoe. She told the bouncer that they were Steve Madden flip flops and totally acceptable. He looked at her like she was crazy and shook his head.  He wasn't budging, and I was crushed. I made these plans months ago and it didn't look like we were going to have that martini in the sky. Suddenly my other girlfriend pulled a Felix the Cat move :http://youtu.be/amGbBFsiuzc , and pulled out an extra pair of heels from her bag of tricks, and voilà, they fit!  We all laughed at the absurdity of the situation. She put them on and we were admitted. Hooray!We rode the elevator up 16th floor and walked into the bar. The space was was all windows, gloss, and view. It was gorgeous! Trendy, yet tasteful. I was in Heaven, although technically I was in Hell's Kitchen. This was the end of May, and NYC was having a heat wave consisting of 100°days, so we sat outside on a sofa and lounged in the covered area for our first drink.We sipped our cocktails, took in the amazing views, and shared stories of our adventures earlier that day. The vibe was nice.We had one Martini in that spot before moving to the open air area, with a mini-reflecting pool and more expansive views of our surroundings.One could overlook the Hudson River on one side, and Manhattan on the other. The service was professional yet friendly. The drinks were top notch. The restroom situation was a bit screwy. They felt like they were a mile away from our seats outside, and were located up some stairs next to the indoor bar. I'm sure there's been some drunken mishaps on those stairs. The restrooms are single stall, unisex, with each having there own door. After a few drinks this became irritating, as there was no way to know which of the 5 rooms were occupied. It felt like a game show,  à la  The Price is Right. ""Behind this door, we have a ... Sandy Duncan's glass eye! "" They also had little to no ventilation if you catch my drift. My girlfriend left me a nice surprise when it was my turn to use the room that we shared. (Think Grandpa  Fred)Later, there was a bathroom attendant outside. Although he was helpful, it was uncomfortable having him guide you. Tipping him is much appreciated. We ordered a few more martinis, and watched the sunset. When the sun finally settled we could see the bright lights from Times Square.It was highly entertaining to see model types striking poses against the skyline. I wanted to join in on the fun, and did so, but one girl wasn't having it. So serious!It was starting  to get busier and we had other places to go, we had dinner reservations at Dirt Candy in the East Village. I was pretty tipsy when we left. There was a line for the elevator and the restrooms as we exited.We drank here 5-30-2012 Highly recommend.",6,3,1

Press is a good place to stop by after dinner for a few drinks with a nice view. Beers are around $10 and mixed drinks go between $15-20.The best thing about this place is the relaxed atmosphere - no one is forcing you to keep buying drinks or anything like that. You can grab your drink and help yourself to one of the tables outside with a nice view of the NYC skyline. The rooftop is ~20 floors up, so that should help give some perspective on what views you will have. It puts you about 2/5 of the way up to the highest skyscrapers in the city.",2,1,

It got crowded quick and there was no place to sit (even random surfaces on the balcony were filled).

And the prices are substantially more than Yelp reviews had me believe (they must have recently raised prices by 25+%. But the view. Unbelievable. It is a decent but not crazy height up for a rooftop bar. But what sets this place apart is the lack of other tall buildings in the immediate area blocking the view, allowing for impeccable sight-lines both towards Midtown Manhattan and the Hudson River.

If you want to skip the line going up and there will be one on a weekend have dinner first at the restaurant down stairs,after your dinner you tell the hostess you want to go to the lounge and she escort you to the elevator man and they take you straight to the front of the line,kind of VIP treatment. Got to see the sunset. Once upstairs they only have drinks and a very small menu of appetizers so dine first if your hungry before arriving. Might be s bit chilly since it's so high up bring a jacket or they have blankets for you to borrow. Great photo perfect views of the waterfront and new York buildings. Must visit.",,,

Service was fantastic.  Our server asked if we had reservations for dinner downstairs, when we said yes she told us that she would time our service so we would make our reservations without feeling rushed.  A really nice touch and one that we would encounter downstairs as well.  The husband enjoyed his smokey Manhattan and posing for pictures like Don Drapper along the rooftop railing. I had a tequila based drink and it was great. Yes, this place is pricy at $18 a drink (!!) but we were there to celebrate my birthday so it was a special occasion.

The lounge is super chill with couches inside and outside, and also includes a fountain/pool (not sure if you can swim in it). Since its cold out, they have furry throws that you can use to keep yourself warm. ;)This is definitely a place I recommend (and secretly want to not so that it won't get too crowded each time I go).

What keeps you coming back?""Simple: The view...the euphoria you feel overlooking the city with a nice drink...the spaciousness of the rooftop. Damn near everything you've ever looked for in a rooftop lounge is here. Good drinks (although they are on the pricey side: I suggest pregamming if you plan on getting indulged.) Not to mention there is no entrance fee, there is no extreme dress code. The Press Lounge is simply an amazing experience to just overlook NYC and some of Jersey, especially on a nice clear day. Also, don't worry too much if it is rainy or cold out, they have a retractable roof which will keep you warm and enjoy your time here. Press Lounge is more than spacious to come here with a large group of friends or work colleagues for meetings or gatherings. Also a VERY nice place to take a date you really want to impress. Trust me on this ladies and gents, more so gents, you want to get some points with your partner or a potential, yeah...you'd be doing yourself a very good favor taking them here, especially on a clear day/night out.

I was not impressed with the drinks or the service. Drinks: average. Service: subpar. Let me put it this way, you pay for the view. The drinks are quite expensive for the quality. No bottle service and not even a bottle of wine. Quite disappointing. Shelved $150 (tup included) for 3 draft beers, 1 cocktail, 1 club soda and 2 appetizers. The scene does change a bit after 10pm.

The views here are breathtaking. The actual lounge is designed well - as soon as you exit the elevators you can immediately enter the interior or go to the right side and enter the exterior.The exterior has several tables and lounge chairs scattered throughout the areas. It gets busy after 10PM, but before then is pretty manageable at getting a table. We grabbed a table around 8PM on a weeknight and went to the bar to buy drinks. Drinks are generally steeper ($18 each) for cocktails, and more affordable for beers.Sip on your yummy cocktail and enjoy the stunning view!

The Palatino is a great cocktail (can't even taste the vodka - so dangerous, ha), and they can make the mojito virgin if you ask. We came Friday around 6:30pm, and there was no line heading up. The line started forming around 8 - 8:30 according to our friends who trickled in later.You may not get seats, but it's not terribly crowded.

The neon-lighted pool in the middle of the roof top adds so much character to this place, creating a fun and vibrant atmosphere for you to relax and enjoy conversations with friends. The drinks aren't cheap here, for their prices must have included the fees that one will have to pay to enjoy good scenery. I don't quite remember whether the place was playing music or not, but I did feel that it was a relatively quieter lounge for me to have a conversation with people without yelling at them hysterically.

The lounge is at exactly the right story level and Hell's Kitchen location that you feel like you're floating in the middle of the skyline. It's almost a 360 degree panoramic view - the kind that makes you feel like you're Master of the Universe and the kind that reminds you why you deal with the subways and the rats and live in NYC. The chairs are clean and comfortable - low to the ground to make everyone feel cool and at ease. The drinks are quite expensive but well crafted and usually strong. There is an entire hallway of bathrooms on an upper level so your experience at the bar or looking at the skyline is never interrupted by a bathroom line or drama.

Once the elevator opens you see the bar on your left. Then you look to your right you see an AMAZING view of NYC. There are plenty of seats inside and outside. My friends and I decided to sit outside and of course take pictures of that view! Drinks were a bit on the high end but didn't matter to me because I already had a pre buzz going in lol! They had a wide selection of drinks of course. This place is pretty spacious outside as well, on one side you have the view of the city, and if you walk to the other side you have the view of the hudson.

183,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1045,25545,2.0,5/12/2015,"Last Saturday one of my closest friends chose this rooftop bar/lounge to celebrate her birthday at. This seemed like a logical pick as it's within walking distance of her apartment, boasts a fantastic view and it is a nice spend to spend a clear Spring night at.Overall I enjoyed the space very much and the service was pretty great. Beers are $11 each and at one point Ingrid S. and I were frustrated that they cleared our table while we were taking group photos and they went off with 30% of her beer. I said something though and they rectified it so kudos to Press Lounge for providing excellent customer service on this front.What was disappointing was our exit. I found a door right to the elevator banks and disregarded the crowd that wasn't by the more convenient elevator door. My boyfriend (being the sweet ethical man that he is) kindly pointed out to me that there was a line...so we got to the back and slowly shuffled our way up when 3 douchebags began to sneak up on us from the side trying to skip me. I'm Puerto Rican, don't even play, I will elbow you if needed. In making sure they didn't cut me off he made them aware that there was a line and they used foul language that made me want to super saiyan attack them (go look it up, this offensive attack is super nerd cray) but the boy is a gentleman and wields a patience that surely must have been bestowed upon him by the gods. But these asshats ruined my feelings on this place. Overall, Press Lounge can be a fun night and is good for group gatherings, but some of their clientele is rachet. Come for the view, leave when it starts to get late and people get stupid while they drink...also $11 for domestic, big name beers isn't cool anywhere, even if you are attached to a fancypants hotel.",6,14,6

We went up and there was 3 servers/hostesses and we stood there for a good 3 minutes and then finally went up to the group that were chatting amongst themselves. The service was non existent and they just kept telling us ""where ever you want""... And then we sat down and the woman came up, dropped the menus on the table without saying anything and walked away. Then we took a look at the menu and the price of a cocktail was $20, and a class of wine was $15. The price here is steeper than a VEGAS club. Next the lady stood there and basically judged us for ordering two drinks (one each) and wanted to close the tab. She then stood there without saying anything for 3 minutes and my bf and I kept looking at each other like.... And then I was like... I think she wants your card. The service and communication was horrible and for a place like this, the management should prioritize customer service. I also heard the couple around us say the same thing. To be honest they don't even care so you can easily go to this location, go outside take some pictures and leave. It is definitely a great photo location. I suggest coming here right before sun set and staying for all of it and into the night. This place is definitely a 9/10 for photos, and 1/10 for service and value.",8,,1

189,Clare H.,"New York, NY",369,56,130,4.0,5/1/2016,"One of the most talked about roof top bars/lounges in New York City. It features a beautiful scenic view of both the NYC skyline and the Jersey side of the Hudson River. The Press Lounge is located on top floor of the INK48 Hotel, near some major venues in the city such as Terminal 5 and Hudson Terrace Night club.A security/bouncer is always waiting by the elevator that takes you to the roof top. Certain dress code is prohibited (ripped jeans, flip flops, sneakers etc.) and you will be turned away if you're not dressed properly! So be sure to dress appropriately as the bouncer is super strict with the dress policy. One of the best things about this lounge is that it doesn't charge any covers! It is often recommended to come before 10 PM to avoid any long lines.Once arriving to the roof top, you will be greeted by a very upscale environment along with servers walking around with drinks and greeting customers. Comfortable couches and tables are placed on the corners inside the bar and outdoor roof top area. People tend to grab a drink, then take a seat on the couches while embracing the beautiful scenery and chat away with their friends and companions.A rectangular shaped pool is located in the middle of the outdoor area and it lights up during night time. Whether people are allowed to do skinny dipping during the summer or not, that I will find out when I return later on when the weather gets warmer. (I believe it is more for decoration design purpose)Drinks wise it is extremely expensive: $14 for wine and $18 for cocktails (Tax included). There aren't much food options neither: cheese platter, Salami platter, hummus, mixed nuts and olives. I wouldn't recommend if you're here in hopes to get drinks and food at the same time (especially if you're starving), it is definitely more of a pre-game spot for the evening or group gathering/hang out for the night and date spot. But seriously, hands down one of the best roof top bars/lounges in the entire NYC! Just the scenery alone is worth a thousand words.",4,1,
190,Carissa G.,"San Francisco, CA",629,165,424,5.0,7/11/2016,"My favorite roof top bar in NYC as of now. There's still a ton on my list to check out but out of the 8 or so I've been to in the city, this view is my favorite. It's quite the trek here from the Times Square train station but it's worth the walk over. Came here for a birthday celebration on a Friday night and it was packed. Had to wait a bit in line before going in but it's worth it. Will definitely be back!",1,,1
191,James H.,"Los Angeles, CA",505,272,360,5.0,9/2/2015,"The view here is just sooooooo dam amazing!!! Probably the best rooftop bar I've ever been to. I'm obsessed with skyline views and this view was just so dam perfect. The view isn't too far removed or close from the city.I came in here on a Thursday with a group of 4. No lines and we went straight up to the top. Once we entered i was in awe of the view. Drinks were standard high class prices of $14 and up for craft cocktails. I got a standard old fashioned and it was great. Inside there is a glass wall but once you walk outside... seriously... yeah im gonna say it again... the freakin view!The bar had enough people to be bumping but there was plenty of outside seating. We were able to get a corner table with seating. Sat there and chilled for a good two hours until about 1am when the bouncer came by and said everyone needed to go inside.Overall, i just cant get passed the skyline view. Drinks were standard. Thursday would be a good night because i bet it's super crowded on weekends.",,,2
192,Caroline G.,"Boston, MA",8,99,107,5.0,7/24/2016,"10 stars actually for this rooftop! It is for sure a favorite in NYC with unrivaled views of the city and the Hudson. On a hot summer sunny day it is absolutely gorgeous up here. My girlfriends and I enjoyed a chilled glass of prosecco while sitting on lounge couches outside enjoying the sun and the views. Have come to learn that it is completely different during the day than at night. During the day, the place is chill and more casual, quieter group just chatting, sitting around. At night, get ready to stand in line and be surrounded by a less causal type of crowd but it is a place for everyone and a gem to bring people not from New York to. I haven't had any food here but who really needs food when there is so much around to take your breath away!",1,,
193,Aki Y.,"New York, NY",12,9,12,5.0,5/13/2016,"There is amazing view. This is my favorite place :)But always windy, must wear jackets. Me and my friends have been there 3 times with dresses. Regret....Anyway, there is great!! Waiters are better than other roof top bars.",3,,

Updated review","Last night in NYC and 2nd time coming here on a Sunday night...good crowd, no wait no cover but $17 cocktails and $11 beer.......yeaaaaa but hey it's got the millionaire view of midtown and you can't beat that, they told us dress code was business casual with no flip flops or hats but I saw ppl wearing shorts and flip flops still -_____-",1,,1
195,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",40,265,41,4.0,8/16/2015,"Being located on the west side of 11th Avenue at 48th St, you get fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline as well as the Hudson River.  The bar is nice and there is a lot of casual outdoor seating.  Bartender knew how to make an excellent caipirinha.  Servers outside were also very attentive.I highly recommend this place and I'll definitely be back!",,1,
196,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",70,302,103,4.0,4/12/2016,"Gorgeous views. Photo ops. Expensive drinks. Come early (~10PM) to avoid the line to get in.Depending on the type of night you're looking to have, I would recommend either pre-gaming before coming, or having a nice relaxing night at the outdoor rooftop bar, by the ""meditation pool"". The overall demographic of the clientele: well-dressed young professionals. There were many tourists on the 2 occasions I visited, and for good reason. Gorgeous views of the city and of New Jersey. Definitely a great date spot! Comparable to PhD Lounge, but seems a little less pretentious to me.",3,,1
197,Amanda C.,"New Orleans, LA",304,642,85,4.0,3/11/2016,"Yes, the cocktails are expensive, but so is every other place with a roof. At least Press Lounge has incredibly attentive, unpretentious staff, and a really great view. We didn't have to deal with any door drama or flagging down people for our orders. The roof is very roomy with couches, chairs, and the border of the fountain are as sitting spots. You can have your pick of a view of the, city, the Hudson, or both. They don't really offer a southern view, but that's ok. Drinks are $18, beers are pricey, but a large flute of prosecco is $13, which isn't too bad.",5,1,3
198,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",180,220,726,4.0,6/24/2016,"It was my first time at the Press Lounge rooftop and I had a fabulous time here! For Thursday night it was decently crowded, and we got no hassle at entry which was great. It s located on the 16th floor right next to the hudson- so on one side there's a beautiful view of the river and on the other- of the midtown. I am already in love with this city but coming here made me fall in love with it all over.The one thing that I particularly liked about the rooftop of Press Lounge is the lighting which was just perfectly dim and allowed one to soak in the beauty of the night in the city all the more. I have been to some rooftops before which are overly lit up with LED lights and that for me really takes away from the rooftop experience- so glad this place chooses to be classy like that!I had the rum with blackberry cocktail(forgetting it's name, starts with S) which was one of the best cocktails I have had. My friends seem to like their drinks too. Why I took off one star is because of the selection of food items here. I get that this place is to come for drinks and nibble, but even for nibblers I would ve liked a better selection of food besides the cheese platter with average cheese, average cold cuts and salted nuts. The bread tasted stale and through my time I here I kept wishing for some nice tasting appetizers. Next time I ll probably fill myself a bit before coming here.",1,,
199,Amy G.,"Nutley, NJ",42,77,1212,3.0,2/4/2017,Great rooftop but has changed a bit since it's been open. This rooftop is more of a romantic couples place. So for all you love birds who want a beautiful Romantic spot to take your loved one this is the place.  the menu is very limited and same for the cocktail menu. :(  the views are amazing though!!!  They have heat lamps so don't worry about being chilly beside you should have your loved one with you to cuddle,2,,
