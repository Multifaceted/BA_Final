0,Julie G.,"Raleigh, NC",12,52,16,4.0,10/1/2018,No matter where I fly into I always have to stop by the Tim Hortons in Penn Station. Originally from New England I grew up on Tim Hortons and the one in Penn Station is the nearest one I will ever go to. I have to stop info a nice hot coffee and some Tim Bits. The staff is always friendly and quick with order. The only thing that is kind of a pain is the seating; this location has 4 other fast food places within the one seating area so it is a little tough to find a place to sit for a few minutes. During my visits to the city I always make sure this is my first and last stop with multiple trips in between.,,,
1,Linda T.,"Queens, NY",130,318,1184,4.0,1/14/2018,"I have been coming to this Timmy's to get my breakfast combo set before departing for work day trips to Albany. I only got the sausage, egg, and cheese in English muffin combo and it comes with hash browns and coffee / juice. The food has been pretty delicious every time. Breakfast combos costs between $6-7 and prices vary depending on what you get. The lines are pretty empty at 7:30am and there's usually two staff on duty (i.e One person is the cashier and the other is making the breakfast orders). There's also seating here too and it's shared with other fast food chains.",2,,2
2,Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",1209,4552,31449,1.0,2/3/2016,"This location is in Penn Station. There are some other fast food brands tucked in with them: Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Nathans - to name a few.I stopped in to grab some breakfast before my train back to Union Station and Washington, DC.I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese on an English muffin, a hash brown, and a small cup of coffee. The food came up fast - to fast. They apparently don't know how to properly toast an English muffin - as it was basically untested. The hash brown had been out far to long, biting into it was almost like beef jerky. The coffee was okay - but not good enough to raise the overall rating.Will steer clear of this location in the future...",3,,1
3,Mike G.,"South Amboy, NJ",1,84,1,1.0,3/9/2018,At this location they advertise all day breakfast. They lie ! Why post breakfast all day when it's not true. Go to shake shack they don't lie.,,,
4,Renee G.,"Emeryville, CA",359,51,7,3.0,1/8/2013,"Ok, this is literally a teeny window right next to Penn Station, but it does what it's supposed to do very well: give you a covered place to duck in, grab a coffee and donut, and pretend you don't look like a clueless tourist while you're searching for your friend, whom you foolishly told to meet you ""outside Penn Station"". Nice attempt, Einstein.Coffee was hot; donut was serviceable.",,,
