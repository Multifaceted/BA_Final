Updated review",I was never offered an additional two weeks to come back in. I also had a WONDERFUL experience at your Soho location with Kathleen. She was the best of the best but unfortunately she moved to Australia.,1,,
3,Nina E.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",0,10,5,5.0,6/30/2018,I'm so picky that I used to cut my own hair! One special day Sandra cut my hair and I'm not sure if i can explain in words how I felt after. She listens so well and understands exactly what I want. She knows how to work with my face shape. I always feel extra pretty after a do from Sandra! The cut grows out so perfectly even when I don't get a chance to come in for a trim. Her blow dry and style for special events are perfection! I recently had a maternity photoshoot and I will treasure these photos forever! Thank you so much Sandra!,,,
4,Molly Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,107,52,5.0,10/23/2017,This is an appointment I look forward to. The entire vibe on this place pleases me. Everyone is kind. It is beautiful. The lighting is soft and doesn't make you look like a monster when you have your robe on and wet hair. The music is at the perfect level that allows you to converse or zone out- whatever your preference. Julie has been cutting my hair for a few years now and it is the best cut I have ever had. My hair just works. It does things I couldn't make it do if I tried. Like- she just gets it and does such a great job. They also have amazing treatments they can do when you get your hair washed. At only $35 (booster and the new split end repair are the ones I have done) it is a great value and so worth it. Ask about one! I adore Julie. I adore this salon. The location is super easy to commute to. Appointments are smooth to book online or over the phone. I also love that appointment starts and finishes in the window/time frame you book- so you can easily run out on your lunch break or before work or before dinner and you know you will finish on time. A+! Thank you Julie!!!!!!!,,,1

And expertly cut my hair allaying all my concerns -- go enjoy the service, feeling pampered ( can a guy feel pampered??) and bring your gold card. Services very expensive but I guess that's what it takes to be across the street from Trump Tower. All good. Go and see Hanna.",2,2,1

Updated review","Another day another 5 star haircut with Hana lol!  I've been getting my hair cut with Hana for at least 7 years now and all I can say is she is the BEST.  I'm so happy with my haircut which looks so sleek despite walking around in NYC humidity!  The salon is so relaxing, I treat myself and Hana's haircuts are worth every penny!  Highly recommend!",,,
9,Boo B.,"New York, NY",0,17,0,5.0,12/31/2017,"Fabulous hair salon in a beautiful Fifth Avenue space.  I love my stylist Tomo who gives the best haircuts of all the hairstylists I have tried in New York for the past 15 years!!!!  He is also just such a lovely person to know; and you can tell he genuinely cares about his clients a lot.  In addition, all the staff at Fekkai are great- I have never sat for more than a minute before my appointment without someone coming to ask who I am waiting for.  I don't color my hair; but my Mom gets her hair cut and colored here, and she always gets compliments on her color, too.  Two thumbs up!",,2,

The salon is beautiful, smells amazing, and everyone there is so nice. You are treated like a celebrity and when you walk out you'll look like one. The staff is the best of the best. This is the type of salon you expect from Manhattan. Bonus: it's located in Henri Bendels so if you show up early you can shop. Pro Tip: they're open every day but Sundays are easiest to get appointments.",2,,1
11,Sloane R.,"Cambridge, MA",1,31,0,3.0,10/15/2016,"Went there for a blow dry and make up for a black tie event. Four stars for make up, 2 stars for the hair cut/ blow dry.The stylist offered to cut my hair a bit before the blow dry, so why not? Well this ended up being a very bad idea: the stylist cut my hair into a layered bob that looked so dated (think Joey Tempest in the 80s), it left me on the verge of tears. Another stylist came later to try to salvage it, but it was too late: you cannot save a heavy metal inspired hairstyle unless you cut everything. And at this point I was too scared to cut anything more.Make up was great though and the make up artist (a young woman) was lovely. Will be back for make up, but never again for my hair.",8,,
12,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,5.0,12/4/2015,"Frederic Fekkai is the Creme de la Creme of hair salons.  Frederic created this salon for the most demanding woman because he knows that she believes that her hair is 'privileged'.  It's hard to find a good salon in New York, especially one I could trust.  I filtered through local salons and couldn't bring myself to trust any of them with my hair due to past prior experiences so I ended my torment and called FF to make an appointment.Same day appointments don't usually happen but I was lucky.  Apparently when NYers escape during the holiday, there is more opportunity for the NYers who stayed behind to get their hair done. I noticed the SoHo location was closed Sunday and Monday so I opted for the Fifth Avenue location. The address is 721 5th Avenue located on the 4th floor of Henri Bendel's.  If you ever enter through the corporate office around the corner, there are doors leading to Bendel's.  Regardless of which way you enter, you can go up the wide wooden staircase or elegant elevators.Upon entry, you're greeted by the receptionist who checks you in.  While they check to confirm your appointment, you realize the atmosphere is an understated elegance that while caters to the (usually cold) Upper East Side there's still a certain warmth to it.  The receptionist gave me a tour once she learned she hadn't been there before.  To the side there was the makeup and mani/pedi station while opposite there was a waiting lounge with a well lit wall displaying nearly all of FF's hair products.  The receptionist instructed me to put a brown FF robe over my outfit and to hang my coat in the closet.  Odd, since I was getting the red carpet everywhere else there but that's just an observation rather than me actually having a problem with that.  As soon as I came out of the changing room with my robe, Sonia, my stylist, was already there with Monica, who would wash my hair, and I was escorted to my station.  Sonia sat me down, touched my hair asking, ""So, tell me everything! What are we doing today?"" Sonia and I spoke briefly for a few minutes so we were aligned.  The conversation was about my vision and her professional input on what she could do to meet my expectations. Earlier this year I played with my hair color at another salon and I felt lost as to where to go in the future should I want to color my hair again.  Sonia rattled off the treatments they offered and offered to introduce me to a colorist at the end of my appointment.  Monica asked me what products I would like to use.  I had none in mind, so she asked me to describe my hair and offered a masque since my hair was dehydrated.  She explained the products she would use before tasking her time washing my hair presumably to give products time to soak into my hair and roots.  It was heaven the entire time - I had seriously never been more relaxed.  Afterwards, she explained that the products she used would be in the front for me to look at and ultimately purchased (obvs).  Walking back to the station, she stopped to ask if I would care for water, either cucumber or orange infused.  I opted for cucumber, which was served to me in a perfectly chilled glass with a lemon wedge clinging to it all the while on a napkin atop a little plate.  Sonia's hand ran through my hair and she noted the difference in my hair after my wash. She educated me on the products, my kind of hair and what it needs, how often to wash my hair and use products.  At some points I stood up so she could reach me but it was well worth it. Sonia was extremely focused and precise and above all incredibly polite.  As my hair fell to the ground, a member of the staff quickly cleaned it up.  I also had time to notice that some of the brushes had a label wrapped around them clearly stating their were sterilized and ready for use. I've never seen this before but it was comforting yet not surprising FF had this on their products. While observing my chic, comfortable surroundings my phone rang. I was distracted but not enough to note how Sonia seemed to be internally critiquing her work and continued to  transform my hair from dry, long and boring to hydrated, slightly shorter with side swept bangs.  To keep my hair from being dull, Soniya went over my hair with a small barrel curling iron to give it some body.  The end result was my hair looking sophisticated, playful, shorter with no more split ends in sight.  Ultimately, Sonia met my expectations for a high quality cut but as I left, she effortlessly exceeded my expectations with her incredible customer service and personally introduced me to a colorist she felt would work best with my hair.  There was a proper name introduction and Sonia was there while the colorist and I spoke. Before I left, the products used were put aside for me prior to payment and I was offered a free 'touch-up' in their makeup station. From the beginning to the end of my experience, this was worth the splurge for the luxury and performance of this pleasurable salon.",3,5,
13,Janie T.,"NY, NY",0,52,0,2.0,4/28/2017,"I have been going to this salon or two years.  Reyard does my highlights He is goodbut,  he is a cookie cutter colorist.  Everyone he highlights has the same highlights inthe same place - like an assembly row of cars.  Very phony - the higher the tipthe more interested in you he is.  He has  horrible ass't who really should be firedfor not giving the appropriate attention to clients when sitting in her chair waitingfor washout of treatment or color and she disappears and shows up when she pleases.As for the complimentary blow out - they are really beyond inadequate.  Not one ofthem can do a straight blowout and they are not permitted to use a hot iron on hair.There has to be a salon in this city that does better highlighting then this one.  Recommendations welcome.",5,1,1

18,Andrew H.,"Lisbon, Portugal",123,587,111,1.0,7/26/2014,"This is a very high quality salon - they cut, color, and style hair exceedingly well. Let's get that out of the way.My girlfriend got a very expensive hair coloring treatment here. In the middle of it, they asked if she wanted to get the edges trimmed, without mentioning a price. At the coloring station, a stylist trimmed the ends of her hair for five minutes while she was still standing up.At the end, they charged her $165 for this five minute ""haircut"" on top of the several hundred dollar coloring treatment. We asked them why this was. A manager came out and said she was very sorry and understood our position but couldn't do anything about the price. We mentioned that they did not tell her the price and they had told us the price of everything else beforehand. They said they had followed standard practice in hair salons in New York. I mentioned that I would write a yelp review about this. They offered to give us product but still wouldn't reduce the price.To add insult to injury, the cashier admitted that they typically wouldn't charge for a bang trim (essentially what this was) for their regular customers, but it was our first time.It's funny how they made a point about how they only give starting prices before the coloring service and would inform us of the price after a consultation before they start it, but then they would not mention the price of a $165 bang trim. It reminds me of a story about a couple of Japanese tourists spending $720 on a manhattan pedicab ride (newyork.cbslocal.com/201…) - because this felt like a scam. There is no way she would have agreed to pay this if they had actually informed her of the price. I guess the advice here is to always ask how much anything they offer you will cost.",53,3,2

24,Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",391,741,425,1.0,9/16/2013,"I wanted to start off by saying that I was doing hair modeling for this location and another location a couple of years ago. I typed an email to the woman in charge of sending out the reservation emails immediately after going to the salon (6/12). Below is what I wrote to her with no response, of course:I just wanted to say that I had a terrible experience last night. Every time I go to the 5th Ave location it's always something. Molly (student) did an amazing job but the old brunette instructor should not be instructing a thing. She needs to be instructed on how to do hair. My hair is long and thick and she took over Molly's instructional class and called herself finishing half of my hair. She yanked my hair and head because she assumed that it was the appropriate way to deal with my type of hair when it is not! The section that the instructor did is puffy and kinky because she tried to dry my hair without straightening it to make it more manageable. I've been dealing with my hair for 12 years and if she wanted to know what works best all she had to do was ask.My hair drys fast so she needed to keep it damp. Instead she practically tried to rip my hair out of my head trying to dry it. Molly tried to salvage the damage but she couldn't because she would've had to wet my hair again and start all over. The sections that Molly did I liked but the instructor did the middle of my hair and I was not pleased. While the instructor is supposed to be there to help she completely took over and dominated. So now the middle of my head is frizzy and kinky while everything else is straight. Then when Molly tried to go over the ruined sections the instructor said this is as good as it is going to get since my hair is thick.You can remove me from the database, I will not be coming back. There's always one snotty person at the 5th Ave salon. Last August it was a feminine male instructor who thought it was appropriate to talk about my hair color and my hair texture. He stomped around like the little child that he is because my thick, long hair was making him late for his oh so important dinner reservations. That's YOUR job and if you didn't want to be there don't come to work. No need to make the experience unpleasant for everyone because you were in a nasty mood. I should not have to feel bad because I have a lot of hair. I love my hair and they will NOT make me feel that way again. Thank you.",33,4,3

Great experience. Also went to Victoria, the eyebrow specialist and she gave my eyebrows such a nice shape.

Their shampoo service is relaxing and the atmosphere here is spacious and enjoyable. My experience with Kenji hasn't yet impressed me because I have wavy hair and the waves now just look like a mess..

33,Laura P.,"New York, NY",16,26,0,1.0,10/11/2016,"I was extremely disappointed with their service. I went in for color and requested a dark plum but turned out to be just a reddish tint brown. My hair is very shiny naturally but after the  dying process it lost its luster(when it should be the opposite-radiant and beautiful). I wasn't even asked at the end how I like the final result. And on top of it all, you can't add tip when you pay by credit card for their service($200 for color) so you have to use their ATM and pay a $2.75 fee. I feel like they nickel and dime you for everything because they have a big name behind but they don't really care about their customers leaving satisfied. Next day I went to a different salon, Eva Scrivo, for a nice cut and they couldn't believe I just had my hair dyed the day before. No color, no shine,can't even tell the difference.

37,Rebecca C.,"Manhattan, NY",27,5,1,1.0,4/30/2013,"Came here for highlights after visiting another of their salons in California.Waste of money - Almost $700 after tips.I was very specific about the highlights I wanted and gave pictures. DID not listen at all and did highlights that the next salon I went to called ""Jersey Girl"" highlights. It was so bad friends made comments - even MEN.The highlights were patchy - and not just too thick highlights but patches of half the the strand was brown and the bottom half was blonde. I had to part my hair a certain way just to leave the house.First Visit - $480 including tip. I only tipped because they told me I just had to get used to the dramatic color change. Used to the contrast of the polka dots in my hair? It was orange and I was very upset but they made me feel like I just had to get used to it.It was AWFUL.Second Visit - 2 Days later. They KILLED my hair this time. I was no longer orange but I was too blond and my hair was FRIED. My hair was perfect before I came here. I got home and my hair was falling out and breaking. The ""roots"" were still awful with stripes and polka dots. I called and they said to come in for a consultation with someone else. They gave me a free haircut which then cost me like $70 in tips. (The haircut stylist was fine but I didn't need a haircut until I went to Fekkai, I had just had one two weeks prior to the highlights).Third Visit - A month later. I couldn't stand the horrible job they did. It was so cheap looking. I could have done a better job myself at home. They did not charge me but they also didn't DO anything. He put in a few highlights telling me my hair was too damaged for much more. I went home and it looked like he did nothing. The polka dot which I specifically pointed out was still there. The roots were there. I have no idea what he did or why I tipped a $100 to him and his assistant (at least the assistant did a good blowout).I was practically crying. I was so upset, not just at the money but my ruined hair. I NEVER should have gone to Fekkai. I have heard nothing but bad things since from other people.GO somewhere ELSE for color!! I was so upset and looked on FB for a friend that could help me. I looked at his work, and used his referral for a colorist at the high end salon where he works.

Twice.Well, truth beknown I was really there on holiday and thought I'd splash out. Let me get straight to the point: Fekkai gave me the best hair I've ever had. My stylist was Brandon, who was absolutely brilliant. He exceeded all my expectations.He is precise, fussy and a perfectionist; all qualities you want in a hairdresser. The salon itself is on the top floor of Henri Bendel and is elegant and understated without being cold. The service is prompt and friendly - without prying too much into your personal life. Bonus points.The initial consultation is what impressed me the most about the salon: from standing in front of a full-length mirror while we discussed my new 'do, to my stylist Brandon playing with my hair in it's natural state to see how it fell. He didn't just cut my hair; he gave me a new 'look'.Don't be fooled - this place is not cheap. In fact, it's expensive, but when it comes to hairdressers, I really do believe you get what you pay for. And Fekkai is worth every hard-earned penny.

Updated review","After my bad experience, I spent a week hating my hair before finally deciding to call and complain.  I was told no manager could help me at that moment, but was invited to leave a message and told that I would be called back the next day.  No call.So I called the following weekend and left another message for a manager.  This time I got a call back.I was a little put-off when the first person to speak was the colorist.  I didn't want to offend someone who makes their living doing this, and was really hoping to speak to the manager about my issues.The colorist said there must have been confusion between us as she thought she was clear with what I wanted.  I eventually talked directly to the manager who said I can come in the following weekend to have it fixed.  He asked if I preferred to go with another colorist, and since I was trying to avoid any awkwardness, I said yes.He then called me back to tell me that because I had booked the coloring on a deal, I had to go back to the same person.  I wasn't pleased, but I figured she would be professional and hoped for the best.I just went back on Saturday and it seems there was definitely some confusion of what she told me compared to what I was expecting.  A manager warmly came over and helped with the consult, and we all agreed that it was best to try to take out some of the color and put on a glaze to just boost my natural color.  I was impressed at how professional the colorist was, even after knowing I had complained.Well... she did a GREAT job with my hair.  It's a fantastic color, much more what I was expecting.  I then received the complimentary blowout and it's absolutely fantastic, even 3 days later.  I had to wait a bit for it, but it was clearly communicated upfront this time.Had this been my first experience, it would have been a 4 or 5 star one.  Since it was a redo, I'm averaging it out to a 3.I'm not sure if I'll go back, but I'm glad they did the right thing.",17,4,2

48,Opinionated B.,"New York, NY",117,307,45,3.0,5/22/2011,"So, with a combination of bad genes and a stressful job, I've started getting noticeable gray hairs at the age of 25.  Understandable since both my parents were gray at the age of 30.  Hey, at least I won't go bald!! (omg omg omg fingers crossed knock on wood)So yes, with the gray hairs, I decided it was time to have my hair colored.  I'd done some box dyes as I was a teen, when I wanted asian pop star blond hair, and my parents refused and made me get the dark brown color (in retrospect, thank you mom and dad).  But, this was the very first time I'd legit walked into a salon and gotten my hair colored professionally and for good reason.    So, expectations were high.  I walked in and was showered with smiles and lovely greetings and excellent manners.  I explained that I wanted to cover up my grays, but I still wanted my hair color to look natural (none of that goth black color), and maybe even a tiny bit lighter for spring.  My colorist recommended a demi dye, since it's softer, gives a more natural look, and is less damaging.  The results were amazing at first.  The new color was PERFECTION and I didn't see any grays anymore.  This was followed by one of the most amazing blow-outs I have ever received in my life, and a free make-up touch up, which was kind of waste of time.  The make up artist wasn't that friendly, and I didn't like what he did.  Though, the make up did stay on for the rest of the day without any smudge!So now, why not a 5 star.  Well, the demi dye washed out pretty quickly (and I used color protection shampoo + conditioner).  Like, three days afterwards.. I noticed that there were still a few grays (about 5-7) streaming from the middle of my head.  I'm not sure if these were just never covered up in the first place, or if these gray hairs just don't take dye very well, or if the color washed out very quickly??? I have no idea.I called the salon, and they offered to dye it again for free, but this time with permanent dye.  I thought about taking them up on the offer, but I didn't really want to dye my hair twice in such a short time span.    It's very hard for me to judge since this is the first time I'm getting my hair done professionally, and only the second time I've ever had dye in my hair.... but, I kind of expected better results for $135 (not including tax tip).  And I feel really bad giving a measly 3 star because my colorist was SO NICE and friendly, and for all we know it could just be my stubborn hair.  But, I just can't really say that i'm a fan of this place.  And I will most likely try a few more salons before I consider returning.",10,2,1

The products, first of all, are incredible - my stylist gave me a proper head massage during the wash, as she gently removed dirt and residue with a wonderful shampoo. My stylist, by the way, was incredibly sweet and offered lots of advice on maintaining my hair at home. She carefully blow dried my hair, used a brush for volume, then styled it with bouncy, girly curls...well, I may be about to give up blow dry bars entirely if this is what a real blowout looks and feels and moves like.",1,,

Marc is a senior stylist and more technically adept...but he has his own ideas about your hair. I need a little bit of a push and I like his style so i prefer him. Hana will give you input but will also give you exactly what you want...no lopping off all your hair when you say you only wan't an inch or two off. I've seen some great cuts from other stylists but don't know their names unfortunately. They only use their own products and the salon is obviously quite high end.

Updated review","Here's the thing about Fekkai: it really, really, really, really matters who cuts your hair.  Roz is awesome but while she was on maternity leave, I tried some other people at Fekkai.  My first haircut without her was so-so.  The guy half-listened to what I wanted, then did what he wanted.  Still, it came out ok.The next time, nightmare.  The hair stylist's next client was already washed and ready in the next chair and she gave me, seriously, the worst haircut I've ever had.  I'm not that picky, but she CHOPPED it up and it was just awful.  She took off like 5 inches when we discussed 2, and just gave me the worst layers ever.  She wasn't paying any attention to what she was doing.  It ended up looking like some wack cross between The Rachel and Carol Brady.  I left so pissed off.  Went downstairs to Bendel, walked around and every time I looked in the mirror was like EWWW.  So I went back (have never done that before), got a manager and complained.  Same hairstylist tried to fix it.  She made it slightly better but still worst haircut EVER.So, long story short, some of the stylists at Fekkai have no idea what they're doing despite working at the fancy-named salon.  Get recommendations and go to them and them only.  I like Roz, never going to anyone else again.",8,,

61,M M.,"Houston, TX",0,9,0,3.0,4/14/2011,"Today was my first visit to this salon. I came here to highlight my hair. I give this salon a three star because I believe they should have communicated their services better for a first time customer. I spoke to a concierge lady named Stephanie and she asked me who I would like to receive the service from. I responded, it is my first time in this salon and I would appreciate if she could recommend me the best person available and she certainly fulfilled of that.. The ladies, Lori Chica and her assistant, who did complete the highlighting, conditioning and washing my hair were fabulous!! The unexpected experience was having to waiting 45 minutes to get service to do a blow dry after washing my hair. I was shocked. The assistant of Lori finished rinsing my hair informed me that I have the following three choices to make in this VERY expensive 5 star salon:1) I can get an immediate stylist for an additional $75 above the $365 highlighting service already rendered2) Do the hair drying myself, hence Frederic Fakkai staff does not dry your hair, YOU doOR3) Wait 45 minutes to receive a blow dry.  On a Thursday afternoon apparently in this most sophisticated salon there is only one staff member assigned to blow dry hair for those who pay $365 for highlights or any hair coloring who is NOT presently available.I complained to Jannet, one of the manager's crew that this is not acceptable. She heard my concern and I only had to wait 30 minutes instead if 45 minutes. She tried her very best.When it was my turn to get the blow dry from the only staff member assigned to this position, Mirna, I ask her to flat iron my hair on the sides. She responded that she does not have a flat iron. I was shocked again. A five star salon that has one staff member to blow dry for those who pay for a highlighting service of $365 on a Thursday afternoon does not have a flat iron expressed to Mirna that I go to Warren Tricomi, a fair competitor and they do not have such fragmented unexpected service. She was surprised. At the end Mirna did an okay job, not a five star service blow dry.At the end I want to make the following points:I found it surprising that when one pays so much for a highlighting service, a blow dry is not immediately followed up and there is a wait of up to 45 minutes but the highlights did come out beautifully and Lori needs to be recognized for providing such a fantastic serviceI have highlighted my hair for 20 years from three star to five star salons and this has never happened to me. Stephanie knew I was a first-time client and she should have informed me to reserve for a blow dry as well since the culture here is not to include blow dry in the reservation.",9,1,1

The next day an honest friend at work said, ""Oh dear, that's not good, is it?""  ""Dreadful cut + worst hairdresser + inadequate front desk service = $250 at Frederic Fekkai.I wrote the company a letter (a proper one, not an email) explaining my disappointment.  They did not reply.",4,1,

67,Moe B.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,20,0,5.0,7/4/2011,"Let me tell you- I have a LONG history with Frederic Fekkai.  My first experience here was at 16 (many long years ago) when my parents gifted me with a haircut and makeup application for my birthday.  At the time, I got one of the best haircuts of my life from none other than John Barrett, when he worked there (in the old Chanel bldg).  Okay, fast forward about 10 years.  That was my lone experience there, as my family couldn't afford haircuts like that for me as a teenager on a regular basis.  At 26, I was working for a publication that did regular makeovers for women, and I was over-seeing the process.  I was offered a free haircut and color by stylists who were just starting out at the time.  They were none other than Elie (cut) and Reyad (color).  Elie was in the start of his career and Reyad had just been flown in from Paris.  I enjoyed many a discounted cut, but fast forward 5 years and although I am not at the publication anymore I still HAPPILY pay full price for my cut and color. Elie has been cutting my hair ever since, and I would go to no one else.  He listens to me, but makes suggestions and steers me in the right direction.  I've never had a bad cut from him, and my hair always looks sexy and lush when I walk out of there.  He has an infectious smile and is a truly caring person.  I've recommended many friends and family there, and before my mom's passing, he gave her a cute short cut to ease hair loss, as well as looked at her wigs to suggest styling.  He truly loves to cut and style hair, and you can tell that within a few minutes of talking to him- his technique is impeccable.  He always guides and teaches all of his assistants.  My dad would always accompany my mom to our haircuts and will even stop by to stay hi to him when in the area, that is how much we enjoy him not only as a stylist, but as a person. Reyad is also a great colorist- he gives perfectly beachy highlights via the balyage technique.  I get compliments all the time.  I hadn't colored my hair in a few years and recently decided to go in for highlights, and left with exactly what I wanted (I did be sure to bring in pictures with me- I left with the Rachel Bilson/Lily Aldridge ombre).  He doesn't use foils on dark hair (they are so tragic!!) and leaves brunettes looking sun kissed and gorgeous, with an easy grow out process and roots that don't need regular touching up.",2,1,

The salon itself creates a very calm, soothing environment - you're escorted everywhere by uniformed staff and they will cover your purse in plastic so that it's totally safe from dye, water and styling products (necessary here, because everyone seems to carry an expensive bag). They will also order in lunch for clients who are spending the day there - easy when you're having lots of color done. My only complaint is that you need to wrestle with the crowds in Henri Bendel on your way up to an appointment. Tip: Get an early morning appointment before the store opens. Staff is waiting at the locked front doors to usher you in to the salon and once there, they have full coffee service.",,1,
75,Rebekkah K.,"Manhattan, NY",54,145,9,5.0,12/31/2012,"I came here as a part of a promotion offered through work and I am so happy I did. While the money is not in my pockets to go splurge on a haircut every month, I feel this is a place I could go back to maybe quarterly (?) or gift someone the pleasure of going here as well. First off, it's location was convenient for me, even though 5th avenue is PACKED this time of year (or any time year for that matter), second reservations were easy to make and the woman was super friendly on the phone... I had a same day reservation so I leftI stormed in to Henri Bendel in my day off pajamas and took the elevator to the 4th floor for Frederic Fekkai. When I got upstairs, I have to admit I was kind of thinking they would judge me hard core for being dress the way I was, but they were super friendly, the woman at the desk greeted me, led me to get a robe on, offered me a drink, then introduced me to my stylists assistant who was also super nice. The SA did a great job getting my hair prepped for a cut and was perfect at making small talk, very knowledgeable about hair too. I think what I took away from this haircut most (besides the awesome new 'do) is that these guys know a lot about products, and not just ones they want to sell you for commission but they know what's out there and good for your hair. I was told about products in any price range from any store that would help what I was looking to do with my hair. When it came time to meet my stylist, Ros, who I was told is great with short hair (something that always concerns me),  she got right to it and we had great conversation all the while. I would recommend her to anyone, she was just really a breath of fresh air in the world that is upscale hair salons in touristy areas. So with all this said, my hair turned out great, if you can go, go here.",1,1,1
76,Harlow G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,5,5.0,1/30/2013,"After extensive searching around the city for a new hair stylist (my previous stylist moved away from NY!), I came across a review of the Frederic Fekkai Salon and thought I would give it a try. This salon used to be at the Bergdorf Goodman building years ago and now resides in the same building as the Henri Bendel's department store (it's located on the very desirable top floor and it is smartly and handsomely designed). The Fekkai salon is the real deal in terms of high-end, luxury service and what makes it even yummier is that they list their pricing at competitive rates -the costs at Fekkai are comparable to that of any of the upscale studios around the city, so yes it is more than say an Aveda salon for instance, but in actuality not by that much. Also, at the same time they do not charge you ridiculous hidden fees, but to be sure on pricing just call them in advance and ask about service costs and they'll happily help you on that end. As with any studio, you need to find the right stylist that fits your needs (I spoke with someone over the phone to discuss what I was looking for in a stylist and they scheduled me to come in and meet a stylist based off of my requests). For me it was Raymond. He is  undoubtedly the best stylist I have ever had! He really takes the time to get it right (not only with killer cuts, but he's also equally amazing with styling hair for big events). Also, Raymond will push back if he thinks you are going down the wrong path with regards to style. He is a professional that really understands that every service needs to be personalized per the customer, as not each client is the same. In addition, I really enjoy the general staff at Fekkai, as they go out of their way to pamper you and make you feel like a celebrity regardless of your social standing. Outside of Raymond, I would also recommend Michael, who is so talented too (when Raymond was on vaca I had Michael do my hair for an event and he did an amazing job). Suffice it to say, whether you are a local here in the city or even if you are just visiting for a short time, then you should give this studio a go. They will be sure not to disappoint!",1,,
77,Evangeline K.,"Manhattan, NY",465,105,128,4.0,12/11/2011,"I come here all the time for my hair color and hair cut. For my color I see Frida and for cut Brandon. I made the mistake of going to Alma G's hair salon to get a quick hair cut the other day and it made me realize how much i love Brandon's cuts. I'll never stray again. Fekkai is a huge salon located inside the Henry Bendel building. The prices are high but the end product is worth it. My one complaint is about their blow drys, they take forever and do not always turn out well. You also cannot schedule one with who you want. For instance I love how Tory does my hair but since he is not senior enough I think you cannot make an appointment specifically with him. They are also completely over priced if that's all you want to come in for. But for color or a cut the price is well worth it, and the blow dry is included. Hungry while waiting for your color to set? They have a menu to order lunch from while they are serving you champagne. Way to make the time fly by.",5,2,1

79,Natalie B.,"Greenwich, CT",26,108,0,5.0,9/7/2009,"For my birthday, my boyfriend treated me to a cut and color (full highlights to be exact) at the Frederic Fekkai Salon on Fifth Ave.  Since it'd been almost 7 months since my last salon visit at a salon in my hometown in Florida, my hair desperately needed quality treatment.  My boyfriend is pretty particular when it comes to hair - the lady who does his teaches at the Carsten's Institute (her father also owns the school).  Naturally he would have had her do my hair but she was booked until end of October - so he asked her for an alternative salon to take care of the disaster atop my head.  She suggested Fekkai - noting that though pricey, the staff really know what they're doing and always deliver above and beyond.  To her credit, I agree.I arrived 30 minutes early on Friday and, luckily, the colorist (Brooklyn) takes me upon my arrival (woohoo!).  He is fantastic - diligently highlights my hair and does a fantastic (actually, the BEST) job.  Those you usually get full highlights know it's a time-consuming process, even more so at higher end places (a highlight job I had at Bumble & Bumble took over 2 hours!), so he was fairly quick without diminishing the quality of his work.Post coloring & wash, I head over to Vivian who is a young, energetic stylist with a bubbly personality.  She has me stand for a good portion of the haircut in order to make a better cut and assessment of how the hair falls when at a more proper and realistic posture.  Having trained at the Carsten Institute, she informs me of the superior quality of the curriculum there - which she proves herself in delivering a fabulous and very flattering cut and superb blow-out.  Overall, the time it took for a full highlight and cut was 3 hours - not bad considering I felt very pampered and enjoyed the time spent there.  The price was a lot but was less than at Bumble & Bumble (which did a fairly decent coloring but a boring, average, almost below average, hair cut) and I've never felt better about my hair.  I will definitely return since they really deliver more than expected.  I highly suggest going here - they truly know what they are doing!!",7,5,4

What he didn't say was that he was very busy. So the colorist only saw me once in the beginning and all the rest was performed by his assistant. Bottom line, I ended up paying full price for 5 min service with the specialist $330, when hair was all done done by the assistant and not even to have him to check up once in a while. I spoke to the manager, and she asked what I didn't like about the color, asked a way too many questions and said what she could do was to reschedule the service for that moment or no longer than 2 weeks. And nobody ever apologized in ANY moment. I also asked for eyebrow specialist and they sent me to a wax lady just because she was the one available. Pretty much their attitude now is just to not let your money pass, if u gonna get the expected service, that is a MAYBE.",,,

Today I decided to switch to fekkai for my color. I asked who was the best blonde colorist and was scheduled an appointment with Lori. Lori is the most abrasive, rude woman I have ever encountered. She told me she couldn't do my hair because ""I am not meant to be blonde"".  Apparently she was not capable of touching up roots and highlights.  I asked if maybe a darker blonde would be better (because she gave me zero suggestions) and she replied ""you're either blonde or you're not."". In addition, she accosted me in the waiting area, not even get chair, in front of other clients!

I kid you not.  A caveat: With fix-it jobs, they charge a bit more than usual, and my hair was what one would term a ""corrective color"". In other words, I had been a penny-pinching idiot, and trusted my hair to a sub-par salon to save a buck... And wound up with, well, let's just call it ""orange"", shall we? The very next day, I phoned Fekkai in a panic, asking for the next possible appointment. Happily, they were able to accommodate me that afternoon! (Note to self: Mondays are less jam-packed than other days of the week.)  The result? I'm blonde again!  Well, let's call it ""strawberry blonde.""

Walking past the cosmetic counters and getting a ""touch up"" usually will end up turning into a total makeover and over $100 worth of makeup.Frederic Fekkai was smart when he decided to locate his salon in this bustling shopping heaven. Women come here to pamper themselves, no matter what the price tag is. So, I wish I knew this before walking in here- I've never seen so many glamorous women, young & old alike, in fur coats and wearing perfect color and ""cant-take-your-eyes-off"" blow outs. Everyone here know that they look good, and it's rare to feel that energy when you first walk into a salon. So, imagine how I felt when I entered. I wanted to hide the wreck of untamed hair as I was greeted by the receptionist in the front. She introduced me to Amy, my stylist who was so incredibly sweet and listened to my hair concerns. In short, I needed help and I wanted to turn my existing gross mane to THAT *points to every one else*. Amy did what she could to my weird short bangs and softened out my heavy layers. It was nice to know that she offered me free bang trims the next time I go. $130 dollars and 20% tip later, I finally understood why there is no price tag to beauty.

Since I didn't have my calendar with me, I called the salon to confirm the exact time of my appointment. Having been looking forward to the appointment, and squeezing it before an important work event and travel, you can imagine my shock & dismay when the receptionist told me that they had ""accidentally"" moved my appointment to yesterday & that my time slot was no longer available. On top of that, there were no stylists available for the rest of the day, so there was ""absolutely nothing they could do to get me in"".  The salon is closed on Sunday, so I am completely out of luck before my big week.
