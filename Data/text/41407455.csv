0,Nancy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",864,133,204,4.0,10/12/2018,"An iconic neighborhood mainstay that you hope will survive the digital age of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. It's a quaint three screen theater that shows mostly up-and-coming indie flicks. I saw Ride here with a director Q&A after the show in the screening room that sits about 60. I love the cozy feel of this theater though it seems like it hasn't been renovated in quite some time. The seats were pretty decrepit and also flush against the left side of the wall so you could only exit on the right side of each row. That was both inconvenient and a potential fire hazard. That being said, I do hope Cinema Village continues to operate cause we need indie movie theaters like this, especially after the closing of Sunshine.",,,

I got a student discount so my ticket was $8. Then I got a medium popcorn and a small soda for around $8. So I spent less than $20 dollars here which is good compared to other movie theaters. Try to get there a few minutes earlier to get a seat. I will definitely be coming back,,,

6,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",417,497,8940,3.0,2/21/2016,"I have so much affection for NYC's few remaining indie movie houses, so I wish I could report that this was more than a 3-star destination.  Paid them a visit for a Saturday night screening recently, and it was a haphazard experience.  We were shuffled inside in a flurry of confusion about where we needed to be.  The theaters were clean inside and seats fairly comfy- and it seems like weekend screenings are rather lightly attended here later at night, which is a plus.  Visited the concessions stand and enjoyed the lack of line compared to the hoards you have to face at AMC or Regal just to get your hands on some popcorn.  Prices were decent, popcorn wasn't particularly hot and seemed as if it had been sitting for a while, but tasty enough all the same. Biggest beef with the theater is the lack of attention to the projection quality itself.  After a few mid-film glitches in our movie, it then cut out altogether with just a few minutes left.  The audience stayed seated for a bit, assuming someone would swoop in to address the situation.  After five minutes we ventured out to find the lobby deserted.  It seemed we audience members had been left to our own devices to finish the screening, and had no choice but to leave without knowing how the kung fu flick we were watching resolved itself.  Le sigh.  I'll probably still be back in hopes that second time's the charm.  I'm a sucker for old school spots with glorious neon marquees like the one Cinema Village has.",9,2,4

I knocked my rating down from 5 to 4 stars for two reasons. One, I don't think anything can be done about this but, since all the seats are floor level, you do have you tilt your head up a bit to see the screen, which may be a minus for some.  And another thing, during my movie, there was an incessant clicking outside of my theater that. did. not. stop.

The sound was really good and not too loud like you find in so many modern cinemas. The seats aren't that comfortable (they don't recline) and this is my only 'complaint' about my entire visit.

For my very first 2014 review I'd like to take a look at Cinema Village.I took/babysat two teenage girls here to watch Modoka*, an anime that is so WTF that I got absolutely nothing. It was like some anime Inception shit and I can rant about it if Yelp allows us to review movies.Tickets are 15. The entire theatre is operated by one man. He printed out our tickets then shimmied his way to the concession to make the popcorns. We were instructed to wait downstairs until the seating time. The downstairs lounge is a dark, rapey dungeon with two benches to sit on and sanitary-questionable bathrooms. There we met several other otaku comrades who were talking about the latest and greatest nerd things. Thinking that back in my years, animated girls were much hotter than the fetishized anime girls of today, I condescendingly judged quietly. We were then called by the one-man-army when the movie was ready for seating. The seats were uncomfortable. You couldn't rest your head and the armrest didn't look like it could support a sickly African child. My sister and her friend did end up loving the movie so they enjoyed their time here. Unless the movie is nowhere to be found but here, I'd look for alternative venues to watch the movie.* So the theatre misspelled ""Madoka."" Its an anime that has a huge cult following.",7,5,4

You know how when you arrive at a movie theater early, there's always someplace to loiter around and read a book until it's time to go into the screening room? Not so here: Cinema Village consists of a ticket window outside, a popcorn booth inside, and a staircase to the auditoriums. So if you get here early, I guess you can walk into the auditorium and attempt to read under the haze of a weird orange-pink light.Also, be forewarned: no butter for the popcorn here.

Updated review","I returned to Cinema Village again Sunday night for my third screening of Brooklyn Banker and to see The Model and as usual I was not disappointed. The movies were great but yet again the staff went above and beyond. Jose, Sofia and I never got the other guy's name but, he was the guy that went on his phone and actually got a movie description for me, so I would know what it was about before I went in, I want to say George, or Jason but I think I'm wrong, very courteous, Caucasian gentleman.........anyway, these three gentlemen exemplified excellence in their craft. They just seemed to love their jobs so much and bring a movie liver myself, it was greatly appreciated. Standing outside, waiting for my movie to start, and having one if the employees kick up a conversation about the movie ""Seven"" was so awesome, you can't buy service like this elsewhere. Once again, Cinema Village did not disappoint. I will be returning. I recommend checking out their selection of movies, they are better than anything you will find at any place called AMC or Regal.",1,,

We got over there and everyone who works there were very polite to us. My cousin picked to see The Model because the trailer looked very interesting.

34,Bryce R.,"Clark, NJ",20,21,1,4.0,1/21/2013,"I have had the pleasure of attending two films at Cinema Village over the past year.  I was introduced to the theater from the purchase of a Groupon (one of the rare gems in this day and age of the company).  It was a great deal but I enjoyed myself thoroughly so I will be a repeat customer.Here's why I am a fan;Cinema Village is a fine purveyor of films stretching all genres and across the globe.  At any visit, one can attend a buzz worthy film coming straight from Cannes or a thought provoking documentary that will open your mind to a whole new world .  New films enter the rotation every Thursday so the Cinema Village line up is always fresh.Cinema Village is also a great stage for the artist to discuss their craft.  It seems like it is regular for the theater to host directors for screenings and Q&A sessions.  Props to them for making an experience into a thoughtful conversation.It is kind of random but every time I go to the theater, there is a lot of older people in attendance.  This actually warms my heart because they love to talk about the film right after it finishes.Picking a film is an adventure in and of itself.  The theater picks films that are very independent so you really have limited impressions of the movie beforehand.  Reasons why I didn't give 5 stars;While it is great that Cinema Village does heavy rotations of their films, it can be a double-edged sword.  If your heart is set on seeing a film, you better see it within the week's time because chances are it may not be back next week if it does poorly.  It would be helpful if the theater would announce which films are leaving rotation so one could better plan their visit.It is an older film house so some cosmetic changes could be helpful.  New seat (or just cushions) and an updated bathroom would be nice additions.  Something about old seats at theaters makes me iffy...Overall, highly recommend!",4,,
35,Richard H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,1/25/2015,"Went with my wife and her friend to see Wes Anderson's ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", which got a second life after it was nominated for a bunch of Oscars.  The theater was tiny -- my guess is it seats no more than 30 -- but for a late afternoon show on a Saturday it was at most half full.  The seats have been raked fairly steeply to prevent obscured views due to heads and big hair from those who sit directly in front of you, which is nice, but what happened when the movie started pretty much destroyed whatever good will we initially had for the theater.Mysteriously, our version of ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" had subtitles -- in English.  The kind of subtitles for the hearing-impaired you'd see if you were watching a movie on DVD and turned them on from the Special Features menu.  I considered leaving my seat to complain about them to management, but somehow I felt this level of cluelessness when showing a movie would be met by more cluelessness and I'd end up returning to my seat more angry than when I'd left it.  (This instinct proved correct, as you'll see shortly.)  So I grinned and bore it and after about 20 minutes of teeth-gnashing distraction managed somehow to train myself to watch the movie *without* reading the subtitlesWhen the movie was over my wife's friend decided to complain and was met initially by indifference and, indeed, cluelessness.  There appeared to be two persons on duty that evening: one, who mans the concession stand and sweeps up in the theater after each showing, knew nothing about the problem and was at a loss to say anything meaningful about it, while the other, who sells tickets, at first tried to ignore our friend's complaints and then pretended to ""explain"" the problem by reading a blurb about the movie from a circular the theater received.  I gather the blurb talks about how the movie was shot with three different aspect ratios intended to mimic the aspect ratios in which movies were shot at the time the various historical scenes took place.Of course, aspect ratios have nothing to do with subtitles.In the end our friend's insistent complaints netted her a free pass to see something else at the theater ... something of a pyrrhic victory, if you ask me.But in the aftermath of this bizarre experience I'm left wondering exactly what's going on with Cinema Village's print (or maybe I should say file) of ""Grand Budapest Hotel"".  The only comprehensible explanation I can think of it that  the print is the same kind of DVD the studios send to Academy members in the run-up to the Academy Awards, when they're keen to get members to watch (and vote for) their films in the categories where they've received nominations.  That would leave the factotum at the theater to accidentally turn on subtitles when he dropped the disc into the video projector.Bottom line: if you have the misfortune of being shown an English-language movie with English-language subtitles, at Cinema Village or anywhere else, speak up immediately.  I strongly suspect they could have been turned off if we'd simply decided we weren't going to tolerate them.",2,2,

The adult ticket price is, I believe, the cheapest evening ticket price in Manhattan.The theaters are okay but a little awkwardly designed - one larger one (with full digital cinema projection) that's okay, a tiny one that's weird but has stadium seating, and a small one in the basement which shows movies mostly off a data projector that looks fine considering the screen is small. The seating isn't plush but its certainly no worse than the Angelika or Film Forum.Clean and comfortable but small, if you go early you may find yourself lined up outside. They do show some unique films including some move-overs from other art houses and multiplexes in the city, so if you missed at Film Forum or IFC, it might pop up here.

I recently watched the Turin Horse here, it is Bela Tarr's most recent film. I had previously seen it at Lincoln Center Film on it's opening night. Compared to that experience, this was awful. The Exit sign near the front screen (we were in one of the 2 main screens) illuminated the entire room with it's rancid neon red. The volume was turned way down, and anyone who has seen a Bela Tarr film knows they are as much about sound/music as they are about the visuals so my Lady and I were extremely let down. The other reviews make mention of how this place is so sensitive to what it shows, I don't disagree at all but I do take them to task for aesthetic judgments such as the lighting inside the space and appropriate volume levels for specific films. In the future, if they are showing a film I want to see I'll try to see it elsewhere and use Cinema Village as a last resort.",1,1,

The requisite staff of slightly stoned film students were all very friendly and charming, the popcorn was tasty and crisp, and the film was an A+. I left feeling like I should pay more attention to what they play just so I have an excuse to stop in again.The best part of the evening, though, was when stoned concessionaire served up my drink and popcorn, dropped some kernels on the counter, and then started eating them.

My favorite independent films and documentaries play here, and unlike the IFC Center, there's never an annoying crowd. The screenings themselves are generally good to great, but I cut the theatre some slack because they often do second-run prints, which already have a little wear and tear.

It was perfect too because I saw the silent film The Artist in this theater, and the theater in the movie almost resembled the very theater I was sitting in. I wish they can restore this theater and make it even more gilded, although I also kind of like the slightly old and dilapidated feel of it, almost like a post-war abandoned theater.

It's especially sad that they don't have enough room for you to wait for the show to start, which is annoying on cold and rainy days (tip: go to Joe's and get an espresso while you wait).However, it definitely holds its own as far as price and quality of pictures.

When I got around to going to Cinema Village, as I was waiting in the lobby for my movie to start, the box office clerk informed a guy that no, this was not Village East Cinema....she directed him east.  Probably a better mistake than accidentally hiking into North Korea or Iran and being taken hostage, but a mistake no less. Anyway, although I enjoy watching documentaries, I have never felt the need to pay to see one at the cinema (I feel so European saying that).  Cinema Village shows primarily documentaries with an occasional indie or international film thrown into their roster.  It is a cute, smallish theater and I am glad I saw Crazyhorse, a documentary about the famed erotic revue in France. ( Wouldn't be surprised if every guy watching managed a boner for the entire 2 and a half hour duration of the doc).  Aside from having to wait in the tiny seat-less lobby to enter the theater, my main caveat with this place is that they don't have extra butter to squirt into the popcorn.  Unless I am potentially reducing two years from my lifespan, I can't really say that I am getting a true movie-going experience...but then again, this is more of a cinema house  than a movie theater (do Europeans squirt extra butter into their popcorn?).",1,1,
