0,Adam H.,"Medina, OH",112,159,40,4.0,10/20/2018,"If your looking for a cool communal work space, this is it. Lots of tables and rooms, and a large seating area up front. The meeting rooms themselves also have the right tech to make them helpful. The on site cafe is a plus too.",,,
1,Awol G.,"New York, NY",0,40,0,2.0,8/5/2018,"If your life were a movie, you would quit your job and come here to scout, network and lock-in the professional move of a lifetime. If your life were a movie and you had a healthy disposable budget that is. This place makes you feel upwardly mobil and employable just how the Container Store makes you feel neat and containable. But for all of the fanfare, once is rather taken back by the absence of vegan options, I would have expected them to have an Activated Charcoal Nutella latte or something else that rhymes with the black hole that capitalism is. Or a Golden Turmeric latte to attract them riches to your fingers, Midas style! But no, not even a Matcha latte, a Chai Latte, blah, underwhelming..",,,
2,Brittany S.,"New York, NY",755,106,147,5.0,10/2/2017,"Neuehouse is an excellent co-working office space with a delicious cafe and bar! This place is great for creatives and entrepreneurs. The decor, art and ambiance is well curated. They have very interesting events and programs that you truly can't find anywhere else.",1,,
3,Craig B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,5,0,5.0,3/16/2018,I discovered Neuehouse through a friend who invited me there for lunch. I felt comfortable immediately - a great deal of thought has gone into creating a relaxed atmosphere that gently promotes both conversation between members and singular focus.,,,
4,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,4.0,4/11/2016,"If you combined shared office spaces, a chic coffee bar, a private library, and furnished it with stuff from a really cool concept furniture store, you'd have something that looks like Neuehouse.Came here for an event courtesy of my friend. I felt like a fish out of water among these movers and shakers, these trendy professionals, whatever you want to call them. The event itself was held in the front of the space and it was pretty cool, featuring chef Daniel Boulud. I definitely recommend going here for their events if you can get in. They have some really great speakers and cover a bunch of different topics. The space alone is worth checking out.",6,1,4
5,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2412,5152,5.0,11/18/2013,"So Neuehouse was described to me as ""a new private collective in Gramercy Park oft-mistaken for a membership club like Soho House."" While that helps me understand what they *aren't*, here's what they *are*: the most stunning 20,000 sq. feet of bricks, mortar, Edison bulbs, leather bound books, exotic animal pelts, and sophisticated whimsey I've encountered in years. I was blown away that such a space exists anywhere outside a tech start up with way too much VC money to blow.From what I gather, it's a co-working space for motivated artists, entrepreneurs, visionaries, etc... I'm also under the impression that there's a lengthy application process to become a member, so it takes more than just a Macbook pro and the ability to type 100 words per minute to get up and running here. But if you're lucky enough to attend an event that's open to the public, I highly suggest you drop everything on your schedule to be a part of it.",13,9,8
6,Susan A.,"New York, NY",359,498,559,5.0,4/10/2017,"NeueHouse is an awesome event space in Kips Bay. I came here for a networking event and was blown away by the beauty of this event space. My Lyft driver had a hard time finding the entrance, as it is rather inconspicuous. Their logo is a form of ""NH"" in small print near the door. It is the ultimate upscale hang out spot for professionals and artists. To name a few amenities, they have a cafe, library, study space, and comfy chairs. I hope to come back because I could spend hours there!",1,1,4
7,Hannah C.,"Burbank, CA",111,68,26,5.0,4/23/2015,"I understand the negative reviews of this place- because i also felt a little intimidated when I walked in. Everyone is quite attractive there and I am just a mother of three teenage boys who also happens to work in media.But once I checked in and sat down to wait for  Ashely - the beguiling membership rep I immediately began to unwind.Instead of a sea of ""resting bitch faces"" as is so often the case at places like the SoHo House, I found people to be naturally friendly. Eye contact was made. People were smiling. The mood was relaxed, and people were chatting, but more so, people were working. Imagine Sunday Brunch meets my university Library.  In other words people seemed to be enjoying working in this setting.One thing that should be pointed out about NeueHouse is their investment in technology. I have been lucky enough to learn about the production capabilities and tech infrastructure that sets Neue apart from every other executive space in the city. You wouldn't know it on first glance but the technology bones of the NeueHouse are first rate and they have deployed some of the most prolific systems engineers to make this space fully functional for almost every aspect of creative professionals. This place is everything that a techotel is and everything that a Regus office isn't.",6,1,
8,Ansley L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",136,4,0,1.0,11/4/2016,"Front of house is terribly rude. Acted incredibly burdened with my call after I simply asked to learn more about the concept, and hung up on me, after I had been very polite. I work in customer service, and I'm pretty sure what I just experienced is exactly what we tell employees NOT to do.",6,1,1
9,Tyler P.,"Manhattan, NY",8,3,3,5.0,11/4/2014,"Speaking as someone who has worked in NeueHouse with a startup and who has helped organize events here, I ADORE this place. It's one of the best incubators in NYC because it's so versatile, friendly and innovative. There's such a huge sense of community that you can feel each time you walk through the door. In fact, I not only met the person who would ultimately fund my project but I met my designer and head of marketing there as well.The space itself is in a class of its own. Aesthetically marvelous and sets any meeting off (with clients seeing it for the first time) with amazement. The floors themselves are full of inspiring pieces of art and brimming with natural light during the daytime that reflects off neighboring windows outside and through the glass right to you. It's almost like being on a movie set. If you have a startup here, you can dedicate yourself to your work from early morning to midnight, which is very essential for those who are wanting to burn the midnight (or weekend) oil on time sensitive projects. And the events themselves - the meticulous detail that goes into the programming is extraordinary. They're always great for networking and meeting the most fascinating people. I remember speaking with an idol of mine, Ian Schrager, after he spoke at one of their events and it changed my life forever!If you want to learn how to build your company or develop your business, or just have an awesome cup of coffee with some cool people, stop into NeueHouse sometime. It's all about having a supportive community surrounding you, which is exactly what you need when you're in the early stages.",2,,2
10,Nicole G.,"New York, NY",112,54,32,5.0,1/25/2016,"This place is so great. I love coworkers spaces and this was designed so well. The spaces to work vary wildly with stadium like seating, library esque tables, board rooms, couch areas and a whole restaurant. The salads were so good and cappuccinos, my favorite, were good enough that I ordered two. Salmon was a little fishy but I'd try someone else as a protein next time. It's member only but visiting a colleague made me curious so I'll be looking into it.",,,
11,Michael G.,"New York, NY",258,50,8,2.0,10/10/2016,"Nice bubbles in the conference rooms, but wtf is up with the name. Is it German? Nope It'd be Neue Haus, is it american? Nope, it'd be New House. Is it just kinda cheesy, overpriced, and wants to make its members feel good about being there. Yup.",1,5,
12,Sir M.,"New York, NY",163,239,0,2.0,4/2/2016,"I am not a member, so please bear this review with that in mind. I was here for a bit checking it out and have quite a few friends who are members. I've gone to meet them here, talk business, and do a little work. If they are ever going to make a show about co-working spaces in the style of HBO's Silicon Valley, rest assured it will be filmed here. It seems pretentious to the point of being hilarious. Again, I AM NOT A MEMBER. But every time I've been in here it feels chaotic, crowded, loud, and disorganized. Maybe it's awesome. Maybe I come at bad times. Or maybe I'm the problem. Good luck on your iphone apps that are certainly revolutionizing the way we buy, sell and think about tires.",3,,1
13,Jane C.,"Los Angeles, CA",364,142,41,1.0,7/30/2014,"I first heard about this place from my friend who told me that it was full of people blowing air kisses who cared to look important and dripping with pretentiousness. I didn't believe her, but after experiencing it first hand, I admit she's right.I got a good chance to work here for quite awhile and here's the verdict:-Coffee is waayyy overpriced. How dare can a regular hot coffee be around $4?! Jesus. -Chairs are very uncomfortable. They should've user-tested it before they invested in the super expensive chairs.-Girl at front desk is super snobby.I don't see this place as a place that cultivates real people/artists/innovators. More like wannabes. Ew. At least they have free wine during happy hour. But then again, it's the least they can do with the amount they charge.",20,9,3
14,Kayla W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,13,5.0,1/5/2015,"I can't say enough good things about this place. I love coming here. It's a beautiful space, with beautiful people.  The vibe is trendy, but approachable. The staff are friendly and attentive.  The cultural events are always very interesting and well executed. They have a great wine selection and the food is delicious.  5 stars!",3,,
15,Allie M.,"Montclair, NJ",697,188,481,5.0,5/12/2014,"I basically just love everything about this place. I work here a few times a month, and the location is perfect, the interior is designed beautifully and clearly with the intention to inspire, their cafe serves plenty of health-conscious options that are not only good for you, but taste amazing, too, and the staff is friendly. The concept of this place alone is fantastic, because there are so many professionals out there who need meeting spaces and offices, but don't need them everyday of the week. And the amenities here cater to whatever you need - not just offices and meeting rooms, but they have an event space downstairs with a bar and full catering capability, a small television studio that can broadcast live via Satellite/C-band, and plenty of communal spaces where you can work alongside other creative professionals, such as designers, musicians, advertisers, writers, and producers. If you go to the cafe, you've gotta try their kale salad - the dressing is unbelievable, and if you have the chance to try their spicy tuna wrap, take it. It's one of the best wraps I've ever had.",10,1,1
16,Rachel J.,"Perth, Australia",24,133,9,2.0,7/1/2015,"It's a beautiful space. I know the artist who is showcased in the space (he works down the street from me). I am told I am ""waitlisted."" Eight-thousand and twenty-four years later, the wait list is still ""full"" and ""not moving"" (read: I'm not getting in). I did not wear heels on the day that I met Jessica. I may have had a cold when I arrived. Maybe NeueHouse judges harshly. Who knows.",7,,
17,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11026,3.0,4/17/2014,"In terms of a conference or meeting space, Neuehouse is pretty cool. There's a cafe on the first floor and private meeting rooms elsewhere in the building with pretty new tech. Security is a bit annoying though. I was running a bit late for a meeting and it took about 15 minutes for them to call the meeting organizer and to find another employee to show me the way to the elevator in the back.",6,,
18,Courtney O.,"Colorado Springs, CO",323,18,38,1.0,5/4/2015,"Just had the rudest experience being curious about this coworking space. They won't give you any info when you stop in or offer any kinds of tours, they won't tell you anything other than saying you can read it online (essentially kicking you out the door), they won't tell you anything about membership without you first committing to be a member by filling out an application online and as we were standing at the door to leave, they told us we weren't even allowed to take photos from the place we were standing. We couldn't leave fast enough. Worst experience ever.",10,1,1
19,Cara G.,"Venice, CA",153,470,420,4.0,11/8/2015,This is a very nice co working event space in Manhattan. You do need to be approved to be a member and once you get in there are many interesting events t attend as well as working alongside interesting people.,,,
20,Zuzzi E.,"New York, NY",188,553,17,3.0,2/25/2015,"Gorgeous space, but wow are they stuck up! I came here for a Harvard alum event and wanted to learn more about their co-working space. I submitted my info online (accidentally, twice) and got one rejection email and one invitation to visit and learn more. I went in and met with Jessica, who is in charge of memberships. She explained how they don't like people coming in suits, and that it's really a place for creatives (I don't even own a suit, but I'm also not that trendy). Our interaction was very patronizing and reminded me of everything I hate about NYC.",11,3,3
21,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,4.0,12/10/2013,"This is a very cool space for artists. I believe the main floor is made available to members of some artist collective. Don't quote me on that. But it's not a public space open to everyone. I went to Neuehouse for a private event which was in the basement. It's an AMAZINGLY beautiful space complete with a bar area (though I think they're still in the process of acquiring a liquor license) and a screening room. The area is spacious enough to accommodate 50-75 people comfortably. There's also a private meeting room hidden on one side of the space. Very cool venue for movie screenings, whisky tasting events, art displays, etc.",2,,1
22,Samantha S.,"Sydney, Australia",0,16,11,5.0,7/30/2015,"WOW, this is the best office concept.  must visit in NY.  Hope they have some similar concept in LA.",,,
23,Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1524,1242,3771,4.0,10/16/2014,"Neuehouse is a really cool shared office space that hosts random events.  Last week or two weeks ago there were events held under the SONOS STUDIOS label.  It was pretty fun.  I got to see Danny Brown, an Atlanta based rapper in a very intimate setting show and there was so much fun everywhere and free booze too.  I was there with a few other yelp members as well.  We throughly enjoyed our time here, the concert itself only had about 70 people there.  That was kind of the perfect number, not too many people at all and my group was right in the front so we got to Talk to Danny before and after the show.  I also attended the Saturday 10/4 even that was the Sonic Chop Shop, it was a build your own speaker affair.  It was mainly focus on the Soundwall that features many artists tracks.  I also saw the Gabriel Kahnane and Bam performance that was very small as well but featured the couches instead of the standing room only like the DANNY BROWN show.  I would definitely come back here for an event, next time i can get on a list or something.  Very nice space, in the basement was the real party and the drinks but there was all kind of corporate stuff and separate events on the top floor.",3,1,2
24,Diana T.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,7,0,5.0,1/13/2015,"Elegant shared workspace with all the necessities and those extra touches in the heart of NY. Atmosphere fosters both creativity and productivity. If you can become a member (apparently not easy), I highly recommend it.",1,,
25,Willie G.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/21/2015,"Wow NeueHouse truly is a one of a kind place in NYC. The second you walk inside the door, you can feel the creative vibe that is shared throughout the community. The space is beautiful, trendy, and all of the members have an OPEN mindset when it comes to networking and sharing ideas ... which is difficult to find in the city.Now ... the events ... impeccable execution, beautiful layout, and the staff finds a way to keep hosting some of the most versatile concerts and networking events that i have experienced in New York Simply put, NeueHouse offers members an incredible opportunity to further their careers, build networks, and share in a communal experience that is second to none in this amazing city!",,,
26,Khatchig K.,"Boston, MA",0,1,0,1.0,1/9/2015,"Terrible hostess. She refused to let us in although we had tickets for a fundraising event. She claimed people were leaving the party although the crowd stayed on for at least another hoir. If you're looking for inhospitable, impolite and arrogant hosts, this place is for you.",10,1,1
27,Dilani A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,3/10/2015,Came here to visit a friend - and was blown away. The space and decor are beautiful. Had a great lunch at their in-house restaurant. Can't believe they call this an office. Would love to work here!,,,
