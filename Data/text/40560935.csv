0,Ryan P.,"Manhattan, NY",2834,85,10629,4.0,10/19/2018,"Went to see Dear Evan Hanson here. The theater is not very big but quite nice. I was a bit upset that the upper section seats were not cheaper. After now having gone, I will say there are not many bad seats. I was in the middle row of the upper section, stage right and the view was almost completely clear. The seats are comfortable and rather spacious for relative to most theaters.",16,3,6
1,Paula M.,"Nashville, TN",13,260,192,4.0,5/6/2018,"Each of the three times I've seen DEH, I've had an enjoyable experience mainly because the show is amazing. The theatre is small and the overhang of the balcony doesn't affect the view from the back rows as it would in the Richard Rodgers. The seats are relatively comfortable but there's not much space between you and the row in front of you. So, it's common courtesy to get up to allow people to pass you. Unfortunately, during one of my visits, I sat next to a guy who would not stop spreading his legs and literally draped his jacket across the armrest and into my lap. Seriously, just keep your legs pointed to your wife and keep your jacket to yourself!I kept reading conflicting views on the front row. Some people said it was a partial view, some said it was fine. I was lucky to get a seat in the third row and opted for that instead of the first or second row. It was a perfect seat to see everything without having to look upwards. But if you are in the front rows and have trouble seeing a lot on the stage or if you are short or you have a child with you, make sure you ask for a booster seat from one of the ushers. They only have a select number of them and I don't think they have rules about saving them for certain people. Anyone can ask for one.I'm not sure if there's a bathroom upstairs but the bathroom downstairs is conveniently located with plenty of space to accommodate the crazy line of women that inevitably forms!Personally, I like to get to the theatre early. If you are like that, just know that you'll enter from the rightmost door so you could start a line that grows toward the Marriott. I'm not sure if it depends on the weather or on the security staff but they will let you into a holding area prior to the doors officially being opened 30 minutes prior to the show. I recall being let into the holding area almost an hour before curtain. At that time, they just do a bag check, so make sure you have your bags open for inspection. In the holding area, they have you form a U-shaped line down the hall and back. So, when you enter the theatre, don't stand around. Get in line! :)",1,,

And to expect heightened security (probably because of UN meetings in the city). Nice bathrooms downstairs and upstairs from the main theatre entrance. Good variety of drinks and snacks. My husband realized after he bought the tickets for a Wednesday matinee that the understudy of the lead would be performing. We came anyway since it might be years before we get back. It was a wonderful performance. I think every patron was crying. Even my big, tough husband. The subject was sobering. I wish there wasn't so much profane language though.",1,,1

And I took the previous reviews' advice and didn't order anything to drink.  Currently, ""Dear Evan Hansen"" is playing here, and I imagine it will be for a while. The first act, I couldn't help but think, ""Oh God, what a train wreck!"" However, the second act ties it up beautifully.  It really is that good.

The show was fabulous, and I enjoyed the space.  We had been at Hamilton the night before and found this theater so much more comfortable. It's a small theater... the upside being that all the seats are pretty much good seats. Like any older theater, the seats and rows are compact, but there is enough room to be able to enjoy the show.  Temperature was kept consistent.  We had front row mezzanine seats, which were excellent. We were close enough to see the actors' faces, but far enough away to see the whole stage. No annoying bars blocking the view like some have. I would pick those seats time and again... perfect!",,,

8,Arelis D.,"New York, NY",43,76,368,4.0,11/18/2017,"Before buying tickets, I read a lot of reviews that said there aren't any bad seats in this theater. For the most part, that's true. This is a small theater, so you won't be too far from the action even if you sit in the mezzanine. However, there are definitely some seats I would try to avoid. If you're in orchestra row B, avoid the last seat to the far sides - your knees will be up against a wall. Like most theaters, the first two rows in the orchestra aren't ideal, since you'll need to look up. However, I did see several people in the first row getting extra cushions which added an extra inch or two of height and may have helped. The seats themselves are fairly comfortable, too.",2,,1
9,Kat V.,"Coraopolis, PA",114,240,49,4.0,7/3/2018,"Very good theatre and we've seen some wonderful shows there. I know the theatre you goto is determined by the show you want to see, but the staff is very friendly. It was odd that they didn't post prices at the merch stands for some reason. I can't remember ever seeing that before (even for previous shows at the Music Box). Hopefully, they'll fix that soon - maybe they were recently raised.",,,
10,Gabriella T.,"Jamaica, NY",385,144,164,3.0,1/9/2018,"This is a very, very small and uncomfortable theatre to see a show in. The pros of this is the intimacy it provides, and allows for all viewers in the theatre to get a good view of the action. Went to see Dear Evan Hansen in the mezzanine level, and it was just pretty much impossible to get comfortable. I guess it just kind of takes away from the experience of seeing a show when you feel like you can't even move your body without touching the person next to you. In addition, one of the bar tenders/snack vendors was incredibly rude and unprofessional. In the end, people will obviously continue to come here given the circumstances that it is the theatre that holds DEH (which was absolutely spectacular), I just wish it had a little more wiggle room.",,,

I know that the bathrooms are going to be a tricky and I prepare for these nights like the physical challenge that they are.I always make sure to watch my liquids at dinner and use the downstairs bathroom as late as I can. Then I climb all the stairs up and up and up. I always get an aisle seat so that I can have one leg that is comfortable. I also take a couple of Advil so I can sit back, ignore my knee pain and enjoy the show.When the show is Dear Evan Hansen and you've prepared properly you can appreciate the architecture and lose yourself in the magic.I don't suppose they will ever tear these old theaters down and have comfortable seats, leg room and staircases that weren't built for people over a hundred years ago. When they do, I will cheer but in the meantime I suggest you prepare as I did.",4,3,6

Wrong!  The hulk that was sitting in front of me blocked 80% of the stage. The seat were cramped and I'm 115lb at 5'5. I kept MAJORLY leaning to my daughter's side of the lady that was sitting next to me to catch any kind of action. Like that wasn't enough, the hulk kept on tilting his head CONSTANTLY so I had to flounce to left or right the entire play. ginormous freaks should have a special row in theaters, srsly.

I had row 2 tickets, so Taylor stared deep into my eyes almost every song (kinda not joking).But, if you can't afford a $300 ticket, you're in luck bc the theater is small and intimate. I imagine the people in balcony and rows behind had an almost as enjoyable experience as mine. I can't and won't speak for them. It clearly wasn't better than mine, but it couldn't have been bad bc theater size guarantees an enjoyable show.In all seriousness: great theater to enjoy a Broadway show.",,,

Updated review","Very comfortable even though not much leg room. Very organized. Nice employees handling security and seating. Stairs are not unusually narrow like some theaters. We had a comfortable climb up and down the stairs. Plenty of room to exit out through the alley exit. You come out right on the street. No crowding out the front entrance. This is a lovely old theater. Beautiful chandeliers adorn the ceiling. The seats, carpets, stairs, exit floors are well maintained and clean. I've been here for other shows. No obstructed views of the stage as far as I can tell. Small theater so it's easy to see the stage. I enjoy coming to The Music Box each show I see. No complaints from me.",34,20,31

Updated review","I can usually tell what fraudulent situations look like--especially on Craigslist (a notorious den of epic b.s.). I missed it this go-round (44 years old and I guess there's always a first?). On 8/24/17, a thin black guy with a beard and many arm tattoos met me in midtown Manhattan. He sold me 2 fake Dear Evan Hansen tickets, which, of course, I found on CL. The tickets looked entirely real (I've been to thousands of concerts and shows), and he had what looked like the perfectly real bill of sale. All of it was fake. The fake tickets were in the Right Orchestra section, Row B, seats 2 and 4. My intent: repost this--and KEEP reposting this, because I want to keep everyone else from making the same mistake I did. We know this sh-thead is NOT getting caught, but at very least--we can help others to avoid giving their hard earned money to an affable, very thin, black guy with a smart beard (approx 5'9"" with lots of arm tattoos). The two cellphone numbers he used (which are probably burners) are 313-558-8995 and 347-600-1475 (and this one is one too: 646-349-0964.) The Dear Evan Hansen house manager's response? It was utterly appalling. And I quote: ""It happens all the time. We get these fakes in multiple times per show. People are sold fake tickets from craigslist and have been  turned away every day, for months."" (I'm sorry...did you say, EVERY DAY, for months?) They do NOTHING ABOUT IT. They've made NO REAL EFFORT to clean up the insidious problem. So, frankly, I think it can be argued that they are equally culpable. (Now--shame on me for having bought the fraudulent tickets to begin with, but if it's been going on since the show's inception--WTF?) I'm disgusted--so I'll now do what I can to annoy the sh-t out of these scammer lowlifes and try to keep others from making the same very unfortunate mistake I did--even though the folks at Evan Hansen made it clear that they couldn't legitimately give a f-ck about the problem.",2,1,

I have a pretty average build and I'm 5'1"", and I was very uncomfortable. The women behind me tapped my friend and I on the shoulder and asked us to sit lower so they could see (again, I'm 5'1"", and my friend is about 5'3"".).We actually moved during intermission to try to get better sightlines (due to the rake) and because we were so uncomfortable.",1,,
21,Nick M.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",0,6,3,4.0,2/13/2018,"We went to The Music Box Theatre to see Dear Evan Hansen. The show was out of this world fantastic, and the theatre was beautiful. It was small enough to be quaint, and intimate, but you didn't feel terribly crowded. Where things took a left turn for this Louisiana resident was when I went to order a glass of wine for me and my wife. Mercifully, our friends declined when I asked if they'd like one. They are native New Yorkers, and probably knew the fate that was approaching me. As I walked up to the vendor, he was explaining to someone that credit cards could only be used for purchase of $10 or more. To me, I heard ""don't worry, there will be a little premium on the price here, but it won't be too terrifying"". I mean, if there are things that are less than $10, how much can a glass of wine be? I ordered a large, and an extra large glass for the two of us, and a bottle of water for my daughter. The extra large pour was a stout 15 ounces. I'd need it. The vendor handed me my two souvenir cups of what I'm assuming was $7 a bottle wine. I went to peel off a twenty, with a five as backup just in case when he said ""that'll be $65"". At this point I'm in such disbelief that I just hand over the card. I sign away my $65, plus tip, because I'm just too much of a sweetheart. And I clutch those hard plastic cups with such ferocity that I'm questioning the strength of the 1/4 inch thick plastic Dear Evan Hansen mug that will be required drink ware for my daughter until her wedding day. I sat down with my wife, explained that we were drinking the classiest thing we would ever drink, and continued to clutch my sippy cup of wine like it's the last vestiges of liquid in existence on my journey through the Sahara. Ten minutes in to the second act I had to make the risky decision to switch to my non dominant hand because my fingers were going numb. We made it through the show with no spills, and after many $3 sips of $7 wine, the show was over, and I had a $4 buzz. So the theatre and the show get five stars hands down, but the prices for wine get 0.02 stars. I mean, I guess I should be stoked that I had an option. And yes, relative to ticket prices, this seemed to be fairly in line, but I figured the ticket cost would mean ""Hey, you got in! Here's a glass on us."" But I guess an open bar at a Broadway Show wouldn't be the best atmosphere. Maybe they are geniuses, and I'm much better off grabbing my 1.5 liter bottle of whatever is red at Kroger. I'll be back at some point. But I'll wait until after the show, grab a big bottle and some Halal Cart food for $35, and slip my wife the extra $30 to buy herself somethin purty.",,2,

Seating is tight but the bathrooms were better than I thought they would be for this place. The only problem is parking I've gone out to dinner near here and have gotten a voucher for free parking.

However,    sitting off to left the side in the orchestra still gave me a good view of Patina Miller, Matthew James Thomas, Terrance Mann, Andrea Martin, and the other fine members of the cast.The show has now more of a cirque du soleil theme to it along with some magic acts thrown in. Still the musical numbers are intact and as I was told when I entered ""this is Fosse"" I am sorry to see it go but it gave me an opportunity to check out another theater.My seat was ok. I really didn't use the rest room and the gift shop area was tiny. Hopefully, I will return if they get another great show here.",,,

The seats were comfortable and has a good angle so you can see over the people in front of you. It's a nice small theater so I bet any seat in the house would be great. Although it is very small so be forewarned at the end of the show it will be a big herd of people leaving the small exit/entrance.Pippin was full of fun and had us interacting at one point with them singing along which I've never done in any Broadway show I've seen, so I thought it was great!

One of the more ornate Broadway theaters out there with great sight-lines from even the last row of the Mezzanine.I want to point out one incorrect item that a reviewer mentioned. They called this an off-Broadway theater. It is smaller than a lot of the Broadway theaters, but it is not off-Broadway. It is a smaller theater with just under 1,000 seats, but it is definitely a Broadway theater with a lot of history!I have sat in almost every spot possible in this theater through various plays. From the rear orchestra for August:  Osage County, to the last row mezzanine for the current production of Pippin (which is truly incredible, a must see), I can tell you that there are very few bad seats. Even from the last row of the mezzanine the theater feels very close.The seats are comfy, and the staff are kind and efficient. The lobby and lounges downstairs are quite pretty. Overall a great theater, and definitely worth visiting for what is currently playing. Get a seat in the rear mezz using a discount code from BroadwayBox for $49. You won't be sorry.",7,,

Like they were trying to be Cirque du Soleil.  Lots of mindless jumping around, acrobatics, gymnastics....but the story line was stupid, ridiculous, and didn't interest me. Sure, the actors/actresses were pretty, fit, especially the muscular guys ;-)  The actors really tried hard and put all their heart into it....But that wasnt enough....they need to develop an actual plot and story that would interest people.....and i hated the one charactor/actress who was critiquing the blonde girl in the 2nd half, about her acting ability. Really ? Is this some kind of new ""reality show"" twist in musicals ?   If you're looking for a musical to see in NYC, I would NOT recommend this one.

Yes, we were sitting on the left hand side, and could once in a while hear the cheers, whistles and whatever else from the theater next door!Otherwise we were here for Private Lives with Kim Cattrall.

Asked if they were close, and she snapped she didn't know, I'd have to come back later. How can the box office person not know about their sales? Came back just before the 2:00 matinee and was told they still weren't sold out. Full price was over $100.SO, I came back Sat., figuring the second to last performance of a Tony winner must sell out. Was told by the same woman at five till curtain that there was still one full price for sale. Waited for a few more people to go through, then checked again, this time with her partner, an older man. He told me they'd sold all the standing room. I told him that a few moments earlier I was told they weren't on sale. He just said, ""No standing room.""

A vendor hawks bottled water in the theatre before the performance, and during intermission, for $4.I was able to purchase discount tickets ($59.50) on the day of the performance through their website. The show was ""Superior Donuts"", by Tracy Letts, an engrossing drama interspersed with quite a few laughs. The cast was very good, especially the lead, Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins of Spinal Tap).There was a technical glitch with the lighting which resulted in a 10-minute delay, and an awkward, ""do-over"" of the start of the performance, but, that's show biz.Junior's Times Square restaurant is one-half block east of the theatre.

Unfortunately, our experience was marred by the lack of organization and rudeness of the employees at the Music Box Theater. I go to a lot of dance, music, and theater performances in the city, and I have never seen such poor organization. Rather than either handing out programs at the top of the aisle and then pointing the way to seat (as at, say, PS1), or having several ushers per aisle to show audience members directly to seats (as at the Met or City Ballet, the Music Box had one usher per aisle walking attendees to seats, which meant that others had to wait at the top of the aisle to be seated (I waited a full ten minutes while others cut in front of me and, running into the usher halfway up the aisle, were seated ahead of me). When I tried to simply seat myself by picking up a program from the pile on the floor and heading directly to my seat, a very rude and petty usher insisted that I would have to go to the other row and wait until that usher was available to seat me. Furthermore, he insisted that I return the program that I had picked up from the floor, falsely claiming that there were just enough for the number of seats (at the end of the performances, there were several piles of programs left). This usher was utterly inappropriate and disrespectful, raising his voice and rolling his eyes at me (he gave his name as ""Matt"", and he looked to be in his early 20s,  was shorter than average, a bit pudgy, and had longish, curly dark hair). I do not come to plays to be insulted by surly young men, nor do I enjoy standing in the aisle because the theater has neither hired enough ushers nor allowed audiences to seat themselves. I understand that many Broadway customers are tourists, and that management is probably more concerned to sell water and chocolates than to provide a professional and enjoyable experience that will bring people back. But this rudeness and disorganization was shocking even for Broadway, and I certainly hope that someone will do something to correct it. I will avoid the Music Box theater in the future, and will warn all friends and out-of-town guests to avoid this venue at all costs and to attend plays at places that will treat them with courtesy and respect.",1,1,1
