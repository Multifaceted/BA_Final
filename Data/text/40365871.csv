0,Jennifer G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,2,5.0,7/16/2018,"I was told about this restaurant from a friend and I am so glad I discovered this gem in NYC.   The restaurant has been around since I thin the 60's. and the owner is there every night.  It is a family business and has many regulars who eat there nightly.  The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I had the lamb chops, burnt and crispy on the outside and medium rare inside.  My husband had the branzino fish and it was the best and freshest we've ever had.  The atmosphere is dark and cozy with beautiful music playing in the background.  A perfect evening.  I will go again and again.After reading some reviews I will say this.  I love that there is a dress code and they don't want this to become a raucous loud night time hang out.  Being able to eat in a restaurant where you can hear the person across the table from you is a treat these days.",1,,

2,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",356,275,181,4.0,4/6/2018,"'Twas the night before St. Patrick's Day...Having lived in the area for more than 10 years, Nicole suggested that, instead of competing with other revelers on the actual holiday, we go to Neary's on St. Patrick's Day eve.  ""If we get to Neary's around 6:15PM, I doubt we'd have to wait longer than 30 minutes.""  Longer than 30 minutes??  Considering that the restaurant is located in *east* Midtown East, I was a bit surprised that there would even be a wait time at all (sorry guys, it's not Soho)!It wasn't until I approached Neary's that I realized I was in for something special, unique, and *not* your typical Irish pub.  ""Proper Attire Required"" was posted prominently - yet tastefully - on the front door.  I had high hopes that what this really meant was no residual smells of months-old spilled beer, vomit, and the pungent cleaning supplies used to make them disappear...Indeed, Neary's was like nothing I've ever experienced in New York.  From the moment I entered the space, I was whisked away to a bygone time when the owners still acted as hosts (in this case, Mr. Neary and his lovely daughter) - the loyal staff were treated as family - guests were greeted by name - the mahogany bar was so pristinely polished, I'll bet you could see your reflection between sips of that perfectly-crafted martini.  After giving our name and party size to Mr. Neary, himself, we waited about 20-minutes to be seated for dinner.  ""It's going to be an early night for me, fella's,"" I overheard one bar patron remark after taking the last slug of his cocktail.  ""I have to be at church tomorrow for the 8:30AM St. Patrick's Day Mass.""The dining room, a space that could easily pass for that of an old-fashioned steakhouse (dim lighting, red table cloths, walls lined with framed photographs, brass adornments), was fully occupied when we were seated.  After placing our drink orders, our attentive waitress returned with a basket of gratis, run-of-the-mill bread and took note of our entree requests.While most of our table ordered the outstanding Corned Beef & Cabbage (the best representation I've had, to date), I chose one of the evening's specials: Beef Pot Roast.  I found Neary's food to be positively heart warming and comforting; nothing on our plates was fancy or fussy - but everything was delicious and perfectly cooked and executed.For dessert, we enjoyed a round of Irish coffees while tapping our feet to some live music, courtesy of one of the Neary's relatives.  A true family affair!Neary's is an incredibly special place, and my evening here proved to be one of my most favorite and cherished experiences in all of my twelve years in Manhattan.  I cannot wait to return here with my mother who has very thick Irish roots!  Until next time...",2,,2

Great food, I had a broiled cheeseburger, so good!  My dining companions had the Shrimp Scampi and Broiled Salmon and were very happy with their choices!  Fantastic service and Jimmy is amazing!  Great neighborhood haunt and all are made to feel like ""regulars"".

4,Molly S.,"Longboat Key, FL",0,5,0,5.0,9/29/2018,"How many New York City restaurants have been around and thriving for 51 years? Not many that I know of. I have always been disappointed by reviews that discredit Neary's food and service. It is our (meaning my partner's and my) neighborhood pub and what we eat there -- typically lamb chops, roast beef or broiled fish du jour -- is consistently good. We are not talking exotic fine dining -- for heaven's sake, it's a pub. You can't beat it for those things ... not to mention the rice pudding, with or without whipped cream. The bread is, shall we say, not an attraction with the exception of the Irish soda bread for which I would gladly walk a mile. The servers are friendly and pleasant, as are proprietor Jimmy Neary and his daughter Ooma, who has a very big day job. We don't sit at the bar, which is typically crowded, but from the looks of things, the bartenders are Cheers grade. The clientele is not young and mostly midtown East locals. Don't go in dungarees but a tie is not required. Most of all, don't be put off by Zagat and other reviews. Enjoy it for what it is.",1,,
5,Ed H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",0,46,0,5.0,10/8/2018,"I celebrated my 65th birthday with seven family members at a luncheon here this past weekend. My son and I arrived early so we had a drink at the bar where we were welcomed very warmly by the cordial and attentive bartender. Afterwards we all had an amazing meal. I ordered the broiled sea scallops with turnips and it was incredible. Others had shepherd's pie, beefsteak, a cheese omelet and a pasta dish, with everyone raving about their selection. It was a pleasure to meet Mr. Neary and an honor to have him surprise me by bringing my rice pudding complete with a candle and a warm rendition of ""Happy Birthday."" Several days later and we are all still talking about the great time we had and are already planning our return visit.",,,
6,Bryant R.,"Manhattan, NY",101,518,0,4.0,4/9/2017,"Having read some of the negative reviews, I can understand how some would find the vibe here off-putting but I want to stress that I was treated well here and would return, though I tend to dress up to go out on a regular night (blazer, jeans, nice loafers). Definitely a spot for an older crowd, I have walked by many times and wanted to stop in and last night we did.  The bartenders were expert, warm and friendly.  There is clearly a lot of history to this place and a lot of locals and regulars.",6,1,2
7,Mary D.,"Miami, FL",32,17,4,5.0,6/9/2018,"I can't say enough about the wonderful experience we had tonight.  My husband and I took my parents and uncle for dinner to celebrate my Dad's 84th Birthday.  Jimmy was the best, sat down with us and made my Dad feel like a million bucks!  Three of us had the filet of sole with mashed potatoes, hands down the best I ever had!  My husband had the lamb chops which were excellent along with my Dad's scallops which he devoured!  I would definitely recommend this place and will return!  Thank you Jimmy and the staff at Nearys for making this a day to remember!",1,,
8,Eliziebetiano V.,"Brooklyn, NY",282,15,5,1.0,7/19/2018,Patrons beware. This long time establishment carries ignorance and hatred. If you are an interracial couple. You aren't welcome here. Last night my boyfriend (Irish) and I (Indian) came in an ordered oban at 11:30.  We sat at this dimlit pub and chatted and flirted. Which is normal relationship behavior and appropriate consider we are having drinks and out painting the town red. We weren't groping one another or making out. As my boyfriend was rubbing my back (as boyfriend do) the owner hits him with his cane and said i don't allow this behavior in my establishment and mistaken me for Lady of the night. I didn't realize moccasins and crochet vests are the new on the corner leisure way for men to find a good time. Do not be mistaken this establishment deserves to be shut down immediately for not accepting interracial companies especially in a city that is known as the melting pot of the world.,4,1,1
9,Tina K.,"Oakland, CA",63,25,16,5.0,5/27/2018,"I lived in NYC from 1990-1998, and Neary's still holds a special place in my heart. I've now lived in California for 20 years, but telling a friend about this authentic Irish pub in midtown Manhattan revived all the warm, affectionate feelings I have for New York (and maybe one Neary son in particular).   This is one place you must check out, whether you're visiting, or a long-time resident.",,,
10,Jeanne B.,"Moses Lake, WA",0,10,0,5.0,5/12/2018,Had a wonderfully delicious dinner at Neary's this evening. The food was excellent and the service was timely and very friendly! My three children who live in NYC had not been here and all agreed that the food and service were dazzling! My son brought their 3 yr old and 5 year old and the staff made a fuss over them. Mary took them to the kitchen and helped them make their own sundaes!! SO very delighted with our experience!!!,1,,
11,Eileen O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/2/2018,First of all this is not a fancy restaurant and is not a pleasant bar inside. Was sitting at the bar after work waiting for a friend and owner Neary the little old fart came up to me and said next time I come in can I dress a little better. I'm so sorry that my denim jean shorts and shirt are not to your standard because it's 90 degrees outside. Never been so offended in my life. Hope anyone who reads this knows if you're going here you're entering catholic Ireland in the 1950s smells like that too,2,3,2
12,Tamra S.,"Manhattan, NY",234,11,5,5.0,3/17/2018,"Second year in a row I ordered corned beef and cabbage from here for my company's St. Patrick's Day celebration. It is delicious and the staff, especially Mr. Neary, is just very pleasant.",2,,

14,Matt M.,"Toledo, OH",0,2,0,3.0,11/10/2017,The owner and staff are adorable but the food was meh.  Out of prime rib at 6:30?  Out of the first two wines we ordered?  The fish and filets had zero seasoning but were cooked well.,3,,1
15,Elizabeth C.,"New York, NY",0,30,4,1.0,3/17/2017,"I am a devout Catholic and had not been able to have Corned Beef and Cabbage in decades. I usually give up meat for Lent. This year, the Catholic archdiocese made a concession. I was excited and did my research. It was a long journey for me and I heard this was the place to go. It might have been the place to go - but they really didn't want me there. I'm an Asian woman and the moment I walked into the door today, I was dissuaded from service. ""Do you have reservations?"" Already knowing this place doesn't take reservations I said no. Told the wait was at least a half hour. ""That's ok,"" I said. Then suddenly the wait changed to ""1.5 hours."" The person working the door asked if I was waiting for someone. ""My husband, I'll just try to get a table."" As I was waiting for a table, the man at the door came back in and said he wouldn't let my husband (An Executive at Bloomberg) in because he was wearing sneakers. He didn't meet a dress code. (My husband was wearing a button down shirt, slacks and yes, black sneakers.) This as I am standing next to a very tall Irish gentleman wearing a full Tracksuit, sneakers and what looked like Bourbon Street beads. So no. Even though I had spent $50 to make it to Neary's. I never got to go. Their ""Appropriate Attire"" Is there way to eliminate people they don't want in the restaurant. I was the only non-Irish, Non-Geriatric person. I am not the kind of person to feel that I was racially profiled - but I totally was. As I felt such embarrassment being escorted out -- literally kicked out of the restauran --  I noticed the feet around me. Sneakers everywhere, sneakers here, sneakers there. Except everyone was white. I am Asian.I later found out that the guy wouldn't even let my husband get me to let me know himself he wasn't allowed. My family are longtime residents of Sutton Place. My husband works in the neighborhood.  They made a terrible decision tonight and made me feel very terrible about myself and making the effort to go to a place that didn't really want me there.",45,4,4

Updated review","Another great meal at Neary's.  The lamb chops with mint jelly are first class. My friend had the broiled salmon--a perfect 10. And Jimmy is still enforcing a dress code: No shorts, tank tops; collared shirts a must, and no hats.",2,1,1
17,Lisa N.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,47,3,5.0,4/8/2018,"After seeing this on a PBS special, we knew we had to stop by on our trip to New York.  We were not disappointed.  Jimmy is a great host and the food was incredible.  If you are in NYC please stop by Neary's.",2,,
18,Dorothy F.,"Manchester, NH",69,37,0,4.0,4/14/2018,"I concur with all of the reviews.   This is a nice place with a very friendly staff.   They have a great selection of fish and other offerings.  I had the shrimp scampi and it was absolutely delicious.   We all enjoyed our meals.   Yes,  it is an older crowd,  but who cares?   I found it a great place to dine as it isn't loud so conversation is easy.    We all liked our dinners and drinks.  The only reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is I can't imagine an Irish pub without draft beer.   I was all ready for a cold Smithwick's draft (sorry,  bottle not as good) ,  but my martini was good too.   I would go again.",1,,
19,Dan S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,21,6,5.0,1/4/2018,"Great comfort food like corned beef and cabbage, broiled fish... the night that I was there I had the roasted turkey special.  It was delicious!  Classiest Irish Pub ever.  No shorts and T-shirt's here.  Jimmy Neary has owned the place for over 50 years.  You are sure to see him.  He welcomes everyone.  He is legendary!",4,,
20,Mike M.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",44,82,95,4.0,4/9/2016,"We're here at Neary's early on a rainy, cold Saturday night.  The crowd is all above 70 and quite animated.  It seems that everyone has fortified him and herself from the elements.We always chat with people, whenever we come.  The reason is that the seating is close courted and lends to the congenial atmosphere. The guy next to me looks exactly like Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, but he assures me that that's not the case. Well I digress.  The meal has arrived, roast turkey and pork chops.  Both are absolutely delightful!! I don't know how they do it, but the pork chops are juicy and tasty as hell. The turnips are sweet and hit the spot.  All in all a wonderful experience as usual.  Jimmy you are the BEST!",2,,1
21,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,3.0,1/14/2016,"Neary's is a neighborhood regular's place if I've ever seen one.  It seems like the staff knows everyone in the place and that everyone has been coming here for years.  There is a waitress who has literally worked here for 50 years.  This aspect is pretty cool but can be intimidating to an outsider.  As others have mentioned, the crowd here tends to be older which is partly the result of the area as well as the clientele.  Reality is, most young people don't want to dress up to go to an otherwise ordinary restaurant for dinner.  Granted the dress code isn't strictly enforced, but if you come dressed casually you will feel out of place.  Decor is dark and classy, even if the place is a higher-end Irish pub.  Service is friendly and fairly efficient as you could expect.Drinks are on par for what you'd expect from a nice bar.  I only got scotch but the portions were generous.  Their bread basket has a few different kinds of bread which is nice.  For my meal I got the corned beef that multiple people rare about here.  The beef itself was tender and had plenty of flavor, but my main complaint was that there was so little of it.  Instead the dish was mostly cabbage and the mashed potatoes I ordered; again, these sides were very good, but what about the main dish?  A few more slices would've done the trick.  For $20+, I expected more.Walking in here is like walking back in time and that makes it worthwhile alone.  Very cool that it still exists and is run by the same gentleman who opened it decades ago.  Still, it's not really my scene as you can probably tell by my writing here.  I think I'll file this under ""glad I came, but probably not again anytime soon"".",3,2,2
22,David M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,36,7,5.0,12/22/2015,"I recently moved to the neighborhood from the west coast.  I've been to many local restaurants and bars.  If you like a classy, truly Irish place..... This is it!!  The crowd is not younger and hip.  Lots of other places for that.  This place is like a true Irish establishment were the care about their patrons.  Asked, introduced and met the staff/owner.  Remembered my name the second I walked in upon my second return visit.No loud, obnoxious crowd.  All depends on what your looking for.",3,,
23,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",784,815,371,4.0,9/20/2015,"I love this place. One of a dying breed of local or neighborhood restaurants in a city where rent renewals can be 100% and force places like Seasons to close or August to move from W Village to UES as a result. I had the lamb chops: 4 beautiful, tender, perfectly prepared chops with big baked potato loaded with sour cream, butter, chives, and steamed veggies. Martinis are big and strong and many of the people who patronize Pesce Pasta (whose bartender worked at Elaine's many years) come here as well. Friendly and comfortable. Prices vary. Some seems really lower than you would think, some (like the lamp chops) higher, but it's really enough for two people to split. Martinis are big and strong, unlike new upscale places where the glasses seem to be getting smaller and smaller with each passing year. That was another thing I loved about Seasons on 63/Park. Yes hotel bar pricing, but the thing was huge and you didn't need more than one. And I loved that unusual crystal glass.",5,2,1
24,Rob L.,"New York, NY",42,23,0,2.0,3/23/2017,I went there after work with a colleague for a drink because a review said they have a great bar. They lied! The barman was OK but not friendly however the drinks list was very limited. Only 4 or 5 Scotch Whiskies to choose from?? In New York Wow! - now that is limited. Then followed a procession of geriatric patron's with walkers. Clearly not for the younger set (I am 66) Neary's is off my list of places I will be frequenting in the future.,5,5,

Be careful it's no frills and a lot of regulars. All of them are friendly, and if you give the place a chance you'll love it. Just a brief taste of the food and it was good!

Having gone for so long it feels like ""Family"" both the staff and also the neighborhood regular patrons you get to know. I like the dress code. No one should wear sneakers nor tee shirts when attending a fine restaurant. They give you a jacket if a gentleman does not have one on. Mr. Neary is very special. Always a a big smile, friendly word and fun story. His lovely daughter is often there as well. They care about their patrons like Family. The staff has not changed since it opened many years ago. Everyone always in a good mood. You are never rushed. I highly recommend.",1,1,
29,Joan M.,"New York, NY",1,31,0,1.0,8/19/2015,"I live in the neighborhood many years and have been there sporadically mainly due to convenience and the fact that my mother likes it.   Lots of diners in the area are elderly and they are, apparently, very comfortable there.  Might have something to do with diminished eye sight.  It's amazing to me that my finicky mother likes it.   I think its because they have filet of sole (frozen and watery) and mashed potatoes on the menu which is her favorite.   That being said..... I think it is just horrible.   The last few times I've been there have been during the day when it is not very busy.   It is dreary, dark and depressing.   It probably isn't but it has this unsanitary atmosphere.   There are usually a few locals at the bar trying to forget the day that didn't start yet.   Food is borderline inedible.   A while back I had a craving for corned beef and cabbage and got it as take out.   It was just disgusting.   Most of it went into the garbageCan't understand the accolades but to each his own.  Also there is nothing ""upscale"" about this place.   If it didn't have the name it would be just another dark dive with mediocre overpriced pub food that tastes good if you had enough to drink",13,5,2

31,Rickie C.,"New York, NY",35,3,0,1.0,3/17/2017,Casual racism is completely uncalled for. Especially in the heart of New York City. My friend tried to eat here on St. Patty's Day and was given multiple excuses as to why her and her husband should not eat there.

From the wonderfully fresh shrimp in my shrimp scampi to their speciality Irish coffee, everything exceeded my expectations. Hope Jimmy and his restaurant will be around for another 48 years.",3,,
46,Amanda P.,"Goleta, CA",415,20,2,1.0,11/15/2014,This place sucked. The waitress was so rude she didn't care to help us at all.. The owner was rude as well. Unless your 60 or older stay away. Seems to cater only to old people. RUDEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET .. I hate this place more then mcdonalds.. I would rather dine in hell theN This place .. GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!,6,9,2
47,Simone W.,"Manhattan, NY",377,52,12,3.0,1/18/2013,"So let me start by saying that I only go here with my boyfriend and his 87 year old grandmother, who loves it because ""you don't have to make a reservation and they always have a table"". Neary's has been around for ages, it's family owned (the owner is often there and he's super nice), and it's very old school.When you walk through the heavy double door entrance, it's like walking into the past. They crowd is mostly older (its an octogenarian clubhouse lol), the bar is always crowded, the drinks are strong, and the walls are covered with random pictures and memorabilia (there's a really cool pen that once belonged to JFK next to the coat check).",6,1,
48,Steve F.,"Manhattan, NY",193,327,91,4.0,8/1/2012,"Live down the street and finally gave it a try. Huge tasty portions, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere is all you can ask for.  Came for lunch and there were only two other tables.  Dinner time is more crowded.We started with the Marinated Herring with Capers (yum) followed by the Stuffed Pork Chop  and the Corned Beef Hash with Poached Egg off the daily specials menu.  Old fashioned presentation but really tasty, simple, well-seasoned preparations.It's mostly an over-40 crowd or even over-60 but don't let that scare you away from giving the place a try.Lunch is a good time to sample the menu as entrees are the same size as dinner but about $5 less.  You can also take away but they don't deliver.",5,1,1
49,B W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,62,0,4.0,1/22/2016,We had lunch catered to our office on St Patrick's Day and everything was FANTASTIC and Super delish!  Una the manager was a pleasure to deal with and so lovely and helpful.  I would definitely recommend a visit to this charming spot.,2,,
50,Jessica G.,"Kew Gardens, NY",28,145,21,5.0,4/20/2014,"This place is different.  Definitely an older crowd.  Charming service, affordable prices, and delicious food.",3,2,
51,Lisa M.,"Wellington, FL",54,119,119,3.0,8/25/2014,"Warm friendly staff.  Attentive owner!  Simple food, decent prices.  Not a place for the young in the evening.",2,,

53,Marie L.,"Manhattan, NY",5,421,300,4.0,7/28/2011,"Goddamn, I love the Irish. Neary's is a great establishment. Where else do you walk in the door and the owner (in his early 80's)  immediately runs over and introduces himself to you. Such a welcoming place! Friendliest staff in the city. All servers and bartenders are incredibly friendly. Most entrees are in the 20-26 dollar range. The menu, like the place, itself, is very old school, traditional, and meat-centric. I would say the median age of diners is about 50, but I still come here on a regular basis, since the place is just so comfortable. The food is not innovative or cutting edge, but it is consistently good. The bartenders are also great fun. Quick to chat you up, offer food and drink suggestions, etc. They're also open late!Word to the wise: you don't have to wear a suit when you go here, but no ball caps or ripped t-shirts. I have heard Mr. Neary ask someone to take their hat off, and then mumble something about this not being a second avenue pub. ha!",4,4,2
54,Valentina H.,"Brooklyn, NY",196,181,82,4.0,3/14/2012,"This was another stop on our impromptu bar crawl on Monday.  I was a little skeptical when I saw the ""Proper Attire Required"" sign on the door because we were in scrubs. Oh no! Would they let us in? Would they serve us beer? I was already coming up with a plan B, just in case they turned us away. Fortunately, that was not the case. In fact, it was exactly the opposite of that.  It was an open armed welcome. The bar is geared toward an older crowd, and maybe they were happy to have a couple of nurses in the house. I'm not sure, but we were treated very well. We met Mr. Neary, who is preparing for a BIG St. Paddy's party. He warmly introduced himself. He's very proud of his restaurant, and was very eager to tell us all about the history of it. We enjoyed a cold Harp in a frosted glass. There are no beers on tap here, just bottles, and the selection is limited. I think they have Guinness, Harp, Heineken, Bud Light, and Coors Light. I'd like to come back for an early bird dinner. I'm sure the shepard's pie is amazing.",1,1,
55,Gerald H.,"Newtown, PA",86,65,3,4.0,11/14/2011,"If you pride yourself on your Irish heritage, then you need to come have a meal with Jimmy Neary.This establishment is classy sans a high priced fancy food menu.  The fare is basic but perfected.  The steak comes on a bed of toast - probably the best toast I have ever had.  The fish dishes again are basic, broiled or fried, but fresh and full of flavorThe Neary's staff is basically one big family and they are more than excited to welcome you to dinner.  The kitchen is open late and the bar hosts many an interesting tale.",2,,
56,Lawrence W.,"Rego Park, NY",0,145,0,4.0,3/8/2011,"These are the decent but really congenial neighborhood crowd who used to go to The British Open 2 blocks away; but, currently similar crowd to Parnell's on 1st Ave. Haven't hardly met a supercilious person here. Mr. Neary fits in well with the guests.Down the block from Sutton Place, it's worth wearing decent, fashionable clothes here. Many parents and grandparents will especially appreciate the traditionalism, service, and atmosphere without the stodginess. Menu selections are plentiful served with Potato & Vegetable. Fresh fish, mostly broiled and baked, stews, soups. Drinks are exquisite. Lawrence Weinzimer",2,,2
57,Craig G.,"Manhattan, NY",89,71,0,4.0,9/14/2010,"Neary's is like classy Irish restaurants in NY used to be decades ago, where the owner comes over to sit with you, where the bartenders greet you by name, and you feel at home. That's why there are so many old folk hanging at Neary's, because there aren't many places like this left. In fact Neary's may be the only one of its kind left.They do have a dress code and they don't mess around. No tshirts, beat-up jeans, sneakers, shorts, or hats. They will show you the door no matter how well they know you. It's genteel and old fashioned by our (young) standards, but sometimes the old guys will crack ribald jokes when the ladies aren't around.  If you watch Mad Men, you'll understand the vibe here.So, come if you want to step back in time.  It won't be around forever, so enjoy it while it lasts.",2,,
58,Westchester S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,4.0,3/17/2015,"Spent a wonderful Tuesday night at Neary's with my son. We live in the neighborhood but had never ventured into this gem. Jimmy, his daughter, the bartender and all of the staff made us feel as though we were regulars. Had delicious lamb chops and steak followed by amazing  rice pudding. The  food is delicious, hearty and a welcome change from the local restaurants. We will be regulars now.",,,
59,M W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,5.0,2/22/2013,"Great American Food! ...owned, served, and supported by a true American!Ask for Jimmy, and enjoy the solid and hearty meal of your visit to NYC!!I usually sit at the bar and enjoy all the folks who keep your drinks filled and food flowing.  What a great neighborhood place to enjoy your evening at meeting other great folks.  This is what our country needs - - hearty food (and healthy), good wines, and great fellowship with the kind folks who visit this place.The only tip, salt and pepper necessary on the vegetables....but at least you're getting fresh vegetables in NYC!!! ;-)",1,,
60,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,9/12/2013,Cafeteria food served to the elderly at ludicrous prices. We really regretted choosing this restaurant with each plate that arrived--and especially when the check came.,7,4,1
61,Richard D.,"New York, NY",55,55,0,3.0,7/16/2009,"I feel a little bad about the three stars because Irish food is just not terribly interesting.  I'm not holding that against them, but the vegetables were over-cooked and the bread was a bit on the dry side.  Having said that, though, the food was more than acceptable, and I thought the calves liver and onions that my companion ordered was quite good.  I had a prime rib.However, the setting is amazing and the staff is outstanding.  If you want a meal served by a friendly, professional staff, and you want to chat with the restaurant owner during the meal, if you want a sort of ""place where everyone knows your name"" feel, this is the place.  The bartender greeted every customer who walked in during the 20 minutes I waited there for my companion's arrival by their first name.  Every. Last. One.  I felt like I was crashing a private party.So, because the food could have been better, you don't have to over-cook vegetables and leave your bread out too long in order to preserve Irish authenticity, it just wouldn't be fair to the other restaurants I have given four stars to give this one four.  But, I like it, and I will go back, but for the atmosphere and service, not the food.",8,,1
62,Howard F.,"Miami, FL",3,41,0,4.0,8/5/2014,"Really great.  They don't need any more good reviews.  They're great.  Jimmy is great.  Liz, the best server, of 30 or more years. Best lamb chops.  Great calf liver.  Great corned beef and cabbage.  And, very fair pricing .  Will be returning to this gem of a restaurant",1,,
63,H. T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,28,0,4.0,7/13/2012,"It's all the best aspects of an Irish bar / restaurant in New York. Sometimes the dinner service can take a little longer than it should, but wow is it GOOD.",,,
64,Meow G.,"New York, NY",64,2,0,5.0,5/8/2010,"The owner isn't 'Joe' it's the fantastic Jimmy Neary. This place is instant family - yes, an older crowd - but everyone is so friendly. If you are a woman of a certain age, this is a great place to eat alone. I love the prime rib and the Irish Coffees are delish and deadly. It's like a club house and one of my favorite places in the universe.",,1,
65,Brendan M.,"Boston, MA",0,8,0,1.0,1/8/2013,"I took my wife for dinner here on Sunday, 1/6/2013.  As an appetizer I ordered the clams casino.  Two and half hours after leaving the restaurant I was on my bathroom floor puking my brains out.  Yeah, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but after I pay $108 for dinner for two, I don't expect to become violently ill and have to take a sick day from work.",4,,
66,Steve S.,"New York, NY",31,163,9,4.0,4/8/2007,"Very traditional pub-like/brandy room setting. Menu was pretty good. Had the steak tips with roasted vegetables. Reading the other reviews from 2005, Joe Neary (the owner) was actually still  there and came over to our table to chat.Very good service! Waitress was friendly and made some great suggestions. My friend had the prime rib which looked pretty good.FYI: Joe Neary doesn't like t-shirts or ""ripped"" jeans"", so don't make this your pre-going out dinner place...haha...unless you want to wear your coat during dinner.",2,,1
67,Hadley F.,"Dover, NH",0,10,0,3.0,10/12/2013,Been coming here all my life. Good simple food and great drinks. The decor is old fashioned and so is the food. Best Irish coffee and rice pudding ever.,,,
68,Joseph G.,"Little Neck, NY",2,182,0,5.0,11/29/2005,We had Thanksgiving dinner at Neary's in 2004 and it was wonderful! The service was fantastic and the owner was there speaking to each table to be sure all was well. Most of the entrees were less than $25.Would go there again in a heartbeat.,1,,
69,Judy L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",89,4,0,5.0,1/21/2008,"While vacationing over the Christmas holiday we had the extreme pleasure of visiting Neary's on a referral from 3 men we had met earlier in the evening. What fun.  We were treated like royalty from the moment we entered.   The owner grabbed us took us to his best table and proceeded to make us feel like one of his regulars, introducing us to everyone. The food was scrumptious and later we shifted to the bar where again we visited with everyone, even being treated to a bit of Irish Mist.  From Jimmy the owner to Johnny the bartender and all of the gracious regulars this place was delightful!",1,,1
70,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0,4.0,12/29/2005,"A neat neighborhood Irish pub! Feels like you've stepped back in time but it's warm, comfortable and the food is good! Had some of the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had. And, the chicken,  is worth the 20 minute wait. Service is pleasant and attentive and the $$$ are entirely reasonable. Yeah, the patrons are ""mature"" but we're all getting there, aren't we? And, we still like to eat, right? Well, here's a friendly neighborhood place to do just that and enjoy it!Pros: Good Irish food, Pleasant",,,1
