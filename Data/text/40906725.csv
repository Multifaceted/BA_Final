0,1,7/23/2013,302,,"Saint Paul, MN",Jana H.,991,3.0,239,"A welcome addition to Downtown Newark offering on-line ordering, delivery, catering and friendly to your wallet. -Price: Inexpensive averaging $4 -$8 per person (excludes beverage & tax)*Price Samples: Cheese Omelet $4.75, Cheese Burger $4.25, Turkey Club Panini $7.95 (prices as of 7/22/13. Prices subject to change). -Menu: If you only view the on-line menu, you wouldn't know that Washington Square Café has a large menu with items such as salads, burgers, bagels, pancakes, standard fried appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, gyros, wraps, egg dishes and more.  My grilled chicken was thin, seasoned well and overall tasty. The Gandules Rice is just fine but made better with pepper / or hot sauce and the Maduros (plantains) are okay, I personally prefer sweeter Maduros.*Tip: if you plan on ordering a Latin cuisine lunch special on-line for pick up, I suggest NOT doing so. The lunch specials are made hot and ready to go, no need to order in advance. Plus, ordering in person allows one to view the options and guarantees that your food is nice and hot. -Delivery: Free delivery. Limited delivery menu if you order on-line. The on-line delivery menu primarily consists of beverages and Latin cuisine specials. If you are looking for American food, call in your order. *Tip: If you place an order on-line for pick up, I suggest calling the restaurant to make sure that they've received your order. When I placed an order for pick up I received an e-mail confirmation. When I showed up the order had yet to be started. The staff was friendly and apologized for the inconvenience.-Service: Average - not too slow, not insanely fast and the staff is friendly.  -Bonus Points: Extra points for offering on-line ordering options plus delivery.  Breakfast served all day. Pizza is served by the slice or whole. -Typical Crowd: Construction workers, The Rutgers-Newark Community, Police, Prudential Employees and City Employees. -Miscellaneous: Washington Square Café has five booths that comfortably seat four adults (six if you squeeze) and two small tables seating two.",1
