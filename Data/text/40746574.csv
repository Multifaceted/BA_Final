0,Kaitlyn F.,"New York, NY",252,42,43,5.0,10/5/2018,"Okay ok obsessssssssed with the wings. Holy cow are they delicious! I've been meaning to come here for wings quite some time now, and it certainly did not disappoint! Firstly, you can tell the staff are like family. Everyone communicates to one another and helps to ensure anyone that walks through that door is having a good time and eating/drinking well, even the bouncer is great! The specials defiantly cater to wing Wednesday's and football season, but the drinks are also at a good price. I got the classic single wings (10 a piece for 13$) which I think is a steal. I got the Thai chili flavor and they were delicious. I did not stop eating them until I was finished, I didn't even engage in conversation they were that good. They are perfectly crispy and crunchy but also somehow perfectly coated with the sauce. I probably could've split the order and got a dip but I'm beyond happy I didn't. Highly recommend, prob some of the best wings in the city!!!!",1,1,1
1,Alison A.,"Manhattan, NY",361,84,138,4.0,9/18/2018,"Great spot. Have been here a bunch of times, they do the wings and beers well.Ton of beer specials on Sundays, for football. $18 for a bucket of 5 beers, can't be that!Wings - Get bone in, buffalo, bbq or garlic parmesan, you won't be disappointed.Definitely try the 'chicken littles,' cooked the same as wings, but boneless, essentially.PRO TIP: Try wings Carrie's Way. I don't know how to describe the flavor, it's a mix of sauces, not on the menu but so delicious.",,,
2,Marijana B.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,10,7,5.0,7/26/2018,"Great place with good music, the atmosphere and the service is excellent. Nice selection of beer (the Brooklyn lager highly recommended), didn't try the food but the people around who did - they looked happy and satisfied :).Not empty, not too crowded- enough room for everyone. I'll definitely come back!",,,
3,Dimitric H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",61,115,154,4.0,5/13/2018,"Still on the search for a great bar that has great wings and also a place I can watch games. This place is definitely an option on my radar. Wings were solid, my favorite option that is not on the menu were ""Kerry's Way"" a mix of honey mustard and BBQ. These were the standout and excellent. Also got the garlic parmesan personally did not like this flavor.Waffle fries were hot and fresh out the fryer. I will definitely come back here to watch a game, the only flaw is that I wish they would change the supplier from where they get their wings. The wings are on the small side and wish they were bigger. Another than that pretty good overall.",,,
4,Erick S.,"North Wales, PA",327,117,406,4.0,10/7/2018,"came here after a friend recommended it, so a few of our friends decided to come through. we came on a friday night, it was packed and loud, exactly what i expected at a sports bar. we ordered a few drinks, had their classic buffalo and the sweet chili, both were delicious and meaty, and the waffle fries and onion strings were well fried and on point! i'll recommend it to any other bar food and wing enthusiast out there.",,,
5,Michael C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/28/2018,"Service was somewhere between an Arby's and a middle school cafeteria. Order was incorrect and the staff was rude. There is too much competition in this area to half-ass anything, let alone treat customers poorly.Customers are expected to drink draft beer from filthy lines, which clearly are not kept in compliance with code. A separate complaint has been filed with the City of New York. Avoid at all costs!",1,,
6,Andrew C.,"Melville, NY",147,638,2320,3.0,12/17/2017,"A good sports bar to watch Sunday football with friends and family. We love their wings, especially hot wings.

7,Michelle A.,"Bronx, NY",1,9,19,3.0,10/7/2018,"My job is close to this place so I have been here a few times for beer and wings. They do change their beer selections. They do seasonal one which are sometimes are good. Im a cider girl so I do drink the cider they have which is good. The wings are great. I LOVE spicy but the nuclear hot sauce is ok. Its not spicy it just numbs your tongue. Its hard to explain if you dont eat much spicy stuff. We ordered the nachos and sometimes bars would add cheese, your choice of protein, beans/chili, sour cream and guac buuuuuuut in bar coastal it was just nachos, chicken and cheese. Guac, sour cream and chili were in small plastic containers. When they gave us the nachos they didnt look appetizing to begin with. We got wings which were hot and good, onion fries were ok cant complain. Service was good they checked in on us regularly. The whole place was good and lively.",,,

Updated review","I ended my original review stating, ""how can I get this place to be my local spot?"" and little did I know, 1 year later and it would be..... NYC really makes dreams come true.The vibe is still all that its about.  Cali' livin, sun lovin', surf ridin', it's all about the slow life. The decor and vibe is fun, with surfboards, sharks, and lots of Cali memorabilia, with a lot of it being throwback . Music is always spot on, raggae, beach, throwbacks. Great cocktails and cheap beers. I've explored the food menu more, and can honestly say they have the BEST waffle fries and chicken fingers that I have had in NYC. This brings ""sports bar"" ""local bar"" to a whole new level and makes competition for any other place tough. Good tunes, good vibes, good beer, lotta tv's, good food.. how did I get so lucky for this to be my neigbhorhood bar?",5,3,4
9,Peter D.,"Manhattan, NY",19,65,332,5.0,10/16/2018,"Best place to watch a Yankees game. Wings are awesome and super cheap beer. This is the quintessential NYC sports bar. Waffle fries are bomb. Also, one of the best places to watch the NYC marathon. It gets crazy, but they party all day and blast music. Fun",,,
10,L T.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,28,10,3.0,5/19/2018,"Came for Atomic Wings, was surprised to see it as a conjunction with another bar. Didn't try the drinks, I was just craving some atomic wings around the area and it took me here. Not much to say, but they have a lot of food options on the menu, nice seating area outside (with wonderful lighting) and the ladies bathroom was clean. Would have still preferred an original Atomic Wings establishment because man was it pricey lol. By the way, the Thai chili is their best flavor to me the teriyaki is way too bold (unless you're into that).",,,
11,Kay W.,"New York, NY",1,161,10,3.0,4/21/2018,This bar serves alcohol and mediocre food and it's just fine. It's a popular place though! Check it out to see if the crowd is your style. It's a good spot to watch games with friends and strangers. They'll never be in want of patrons. Even with mediocre food. I don't think people come here for the wings. There is a bouncer so be on good behavior.,,,
12,Dani G.,"Manhattan, NY",32,12,3,1.0,10/4/2018,If you're from Los Angeles definitely do not come to this bar. They have LA signage and are trying to pretend to represent us transplants. But I came all the way up town to watch my beloved dodgers play on game 1 of the playoffs and they refused to put the game on more than 1 tiny TV. And said they favored New England football over dodger baseball.  No Cali pride here. I only give it one star bc the wings are pretty good.,,,
13,Lazy Lightning L.,"New York, NY",2,17,0,5.0,9/23/2018,"This place has the best wings in the city. Always crispy and the sauces are great. They are the only place that you can get secret off the menu Keri's wings as well, honey mustard mixed with hot sauce I think",,,
14,Pj C.,"Manhattan, NY",27,8,8,5.0,5/4/2018,Best bar in the Upper East Side. The taps are as clean and pure as the River Thames. Bud Light pints are perfectly cool and crisp on a hot summers day. Atmosphere is great. Food is fantastic. Best wings I've ever had. Music great. Bartenders are amazing. Always a great crowd. 5 stars.,2,,
15,Johanna R.,"Manhattan, NY",54,65,38,5.0,6/2/2018,"So I have to give this place 5 stars. First Mike the bartender is the best and funny as hell. So I always come here and get the waffle fries with the cheese dip which is delicious. I also have the fried shrimps which is good. A lot of people come here for the wings but im not like a wing person. But yesterday BOYYYYY I had some bbq wings and guys let me tell you hmmmmm... the wings were fried perfectly and the sauce sat right on those wings Im just glad I got to live this long enough to try some wings like this ... i did not use all ten fingers to eat the wings but maybe next time ill dig in !!!And, the drinks hmmm ill let Mike make the drinks for you lol lets just say I always miss a step on my way out !",,1,
16,Ireen K.,"Ridgefield, NJ",227,133,508,3.0,8/16/2017,"Went on a Monday night to grab wings after work.. and must say it was pretty lively, surprising for something on the UES. Was greeted and seated immediately, but must say the service was lacking. The waitress took a while to come and take our order and after receiving our food, we were never checked on. Even after finishing it took quite a bit of time to get the check. A bit off putting to say the least. Though I must say their wings are delicious and their pricing is reasonable. Hoping that my next visit that I'll get some better service. Everything else about the bar is pretty uneventful and mundane.",3,3,3

18,Amy Bianca L.,"New York, NY",277,65,9,4.0,6/23/2017,Super loud joint on the UES at night - BUT THEIR WINGS ARE THE SHIN DIG!Best place for wings right around my old apartment. I met up with an old coworker here to catch up and we could barely hear each other. The next time I was with a group of 4 and we sat in the back. Wings and tequila is the best mix here.,2,,
19,Austin D.,"Penfield, NY",86,6,0,1.0,3/24/2018,Tbh the wings and nachos here are absolutely horrible. There wings are the size of dominos and the nachos were just awful...  the meat is not seasoned and  the cheese was disappointing so I would never order those again .today I got the onion and waffle fries and the waffle fries were  phenomenal while the onion rings were subpar as at best. As a Main course I picked the chicken tenders and they were ....edible Overall if ur looking for a cheap place to go for drinks and maybe to get some food when ur hammered it's alright but for your sake only get chicken tenders and waffle fries stay away from everything else .,,,
20,Bchapow C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,51,1,1.0,7/6/2018,"Not a great experience tonight at Bar Coastal. We had to get up and ask the waitress for salt and pepper, knives and forks (which they never ended up bringing) & the cheese dipping sauce. They also got our wings order wrong! The waitress wasn't very good and wasn't impressed to be at work at all. Never coming back! Sorry!",,,

24,Lauren T.,"Boca Raton, FL",491,3,0,3.0,9/16/2018,"Love this place for a quick bite and game day. However the waitresses and hostess are the opposite of friendly. We walked in and put our name on the list for a party of 3 and when we realized they were seating people before us that had come after we confronted them asking when we would be able to sit. There were plenty of tables open but they said they couldn't sit us because we weren't a party of 4, we finally convinced them to let us sit because the table was completely empty and when we got to the table our waitress slammed the plates down and has been rude to us ever since. Makes such a fun place not as fun!",,,
25,Dayna W.,"ASTORIA, NY",4,4,0,4.0,9/10/2018,"Bar Coastal is an upper east side staple and one of my favorites for chicken wings. 4 stars only because service is always touch or go unless you get someone who's worked there a while. Most recently had a server Kayla who was unfriendly, short and at some points been rude to our table. Wouldn't recommend going back on a Monday night but have always had stellar service other days of the week.",,,
26,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,2/23/2017,"Came here on a Saturday around 6:30pm.Ambiance: You walk into Cali surf décor. Place was not packed and we got seats at the bar.  They have a back area with extra tables. It was difficult to hear the music they were playing but it seemed like old school pop and rock. Service: Bartender was straight to the point.Food: Their sweet potatoes fries were pretty good. The nachos on the other hand, mediocre.  I tasted their buffalo wings and they were good (my friends were trying to see if they were better than Jake's Dilemma fries-they were not better or worse).  I also had the wings with the Kerry sauce and it was quite delicious, but it gave me a stomachache (blah).Drinks: I only had one drink but the price was pretty good.This place is decent if you are in the area but as a west side girl, this is just too out of the way for me to return to if not already in the area.",3,,2
27,Cristina L.,"New York, NY",262,101,8,2.0,3/4/2017,"I'm giving two stars based on Yelp's ""meh, I've experience better"" guidelines. Happy hour sucks. It is $4 for bud lite....that's happy hour.I enjoy a good happy hour around 5pm. I don't eat wings, so I can't speak to those. But I can speak to the happy hour deals.And... no. I won't be back for happy hour ever. I may come in for a casual beer or maybe a whiskey on the rocks. This place is a sports bar, a little divey, and is designed to be a rather casual no-frills place. I can definitely appreciate that. But at $8 per draft beer....ehhhhhh.... or to use Yelp's term: meh, I've experienced better.I'm a frequenter of the bars on 2nd ave, so that's why this bar's prices kinda wow'ed me. Being on 1st ave, which is a bit *thankfully* quieter than 2nd, it was unusual to drink an $8 domestic beer on draft during happy hour.Really great service, but the prices threw me off.",1,1,1

Anyone else is not qualified or understands my needs as a consumer.  I came in one time and everyone after that they both rembrd who I was and what I order.  I've been coming for 6 years now.  The new girls are...

For food, definitely try the waffle fries or the sweet potato waffle fries, the quesadillas, and the wings. As for drinks, it's a full bar so drink whatever your liver desires. It's a great time to be had, whether you start, spend, or end your night here. The servers and bartenders are absolutely awesome.

Perhaps, since you probably live in the neighborhood, head to Barnes and Nobles and buy Parenting For Dummies. Bar Coastal is a well respected BAR on the Upper East Side. Great food, fun atmosphere, and awesome bartenders and owners. Yes it has TVs, noise, and finger food but that does NOT mean it is a place for children. It is disheartening and just pathetic that you are blasting Bar Coastal on social media for your terrible parenting decision for wanting to take your infant to a bar which by law only allows customers that are 21 years +.

Also she came around like once an hour so it was difficult to get our drink orders in when she was MIA most of the night. Then she brought the wrong cider, although I specified, and when I mentioned I wanted the other cider she snapped at me even though she was in the wrong.

Had the jumbo chicken strips buffalo style, very lightly battered and were very juicy and tender inside. Got the wafer fries & onion rings combo; asked to have the smothered with chili and sauce was instead given a cup of cheese on the side and an actual small pot of Chili that had white beans and veggie mix in it with chunks of beef in a (color) looking broth.

51,Tracy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,11,0,2.0,5/4/2018,". I was in the neighborhood late afternoon, not crowded and wanted something fast. I had my infant with me and was basically told to leave as they don't want children. It's a bar/ restaurant so legally they can't do anything about it. Certainly I wouldn't take my baby to a bar during happy hour or later- but I needed a quick spot- so I ignored the staff and grabbed a bite while my 5month old slept on my lap. Average food but probably fun if you want an easy, inexpensive dive bar/restaurant. I was able to make some calls, sit for 25min and eat - all while getting a stare down by the staff. So be warned customer service- not here! But don'tlet the attitude bother you. They win either way as they get the revenue and I am a very good tipper (which produced the only polite exchange post meal:). Oh and if they tell you no kids due to ""insurance"" tell them to settle down and learn the law or drop dining area/ menu from their offering:)",,,

54,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",824,153,147,4.0,11/19/2015,"A solid choice for beers, wings, and sports.Sometimes, you just want a casual hangout where you can unwind after a busy day of work - whether it is to catch up with friends or watch the night's football/basketball/baseball/etc. game.  I have been coming here for a while now since living in the neighborhood, and it succeeds in filling that need.There is one bar and two seating areas with plenty of tables, televisions, and surfboards (yes, it is a California-based theme).  Bartenders and waiters have always been friendly and attentive.  There have been few times when my group's pitchers or buckets of beers have been empty before a server inquires about the next round.I am going to go out on a limb and say this is one of the better bar menus in the UES.  This place serves legit appetizers, and their chicken is awesome.  Start with the wafer fries and/or friend mac & cheese wedges, followed by as much chicken that you can fit into your stomach.  I prefer the boned wings, but the chicken littles (boneless) are also good if you are looking to keep your hands clean.  The chicken sandwich is also great.  I am a fan of the buffalo sauces (select suicidal if you want to lose feeling in your mouth), but there is also honey mustard, teriyaki, jerk BBQ, chipotle BBQ, garlic parmesan, and Thai chili if you desire something milder.Overall, I really enjoy it here as a casual watering hole.  Check it out if you are in the area!",2,,
55,Ashley G.,"Shavertown, PA",22,32,9,5.0,3/24/2018,"This is a really low key cool place to grab a drink and watch a game. During weekdays it's not super crowded but it can get busy on weekends. The bartenders are all super nice & the drinks are all very good! Also, the Thai wing sauce is to die for!",,,
56,Roger A.,"Manhattan, NY",83,511,38,4.0,11/22/2015,"I love Bar Coastal.I've been coming here for years and this place is awesome.It's a good sized sports bar with plenty of TVs tuned to different games. Most of the seating is in stools either at the bar or tables.There's a dozen or so beers on tap, always wide range from pilsner to IPA to stout.  I love the boneless chicken wings and the waffle fries!  My go to food choices!  YUM!  get extra hot sauce to spice it up!One of my favorite places in the 70s on the UES, hands down.",1,,
57,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1260,4.0,7/14/2014,"I came here with some friends since I was in the area and we were in the mood for wings. After looking for a place on Yelp for good wings in the area we found this place and let me tell you we weren't disappointed. We got there and since the waitress wasn't around some guy came over and gave us menus. The waitress came by right after and was really nice. We got the wings (delicious), loaded fries (okay) and onion rings (very good). I also got a margarita and it was really good.I was very happy with the service and wings. I was very shocked by the cheap prices as well.",2,1,1

60,Stephanie H.,"Holly Springs, NC",528,1095,3656,3.0,8/13/2015,"BAR-Coastal is a California themed bar located in the UES. We did not stay long, came here to split a few pitchers with friends.

Wings come with plenty of sauce, medium was the right heat. I liked the blue cheese dip, and you also get carrots & celery. People in the bar seem pretty cool. Will come here if I crave wings next time.",,,
65,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,485,4.0,5/30/2014,"Wings --- YES PLEASE. This is my go to spot hands down for wings on the UES. I've been here a dozen times or so, mainly on Wednesdays when they have wing specials, buy one plate, get one half off. The wings are great, crispy, meaty, & flavorful. My favorite is the Cary's way which isn't on the menu. It mixes buffalo style and honey mustard which is a delicious combo!This place gets crowded. Especially when there is some big game on tv. It's most definitely a sports bar, lots of tv's, beer pitchers, etc. The service is usually decent. There usually isn't more than 2 waitresses at any given time, but when it's packed, it's definitely tough to get their attention.This place is good to come to with big groups. I'd 100% recommend the fries/onion rings combo. Killer. And will feed 4 people. Overall, this place is a great neighborhood spot. I've only ever had wings and fries but it fulfills my need for it! It's nice in the nice weather to sit by the open windows and be outside. Shout out to Laura, she's a great and friendly waitress and always provides good service!",1,,
66,John T.,"Manhattan, NY",12,3,0,2.0,1/20/2018,"WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE CHICKEN WINGS IN THIS PLACE?!!! This review gets two stars, because it's a good bar. I ordered the wings, because I used to consider them the best around. I was looking forward to enjoying them once again. What a huge disappointment to see the smallest wings that I've had in a long time. It was actually comical how small a couple of them were. The sauce is still the same great sauce that they've had for years. However, their wings used to be big and meaty. These were anything but. Dunno, maybe I just came upon a bad batch, but this is no longer my go to place for wings. I'd rather that they would tell me that they were out of wings than to be served what I was served. It's a sad day...",,,
67,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,6/30/2015,"*This review is only about the drinks and service.*I came here with a friend to watch American Pharaoh get triple crowned, and I'm so glad I did! What a fun place with a great atmosphere. Wooden tables and nautical-themed decor throughout (shocker, huh? ;) gives this place a nice by-the-beach vibe. There are large TVs above the bar and in the dining room, and they always have sporting events on. During the race, the place was packed and the bar was buzzing with excitement! Very fun!Their drinks are decent and service is attentive, but our waitress was a little overbearing. Every 5 minutes, she'd come over, interrupt my conversation with my friend, and ask us if we were doing okay. It felt like she was trying to end her shift and we were holding her up. Too much.Overall, this place is a great place to go if you're looking to catch a game or just grab a drink and be among a fun crowd. Based on past reviews, the food here also seems decent so I'll have to be back for some wings and nachos!",2,,
68,Monica L.,"New York, NY",0,14,1,5.0,6/30/2017,Really good wings and chicken sandwich! Very chill bro bar/restaurant. Good for hanging out with a big group and watching the games. Also love that they show west coast teams,,,
69,Orinda K.,"Manhattan, NY",169,156,105,5.0,5/25/2015,"Went here to watch a basketball game. It was a quiet time because it was Memorial Day weekend. I know that in general this place gets overpacked but I really enjoyed it at its quieter moments when I visited.The ambience is awesome. So many TVs and they play different games at the same time. The big TV shows the most popular game.Their food was great as well. We had the popcorn shrimp, the lil chicken, the wafle fries, and Mac and cheese wedges. All were great. The lil chicken was mild but quite hot even the mild. But overall amazing bar food!Service was pleasant as well. There was not a long wait and our waitress was attentive without being overbearing!I'm so glad I checked this spot out. I will absolutely be visiting again when I'm in the mood to watch games!Prices were also very decent for upper east side!! I highly recommend this spot!!",1,,2

The wings are crispy, meaty and the flavor is ""blow your mind"" awesome. To be honest, I don't even know if this flavor is on the menu, but I believe it's buffalo sauce mixed with honey mustard dressing. Enough said. Pair these wings with a onion ring/fry combo platter and your night is set. Apart from the wings, this little bar has a really great vibe thats ideal for a casual night out to watch the games. Be advised, it gets pretty crowded...but there are plenty of TVs for your enjoyment.This is definitely a neighborhood favorite!!!",1,1,2
74,Steven M.,"New York, NY",170,14,0,4.0,11/2/2017,"Great spot on the upper east side for wings and a beer(or two). The wings are some of the city's best, and the waffle fries are a must. The fries are always deep fried and crispy, and come in large portions. Beer is reasonably priced and there is always a good crowd. Get here early to watch games, as seating is limited and people tend to stay for awhile. In the summer they always open up the large windows in the front which makes for a great addition to an already A+  sports bar.",,,

My husband and I were loyal customers throughout the past 5 years until today. They would not allow us to bring our daughter into the restaurant in the middle of the day, while 90% of the tables were open and we were there to meet a full table full of friends and family. We are VERY disappointed in the lack of accommodation and the fact that they were not even apologetic to the fact that I have already had my daughter in there twice without anyone batting an eye. Once loyal customers who have brought them TONS of business over the past 5 years turned away because we have a child... We are now Done with them and so are our friends and family. They do get two stars because the wings are that good...",,1,

It's a great place to watch a game. The only negative is that it's obviously a west coast bar so you have a ton of band wagon San Francisco fans. Other than that, it's one of my favorite spots in the city",2,,
78,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,3.0,1/5/2016,"I was disappointed with their wings.I thought this was the go to spot for wings upper east but hadn't ordered from here in a year or so - until last night. The barbecue wings did not have much meat/ chicken to them as I thought I remembered. And were underwhelming. My brother agreed and didn't eat many. Having most of the 10 leftover I tried to give some of the chicken to my cat - he eats anything--  and he wouldn't even eat it. Ha I had my first fish taco there a few years ago and thought it was so great then, and the one we ordered last night while pretty good and with a little spice/ kick was not great like I remembered.Fresh carrots and celery w the wings were fresh and good.I need to find a go to spot for the occasional times we want wings as bar coastal' were not meaty and disappointed.",,,

Well you don't have to because there is one on the upper east side.Even though there wasn't many people there, it has a very ""bro"" vibe with the blue and purple dark atmosphere. I wouldn't be surprised if they had fish bowls. It was actually pretty dead for a Friday night. Hopefully y'all don't get approached by the gentlemen who live above this bar. They like to interrupt conversations and talk highly of themselves to the point of unbearable exhaustion. I don't think I would com enact here, unless they have a very great happy hour, but I don't even wanna further explore my options here.",,1,

Large windows allow for optimal people watching.",,,

There are plenty of TV's and a screen on the wall to watch the game at any angle. Food is pretty good. The sweet potato waffle fries was the highlight of the meal. The wings and chicken tenders were decent, but nothing that wow'ed me. Regardless, this place is worth coming and I will be returning when I want some food while watching football",,,

Damn, theses guys know how to make fried food.The wings are so good we wanted to get delivery the following week to realize they do not deliver. Not sure why we haven't come down here for so many years....

The food came in a timely manner and was reasonably priced especially considering the portion sizing. We were surprised with how good the Wings and the popcorn shrimp were (extra points for the fact they were ordered). The wings were meaty, and not overly fried. I ordered 20 thinking they would be skimpy like most places but I was very wrong. The shrimp were crispy, fresh and most importantly, very delicious.

I tried the waffle fries with cheese, wings mild, and fried mac and cheese wedges. The problem was the food ended up soaking up all the alcohol lol. So I was pretty sober. The waitress was really nice although another girl kept coming to our table so it felt like we had 2 waitresses. The negatives of this place: the music could've been better, the sound system sucked the speakers kept going in and out.when we asked for patron shots we were told after we took the shot that they are actually out of patron and that they gave us Don julio instead. The shot glasses look like baby shots to. Overall I'm not sure i would return at night but for lunch maybe.",,,
132,Paul K.,"New York, NY",4,45,1,4.0,10/12/2014,"Went here to watch a Univ of Wash football game, it was the only place I could find that actually had the Pac 12 network. Score!The wings were good. The wings are deep fried making them nice and crunchy, which I love. (i.e., my pet peeve = soggy hot wings) I got the medium sauce given my reflux after years of drinking IPA's and spicy foods and the spice level for me was perfect. They also loaded the plate with a ton of celery and carrots which was a nice compliment to the wings.The one thing that irked me was the price for the beer. They give you a petite manila envelope with the beers listed per pint but not pitcher. Usually when you order a pitcher you tend to save a lil bit but not the case here. In other words, if the Stella Artois is listed $7 pint then the pitcher is $28 since you get exactly four pints per pitcher. So all in all we spent a pretty penny for burgers, wings and beer. (i.e., party of 4 ended up paying close to $300.)I know, its NYC, but come on man, its burgers, wings and beer! I like the place but the beer is overpriced...I'll probably go back for the wings but next time I'm sticking to the cheap beer AKA Bud Light or Bud",,,

Fried mac and cheese, waffle fries and chicken Littles are my favorite choices on the menu. Honey mustard is my favorite. But if you want something alittle bit spicier...I'd go with Terri style.

159,April M.,"Boston, MA",56,266,196,4.0,2/11/2012,"I had been avoiding Bar Coastal like the plague ever since I moved to Yorkville. I walked by every night after work, peering in through the wall of fogged-up glass windows to see only swaths of frat boys and omg girls, oft grimily peering back out at me. Not that they didn't have every right.When I moved to NYC, I had no idea what an absence of decent bars and restaurants there would be in the particular neighborhood we ended up choosing. Not that it would have mattered, I couldn't afford downtown anyways. But, it has very much come in to play that there is often no where to go, or worth going, when the fiance and I just want to hang out, without hoofing it all the way to the 6 or coughing up loot to catch a cab downtown. Caution: run-on sentence ahead. However, taking from lessons learned back in Boston on making assumptions on an establishment and never trying it until the last minute, and then regretting having waited all those years to discover how great it was, we one night decided to brave the wall of baseball caps and button-ups to try none other than: Bar Coastal.Winner winner, chicken dinner. Comparatively, Bar Coastal is not half-bad! Given its competitors - Brother Jimmy's, Stumble Inn, Hi-Life and a bunch of other dive-y or stuffy (in a bad way) places not even worth mentioning, it makes quite a good option.Bar Coastal is in no way breaking any molds in the sports bar category, but it gets the job done, and done well.They offer a standard selection of beers on tap and in bottle, and a full bar. With ample seating in the front, at the bar and in a side section, there's usually room to sit (unless on a big game night or prime time on weekends). The food is actually not bad - I was shocked to find this out! Probably some of the best ""bar food"" I've had. And actually, their burger is one of the best burgers in general, that I've ever had anywhere. It is FAT JUICY and FULL OF FLAVOR. And no, I'm not talkin bout your momma's behind. These burgers seriously deserve some recognition. The unsung heros of UES sports bars. Try one, you won't be disappointed. The fries aren't bad either, but I don't see why everyone is raving over them. I'd rather have an order of the ""I-know-these-came-from-a-freezer-bag-but-I-don't-care-because-they-taste-so-damn-good"" mac'n chhese wedges. Drool.If the surf board, license plates, t-shirts, neon signs and other paraphernalia didn't give it away, the decor is over the top California surfer - quite apparently, that's their theme: CA. Can't miss it. Service has been average - they haven't done anything wrong, but they haven't done anything special, either.They have multiple flat screen TV's at all angles, all playing different sports events at any given time (I'm sure you can request special games) as well as a giant projector in the middle of the room that usually boasts the big game of the evening. There are darts in the back for the less-drunk of us (not sure how you get ahold of those). The music, predictable; light and fun. A mix of 80's big hair bands and Top 40 Hits.All in all, you really can't go wrong at Bar Coastal, as long as you know what to expect. It's a laid back sports bar offering standard drinks, standard fare and standard experience - but exceptional burgers. I'm happy we went. And yes, we've been back multiple times!",1,2,1

I convinced my friend to go here with me instead of another bar that also had good reviews on wings but was closer to where we were. We ordered the 10 piece medium flavored wings,  loaded fries, and onion rings. I also got a side of ""suicidal"" sauce because I like spicy food. The wings were good; however, the ""suicidal"" sauce was not that spicy.  The loaded fries was a disappointment in my opinion.  The fries was not as crispy as I would have liked and the chili that it was topped with, was not that flavorful and a little on the watery side.  The onion rings were thinly sliced and lightly coated with breading.....it was ok. It could have been better seasoned and hotter (temperature wise). I really wanted to try the mac and cheese bites, but because the portions were huge we decided in the end not to get it. Food prices are cheap. Recommended for college students on a budget.Our waitress was nice and helpful with food recommendations (we should have probably listened to her and not have ordered the loaded fries lol).

And delivery is also great. They have all kinds of soft drinks and Ben & Jerry's, too, which they'll happily and quickly deliver. They forgot my root beer once on delivery and offered to bring it back, credit me the difference or 'owe me one' and the next order they definitely sent me a free root beer. Good bar food when you're in the mood for something on the not-so-healthy side. Wish you could order online, but phone call only.",,,
163,Allison S.,"Boston, MA",127,262,19,2.0,8/27/2012,"Bar-Coastal seemed to be a surf/tiki/California-themed place that has a pseudo outdoor patio type of area. The outdoor patio area was pretty cool.I stopped in for a few drinks with a few friends on a Saturday night and it was absolutely dead. There were maybe 10 people in the entire place, and it was fairly sizable. It wasn't really a dive bar, but I also didn't find it to be super clean either. Meh. There are other places in NYC for me to visit.",,,
164,Grant B.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,107,234,4.0,7/9/2010,"This bar contains all the feel of a west coast bar, but in the heart of the Upper East Side of Manhattan.  If you are a USC, UCLA, or LA fan of sports, it is a great place to find your game on.  Food: The waffle fries are DELICIOUS - they literally are the greatest fries I have ever tried.  Drinks: are averagely priced for well drinks and beer. There happy hour is pretty consistently priced with the rest of the area.  Ladies night on Thursday...$2 well drinks for the ladies....$5 well drinks for the men.",,,

Was delighted to see the Olympics on and to hear grown men cheering on the gymnastics team! Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered a surplus of food. A single of BBQ wings (10 wings), a chicken sandwich, and a mix of onion rings and fries.As always, this was too much food... But there's nothing wrong with taking the rest home!Staff was very nice and accommodating, and for everything under $30, I left a very full and happy lady.",,,

Their latest menu offers more choices for sauces, and now my boyfriend and I are obsessed with their honey mustard sauce. More honeyey than mustardy, which is fine by me.They also have a veggie dip platter for all you wanna be health freaks who have to eat great despite yourself sitting in a deep fried bar. But regardless, you'll get a great amount and selection for a decent price- Good Sunday Fundays...I usually like to end my Funday here to get completely obliterated before watching TrueBlood.... but always roll in with a crowd, as most people there tend to.Now I'm hungry.",2,2,2

168,Courtney K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3,8,0,5.0,1/9/2012,"I love this place.  It is THE BEST place to watch big games -- like all NY teams -- b/c they have a huge screen they pull down so the whole bar can watch, AND they actually play the sound of the game/network vs. the stupid music, like so many other so-called ""sports bars"" do.  I wish I could get more people to come uptown and hang up here. The bartenders are also really cool and make the place that much better.I don't eat here, because I'm a vegan (LOL!) but I hear their chicken sandwiches and wings are pretty dope. Give it the ol' college try...you won't feel like you're on what you imagine to be the UES.",1,,

It's one of those Cheers type places that has a regular group of guys who are in their daily drinking and loafing. They're all very nice, but past a point it gets weird seeing the same 45 year olds in the bar all the time.Some of the staff is great, others not so much (or at least, from what I remember of it 3 years ago)The wings are really fantastic, though. The only place I've ever been to that had honey mustard wings that I could eat dozens of. During football season, it gets pretty crazy over there. Back when I used to go they had all you can eat wings and all you can drink beer pitchers every Sunday during football season for, like, $30. The rest of the food is meh. Bottom Line, go for the wings, have a friendly convo with the regulars, then leave and head elsewhere for everything else.",2,,1

Never had a bartender offer me a chair to give me from the back because he noticed I was standing while watching the game. Service was attentive and quick. Drinks are reasonably priced and not skimpy on the alc.  Bar Coastal does such a great job in giving off the So Cal vibe that I even thought I was back in a Pacific Beach bar back home.,,,

Total sports bar, which my friend loved about the place... typical guy. Would definitely recommend this place.  Good food, good service, friendly waitstaff.",,,

It's not a perfect bar, but it has a ton of great qualities and a pretty friendly staff. Happy Hour is the best time to check it out especially during the week when it's much less crowded.Pros:- Good prices, GREAT HH prices. Bud Lights for $3 on HH or wells for the same price. - Best wings I've found on the UES. These are very tasty and reasonably priced. Be warned: anything hotter than just 'hot' will stop you in your tracks after just a few bites.- Service is amazing. We've got to know the staff and they are all very nice and make their rounds religiously.Cons:- Sometimes a large obnoxious crowd. The main area gets slammed and pretty loud and really drunk. If there's a big game, it'll be wall-to-wall with people yelling at the top of their lungs. You can try to get a table in the porch area to avoid that.- Fried food smell is pervasive throughout entire bar. You'll leave there smelling of waffle fries for sure.- Everything besides wings are average at best. Waffle fries are OK for a few bites and get greasier as you go, I've never finished a basket. Nothing else really stands out.",,,
