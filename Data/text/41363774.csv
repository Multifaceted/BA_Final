Although upon arrival Rattle and Hum screams hot, crowded, dark dive bar, it is actually an awesome spot with some of the best service I've experienced. Despite being crowded, the servers here are on point. It's rare that a bar with a great happy hour deal can keep up with its patrons but they do here. Someone came by every 10 minutes or so which was perfect for our group of people coming and going. There are a good amount of tables in here to post up with a group. They also have a fairly good amount of seats at the bar if you're only with 1-2 other people. If you're patient or get here early, you could definitely get a table for a group of up to 8-10 people. And yes, there are several TVs in here for our sports fans. Speaking of getting here early, they have a fantastic happy hour deal that is not to miss. Until 7:00pm, wine, well drinks and certain draft beers are $5. Yes. Please. Rattle and Hum also has good bar food for when the happy hour drinks inevitably start catching up to you. We had the Soft Pretzel Rolls with beer cheese, the Nachos with beef chili and the Mac n cheese with bacon. All solid choices that I would recommend. Overall, this is a great happy hour spot with solid food options. Bring a group after work and take advantage of those great deals while catching a few games.",4

The venue is decently sized with some longer tables towards the back. It's a great place to meet up with friends, particular if any of them are bridge-n-tunnel folks as this location is very close to the PATH (and, for what it's worth, the west side location is very close to Port Authority).I haven't had any of the food here yet despite multiple visits, but from what I've seen it looks good (traditional pub offerings - burgers, apps, sandwiches, salads, meats, etc.). They also offer happy hour pricing on some of the taps, which makes for an awesome after-work meet-up.If you're in Midtown (either east or west), and are craving some tasty craft brew, you won't go wrong by heading to Rattle n Hum.",

My sister and I each got a flight of mostly local-ish beers that are in season along with our dinners. The beer was good and priced accordingly and the food was good (pretty standard for the area), but our service was remarkable. At one point I was telling a story and gesturing, and the waitress caught me out of the corner of her eye and thought I was waving her over. Clearly the staff here is attentive and makes the visit worthwhile.",1

They have stools and the tables are supported by barrels. it's a big space.We got mozzarella stickers, standard.We got a chicken slider, it was a bit dry and couldn't really taste the spicy aspect. It was ok.We got a house drink, it was the UFO one, low on the bitter scale, it was actually really good and I'd get it again. bonus was that it was happy hour price.we got the house burger. it was really good. the sauce was good, my fiancée stated it was tastier than shake shack, five guys, etc. That's saying a lot. I didn't necessarily agree with her assessment, but the cheeseburger was really good!the fries, were a bit soggy, didn't have that crunch, but they were good.overall, we'll be back for another burger and beer.",1

This place is known for its craft beer and they have selected number of drinks for their happy hour special. I didn't really like the drinks that were selected for their happy hour and the drinks I wanted to order were sold out. At the end, I ended up with a glass of cider and I found it to be pretty watered down and not even sweet. I also got an order of their IPA fries and it was hot and nicely portioned. The staff was attentive and they change their menu daily.3.5 starsP.S.: This place gets pack in the evening so if you want a table after 6 or 7pm, make sure you call to make a table reservation ahead of time.",7

As usual the wife and I allowed the waitress to choose our meals with SLIGHT parameters. The nachos were REALLY good and was a great beginning to our dinner unfortunately that was the only positive note. The short rib sandwich that was suggested to be the "" best on the menu"" was... blah. It was just sliced short ribs on Texas toast with tons of cheese on it. The wife's burger was average as well. Nothing special. Service staff was nonexistent. There were roughly 10-12 people in the bar and my wife's drink wet dry... twice.",1

Both times I've visited this location I've been excited by something I've seen listed on its website as available, only to arrive and be disappointed and find a different list all together. This disappointment alone is a fairly significant reason for me to deduct a star. This is also a much smaller location in general and the atmosphere can't compete with the West location.",2
11,,7/27/2018,1,,"New Brunswick, NJ",Monica D.,5,4.0,4,"Stopped by with two friends for happy hour (ends at 7 pm). The bar is right when you walk in and there are also tables in the back. We decided to get a table and we were sat immediately. Wasn't too crowded for a Friday evening but lively nonetheless. They have $5 HH deals on select drafts, but we decided to go with a nitro stout that was not included. The stout was nice and creamy just as we had hoped! We also ordered Mac & Cheese and Totchos (tater tot nachos) to split. The Mac & Cheese had a bit of a flavor kick and the totchos were a perfect bar snack.The service was attentive and quick. Overall, we are glad we could stop by! It's a couple of blocks from Penn Station so it's a good place to have a beer while waiting for the train.",
12,,1/7/2018,121,,"New York, NY",Mel-Lisa S.,92,4.0,45,My friend brought me here on a snow day and it's a real authentic dive bar. You can tell it's a local joint and I appreciate the decor. This is a place for people who really love good craft beer. You can't come here and choose to order a basic Corona or bud light. They have this huge chalk board b on the wall Leith all the features beer on tap. Take a chance and try something new. Don't be afraid to go to the bar and ask for a taste before you choose. I went and I ordered a flight which is just four options for you to try different ones on the menu. This is definitely a bar I'll be right back to and it doesn't get that they have some good food to go along with their beer. It's right in the heart of the city.,
13,,1/6/2018,237,,"New York, NY",Alina V.,591,5.0,246,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a spot to grab dinner Friday and I found this place through yelp. We came in around 7, I had made a reservation so we were seated right away but it seemed like there were spots opening up by then since their happy hour ended at 7. This bar has a huge selection of beer, different from what you typically see in a bar. I got a Crispin cider but my boyfriend tried a flight of different beers, all of which he really enjoyed. Also he logs his beers on the untapped app and the menu at the bar actually had the rating for each beer from that app as well which was cool. We got the calamari for our appetizer which was really good! They were perfectly seasoned and crunchy and a great way to start the meal. For our entrees I got the crispy chicken sandwhich (huge piece of extra crispy and extra delicious piece of chicken, cheese, tomato, lettuce and a pickle slice on a seseame bun) which came with Cole slaw and fries and my boyfriend got the California wrap (Grilled blackened chicken, avocado, roasted peppers, cheese, bacon, caramelized onion and chipotle mayonnaise) with a side salad. The chicken sandwhich was one of the best I've ever had, it also had some sort of spicy chipotle type sauce on it which was the perfect touch. The wrap was also delicious and it would be a tough call next time I come to pick between the two. The atmosphere of the bar is really great, we had a table on the back so it was awesome to have our own little corner. Also we enjoyed the decorations of the bar, they have signs and taps on the walls food various breweries and beers. We both really enjoyed our time here and look forward to coming back soon!",
14,,7/16/2018,395,2,"Fairfax Station, VA",John D.,46,1.0,429,"After ordering two beers that they didn't have, I asked why their Untappd and paper menus were out of date. The bartender pointed to the chalkboard and said that shows what we're they're out of. I asked why they don't just use the chalkboard instead, then.She asked me ""if I was having a bad night"" and proceeded to argue with me why I was wrong. She then refused to serve me after that and the guy had to serve us. I was a bartender at a bar with 60 taps, it wasn't an illogical question. Something kicks, let the frigging customer know when they get the menu. You have one job. It's particularly annoying because I went there because of what their Untappd menu showed. It's not worth going here for rude service like that.Go to The Jeffrey Craft Beer and Bites instead. They have friendly staff and an amazing (and accurate) draft list.",3

I'm not a beer guy but can vouch for the fact that most of my team-mates who're absolute beer nerds have loved this place.. The whiskey/ cocktail selection isn't anything worth bragging about but as long as you're having a good time with a big group at a place with commendable service I see no qualms :),6
16,,10/29/2018,48,,"Brooklyn, NY",Leanna P.,0,1.0,5,"I was roofied at this bar on Thursday, October 25th, 2018. I do NOT recommend any attractive women under 30 go to this bar ever. Me and two of my friends who work in the garment district met here for happy hour after work. We sat in a table in the back corner, and received table service. I only left my drink unattended once to use the restroom, but my two friends were at the table watching the drink the entire time. Both of the women waitresses were white and around 40 (too old to be working as bartenders). I only had 4 beers. At the end of the night around 11pm we closed out and the waitress brought us a check for $160, which was incorrect as there is no way the three of us had spent $160 on a total of 12 beers, some being at happy hour prices. We re-evaluated the receipt and noticed the waitress had charged us for 6 additional drinks that we did not order. We brought the mistake to her concern and she tried to gaslight us saying that we had ordered more than we said. One of my friends asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and threatened to call the police if we were refusing to pay the tab, saying they had cameras in the place and would use it as evidence. Meanwhile, we all had our cash and debit cards on the table and were clearly not trying to refuse to pay the tab or have the police called, just not get ripped off for drinks we never ordered. We sucked it up and paid the bill which was almost double what we had ordered and decided never to go back again after being treated so rudely by the employees. My friends left to go home and 15 minutes after I left the bar I completely blacked out for an hour and woke up in Union Square park, 20 blocks from the bar and completely out of my way from my apartment. I had no recollection of how i got there and had a scissor/knife cut hole right where my private parts could be accessed. There were cum stains all over the left knee of my jeans and the right hip. I called my mom at 12:15 and was so panicked and freaking out I was screaming for help ""i cant see anything help me there is something very wrong my mental health is messed up im going crazy what is happening someone help me get home etc. etc. for about 3 hours while she helped guide me to my house meanwhile I was drowsy, freaking out crying and hardly able to see or walk. It was the most endangered I have ever felt in my entire life. My mom said she is 100% positive I got drugged. The suspect knife cut, cum on my pants and hour of complete memory loss have led us to the conclusion that somebody drugged me, followed me out of Rattle and Hum, then raped me. My friends both say they didn't see anyone come to the table who could have slipped a roofie in my drink, which leads me to believe one of the bartenders were paid off by a patron to roofie my drink. I was probably the only cute young fashion girl in the bar as most of the patrons are 30-40yr old rich business men in suits, so I would be a target. This is not a light accusation and I sincerely hope that Rattle and Hum will get in contact with me about this terrible incident.",
17,2,4/18/2017,249,1,"San Leandro, CA",Shirene B.,186,5.0,152,"It was Friday night in NY. After hearing some classic Jazz at Fine and Rare, we came by this beer bar as we were hungry and the kitchen was closed at Fine and Rare. I figured a beer or two and a quick bite as it was late, would be good. 4 plates later and a beer each later, there was a serious hobbling back to the hotel.So I love great beer and great pub food. This place has BOTH! I told my bf if I lived here, I'd be here ALL THE TIME! We perused the menu and verbalized what dishes we'd be interested in ordering. Now most of the time when there's 4 dishes and 2 people, you'd trim it down to 2 dishes. What'd we do? Order the lobster mac and cheese, short rib sandwich, wings and a burger. We killed the mac and cheese and wings. But took the other halves of our burger and sandwich back to the hotel. Now normally I wouldn't order lobster mac and cheese in a bar. But it's NY, all the food HAS to be good here right?? Yes! It was! And they weren't chintzy with lobster either. A dish, well worth the price as it was enough for two people. The wings were good. Nice and crispy. And the kitchen was nice enough to let us put the buffalo sauce on the side, so they didn't get soggy.The burger was decent. Nothing astonishing.Now my bf asked the bartender if his mom was in the back because the short rib sandwich taste just like hers. He said I'm not going to say it's better than my mom's, but she didn't put it on Texas toast!Needless to say, if I'm back in NY THIS will be the beer bar I am at!",4

They're really into draft beers (I go for the stella every time haha) and they said they loved this place. It looks like a long hallway and in the back they have a big seating area. I really like how chill it is and the fact that it feels like a neighborhood sports bar. The service was alright - when she brought me my first beer she didn't open it so I had to find my own bottle opener so that was annoying- I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt and say she was super busy lol.,2

We came with a pretty large group around 7pm on a Thursday night and the waitress was super accommodating in order to get us two tables. A couple of guys happily moved to a smaller table to allow us to have a bigger one - so rattle and hum has awesome staff AND awesome clientele!For 15 people splitting a bill, it was pretty reasonable - we all had about two drinks and we got a bunch of appetizers to split and it came to $27.75. Not bad! I also liked how the waitress circled that the tip was already included... there are some pretty shady places in NYC that hope you're too trashed to see that they already included the tip and double tip..

This place gets real busy so I guess the waitress that was giving us the stink eye the entire time didn't like that we were enjoying our beers without getting food too. She literally shouldered through me to get to the much more favored party sitting next to us on the communal high tables, without so much as glancing back in my direction.

I never heard of the place and didn't expect much, but actually was surprisingly pleased with time here, this evening. I arrived around 6ish and initially sat at the bar, but opted to be moved to a seat. We were forced to share a table with two other patrons, but there was ample space for all and didn't feel overcrowded, nor like our space was invaded. The waitress came over several times to take my drink order, and it actually was overkill. However, her efforts were appreciated. I would say she came over four times in less than ten minutes. They offered several beers and a couple wines were included for Happy Hour specials. I went with the Chardonnay, as did one of my friends, the other went with a beer.Our food choices for the night collectively was a Burger & Fries, California Wrap & Fries, I went with Grilled Salmon, Spinach, and Mashed Potatoes ($12.95). After placing my order I wondered to myself about getting Salmon at a bar, but surprisingly, the food was actually pretty good. the salmon was done well and the potatoes were delightful.In sum, this is a typical bar in Midtown, good service, nice atmosphere, and only maybe only in need of a few minor changes could be made. Some of the items on the menu were a bit pricey for a bar, they could offer more drinks for the Happy Hour special and lastly, some better music in the background, but other than that, I was pleased. I would surely return.P.S. It was semi crowded when I arrived, but by the time we left, it was a packed house. So, the earlier, the better. Especially if you expect to get a seat.",4

For $15 you get an entree and brunch drink. While nothing was particularly bad, nothing was good enough to make me interested in going back again. We walked in around 1 and the place was practically empty. You'd think with both brunch and football, they'd draw more of a crowd. There wasn't a NY football game going on at the time so maybe it gets busier during those games. The space is dark and kind of dingy looking. On the bright side, they let us pick a big table in the back and request what game we wanted on the big projector TV so that was cool.For brunch I tried the Imperial French toast and it was actually way better than I expected from this place. It was cooked well, perfectly sweet, and came with genuine maple syrup. The bloody Mary I got was just average and then size was small. The beers are mostly $8 and they only have one beer discounted during football so its not exactly an economical place to drink for hours compared to some places nearby that have great football specials. The service wasn't very good. The bartender also had to be the waitress which can be a tough situation but it was hardly busy and she still didn't come check on us very often.

We sat at a table and asked the waitress if we could all go to the bar and order drinks separately so that later it won't be an issue when we need to split the check and it makes it easier for her. She told us no, she wouldn't let us and so half of us didn't order anything. I guess they didn't want the money...I tried the food and it wasn't great. The guacamole is terrible. It's smooth and tastes store bought. Most places have chunky and authentic guac but I guess this place has never heard of it before.

We headed in for dinner last Thursday night, and the place was loud and crowded. They have the pub vibe going for sure! We walked all the way to the end of the bar before someone greeted us and asked if we needed a table. We were a party of three seated at a table for two, which made things at our table crowded,and I kept bumping into the person seated behind me too.They have a huge beer list that seems to change very regularly, if not daily. They had all sorts of very unique beers, and even a system where you could give three requirements for your beer and the bartender would find you a beer to match them. They had an awesome sour beer on tap from Ballast Point called Sour Wench that I would highly recommend. If you're into beer, you will be into Rattle 'N' Hum.We had to flag down our server a few times, so service isn't the top priority, but they were also super busy, so I'll let it slide. They offer pretty standard pub fare on the menu. I went with the California wrap, and it was just what I expected. Another friend ordered the buffalo Caesar wrap and requested more buffalo than Caesar because that a slightly questionable combo. He said they nailed it and enjoyed his food as well. My boyfriend got the fish n' chips and also said they were great. All in all, we really enjoyed our experience at Rattle 'N' Hum, and I would definitely go back to try more of their beers!",1

We enjoyed a few Firestone Walker Double Jacks, a Ballast Point Sculpin, and a few Bear Republic Racer X's. All fantastic beers. Bummed we couldn't check more off the list.

The four of us shared a guacamole appetizer and each ordered some pretty solid burgers and fries. I probably would give this place four stars if it weren't for the fact that a) I had an absolutely phenomenal burger the next day in the city that easily trumped this one and b) they automatically put gratuity on the bill even though we were only a party of four!The guacamole we had was only average and for the $10, I wouldn't recommend it. It didn't have any kick or noticeable flavor to it, which I expected given its ingredients. Plus, the burger and fries were filling on their own so you shouldn't even need an appetizer. The burger itself was extremely juicy and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't the cheapest dish and there wasn't the most complex flavors (and that includes the rattle n hum burger, for which I think the taste of the meat itself overpowered the additional toppings) but it was still a very solid choice. Also, I wasn't crazy about the IPA fries. I mean they were good (seemed like pretty standard sea-salt dusted fries), but they didn't live up to the hype that the reviews or their description promised.

The stools at the tables are packed in, and it makes for tight quarters. Once seated, we waited and waited. Finally a woman came and took our order. And then we waited and waited. She returned seriously 15 minutes later with our drinks and totally forgot about the waters we asked for. She was gone before we could remind her. We tried going up to the bar to get our second round and had equally dismal success there. Another 20 minutes to get served there. We didn't dare order food for fear that it would take an hour. But what I saw passing by looked pretty tasty. I'm quite sure that on a quieter night, we would have had a fabulous time. It was just too packed to be an easygoing experience.

90,,11/22/2016,98,,"Austin, TX",Zachary A.,0,4.0,1004,"Pretty solid rotating beer list. They also have a surprisingly great HH where there's a selection of about half dozen brews for $5 each. What makes this a good HH is that the selection isn't just your basics, but also some rare, high alcoholic options. They also offer flights for $18 for 4 5oz beers. This is actually quite high if you're sampling but you can apparently get less oz glasses if you ask, which I wasn't aware of when ordering. The bartenders are good and let you sample some brews before ordering which I always like. It was a little crowded, weird for a Monday I'd imagine, towards the end of HH (4:00-7:00) but it seemed like a good meetup place for post work drinks.",

They have a nice selection of beers to choose from and the bartenders are wonderful. It might look like a biker bar, but it's really a mixed crowd that mingles around in this place. Keep in mind that they have a credit card limit if you choose to not spend too much.",5

Quesadilla was the size of my head, packed with cheese, sautéed peppers and onions and perfectly seasoned chicken. My entrée was the Tex-Mex salmon that seemed straight from Santa Fe. The salmon was light and flaky with just the right amount of spice, and blended magically with the black beans and seasoned rice. Great food, full bodied Ale, and attentive service set the bar high of my week in the city.",1

And even though I'm not a beer fan, it's good to have a go-to spot for beer and bar food.I personally like, and almost ALWAYS order the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wrap (Recommended). However, I have had other stuff and it's always top-notch!I take my Pops here once a month and I like that the bartender (Jolene) knows us. Mostly locals come here...I rarely see tourist. Not sure why. Maybe they're afraid! HAHA.The place is block away from the Empire State Building and will not clobber you over the head with touristy pricing, like Heartland Brewery (Heartland SUCKS)!Good spot to chill with friends and drink/eat...Good for large groups, since they have these really long tables!",1

The beer list is broad and the menu is nicely laid out with all of the beers categorized. They also have a full bar and I think I saw some people drinking wine! The music isn't overly loud but still loud enough to listen and enjoy if you're not having a conversation. The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the bartender was extremely disinterested in serving and tending bar.... Overall, great beer selection, reasonable prices, good atmosphere.",1

They also have a decent bar menu. Nachos and fries are good. My friends got burgers and enjoyed it. It's hard to get a table after work, people tend to crowd around the front or the back",2

First time trying Bloody Mary and it was not pleasing. There was only one server for the whole Bar/Restaurant. As our other friend arrived, the server didn't bother to check up on us and take my friend's order. When she came around, my friend ordered the Crab Benedict and a cranberry juice to replace the alcoholic beverage on the Brunch menu. After 30 mins of waiting, I went to the bar to ask where my friend's food was. Seriously they brought it out after I mentioned about cancelling it....WTF!!The service here really fucking sucks!! How the hell you serve food and only have one fucking server for the whole floor!! I will never return to this shit hole with shitty ass service. They should just stick to fucking drinks only!!",3

I was slightly disappointed in the service. Our waitress was kind enough, but she had no knowledge regarding the draft list and when we questioned her on the beers, she couldn't offer any opinions. For a place that serves such a distinct array of beers, I would expect that the servers would have knowledge to answer questions. That was really all that I found disappointing. There was a solid selection of drafts, but many of the lines had been kicked which was a bummer. That said, it wasn't hard to find something we could all enjoy.The food looks phenomenal and had we stopped in for a bite, I'm sure that my opinion on the place would have been slightly more favorable.",1

They have a wide selection of beers on tap to choose from and the bartender behind the bar is super helpful if you need some guidance on choosing a beer more specific for your palette's liking. After having a few and amping up our appetite, we ordered a burger to share which I later wished I had ordered my own.

106,1,4/20/2015,219,,"Brooklyn, NY",Rob W.,521,3.0,347,"I've been here many times and have generally been quite happy - great beer selection and (mostly) solid food.  Not terribly priced for NYC, either.  Last time I was here, however, was an incredibly disappointing experience.  I believe something was clearly wrong with their CO2 system - I first ordered a Founders Dark Penance, a Double Black IPA (a brewery I love and a style I particularly enjoy), and it just tasted off and a bit flat, which I initially chalked up to a rare Founders misfire.For our next round, we found a seat at the bar, and my girlfriend and I both ordered a Pretty Things Jack D'Or Saison, a beer we are both familiar with and love.  The bartender had to pour several glasses that were almost completely foam before getting passable glasses she served us.  These also tasted flat and lifeless.  Watched the bartenders pour several other pints where they were clearly having issues with the taps - all foam and such.  It was crowded, and we vacillated on whether or not to complain or request something different (and request what - it looked like all the taps were problematic) until we just decided it was too late.  I understand that it's kind of hard for a craft beer bar to put even a temporary halt on pouring drafts, but... I would like to think quality would be more important than that.  The place had built up a decent bit of goodwill with me, so I will likely give it another whirl in the future, but it was a truly disappointing experience which admittedly left me a bit wary of a making a return.",1

Slim walkway in front because the bar is there and you must walk by it to get to the tables for seating. Lots of single stall bathrooms too which is nice Now, we went there for an after work beverage while walking back home. Seats the bar helped convince is to stop. Had the Rangers game on too but the place was not too crazy to turn us off from entering. Now, this place has a ton of beers from which to choose. So many IPA's on draft! Which was awesome. I asked the bartender to surprise me because j couldn't choose. My girl got her regular vodka which they made pretty strong IMHO. Overall, decent little spot. Good beer selection.

Updated review",4,,"Mount Sinai, NY",Maria M.,7,4.0,72,"Update to my previous review:After the owner/management had seen that I was upset with my previous experience he took corrective action and offered all my coworkers and I to return for a meal on the house.Different server this time and no where near as crowded as my last visit.We ordered the same food that we did not receive last time:-2 bang bang shrimp taco lunch specials-2 chipotle grilled cheese lunch specials-a side of fries-Fireworks IPAWe all enjoyed our food, which came out in a timely manner.Server (can't recall her name) did a kickass job - she was serving the bar and waiting tables while occasionally picking up the busser's slack.She came over quite often to check on us/other customers as well as was much more personable than the server I had on Friday.Seems like this place has to have various factors incorporated to make it a good experience.If you're looking for bar food I'd recommend it, but your experience is likely to differ based on who's working the floor/kitchen and how crowded it is.Always great for a wide variety of reasonably priced draft beers!",
113,,4/16/2016,61,,"Seattle, WA",Ryan B.,151,5.0,406,"So many times in NYC I've had to deal with bartenders who don't know jack about the beers they pour. Not the case here. The staff all know the beers, flavor profiles, ibu's, and malts used. Be sure to sit at the bar, tell the bartender what you usually like to drink or what style you're really needing just then, and she (or he) will take care of you perfectly.Food is great too, but the beer is still the best part. The variety is ever-changing and developing. Plus more than enough tables and tvs for larger sized groups. Definitely worth your time if you're remotely near this neighborhood (or a 6 line).",1

They have an amazing selection of beer on tap, unlike any other bars in the area. Not too far from MSG/Penn or Grand Central so its a great place to meet friends if you need to in this area. They really thought about the decor which is nice- it is beer-centric paintings and posters and fun stickers, I would consider ""really heady"" ... or in other words ""cool"" but in a VT bro / beer lover sort of way.

The beer selection was also very good. Tasty IPA's are always a plus. Service was fairly attentive for such a busy place. So why only 3 stars you ask? The whole thing fell apart when we went to pay. In 2016 it's standard for servers to accommodate splitting up the tab any number of ways, by percentage or by value, whatever. This place refused to split our bill more than 3 ways, which wasn't practical for our group. They said it was their policy. Bad policy is bad for business. I hope management reads this & promptly changes this bad policy.",
