       "'Came in here yesterday for a breakfast sandwich and friends  the wait was LONG  This seems to be mostly due to the construction worker ahead of me in line who ordered about 10 sandwiches  so I can t really fault the deli for that  They made my bacon  egg  and cheese on an everything bagel relatively quickly and it was a warm  cheesy delicious sandwich experience  And at  3 50  pretty reasonably priced  I went back today for lunch because I noticed the plethora of choices while I was there yesterday  They have freshly made sandwiches  wraps  quesadillas  panini  etc  etc  etc in the deli counter and if you can t find something there they will make whatever you want to order  They have hot and cold food buffets  sushi  gelato  tea  coffee  I believe I saw smoothies   and all the snacks and drinks you d hope to find in a store  The options are really endless  Prices on some things seem a bit high   2 for a 20 oz bottle of coke   oof  but it is midtown  and nothing was outrageous I went with the buffet and got Greek salad  chicken   and mashed potatoes for a little over  8  buffet is  7 99 lb  and I wasn t disappointed  There are chunks of feta on the salad  and being a feta fanatic  I was in heaven  I d imagine this place gets quite busy during the week  so keep that in mind  But if you have time and want a crazy amount of things to choose from  this is a good bet '"
