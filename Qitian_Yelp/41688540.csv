2,BCeats R.,"New York, NY",1,41,0,1.0,4/12/2018,"I have to agree with all the negative reviews.  I'm not really sure who owns this place now but when it first opened, and for years after, it was really a decent place to get lunch and the staff was friendly.  It has really gone downhill.  While I find the girl that works there during the day very nice the rest of them S*%k.  I live across the street and only go in there when it's absolutely necessary and by that I mean it's either raining, snowing, late at night, or I'm to lazy to go to Sugar Deli.This should make you all laugh.  If I have to run in there at night I have to remember to bring ID because the guy that works the register at night asks for it.  Then we go through the same issue every time.  He says the name on the card isn't the same as on my license.  I have to remind him that's because on the license reads last name first but it's the same name.  What an idiot.   I hope this review was helpful as well as entertaining. :)",,,
3,Nelly W.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",99,19,16,1.0,12/7/2017,Don't go here it's awful.  A crazy lady tried to steal this girls phone and was attacked by her and no one here did a thing  or call the police.  The workers just watched and the only people trying to help were the customers near by. Atrocious.,,,
4,Terry F.,"South Orange, NJ",33,94,0,3.0,3/27/2018,"Pretty much a standard Korean-owned NYC grocery/bodega food joint with a little bit of everything for the lunch crowd -- sandwiches, hot/cold food bars, salads, etc. Take the 'Gourmet' in the name with a grain of salt --  don't expect high-quality food, but it's okay, prices are standardish and there's a lot of variety.  It is kinda dark and dingy inside which doesn't help, but I couldn't imagine eating in there.  Nothing special by any means, but it's decent enough for a quick lunch if you work nearby, because the Hudson Yards area is pretty barren as far as culinary options.",,,

6,Danissa H.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,1,1,1.0,3/24/2017,"I'm only giving 1 star because I can't leave a review with none. Where to start? So, on my quest to find something worth eating on the West Side before venturing back to MD, me and my boyfriend stop in this place. I'm trying to decide what snacks to purchase for my trip ( Apple and Eve Cranberry juice or Tropicana) and am struck by an inceasant itch on my heal. I stop, put the juice back on the shelf, take my house keys out and scratch the mess out of my foot! Brief relief cause even now it itches. So, before I've even had a chance to finish putting my shoe on, the shop keep runs  across the store, yelling and accusing me of shoplifting. His words ""I saw you take off shelf, and place in your purse"".  really? I'm gonna steal your $1.50 juice? So, my boyfriend asks the man if he is referencing the juice, still on the shelf. He says ""no, something else"". I ask if he means my keys, and even open my purse to show that nothing in it is from his store. The man insists that he saw on the camera that I stole something, am hiding it, and that I need to leave his store. WHERE TO START?!?! Well, for starters, we obviously decided not to patronize the shop. But I can't accurately articulate the anger and embarrassment that shop keep caused me, with his actions, and accusations. The chances were already slim that I would have ever gone back anyway, but now he'll have scathing reviews on several sites, too. Happy to go back home now.",2,,
7,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,151,3.0,7/29/2016,"Went here to grab a bite to eat before boarding a bus to Boston. Though it was around lunch time, there was not too many people around so I was able to order right away. It looks like they make most of the wraps and sandwiches beforehand and then just heat them up on the panini press. I opted for a wrap with chicken and roasted peppers and cheese. I had no idea that the chicken would be breaded and while the breading was good, the chicken was definitely pretty dry. The rest of the ingredients were pretty lackluster, but I couldn't complain much because of the price ($6.50). If you're looking for a cheap, quick snack, this is not a bad place, but it definitely is not as high quality as other delis around the city.",,,
8,Nancy A.,"Bronx, NY",1,84,0,1.0,12/9/2017,"Terrible. This is one of the few restaurants near my office. Since McDonalds closed, this is one of the few options left. I have tried on several occasions the buffet (not fresh); sushi (poor quality); sandwiches (also not fresh). The last straw was a bagel and cream cheese which was disgusting. How do you mess that up? They are not cheap and staff is rude. I would rather not eat at all than eat here.",,,
9,Gary A.,"Manhattan, NY",83,4,1,1.0,3/25/2017,"Had a really bad experience here and would never step in again.First, this Deli is not well maintained, it's dirty and thrown together.Second, my girlfriend and I came in looking around for a snack, and only had picked up a juice bottle. A few moments later the store attendant accused us of stealing. Claiming he had seen her put something in her purse, on the surveillance camera. She had simpily put a juice down on a shelf while she went to address something on her shoe. I understand you have a job to do and you're trying to protect this lame excuse for a ""Gormet Deli"", but my main problem is how he addressed us. Saying he ""don't want no problems""... when our reaction was shock and compliance. We showed him the juice bottle on the shelf and opened our bags to show him we did no such thing. He didn't apologize, no ""I'm so sorry"", nothing. Just walked away.On our way out we told him to expect a bad review because that's not how you treat people, which he responded to with a few curse words. Real classy. Save your money and go anywhere else. I'll take my chances with the food carts down the street.",,,
10,Mitch B.,"Orange County, CA",865,126,392,4.0,4/9/2015,"Solid deli.Lots of selections at fair prices.Also because of the size you can find new items and a wider variety.Example: peppercini Kettle brand chips? They're great. Try to find them at other deli's, ya can't!Tuna is fresh. They also have an Italian version without mayo.Good hot and cold bar too.I'm a repeat customer.",1,1,1
11,Nickolas H.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",0,7,0,1.0,4/6/2017,"Terrible Service. Terrible food. I stopped here in the afternoon to get a snack. I picked up a can of soda and some candy and went to the register. I asked if they took debit because I'd ran out of cash, and the cashier replied, ""Minimum $7."" I didn't want to spend an extra five dollars (considering that what I had was only two), so I returned both the can of soda and candy to where I picked them up. I then walked towards the door to leave... ""HEY! WHERE DID YOU PUT THE CANDY!"" the cashier screamed at me. I replied with, ""I put it back."" ""I DIDN'T SEE YOU PUT IT BACK."" Obviously this cashier didn't see me put it back because the place where it was stocked in the store was on the other side of a large rectangular column. ""Check me then"", I replied. Knowing that he was wrong, the cashier said, ""Go!"" And I replied, ""Check me."" And he yelled even louder, ""GO!"", not wanting to embarrass himself in front of the other customers for falsely accusing me of stealing.I will never step foot in this ""Gourmet"" Deli again. Plus, the food looks terrible, its on a buffet that looks like its been sitting out for days.",,,
12,Jac L.,"Bronx, NY",2,40,3,1.0,9/22/2017,"Omgggggg me being a waitress and all, I never thought I would ever go so low to write such a disgusting review about someone ever in life. I stepped into this deli while waiting for my bus because everybody in the area are probably waiting to board an out of state megabus or boltbus. I politely walked up to a middle aged asian woman and an older asian woman.  I say ""hi, I was just wondering if one of you ladies work here?"" Young asian woman: Yea I own this place. Im like okay well would you mind telling me the name of this salad (which I pointed at). She says: yea its tuna and pasta. I asked her if there was any meat in it because Im a pescatarian. She says: tuna is meat. Pshhhhhh now she's just speaking to me in this condescending ass tone and I think it's disgusting. So I say: do you have smaller trays because im getting on a bus. To put the icing on the cake, she says: no its by weight anyway so it doesn't matter, its $8.39/lb. The sign was in my face so i saw that already but she was being rude. The older lady was being soooooo nice. I appreciate that in front of the owner, she treated me with respect but the younger lady is very rude. I hate that I had to give her 1 star.",,,
13,Phil M.,"Oceanside, NY",0,7,0,1.0,11/12/2016,Went for breakfast sandwiches the ham and turkey was pre-sliced a month ago looked slimy and grey.

14,Becky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",191,13,1,1.0,7/27/2016,"Woof! I ordered a simple turkey and cheese on a roll with mayo and mustard. I was given a sandwich I thought was egg salad upon opening because there was so much mayo, it was oozing everywhere and a challenge to eat. I imagine this was to knowingly compensate for the stale, hard bun. That and the board read a turkey sandwich at $5.25 and they overcharged me a dollar. Should have heeded the bad reviews.",2,,
15,Ken P.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,254,189,3.0,10/13/2014,"I popped in here after Comic Con the other day as I was in dire need of sustenance.  The plan was to get something from the buffet that I noticed they had and then make my way to the concert that I had to go to at MSG but since it was later in the day and that it was NOT one of those 24 hour joints, the buffet selections were stored away and my only option was a sandwich and soda.  With that being the case I opted for a salami and provolone on a roll with a 7-Up and secured a spot in their reasonably sized dining area.  The downside for me was no visible outlet to get some charge onto the phone since that was rapidly depleting and would likely not last me through the soon to be enjoyed X Japan show.  My stay was not for more than 20 minutes since I was on a schedule but at the end of the day the price was reasonable and I did enjoy the sandwich.  For me sometimes a quick visit does the trick.I'm not in the region all that much with the exception of Convention events but if the chance should happen that I am around there and need something quick this is not a bad option.",,,
16,Karen G.,"Union, NJ",246,249,347,4.0,5/8/2015,"My company is in this building, and this building is in the middle of nowhere, I know you are probably saying the middle of nowhere in midtown???? If you have ever had the pleasure of coming to 34th and 10th - your options are pretty limited, especially if you only have to come into the office once a month, and if you are lucky you get 15 mins to go grab something to eat and then partake in a ""working lunch""They do have a seating area behind the coffee section, and the cashiers are friendly and efficient! Lines can be long at breakfast and lunch, but move quickly. The only thing that I don't like about this place, is that I wish they would use better plastic cutlery, they have the really flimsy pre packaged kind.I do enjoy the food here, they have plenty of options, a salad station, a deli counter, a Mongolian wok counter, a hot and cold buffet, a coffee/ tea station, and plenty of different cold drinks and salty and sweet snacks. All major food groups are covered. Prices are pretty typical for this kind of fare in Manhattan, depending on how much food and drink you get lunch will run you about $12-15 dollars. If you come around 11am that's when they are putting out the items for the hot and cold buffet, if you come past 1pm, forget it, the pickings are slim (stick with the other options). Deli and salad stations are fresh, made to order, and the Mongolian wok it pretty good too, my co worker swears by the spicy sauce! I wouldn't call this a destination spot for anyone, but if you happen to be in the area and want a good variety of food, this is the place to be!",3,2,2
17,Sarah A.,"Woodside, NY",5,15,0,2.0,4/30/2015,"This is really more of a vent-rage since no one should really be reviewing or reading reviews for delis anyway, but... I order an egg salad sandwich, the deli guy says, ""lettuce and tomato?"" Me: ""Sure, why not?"" He makes the sandwich, wraps it in paper, and writes ""5"" on it. I eyeball the menu above his head that says it costs $4.50. He smiles and says ""lettuce and tomato extra!"" What. The. Hell?! The egg salad later fell out all over my clothes as I was sitting in the park because it was chopped so loosely and served on a roll instead of the proper sliced bread. And all that fucking iceberg lettuce wouldn't stay inside it, either.",1,,

Updated review","Beware!!!! This place was shut down by the health department on 9/12/14 and hasn't reopened yet. A co-worker and I went online to look up the health violations and there are many! Evidence of rodents and flies near the food and improper food temperatures are just a few that were listed. Even if Food Depot reopens, I will never eat here again!",2,1,1
20,Shia T.,"East Bronx, NY",0,14,2,1.0,11/29/2016,I only frequent here if I forgot to pick up fruit at my regular spot.  I don't come here for the buffet once I got old food that they overly seasoned to I guess cover up it's age. Yesterday I came for an apple and lemon and was overcharged for it.  I checked the price before I stepped to the register and on my way out the door.  I didn't protest because it was very crowded and I was already running late for work.,1,,
21,Khomari F.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",319,61,129,3.0,6/3/2014,"Food Gourmet...this is a really interesting spot! Located on 34th and 10th they are one of few stores in that area and so they have more foot traffic than a usual deli. They have a large spacious location with lots of chairs and load of options for food. Theres a salad bar, sushi bar, fresh sandwiches or buffet food but beware the buffet is literally emptied out by 1pm due to the sheer number of people in the area so go early to get your lunch on. Beyond that its a run of the mill deli but the one thing they are is very very fast, I mean woah! You may get you bacon egg and cheese in like 5 mins flat. Very impressive for those in a rush pre 9 am!",1,1,1
22,Gena D.,"San Diego, CA",31,90,27,5.0,1/16/2014,"Yeah... just gotta give it 5 stars.... There is NOTHING (except for McD's) in these parts and this place is seriously an anomaly!!! We found it because we were going to take the Mega Bus and it was close to the bus stop.But they were awesome!!!It was cold outside and we said we would buy something if we could hang out and they were more than accommodating and welcomed us, regardless. I, honestly, was surprised at how willing they were.  But more than that, they have an AMAZING lunch selection!!! Holy cow!!! EVERYONE in the area dines there!! They have all kinds of fresh foods that they cook daily for lunches. At noon on the dot, EVERY construction guy in the area was there!!! That speaks volumes to me!! That and a couple of doctors who came from near by for their sushi rolls... yeah - felt that those would be a good choice.And they have an EXTENSIVE tea bag selection and, again, it was cold, so we bought a couple of tea bags and had some nice hot tea.....They really have quite an extensive selection of convenience items.When I saw that this place was listed as being in ""Hell's Kitchen"" I was hesitant but, you shouldn't be intimidated.So, we ended up having tea, lunch, buying some convenience items, hanging out, and just enjoying our time there. They were super nice.We will DEFINITELY be back next time we take the Mega Bus from there!!!(we live in San Diego)",,,

25,Kenneth I.,"Yonkers, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/27/2015,The guy on the grill in the morning has a bad attitude. He ignores the customers until he decides he's ready to help.

26,Anthony R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,20,6,2.0,6/16/2015,"I've been working in the office building where this deli is located for almost 10 years. So I've had PLENTY of food experiences at this establishment. Over the past few years after ordering breakfast wraps and sandwiches - I've come to the final conclusion - and this is a staffing issue - the guys behind the deli counter are surly, lack any customer service skills and what annoys me the most is the only people that they are nice to are the ones that have breasts.  Yes, ladies, lucky you - you get a smile and extra pleasantries from the sandwich guys. I don't have a problem with this - but don't take my order with disdain or a lack of appreciation.  Today, I ordered my sandwich - a simple grilled ham and cheese on rye, something one couldn't screw up.  Then 4-5 woman ordered after me and they got their food way before I did.  Sorry but that's bullshit - this is NYC, time is money and I don't need to watch these guys salivate over women while waiting for a damn sandwich.  And when I say thank you, I get no response - that just pisses me off.  I'm nice, I wait, I get my food last and I get shit service and acknowledgement.  I'm sorry but I am so over them.  I've worked in food service jobs, I know it is tough but I always smiled and thanked people - it's common courtesy. This is truly unfortunate because the owner is a very nice woman who goes out of her way to tally my bill and cash me out.  I'm not bitching about the sushi guy - I would never eat sushi there.  I'm not complaining about the Mongolian stir fry guys.  Just the deli guys. They need to find another career.",2,,
27,Spenny B.,"New York, NY",25,6,4,2.0,10/9/2011,"This isn't about me so it's none of your business but since I'm writing a review here it's kind of about me and it's kind of your business--I like sandwiches. Love them even. Particularly deli sandwiches.  So there. Cats out of the bag. Moving on.This place makes sandwiches. So when I was recently in the neighborhood around lunch time (between 11am and 4:59pm by my definition of lunch time), I gave this place a whirl. It was pretty good, but not great. Well, maybe not pretty good, let's just say it was alright.  Not ""All Right"" just ""Alright"" if you catch my drift. If they'd have had sprouts, that's another story.. I'd bump the puppy back up to pretty good status.  But, they didn't have sprouts, so I'm sticking with alright, alright?Speaking of ""didn't haves"": they didn't have wheat bread.  Apparently that's a hot commodity that some delis happen to run out of... and by some delis I mean this particular deli. That's not okay, but it was okay; I got 7 grain instead.  I couldn't count all 7 grains, not that I would, but just saying. Doesn't matter anyway, if I had to do it over again I would've gotten it on a roll. I love sandwiches on rolls (Wheat Telera if at Henry's, not that they ever pay attention to what you ask for). I prefer sandwiches on rolls actually, not that it's any of your business, this ain't about me, but I do--it makes a purchased sandwich feel less like a homemade sandwich when it's on a roll as opposed to two slices of bread--if you know what I mean. Anyway, if you ask for mayo at this place, 5 seconds later you'll be thinking to yourself ""What the Hellmans, this is way too much mayo he's lathering on there!""  But 5 minutes later you'll be thinking to yourself ""Nevermind, this was juuuuusst right!""5 seconds after that: all the meat slides out of the sandwich.  Too much mayo.",,2,
28,Chris C.,"New York, NY",18,76,0,4.0,6/5/2013,"How can you beat a Mongolian stir fry kitchen that has a full deli and salad bar?Probably with a baseball bat.  But why would you want to?  There aren't many places around here that are worthwhile, and you definitely wouldn't want to get glass and other debris in your food.  In all seriousness though, this is probably one of the better delis around.  The sandwich specials are great (although sometimes messy), the salad bar is always fresh, the Mongolian stir fry is always fun, and even during the height of lunch rush, everything runs smoothly and quickly.",,,

What is really cool is that they have Mongolian bbq.  You grab whatever your want and put it into a bowel-meats, carbs, veggies and you can choose whatever kind of sauce you want and they will stir fry it for you.  They have my favorite mushrooms-straw mushrooms too!I think the food is a bit overpriced but if you come just once a week it's not too bad.",1,,1
30,Alyssa A.,"New York, NY",20,4,0,1.0,7/11/2015,"We stopped in here before taking an early morning Megabus. Ordered two egg white wraps; one turkey, one ham, both with onion, pepper and cheese. From the selection of 3 types these were the only two available and from the selection of 5 wrap favors only 1 was available. Fine. Asked for a side of home fries, had to explain that I understood they didn't come with the meal and yes I was willing to pay extra. Whatever. Coffee selection fine. Picked up a bottle of what I thought was fresh squeezed OJ. Check out lady was nice but gave wrong information about the buses, not her fault. $25 later, got on the bus only to find out that the wraps were made with tomato and not onions and peppers. TOMATO! I'm allergic to tomato! Had to toss it. Home fries were cold, undercooked and flavorless. Oj tasted suspiciously like Sunny D. Overall terrible place, at least the McDonalds across the street has a consistent product. Will never go here again.",1,,

I've been coming here for over 2 and a half years now and my only gripe is that they charge Manhattan prices, it's really not their fault... but they did raise the prices on us last year during the oil price spike and have never brought it down ever since. A sandwich used to cost around $6 with tax, now it's almost always over $7. Breakfast sandwiches are great but run you around $3.25 now. No more grumpy guy behind the sandwich counter... The hot bar has its daily specials: lemon chicken, barbeque ribs, stuffed shells, as well as its regulars: there's almost always grilled salmon and chicken wings, some variety of pasta, rice, potato... and the cold bar has a great selection ranging from asparagus to tofu, fresh fruit to seaweed. There's also a raw bar where you can pick out random meats and veggies for them to cook in front of you mongolian style. They used to use the big wooden sticks until it was deemed unsanitary by inspectors.There really is a great selection of food here. Lots of gourmet snacks and candy and beverages.

Your mama, bless her soul, she was a kind lady. She made a mean sandwich. Yep. Sure did. ...Wait, what?Sorry, the pages of my novel seemed to slip into my Yelp review.It really is a dead zone around here.

I usually haunt the cold salad bar (the hot bar is, sadly, mostly meat), and it has enough variety that i can eat there for a few days in a row before i get bored.The veggie sushi options are narrow (avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, avocado cucumber rolls...), but decent. The sandwich bar makes cheese sandwiches with about a metric ton of cheese, which is a nice change from most sandwich places, which carefully lay one slice of cheese across the bread and call it done.As for snack time, they have a wide selection of cookies, chocolates, ice cream, drinks, and crackers.

(FYI: I don't cook, so this was a bit harder for me than most people) I think I've found a winning combo: 2.5 scoops of Chinese sauce (which I think is just soy sauce with bits of green onion), teeny bit of Hoison + Oyster sauce, two squirts of lemon, drizzle of olive oil, drizzle of sesame oil, scoop of minced garlic, and a little bit of the red chili sauce. Oh and salt and pepper.Pretty sure that was TMI but really I just needed somewhere to record my winning combo so I can remember for the 32491st time! Important details: grab one of those big silver bowls in the back and start filling your bowl to your heart's content with veggies/meat, they charge you by weight so I'd recommend to go light on the noodles, and smile at the guy cooking your food. He's nice.",,,

40,Lauren W.,"Cincinnati, OH",60,15,0,4.0,9/7/2009,"OMG what? Hard to believe that there's nowhere to grab lunch aside from McD's around these parts, considering it's NYC and not Cincinnati, OH... but apparently that's the case, proven by the other reviews and what I've heard from business associates nearby. We had lunch break between meetings which only gave us enough time to run out and pick something up, so the options we were given were the pizza place next door (?) and Food Depot. I'm glad I didn't have a hankering for Italian.. because I would give my left arm to have a place like this in Cincy. After inside, I probably circled the joint for at least 20 minutes before finally deciding what to grab... made to order deli sandwiches, burgers, salads, mongolian grill (yes, really?!), soups and a huge hot & cold salad bar that's like a trip around the world. (Stir fry, fried rice, mashed potatoes, roasted meats, greek salad, macaroni salad, roasted veggies, salad fixin's, etc, etc, etc.) I was so overwhelmed I had to go for the salad bar since I couldn't decide. Ended up with a roasted potabellas & zucchini, some greek salad w/feta, a few slices of grilled chicken, a little bite of pasta salad, and 2 small pork dumplings.... sounds like a lot, but I just remember that it was the perfect amount of food + energy to get me through a late night at the office.I gave the place 4 stars for the options & variety alone.  Sure, it's not the best you can get in NYC, but it's fresh & homemade for the most part, and you can get a healthy lunch no matter what your appetite.  Can't recall the cost after picking up a soda and a Kinder Bueno, but it probably wasn't cheap. I'd definitely frequent this place if I worked nearby. (You guys don't know how good you have it!!)",,1,1
41,Caroline N.,"Washington, DC",12,25,0,3.0,7/25/2008,"there is nothing to eat near work. NOTHING. this is horrible for all of the obvious reasons, but also because there is a McDonald's next door (well, isn't there always) and when it's one o'clock and I can smell fries in the cubicle next to me, my immediate instinct is to sprint at olympic athlete speeds - something that I'm not even close to capable of in 99% of circumstances - to that red and yellow mecca of fatty goodness. let's just say that if it weren't for this deli, my arteries would be in serious trouble. they have a sampling of well, pretty much everything, so you're guaranteed to be able to satisfy any craving without risking any serious post-meal regret. I usually opt for the hot bar, which is loaded with all kinds of things - salad, fruit, pasta, potatoes, chinese food, ribs, steamed vegetables...the list goes on, and on and on. at 6.99 a lb it's a pretty good value, although I find that I usually tend to pick out heavier things (which aren't always more expensive) so it doesn't always work out quite right. everything I've tried has been fresh and tasty. my only complaint is that there seems to be a consistent two day rotation of offerings.. so I quickly figured out exactly what they'll be serving each day. it'd be nice if they mixed it up a little, even if they don't add anything new. a minor criticism though, because with so many options you can still get something new every day of the week. they also make good sandwiches, and though I haven't tried these, they have a nice salad bar and a mongolian bbq. there's also a pretty extensive selection of dry goods, drinks etc.I see places like this all over the city, so I'm sure it's pretty standard, but if you're looking for a reliable lunch option in the area, this is a good one.",2,1,
