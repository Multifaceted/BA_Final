1,Judy S.,"New York, NY",313,1107,1132,3.0,11/18/2018,"It's a Friday night and you don't have a reservation and all the restaurants in Soho and Noho are tiny with few tables, what's a person to do? You go to GMT Tavern. (They also have outdoor seating for those nice fall/summer days.) Their beer menu is pretty good and so is their fish and chips. Generally speaking though, the food is average at best. But it comes out quick. It's perfect for after work dinner since it's also never too loud (given that it's never really crowded).",1,,1
2,Amanda V.,"Stamford, CT",34,229,53,3.0,7/24/2018,Came in for dinner but me and my two friends weren't impressed with the menu so we just got drinks at the bar. I ordered a vodka selzer w a splash of cran & idk what the bartender used instead of cranberry juice but the bottom of my drink was a purple color and the top was clear.. so not right.. Also asked for waters but he never gave them to us even after I mentioned it again. The bartender seemed more concerned with smoking a cigarette outside.,2,,
3,Matthew H.,"North Bellmore, NY",0,6,0,5.0,11/9/2018,"Great place to hang out at the bar or on the patio, came here with coworkers and had an amazing time. They have a healthy draft beer line up and the cosmos were fantastic. Bar staff and management are attentive and friendly. We also ordered a plate of calamari and that was cooked and seasoned perfectly, it was served with an aioli that complimented the seafood incredibly well. I have already begun recommending them!",,,
4,Margarita G.,"Brooklyn, NY",126,66,342,5.0,8/16/2018,"Our original lunch plans fell through and this place was up the block so we decided to check it out.  There was one server for the whole place, and she was pretty good at checking in on us.  I wish she would have dropped water glasses at our table at some point considering we were sitting outside in 90 degree weather but no biggie--we survived with out nicely cold beers.  I love me a good Caesar salad--it was delicious here and the margherita flatbread pizza was delicious!!! Would absolutely come back to try more food!! The inside was well ventilated and our waitress (who was also the bartender) kindly charged my phone while we ate.  The wait on our food..took what felt like forever..but was likely only about 20-25 minutes. I was satisfied all around.",2,,2
5,Felicia I.,"Queens, NY",14,105,37,3.0,9/3/2018,I stopped by here because I was in the area & grabbed a drink with my friend. The drinks were ok & the cocktail menu was limited. :-/,,,
6,David D.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",24,113,256,5.0,4/19/2018,"We've been here before - and always enjoy the visit. Greenwich Mean Time (or GMT) is a British or an English pub. I actually tried an British tap beer once - after being informed by the bartender that it may seem flat to me - accustomed as I may be to the beers poured here in a typical local pub. It did, but it was a very pleasant experience. Most recently on a Sunday, the Honey and I found ourselves here. A nice crowd but not overly crowded. We snagged a spot at the bar and had a martini for me, a cosmo for the Honey. Well poured and very well made. A side order of fries followed. We'll surely be back!",1,,
7,Michele K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,25,5.0,8/29/2018,"We were looking for something light to eat on this hot evening in our hometown. We decided to stroll through the village and came across GMT (Greenwich Meridian Time) tavern. Our waitress was delightful and the food totally hit the spot. There was a good selection of wines, cocktails and beers (draft and bottles). The menu was a mix of different types of cuisine with great options and pricing. We had the cheese board and pork tacos, with a beer and wine. We definitely recommend this place.",,,
8,Taylor A.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",106,134,141,3.0,7/25/2017,"When a Brit hears that there is a British style pub in the city serving a roast dinner, naturally we gather the rest of the Brits (and an American to show them how we do Sunday's in the U.K.) and head over.The place it's self had a nice feel to it, very chill and 'pub-like'. More people were sat outside as it was a nice day and I feel like perhaps the service inside suffered because of this because it was a little slow... We all went for the roast. There was only one option which was beef. Rumor has it this never changes either which is pretty disappointing! However it was cooked well which makes it all that better. Unfortunately disappointment sunk in at the potatoes. Undercooked and lacking any fluffiness. They were clearly missing a good shake after boiling. However with that being said, when your short of options for roast dinners in NYC you can't be to fussy and whilst i enjoyed it and felt very satisfied afterwards, I'm not dying to come back. Let's just say, it filled a hole until I next head home...",1,1,
9,Peter C.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,110,110,3.0,7/24/2017,"Decent place for a few bevvies, and actually serves a proper English sized pint! Although you do pay through the nose for the pleasure...I came here on a Sunday, as I'd heard it's one of the few places in NYC that serves a traditional Roast Dinner, with Yorkshire puds and all. It seemed very quiet, however it did have that nice lazy English pub feel to it, vs the usual hustle and bustle of NYC.The Roast was Beef, and yknow what? It wasn't bad. While it won't compare to your mum's/gran's from back home, it'll definitely tide any Brit over until they can get back home for the real deal. Criticisms were that Beef was the only Roast on the menu, the potatos weren't crispy or fluffy, and the Yorkshire was slightly overdone. Pros were that the horseradish sauce seemed home made, and you get a pretty big portion. As I say, not anything to write home about by U.K. Standards, but tasty none the less.",1,,
10,Zev L.,"New York, NY",183,166,50,4.0,10/27/2017,"I love GMT for their selection. They have a solid choice of common brews, craft, and seasonal. The prices can be steap, but perhaps appropriate for the foreign and craft picks. I'm a happy semi regular, and hope to one day make this a 5 star.",4,,
11,Nancy S.,"New York, NY",184,23,4,3.0,2/11/2018,"We wandered in here on a Friday night after a movie. The food is definitely nothing to write home about but it does the trick in a pinch. We had the PEI mussels and a caesar salad. They had a peculiar lack of beer selection that night - it's a pet peeve when a place has a huge list of options but 35% of the options are actually unavailable. The borderline-tacky colonial decor was actually kind of enjoyable but then again, I am Canadian.",,,
12,Celeste A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",313,53,4,2.0,4/8/2018,"What a disappointment!! We were sat immediately but it took 5 minutes for our waitress to even come over. It did not appear packed as there were about 7 tables empty. Once she finally did come over, we were rushed to fully order. The waitress did not check on our meals once. She did not get us another round of drinks until we were completely finished with the meal. Honestly the service was terrible. The only thing she did quickly was grab the check, process it on the portable computer and watched what I did when the suggested tip came up. The only reason I'm not giving a 1 star review is because the pork tacos were good and so were the french fries. If management ever sees this, make sure your servers know the steps of service!",2,1,1
13,Brian O.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,10,0,4.0,6/29/2018,"We went in GMT with about a 1/2 hour before the Daniel Tosh show at the Skirball center, and actually had a better than expected experience....we were greeted instantly, told the waitress we were in a hurry, and she directed us towards the fish-n- chips and the wings....good choices.Food arrived in 5 minutes, piping hot, and pretty damn good.Potions were large, very many chips with the fish, but the wings were really outstanding, meaty, large, and tasty.Next time we are in the neighborhood, will definitely go to the Greenwhich Meridian Time Pub....",,,

16,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,4.0,4/3/2017,"Been here twice, once on a cold rainy day, the other bright and sunny. The decor works with both; cozy in the autumn/winter, while the windows slow enough natural light in for the summer. There is also outdoor seating if you pleaseDrinks menu is broad and covers most of the mainstream breweries - just don't expect any of the micro brewery stuff you can get at a lot of placesMy wife had a cosmopolitan, which came with an iced top-up - I was a particular fan of that. Service is quick and friendly. Only negative really is that we ordered another round but excluding my sisters drink, yet we still got it. Could have sent it back I guess but would prefer if they just got the order right. Both times found the venue very clean",,,

18,Trushit O.,"Langhorne, PA",47,188,198,3.0,5/6/2017,"We have been here a couple of times. The service the second time was very disappointing. Though we usually stop by for a few drinks after class and bar food, we stopped at 7:30 PM this time. Order of mojito came out fine and on time. Fries too more than 30 minutes but we had to send it back as we were late for a movie. What disappointed us is the waiter not only cared to understand, she just left the check on the table and left. Another server had to ring us up.I am very disappointed with this treatment. I hope the management reviews this with the server. We understood the kitchen can forget or is backed up. There is a reason we had to send the fries back; I wished she understood that.",2,,
19,Emily Z.,"San Francisco, CA",368,1,0,1.0,6/30/2018,Terrible service (over 25-minute wait for drinks) and were double charged for overly sugary drinks. Will not be stopping by again.,,,

I had the summer flirt and shared some fries.  The drink sounded better than it tasted and the fries took forever to come. Once they came they were not that great, kinda on the stale side.

This place used to be this fun Mexican restaurant, Señor swankies it had cheesy funny pics on the wall & pretty decent Mexican food coming into the bar now it looks & is totally different. Since it was a nice night we were able to sit outside. Once seated we got some drinks I had the Summer fling & my company had a beer. Summer fling was not bad , good tasting drink. Beer was good as well. As for the place itself not bad nice set up , service was good & prices are decent no food this time around the place was decent enough for drinks.",7,2,2

25,Nyota W.,"Brooklyn, NY",302,693,106,3.0,2/11/2017,"It was a Friday night and we were wandering around trying to find a an after dinner place for a drink that wasn't overrun by college students, that was full enough so we wouldn't feel as though we'd made a mistake and had enough space to allow us to find seats. Good luck in the West Village. We literally went door to door. And then it appeared GMT Tavern. Perfectly situated on the corner. We were immediately escorted to a table.  The service was nice, she gave us enough time to explore the menu, but ensured that we knew she was present. We ordered a glasses of wine and a cosmopolitan. Everyone was happy with their selection and we achieved the goal of an after-dinner cocktail. The prices were ok as well. I may not go out of my way to come here, but it's a great option for the area. Thanks GMT!",,,1
26,Lauren G.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,1.0,2/10/2018,"Very rude guy working the front door. Demanded aggressively that my friend and I leave while we quietly waited for our car to arrive...while it was raining out. Will never go back, due to such rude and unnecessary behavior.",,,1
27,Stephanie L.,"Rahway, NJ",353,260,1233,4.0,12/28/2015,"If you're looking for a spot to have a well-crafted cocktail, come to GMT Tavern.  Yes they have about 20 beers on tap and a beautiful setting, but the drinks are really a work of art.  I tried the ""Maple & Sprig"" while my friend had the ""Bobby Burns"" ($13 and $14 respectively).  These are the types of drinks that really turn bartending into a craft or an art.  Yes - they were that good.It's called a tavern, but please don't envision a dark hole of a place.  With its vaulted ceilings, dark wood, red and gold decor, exposed brick, and library accents (yes I mean books), you feel a little swanky when you walk in (though not as far as pretentious).  The space is warm and inviting with plenty of seating along the bar, 2-person high top tables, and a large communal counter table down the center of the room.If you're looking for somewhere to sit and grab a great cocktail with a friend, kill time before a show or dinner, or are meeting someone for a first time, this is a great place to try.",5,1,3

29,Meghan O.,"Astoria, New York, NY",1,29,21,3.0,12/30/2017,"Nice bar- it has book shelves, a heavy curtain covering the front door and a distinguished library-esque appearance. It has some cool specialty cocktails as well as a good selection of wine and beer. It's a good bar to go with a small group of people but it's not the type of place that you'll finding a lot of mingling.",,1,
30,Katie V.,"Buffalo, NY",101,110,173,5.0,9/2/2015,"One of my new favorite haunts. I had been here once before (last summer) and they had the most delicious sliders I'd tried so far in NYC. Since then, they still hold that title. I ended up eating 2 orders that first visit.The interior was originally what drew me in. It has the type of elegant-yet-relaxed decor that I look for in a bar/restaurant.I've always received great service here. It became extremely busy the first time I was in, but my server remained attentive for the most part, and compensated with a free round when she realized I had been waiting about ten minutes for a drink. I appreciated her doing that, because although I noticed it had been a bit of a wait, I understand what it's like to work in a busy restaurant.The subsequent times I've come in here, I've been attended to by Sammy at the bar. She's a great bartender with an upbeat personality and is quick. Part of the reason my boyfriend and I go there is because of how welcome we feel (the other part is the sliders).They have an ample selection of wines, beers, and a full bar. My go-to wine is the Chardonnay from New Zealand - perfect for those who prefer whites on the drier side. I'm in the neighborhood at least 3 times a week, so I'll definitely be back, but it's safe to say I would return even if I wasn't nearby on a regular basis.",1,,
31,Niki K.,"San Francisco, CA",148,12,0,3.0,2/5/2018,"The food was fine, definitely nothing to write home about. The mixed salad we ordered came with extremely mushy tomatoes and an extremely creamy vinaigrette. The salad was also overdressed. The shepards pie was dry and did not have good flavor. The french onion soup was okay but the broth tasted too much of wine and not beef-y or onion-y. The meal was also very expensive and the food was not worth the price. The atmosphere is nice however and I would come back here for a drink, but not dinner.",,,

34,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",216,448,2742,3.0,7/10/2015,"Came here for drinks only. Decor is nice, classic English pub. Drinks were reasonably priced, $9 for a glass of wine. Service was not so great. We were greeted by the doorman/security and we asked if we could sit outside. He said the hostess would be back in a minute to seat us... Over 10 minutes later she arrived to seat us (after 2 waitresses walked past us & ignored we were waiting!). Once seated we had a bit of a wait before we ordered and then another wait for our drinks.

35,Barnard C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,7,2,5.0,9/24/2017,"GMT Tavern has brilliantly overcome the cursed cooking of most Irish/British Isles pubs across the pond, and has stealthily grown into one of the top tier of as-yet-unsung restaurants on Manhattan Island.GMT is named after Greenwich Mean Time, the clock time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. It's time is kept the same all year and is  unaffected by Summer Time or Daylight Saving Time. When the sun is at its highest point exactly above the Prime Meridian, it is noon at Greenwich, which is 6 a.m. in New York.There are 60+ beers on tap at a brilliant, long, mahogany bar with a magnificent XXIIII hour clock set to London time. Sit in GMT for 15 seconds and you will feel you are in a 200-year-old pub near Fleet Street, only the food and beverage is far better.Let's talk food:In short. Order the Kobe beef burgers (sliders or big bun) with onion marmalade and perhaps melted cheddar on a classic bun, with pickled jalapeno  slices on the side. Ask for a small dish of kitchen-made chimmi-churri to dip the sandwich in. It's the best chimmi-churri served publicly in New York City.Astonishingly, the bartenders can also create a Rio-level caipirinha, not too much sugar and a little extra cachaca, perfectly muddled. There is none better on Manhattan except at Via Brasil. They make a slew of other imaginative cocktails as well. Order the Key Lime pie. It's made the way it was so long made in the Keys, where it lived unspoiled under cake screens in a hot climate without refrigeration and was truly a form of cheesecake. This pie is kitchen-made, too, and somebody good is in that kitchen. The coffee's too weak and shy for the American palate. The service people are alert, polite, energetic, have good taste buds, and truthful personalities.  The noise level is moderately loud but the music doesn't blast,  and you can sit side by side along the bars and at four-tops so there can be intimate conversation at moderate decibels. HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT: The prices. $$ is true. You can be deliciously satisfied for $US45 each, including a fair tip. SUGGESTION: Go to the GMT website and scan the menus for yourself. If your mouth doesn't water, check your pulse.",1,,

(btw reading ""people of the book"" - quite an interesting read). so anyhow, I just pulled out the book and irritated, decided to write the review. Our evening was fine, the hostess was a bit unfriendly, but it is NYC, the waitress seemed warm and humorous, but then neglected to bring us food or check on us for enormously long stretches of time. So it turned out to be one of those nights where everyone enjoys the company but is exhausted at how long it takes to get anything. The mango soup special was like drinking a bowl of salsa. Both of us who ordered it gave it away to the people next to us. perhaps that is why we were erroneously charged for three? The salmon salad was lackluster, salmon dinner a bit better. we ended up with lobster sliders on our bill, but never ordered them, and I just noticed the mistake. fish tacos were nice, beef sliders a hit. cocktails adequate but Old Fashioned a bitter end. Birthday slices were charged quite a bit with no mention of that, or several different items would have been chosen. Bill was wrong and fluffed but we did not catch it until home.

It was a delicious roast meat with veggies and some form of potatoes. In order of preference of what we liked: it was the lamb chops, scotch eggs and then then the roast. It was all good, without being great. Maybe because i thought it was a little bit over-priced for what my tastebuds wanted and it was the roast that was on the slightly above average scale. I'll have to try it again...On a positive note, our server was really nice and I liked the gastropub type atmosphere. Would like to come here for some casual beers!",,,1

The bartenders were very friendly and gave myself and the other patrons attention and conversation. They seemed knowledgable and had lots of scotches on hand. I was surprised to see they had one of my favorites, The Balvenie 15. Had I not had some beers prior, I would have had some moreI ordered their fish and chips. The fish was very fresh and meaty. The batter was not overly greasy, so they did a great job making it. They don't make it here with spices in the batter, which I prefer, but they do this so you can dip it into one of the two tartar sauces that they provide.

50,Midori K.,"Manhattan, NY",47,156,182,4.0,9/27/2016,"Good English bar in soho. We were stop by for drink, but we bite some food too. We ordered escargot and lobster slider, fish taco. Escargot is ok, not bad but $14.99? Is bad for you spend this money for this dish. Lobster slider was not good. They use too much garlic and didn't feel any lobster. Fish taco was good! Feels like a mini fish and chip inside. I like this place. Music is not too loud. We could enjoy conversation. It was feel lounge inside the bar. I liked deco too! Maybe not food. Waiter was friendly too.",,,
51,Emily C.,"Manhattan, NY",20,16,3,3.0,5/28/2017,The cheese plate (granted I did move the pieces of dry cold toast before I took the pic in disbelief that they were serving me toast!!)

With the storm and everything, lots of people inside, all cheering and yelling. The atmosphere was great for a football game night! I had a huge Radeberger which was great and hubby has a stout!

They have a range of beers on draft and delicious house cocktails. Ask for Sammy the bartender to make you a Tom Collins (one of the best I've ever had)! The fish & chips and salmon salad are generously portioned and always fresh. I always stop in for a drink but I stay for the great service. The staff here have always been so kind to me so shouts out to Elaina, Alicia, Johno, Olya, Allonzo, Chelby and Balthazar for keeping my drink full. Ps if you want an authentic experience go in on a Monday night, they got a handsome English guy (Nat) behind the taps, cracking jokes and making everyone laugh. Love GMT!",,,

Sadly, The food wasn't that great - especially for the price tags. The lobster rolls looked really appetizing but they weren't. And the cheese plate wasn't much in quantity or taste.",,,

Our server didn't even look over her shoulder and said, ""Yeah, that's kind of our thing."" Behind the bar were a number of different scotch bottles turned upside down and ready to pour a shot on command.All right.Our group came in on a Sunday night and there wasn't a lot going on, but from my conversation with our server, the bar is big on soccer.  The space features a huge projector screen where we watched the Broncos and Colts, but I could easily picture an EPL or Champion's League game with no hesitation.Unfortunately I'm not local, but if I lived closer this place would be my spot.

65,P C.,"New York, NY",6,141,11,1.0,6/23/2015,"Very bad experience here. The wait staff was visibly stressed, but for unseen reasons. The place was little over half full yet everyone was running around like mad people being very short with all the customers. 10 seconds after we sat we were asked if we were ready to order. But once we did, waited 20-25 minutes after each drink order. 50!! minutes for our appetizer. And about an hour and 15 for our entrees (which were a burger and a salad). The wings were terrible. Super dry and over cooked so badly the bones were shattering when you took a bite. The blue cheese was disgustingly watery. The burger was cooked well but the cheese and other accouterments were hardly there. Now, we were polite and nice the whole time, but since everything took so long we witnessed 2 tables cancel orders and leave (after about 40 minutes of nothing). One was so infuriated they refused to pay for their drinks they had while waiting. They yelled and spoke to the manager and left without paying. So it was a very real shit show in there. Never did anyone apologize for the wait. Offer to buy us one of our drinks, dessert, nothing. And, when we did ask for the dessert menu the waitress didn't even break her stride and literally threw the menu on the table as she walked past. That really pissed me off. I was the only one being super nice to her and her best chance for a tip and she acted like a complete jerk. I've lived around the corner for years and did not love this place to begin with. Decided to try it only because they just did all sort of renovations. Never, ever, again.",1,,
66,Shamshiri C.,"Tampa, FL",3,45,44,4.0,10/21/2015,Had a fish and chips here. It was authentic in terms of choosing a white fish and having malt vinegar available . The crunch on fish was superb. The only flaw was a pink sauce next to the tartar that I did not get it. Price was very high that I guess typical for SOHO.,,,
67,Lauren M.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",165,257,187,3.0,3/22/2014,"A bit torn over what to say. My review is mostly influenced by the fact that I was very disappointed by my lobster sliders. It was more like lobster slaw (I hate slaw) on a harder-to-chew-than-it-should-be roll for $14. And because I already had drinks before arriving, I was less inclined to spend more money there. My fellow table mates felt similarly about the drinks. Nothing special, especially for the prices, which are above the going rate for this area during a happy hour time frame. I won't weigh the business pros and cons of whether an establishment should offer happy hour, but it did solidify the fact that this place was not a good fit for our social meeting and we'll probably not be back as a large group.On the plus side, I dig the decor with its time theme, and it's very comfortable. The bathroom and stalls are tiny, but clean and get the job done. They also processed a ton of credit cards for our bill split... Not easy stuff. Overall, this is probably the place for intimate drinks than a group co-worker vent / part II pre-game venue.",,,
68,Robin R.,"San Diego, CA",1120,19,22,5.0,9/27/2015,"Great place to hang on an open patio and people watch. Try the Cosmo, they even bring you an extra amount in an iced bowl.  Very friendly staff.  My vote for Sunday Funday on a patio to connect with good friends and take in SoHo.",,,

75,Skippy K.,"Reading, PA",1,35,4,5.0,9/4/2015,Discovered this place two years ago while stalking the hot Summer streets of the Village with my brother as we looked for something cold to drink.  We were quickly seated and both of us ordered the bottled pear cider which we poured over ice and drained like a California reservoir.  It was delicious and we promptly ordered two more which lasted only 5 minutes longer than the first round.Fast forward two years and we decided to return to the place of yore to see if things were just as good and they were...  The cider was every bit as refreshing and the fish & chips that I ordered were among the best I have ever had anywhere.  We even had the same superb server who was very attentive to our table. Prices are reasonable for New York City and I would go back in a heartbeat.,,,
76,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",252,505,1,3.0,7/30/2013,"Let me see.  Things to like.  Things not to like.Burger:  Fine, small, decent bun, decent fries.  $15...I guess for NYC this is fine as well.Menu overall was Meh-diocre.Beer list...again fine, but they have a lot of beers that look like they are hard to get, but they aren't.  Also priced quite high, but I am thinking Philly prices maybe?  Just hard to swallow paying $9 for a Guinness.Atmosphere, quiet on a Monday night, but I liked the inside of the bar...seemed like a decent British pub.People watching opportunities = five-stars.  Favorite thing about this place.  It was a beautiful night and we sat at the corner of the restaurant with a huge open window enjoying a great view of the street with tons of fresh air.  Would highly recommend this seat and the experience will be fine/good regardless of what you order.Overall not a bad place, but a great location.",,,

A classic Sunday roast at GMT Tavern includes roast beef, green peas, glazed carrots, roast potato, roast turnip and a fluffy Yorkshire pudding with a delicious gravy to drizzle all over the yumminess (for all under $25!)

I love the whole British theme they've got going here, but the food and drink left much to be desired. I had a $10 glass of sangria that tasted like it had no alcohol in it. I would have been better off with a beer, for sure.The burger was really gross. It had some kind of cheese on it, that made the whole thing taste bitter. If it weren't for the fries, I would have been starving for the whole rest of the night.The place is extremely overpriced, and the food menu wasn't all that great. Plus, my friend said her stomach hurt for the whole morning after, after having the duck confit. Ah well. Looks like I won't be coming back here any time soon!",1,,

The first thing I noticed was the impressive bar with over 20 draft beers. The ambience was pretty elegant and quiet and thankfully cool. My friend and I both ordered items from the brunch menu, salmon scrambled eggs for her and lobster benedict for me. Both came with a side of fruits and potatoes. The lobster benedict was extremely tasty and filling. We also ordered white sangria which was actually really yummy.They also had cute outdoor seating, but it was way too hot for us to sit there.

The bartender, Liam, from Dublin, is a really nice, classy guy who will pour you generous samples of ales like Hobgoblin, Holy Grail, and Meantime London Stout before you commit. They also have a pretty good list of small and 25-oz bottles. The place is well-appointed, with dark tones and stately accents, probably what a good British pub looks like in its infancy (I'm guessing they opened not TOO long ago). I haven't had a chance to try the food but will do so in the future. Really nice and laid-back, but not dead, on a Monday night. Cheers.",3,,3

This is definitely one of the nicest places in the area--with a great atmosphere--certainly a hundred times better than Senor Swanky's, which it replaced many years ago. I go on a lot of dates in the area, but when it's someone I think I might really like I make sure to meet them at GMT. I enjoy the specialty drinks and the staff seem pretty friendly. My date and I last night actually met the owner who was hanging out at the crowded bar and he was exceptionally friendly--especially considering this is in Manhattan.

The staff was attentive & helpful. The kitchen was very fast. I suppose you could say a bit too fast as entrees were served while some of us were finishing appetizers. We were a large table with stragglers, so this is forgiven. I didn't taste the Scotch Egg but it looked AMAZING. I had French Onion Soup & a burger. They were both good. The Fish & Chips and Steak Salad both looked very good. My food was not brilliant and not all disappointing. If I was in the neighborhood again I would definitely give this place another shot.",,,

92,Konrad H.,"Workington, United Kingdom",2,3,2,5.0,11/7/2013,"It was a Saturday night in April, around 8pm, and I was strolling along Bleecker enjoying the music emanating from the bars and clubs and enjoying seeing the people milling around. However, the combination of having been on my feet all day, with finding myself in an area that seemed to be full of couples and groups, helped me decide that I would head back to midtown - my adopted neighbourhood. It was just then that I spotted a bar across the road called GMT - an Englishman in New York and a bar called GMT - this was fate - I couldn't not try it...I walked into GMT alongside a beautiful girl - my first reaction was 'Wow - she must be the most attractive girl in New York' - we sat at the bar and talked for some time while she was waiting for her party to arrive. It was a memorable evening, relaxing in the comfortable and trendy surroundings of GMT, enjoying the drinks and the music, sharing jokes, and bantering with the friendly bar staff, and generally enjoying the ambience of a night to remember. When the most attractive girl in New York left we arranged to meet in a club uptown later in the night and exchanged telephone numbers. I was going to take a walk around Greenwich Village but on the way out I got chatting with Raul the Bouncer. I have to say that talking with Raul was a real pleasure - a great asset to GMT - it was really interesting learning about the New York nightlife from a professional doorman's perspective, and we were later joined by Liam the DJ. They both made me feel so welcome and happy to be there that I ended up talking with them for over an hour.I could have stayed there longer but my phone rang - it was my invitation to go clubbing with the most attractive girl in New York...That night reinforced my feeling that New Yorkers are so friendly, and this made all the difference between me having a good time and having a great time. GMT - thanks for the happy memories and next time I cross the Atlantic I'll definitely drop in.p.s. the most attractive girl in New York and I became friends and still keep in touch...",1,2,1
93,Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",600,1450,20,3.0,7/29/2011,"Not a bad corner bar, all things considered, but hardly the best either. It gets loud and it's hard to have a decent conversation unless you're sitting really close to each other. I had the GMTeatime which was quite good. The black tea flavor was pretty strong. The staff are nice and the clientele range from cool hipsters to barbarians clearly just out of a pick-up artist convention. Seriously, I watched this pair eye every woman in the room, sizing up their targetability, then finally settle on a pair of clearly drunk thirty-something women who couldn't keep their tube tops up. Then they negged their way into the conversation and by the time we left a couple of hours later, one was definitely going home with his target. It'd be funny if it weren't so sad.",3,1,
94,Lauren H.,"Calgary, Canada",92,373,11,4.0,5/12/2014,"We enjoyed this place. It wasn't crazy loud (at least to start with) and wasn't as crowded on a Friday night as many of the surrounding places. It had a more casual vibe which was perfect for relaxing after dinner. They had a good cocktail list and a few liqueurs and spirits you don't normally find at the average bar (much to the delight of my companion). Service was quick and friendly, even when they got busier later in the night.It was nice to not be totally gouged for a couple of drinks either like some of the other places in the area. Window seats are great for people watching (but they do have to close them at a certain time out of consideration for the neighbours).Another bonus? Clean restrooms. Always nice when you find those in a bar/tavern.",,,

109,Jorge G.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,636,246,2.0,10/5/2012,"Upscale but uncomfortable. Nice owner; thriving biz..great corner location. But pricey. Too-fancy-schmancy, 'tapas menu'. Example menu item: ""Fresh strawberries with 'creme anglaise' "". Creme anglaise? What the heck is that? I mean, I know what it is but what's with these deliberately effete touches? I donno. Just awkward in some way I can't put my finger on. The furnishings are posh and swank: real leather chairs for example. Lighting is low. Toweringly high-ceilings; cavernous. Maybe too high? Takes away all sense of intimacy?Crowd:  lively; gabby; bustling. But it just feels like a place which has never had 'regulars'; and which will never have 'regulars'. People who are here have dropped in on an utter whim because they saw the sign outside two minutes ago; and when they're gone they won't remember and they won't ever be back because there's too many other choices all around the area. A typical customer would be a 34-ish early Rogaine guy with a wide-lapel shirt unbuttoned to the diaphragm; girlish legs in much-too-tight fire-engine pants; straddling stool backward; expensive smart-phone; case of sniffles. A bored, bony, Yoga-blond with de rigeur little white dog; 'little black dress'; strand of pearls (her man has already bought her over 300 meals in their relationship and she orders automatically now  without thinking about anything except specifically what kind of salt must go on her omelette). Lanky, bearded, horn-rimmed-glasses; v-neck sweater dudes 'talking about the Arts'. Fumbling NYU students on dates; the boys using their parent's plastic to pay..very awkward at face-to-face conversation; hands twitching for Logitech mice. No sense of camraderie; no authentic people; everyone complete and utter strangers to each other as if from different planets. No sense of shared unity. 'Passers-through'. Manhattanites, when they're in that, ""we're out to eat mode""..that mentally-detached, aloof, remote style..'comfort sampling'..drink here, cupcake there, coffee and music at some other venue..they drift though nightspots like plankton... I'm at a loss to describe it all better..but for me GMT was just a cold, grave, chilly experience. Even though there was nothing truly wrong. Probably just me, sorry.

110,Melissa M.,"Weehawken, NJ",18,115,8,2.0,10/7/2012,"9PM on a Saturday and the husband and I were roaming the streets looking for a place to eat.  We passed by GMT, the menu looked nice so we stopped in.The decor is nice, they have really cool 24 hour clock hanging over the bar.  Too bad it doesn't work.  There was a good amount of patrons, mostly sitting at the bar and large high tables.  We walked in and took a seat at a table against the wall.A server comes to the table and drops cocktail menu and food menus. The cocktail menu was extensive.  Huge beer and wine selection.  We ended up with a sloe gin fizz and some other cocktail (I cant remember the name).  Both were really good. We then ordered our food (and some waters that never came).  That was the LAST TIME we saw our server until we were almost done with our food.We started with 2 onion soups.  I am an onion soup junkie, and 95% percent of the time, when it is on a menu, I will order it.  This onion soup (not delivered by our server) was the WORST I have ever had.  The broth was horrible, completely flavorless.  Even the cheese on top lacked flavor.  There has only been 3 instances when I have not eaten the whole crock of onion soup.  This was one of them.Our half-eaten soup dishes were then removed (not by our server).  I was out of cocktail, and was thirsty for either more cocktail or water.  But no server anywhere.Next we had the duck confit pastry.  This was the highlight of our experience at GMT.  Very tasty, like little duck egg rolls.  Delicious. Next we had the shepherds pie and truffle mac and cheese.  Shepherds pie was one of the worst I've had.  Bland, flavorless, and a small portion for the money.  Truffle mac and cheese was ok.  Heavy on the truffle, if you like truffles, try it out.When we had eaten 90% of the meal, and our glasses had been long empty, our server decided to show up.  We were finally able to get another round of drinks and water FINALLY! Its not even like she was busy with other tables.  She was no where to be found.  Then it took forever to get the check, and there went $104 we will never get back.Overall -  nice decor, mediocre food, awful onion soup,  terrible service, way overpriced.  The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the food was not inedible, and the cocktails (when we were able to get them) were good.  There is no way I would return.",2,1,

It's somewhat downhill from there though, given the price. Service isn't as knowledgeable as it could be, food has a few misfires (putting chimichurri on a great hanger steak where butter or bleu would be better - just strange.) Then again, there are some bright spots: awesome fries and pretty solid appetitizers (calamari are great.) Overall, seems like they take bar food to the next level and have great beer selection but might miss some of the refinement beyond that (i.e. entrees, wine list, limited dessert offerings.)

116,Tampa D.,"New York, NY",3,212,1,2.0,7/28/2012,"I have been to the GMT Tavern about 4 or 5 times in total. A few times I went there for drinks. This works well, although their price point is higher than their selection merits, and other neighborhood bars offer comparable drinks for less. I am going to be generous and give them two stars for having a more grown-up atmosphere, though, because the higher prices keep the children away. Do not eat here. Their waitstaff (generally quite incompetent) are constantly surprised when you ask them for things like forks, napkins, plates, and other prerequisites to a normal meal.They also do not seem to grasp the concept of two people coming in for dinner, and what said people might order. We asked for one appetizer to share, and two main dishes, one of which was the lamb chops. The appetizer arrived, and then the first main dish--and ""lamb lollipops"" (their appetizer/small plate). It took us a while to work out what the three rib bones on a lettuce leaf represented. The other main dish (hanger steak) was not at all a hanger steak--it was a thick, stringy slab of beef that might in another life have been a strip steak. Either they don't know how to cut and serve hanger steak, or they get whatever is on sale at the Mortons across the street and just serve it as hanger steak?Oh, and did I mention how overpriced the food is?

But for being a stone's throw from NYU, they aren't exactly friendly to my wallet, which is on the really sparse unpaid student intern budget. However, they excel as a gastropub. They have tons of different beers, both common and some that are off the beaten path, and I love that their seasonal menu is always something different. On the basic side, they serve pub food, but they kick it up a notch and add an artistic culinary flair. It doesn't hurt that they have a giant drop TV screen as well. While they can be a classy gastropub, they can also get packed and crowded for any major sporting game/event.

I've been a couple of times now, and I've never so reliably encountered such surly waitstaff. You know how you hear people describe waitresses that act like they're doing you a favor by looking back over a shoulder to take your drink order as they pass by? That's this place. Truly awful. And too expensive. It's not completely out of line expensive, but when surly staff reluctantly bring me a brew, it just really sucks to end up paying $12 for it after the obligatory tip. Oh yeah, and the bouncer waved at my buddy to get the group moving out the door after we finished. From across the bar.

The cocktails seemed to be pricier than other neighborhood establishments but still within reason at approx $12-$15 per.The Bad: The beer is ridiculously overpriced! Bottles start at $8 and go up from there. We're not talking Chimay here, folks. We're talking 12oz beers you can literally get less than a block away for $3 going for $8+.  They do have Chimay and other fancy selections but you're better off going across the street to the super market and getting a 12 pack of something else for the same price. Draughts of beer are also overpriced starting around $8 with the average price $10+. To justify the overpriced draughts they claim you are getting 20oz but the pours are pretty lousy (or at least that was our experience). How can you market yourself as ""your new neighborhood joint"" when the prices are so outrageous?I hope they will realize that many have tried but few have succeeded in getting these prices in the neighborhood and make adjustments accordingly. According to the bartender, the owners haven't owned a bar before so hopefully they'll learn quickly.

The food was very good, nice portions, and such good prices. It was dark in there, which I didn't love, but they were playing the football game which we wanted to see, so we were happy about that. Didn't check out the cocktails unfortunately. A solid pub for a relaxed dinner.",,,

148,Reema S.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,42,3,3.0,7/8/2011,"I wish the crowd here wasn't so tool-y. But I suppose it's a necessarily evil. I enjoyed the selection of cocktails on their menu and the fact that there was no sports on television or obnoxious frat boys in their plaid shirts with miller lites in-hand. Instead there were obnoxious frat boys in their hugo boss suits. But I digress.The bartenders were nice enough and managed the crowded bar very well. I also love the fact that they wear vests. We only stayed for drinks, but from what I saw, the food menu looked pretty good. I'll probably go back when I'm feeling tool-y.",,1,
149,Mark S.,"New York, NY",183,10,0,4.0,8/11/2014,"Great crowd, and always great drinks and friendly bartenders. If you live around the Bleecker street madness, this naturally becomes your to-go spot. Decor is very cool, it's fun to check out the details around the room when you move your head up and look at the ceiling and the walls after a couple round of beers. Also recommended for their good selection of cocktails. Last thing to note is that it's very central and great place to meetup with friends and even a date spot sometimes. Their food was the only so-so thing here so took 1 star off for that.",,,
150,Milton H.,"Washington, DC",611,126,520,3.0,8/31/2013,"This place gives the impression of being a beer - hole....or said differently a watering hole. To the contrary. Was hanging out in West Village and looking for a late night snack. Stumbled into this place, sat outside checking out the sites and the Friday night fashion show and enjoyed a crab cake garnished with sweet corn salad. Simply amazing!! Also had a white sangria. The food was excellent. Th server was ok...I would encourage her to smile more ---but it was late....maybe her feet hurt and she wanted to go home. Definitely have had better Sangria. All in all nice place, great outdoor seating and I will be going back.",,,

152,Naomi A.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,15,2,4.0,10/6/2011,"This lovely tavern opened a few months ago and it has become my favorite place to decompress after work. Their beer selection is out of this world, but I am more of a liquor fan (their whiskeys and bourbon are pretty top shelf!) The service is a bit hit or miss if you're at a table for drinks. I don't recommend eating an entire meal there as the portions are petite and WAY too expensive, BUT if you sit at the bar you're golden on service. I appreciate that the bartenders have asked my name, such as Brian and Liam, its nice being recognized. Although the dress is casual, the bartenders wear ties, vests, etc, and  most of the crowd is after work suits, slacks, etc. A bit swanky, yes, but its fairly relaxed, dimly lit, quiet(ish), and worth checking out.",,,
153,Amie D.,"New York, NY",1,31,0,4.0,11/1/2011,"Came here yesterday's crazy busy Halloween night. We were looking for a place that wasn't super packed in the area, which is obviously almost an impossibility in this area Halloween night.It didn't look psychotically over-crowded, so we approached, and there was a friendly enough bouncer guy that told us the only available seating would be outdoor seating, which is what I wanted even thought it was super freezing (I wanted entertainment while I ate).Drinks are fair prices, good selection. I just got beer and the Duck Confit Pasty, which itself was $9.00. Small amount of food for the price, but very good quality, loved it actually. My friend got the crabcake, and was disappointed that for $12.00 she only got one crabcake and a side of what looked like..corn salsa. But she said it was very good.Basically the food is good. I really liked the place, was perfect for the night. But since I didn't experience it fully (ie: the inside), I'll wait before I give a 5 star rating.For a crazy night, the service was decent. I liked it enough to write this review.",,,
154,Mark s.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0,4.0,7/2/2015,"GMT recently renovated and very nice. Great outdoor street dining. I had the fish and chips and they were excellent.

155,Israel I.,"Bronx, NY",219,17,4,2.0,8/12/2013,"Food was really disappointing. We were six people and none of us liked their food. I had Cobb Salad which is very hard mess up but the chicken was completely tasteless. My friends said their burger was horrible. The service was OK so that's why their getting two stars. This is a bar and we went there to eat, so my rating is on the food not the ambiance or crowed. I was there for brunch on a Sunday and it was not crowded - not sure how the drinking crowed is.",,,
156,Hudson C.,"Manhattan, NY",33,41,0,5.0,10/4/2012,"Went there for a drink on a quiet weeknight.  Being on Bleeker in NYU-land I was expecting an upscale college bar but I was way off- this place is great: the beer and whiskey menu was extensive (I had a Young's Chocolate Ale for dessert), friendly bartenders, great atmosphere, and they played cool 40/50's tunes.  The food looked good too- I will definitely go back to find out...",1,,
157,Wesley H.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,295,0,3.0,11/18/2012,"SoHo's attempt at the casual London pub kind of fails because the decor and vibe is not the same. Despite that, and the lack of interesting beers and wines, it still kind of succeeds as a casual bar for those who don't want to go to the other fancy, trendy bars in SoHo filled with Wall St. types. A good place to just get a drink with friends before heading off to crazier things later in the night.",,1,

159,John H.,"New York, NY",55,49,0,3.0,4/26/2011,"I really like the concept and the interior is terrific.  The only issue I have with it is the pricing of the beers.  I realize that it is NYC, but $7 for a pint of beer is the low end...some of the beers on tap are $9 (imports).  There is too much competition in NYC for beers--maybe consider a happy hour price too.No TV!  Love it.  Food to come--good to hear.  Music--lots of great music from UK artists (At least last night).  And the staff was really engaging and friendly.I will be back, since they claim they will be rotating the beer selection and adding food.  Hopefully they will work on the pricing--it is just too tempting to hit Blind Tiger or even my beloved Pony Bar at the better prices.",,,

162,Matthew S.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,117,0,4.0,5/20/2013,"Exactly what I expect from an English Tavern, dark cozy atmosphere, large drink menu and good pub fare.   Went w/ a group of 7 and sat outside, it was a bit cold so they were nice enough to turn on the heat lamps for us.    Just about everyone ordered the Fish N Chips.  They give you a huge portion and it comes w/ steak fries.    I also ordered the Kobe Burger w/ shoestring fries so my wife and I could try different dishes.   While the burger was very good, the Fish N Chips stole the show.   The Alaskan fish was perfectly cooked and had a nice and flaky crust.   Tasted even better  when washed down w/ a Hofbrau Hefeweisen.    Prices are not cheap on drinks but they do have a solid selection (go to Red Lion across the street for cheap drinks and music) then head over here afterwords for a high quality drink and a nice causal meal",,,

Well, it was too red to be lobster. It was crawfish. Granted it tasted just OK but no one likes to be deceived especially when I had asked. You mine have on the menu as, ""crawfish benedict"". This is an old restaurant trick where they do the switch and bait. Just like when they say its crab but its imitation crab. Lobster bisque is really crawfish bisque.

181,Louis K.,"Washington, DC",0,7,1,2.0,5/25/2014,"We were wandering around the Village looking for a place to grab a late night drink when we found ourselves charmed by GMT'S outdoor patio. When we asked for a table for 2, the hostess told us to sit down anywhere we liked -- no mention that the patio would be closing at some point. It was a little before 11pm. We sat down and proceeded to wait for a waiter to acknowledge us for a good 15 minutes before one finally came by, only to ask us to move inside because they would be closing down the patio soon. I asked how soon; she said about 20 minutes. Since we were only planning to grab one drink each, I told her 20 minutes should be fine and we would be ready to head out by then. Of course, that was assuming we would get served pretty quickly... but once she finally gave us the drink menu, it took another 10 minutes before our orders were finally taken (by a different waiter). We probably should have left and gone to a different bar, but we were too tired to keep walking. But given the lack of service, we probably won't be back.",,,
