It's located in the relaxed UWS neighborhood and just has enough cinemas that it never feels too crazy and crowded.The best part about this cinema is hands down the seats. All leather and reclining seats and it's been well maintained. Another thing that makes this a winner are the restrooms. There's never been that dreaded long wait because there are more than enough cubicles, and.. it's always been clean! Keep it up!",,,
1,Wildary C.,"New York, NY",199,92,267,5.0,11/2/2018,"Simple and short and concise, BRIEF...This is the best AMC Theater in all NY. The staff is so polite and always friendly, they do as you please, if it's pertaining their job and quality of services.Only wish they addedd more movies, but it's not as big as others so I get it.Love this AMC, it is by far my Favorite one and closest to my home too.",2,1,2
2,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",19,338,213,2.0,8/23/2018,"Honestly leaning towards 1 star.I've always thought of this theater as the ""fancy"" AMC because it had reclining seats well before AMC recently began renovating many of their other Manhattan theaters with recliners (e.g. East Village, Kips Bay, 19th St.) And this theater charged a premium in their ticket prices because of it, so I never went to this theater. This week, I finally came here because it had a convenient showtime. I was surprisingly disappointed at how it looked worn and outdated even though it only seems to have been renovated 5 years ago. They only have 3 self-service kiosks that are old, unlike other AMC theaters.The concession employees are crabby, unknowledgeable, and had no interest in resolving issues. A senior woman who took orders shouted ""NEXT!"" at customers in line before the customer at her register even had a chance to put away their change/wallet and gather their food. When I used my AMC Stubs benefit, she either had no idea how to process the discount and just said it wasn't working and didn't want to honor the benefit. I had to push her to get help and even the guy she asked didn't want to be bothered. I had to keep asking them to honor the benefit and he finally did a workaround.Even the customers are shady and rude. A senior man was in my assigned seat and he lied about having a ticket for that seat but didn't produce one. Because he's elderly, I let him sit there and gave him a heads up that he'd have to move if someone has the seat I took. When it was 45 minutes into the movie, a customer showed up and was nasty and loud about her seat and someone shushed her. Just made an unsatisfactory experience even worse.Even though other AMC theaters now have recliners, this theater still charges a higher ticket price than those other AMCs. They have no other special amenities here to warrant the higher prices. Definitely won't be coming here again.",3,,

Updated review","I have been to this location a number of times, and it never disappoints. I love it... and now they have chicken and waffles!! Like they legit bringing up the standard... first the reclining red seats and now chicken and waffles!? What's next!? I think soon I'm gonna be eating skirt steak, fries and a slurpee! Hahahaha! Always a great time here... keep it up!",3,2,1
5,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2314,302,983,5.0,2/19/2018,"I love this movie theater! Ever since I discovered it, I don't like going to any other ones unless they have reclining seats as well. The seats are sooo comfortable that I've taken my fair share of naps in them. I love that its reserved seating because it takes away from having to rush or make lines to get good seats. The facility is pretty big overall and the staff makes sure its always clean. It's easy to get tickets, but showings can sell out way in advance; I usually buy mine through Fandango just to be safe. Tickets can get a little expensive, especially if you're watching a 3D movie but its definitely worth it. It's also very accessible as its just a few blocks from the 1 train station (86th st & 79th st). Hopefully one day they can make it a dine-in theater but for now its as good as it gets.",2,,
6,Elaine K.,"New York, NY",2,23,104,3.0,10/14/2018,"This neighborhood theater is our favorite. Not only because it's within walking distance, but also because we can get reserved seats online. The seats are ultra comfortable and spacious,  and they are recliners. However, yesterday when we went to see ""A Star is Born"", Theater 5 was next to Theater 6 showing ""Goosebumps"". During parts of our movie, we could hear sounds from the movie next door - very distracting!  That's the problem of going to a multiplex - if the small theaters are not properly soundproof, then the enjoyment of your movie diminishes.",,,
7,Catherine T.,"New York, NY",1389,204,624,4.0,4/29/2018,This is my favorite movie theatre in NYC. Yes its because of the reclined seats. They also have a lot of yummy appetizers to enjoy while watching your movie. The tickets and seat arrangements are done online. Ive been coming here for years and I always have a great time. It's never really overcrowded (on the days ive gone). They should sell beer or wine.. just a thought :),6,4,5
8,Elvin B.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,1.0,11/4/2018,This is the worst amc I've ever been to. Worst customer service and this needs to be seen by the General Manager and District Manger. This is my preferred choice amc but I will never come back here and neither will my friends or family. I want to point out one very specific guy. He never wears a name tag and is always extremely rude to the customers and today I asked him what time does the theater open and he ignored me and cursed at me with profanity and I was with my child. he is very heavy and Hispanic with slight facial hair because he can't grow the whole thing approx 40 years of age and little to no hair. This is highly unexceptable and unprofessional. I can't believe AMC hires such uncivilized people to work for them. This is an embarrassment. If something isn't done about this issue soon because it's been too long I will take legal action and file misconduct with the NYS Labor department and improper work conduct and make sure this location gets shut down due to the dirty ness and rude disgusting behavior of the employees.,,,
9,Nick B.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",5,116,587,4.0,4/18/2018,This is a really big theater with a good variety of films. The place was under construction but besides that it looked clean and maintained. The employees I encountered were friendly. Food is overpriced just like any movie theater. The best thing about this place is the screen and seats. The seats recline to the point where you feel like you on the couch at home. And since there is so much space between rows you cannot hear anyone talk or be interrupted by anyone moving from their seats. Really good theater.,1,,

Recliner seats, $5 tickets on Tuesdays, and many more offers that are offered through becoming an AMC stubs member or a premium member. Would keep going here again and again! One downside is that it is that it can get crowded, so if you get there late then you will have to get seats in the front row. Other than that, I love this theater!",,,

Updated review","20 plus dollars for a ticket.  Went with three friends to a showing of Black Panther.  Of our assigned seats, two of them were broken.  Meaning they didn't recline, which is the whole point of this theater, and why the ticket price is so high.     --- We moved so we could all sit together and chose to sit two rows back.  Four seats together, this time one of them didn't recline.  So, I ended up having to sit in the next row over without the company of my friends.   Crappy.  for more than 20 bucks a ticket, the theater really ought to be cleaner and with functional seats.  the seats that are not functional could still be sold but at a lower rate.  VERY EASY FIX.",3,,1
18,Abigail R.,"New York, NY",2436,274,963,5.0,3/9/2018,"This movie theater is great. They have reclining seats tickets are about 19.99 for adults but you get you moneys worth. The movie theater is always clean there were no disruption during the movies. This is the only movie theater i go to i cant go back to looking for seats and the crowded scenes. This place has so much room and very comfortable cushion seats. I went to see black panther the screens are great they also have 3D if that s something you prefer. The food menu is also decent chicken fingers and curly fries are really good and the nachos. When you enter there's a small area to buy tickets with someone or at the machines or you can go online like i did to fandango if you don't want to go in early and risk it book in advanced. Definitely will continue to go here ""venom"" and Jurassic park is coming out so excited.",6,1,4

Still, when you see how comfortable the theatre is, you'll understand why they charge a little more. The seats are super spacious, cushiony, and recline completely for an ultra-luxe viewing experience. It felt like I was in my own living room!I will definitely be back.",3,1,1
20,Amber R.,"Manhattan, NY",26,76,145,4.0,6/16/2017,"Summary: nice big theatre that offers 3d movies and lay down recliners (lazy boy style). I will be back!Theatre: the bathrooms are only on the main floor. The screen and sound quality are very advanced, with 3d being very realistic. The 3d glasses were new and clean (and in the package). Seats are SO comfortable...They recline completely. We were upset because my girlfriends chair didn't recline and we had to lay on one chair together for the entire movie.Food: They do offer food....I Went without having dinner and they have hot junk food (chicken fingers, pizza, nachos) which did the trick to hold me over. They have your standard sodas, snacks and popcorn. Parking: can be very hard to find a spot If you're driving.",,,

This is the 2nd time I have seen a mouse here. The first time was a few months ago when I saw a very large mouse crawling around the upstairs lobby. When i saw one in the lobby, I immediately reported it to the people who worked there and they were very good about offering me a re-fund. I did not accept the re-fund at that time, I was simply telling them so they would know.  Tonight, I was so grossed out that I left immediatly and called the theatre to tell them. The person I spoke to said "" I'm sorry about that""  in a completely apathetic way and basically just couldn't wait to get off the phone.  He offered me NO refund even though I paid for a movie I did not see.  I am extremely disappointed in the way this theatre is obviously not managed, in the way they ignore the rodent problem they have, and in the way this situation was handled.  I only gave one star because zero stars is not an option.",,1,

If you live in NYC you have to go to this theater. I had one of the most comfortable movie going experiences ever! The theaters are large but the best part is that the seats recline. I'm going to repeat that: THE SEATS RECLINE!!! I had my popcorn in hand, my feet up and did not have to worry about having to stand up or squeeze my feet in if someone needed to get up and go to the restroom. The theatre is clean. The bathrooms are also clean. If you've ever been to a movie theatre in this city you know the bathroom is usually sketchy. That's not the case here. I will add that there could have been just 1 additional cashier at the concession stand just to make the line go by faster but I couldn't tell if this theatre always gets packed on a Thursday night. Either way there should be at least 3 registers open for 7/8pm shows. I will say if you live in Brooklyn or Queens this theatre is a bit of a hike especially since we do have some phenomenal theaters where we live but this place is an experience.

Admittedly, there is a nice theatre by our old neighborhood, Lincoln Center. But this theatre is slightly better because of the bright-red cushiony-leather fully-reclining chairs.You have to pay more per person (+$6) per ticket but its well worth it.I complained initially because the weekend trains turned our one-way commute to 120 minutes but who cares! You can to lie flat on your back while watching Chris Pine battle aliens. Amazing! There is (almost) no bad seats in the house. We bought tickets very late and sat on the 3rd row all the way to the right. I was thinking - oh great, we are going to have to crane our necks up for 2 hours but the seats were very comfortable! The far right seats felt like you were dead center. The theatre is very clean. We got there early, and they kicked us out to clean before our showing. I also like that this theatre allows you to pick your own seats ahead of time. Very useful when you are going with a group.",11,8,10

I liked that the chairs reclined and having the foot rest. I just wish the seats were wider. Only other one in the city where I've had a similar experience is at the city cinema by Bloomingdales, their seats are wider but the selection for movies is rather limited. I like that amc has more movies to offer. I found this place to be clean and the staff to be friendly. I don't mind walking up to this theatre for quality experience.

46,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,569,74,3.0,1/25/2017,"This theater averages out to a ""high 3"" for me. I've tried to have less equivocation in my life of late, so I'm rarely pining for a "".5"" rating, but if there was that option on Yelp, I'd give it a 3.5. There are some 5 qualities and some 2/3 qualities of this place.Let's start with the bad. The whole thing is kind of dumpy looking inside and could use a retrofit. There's only one bathroom in the entire facility. I suddenly remembered I needed to go to the bathroom right before my movie started and panicked when I saw this huge line at the bathroom because another film was getting out. Would I make it back? Would I miss key early plot exposition for the new Star Wars? (Thankfully, because studios are larding their films with 6-7 previews these days -- no joke -- this wasn't an issue.) Let's end with the good. The screens are big, and the seats are unreal. You can recline really far back, and put up a foot rest. They're puffy and extra comfortable. I suppose the only danger is falling asleep in a dark room in such a comfortable seat, which I'm prone to do. (In fact, I didn't take full advantage of the recline because I feared this!)In all, I'd go here again to see a movie. Side note: as many who have been on the Upper West Side know, denizens there often think of themselves in the cultural avant-garde, but it's strange theaters are a) pretty sparse in the area and b) not really that great, especially when it comes to foreign or art-house fare.",3,1,

When I mentioned it to someone they just said ""oh well that's been there since last showing.""No backup projectors? No replacing a clearly burned optic? No apologizing to patrons and telling them ""hey, we're sorry, the screen is really screwed up tonight, here's free popcorn/soda/ticket/etc,"" just show the movie like NOTHING IS WRONG!Attached are images of the screen.

50,ZenFoodster E.,"Manhattan, NY",1089,61,2060,1.0,3/21/2018,"Lodging a complaint against manager at AMC Broadway/84th st...A couple of weekends ago, we went there & were standing in the Premiere Members line @ concessions & noticed- along w/ 4 ppl in same line- that the regular line moved 10 ppl faster than ours. We were NOT first but last...meaning that 10 ppl & 2 rotations of the normal line later, the person in front of me was FINALLY called by a cashier. What was even more surprising was while all members in line were voicing their unhappiness, the manager who was standing @ cashier right in front of us overheard us & did nothing to fast track our line nor did he address or apologize to any of Us. Also, my brother who lined up 5 minutes later than me (when he saw our line hadn't advanced..with 1 person in front of me!) got to front of ""regular"" line & was served before me. At that point, I joined him & the cashier was too lazy to apply my Premier rewards savings to the transaction she already rung up. When I insisted, she asked the above-mentioned manager to help & neither one said sorry for wait or the mishap. Who on earth promoted this useless & lazy person as manager?!? He definitely doesn't deserve the title & the pay!! And everyone who worked there looked like they were serving a prison sentence..for life!It is really quite sad that -although this AMC site has reclining seats- the service & cleanliness are really not on par w/ other ones (eg Kips Bay). The restrooms were filthy &, most importantly, there was only one on the main floor so that if you're watching a movie on the lower level, you would have to run up 2-3 flights of stairs to the level above or wait for their ancient & slow elevator to take you upstairs. Although I'm an AMC movie-goer, this will not be one of my top picks in the future because of the shoddy customer service & dirty & inconvenient restrooms!",,,1

The best time to come is in the early mornings of course because there are far less people and the crowd tends to be quieter. I usually sip on my coffee and recline back in their nice plush movie seats. If you are sick of watching movies like your flying in coach with zero leg room, then you have to try this reclining chair theatre that has a good 3 feet of space between you and the next row. This location stays pretty clean and draws in a more ""refined"" crowd that tends to respect their fellow moviegoers more often than not with golden silence during the movies. I have been to theaters where people have taken the ""please turn off your cellphone and don't talk"" warnings as a light suggestion, and they ruined the whole movie! If you haven't already, sign up for the AMC premiere membership and you can skip any lines and get your snacks way faster with discounts and perks. It's only $15/year and totally worth it.

Updated review","Usually my experience coming to this theatre is seamless. Great movie, great snacks, great time. Not tonight. I don't know if they are having a staffing issue or what, but I would've stayed at home and spared myself the annoyance of this trip. I haven't even sat down in my $25 seat and I'm quite ready to go home. I'm waiting past the start time of the movie to enter the theatre and the place is filthy. Judging by the way the floor is covered with food and trash in the well lit rooms, I'm hesitant to sit in the dark theatre for a few hours. Plus, on the opening week of Black Panther, they are out of half the concessions on the menu. Whomever is in charge, please do better.",,,

58,Kwai L.,"Forest Hills, NY",270,260,556,5.0,8/9/2016,Our friends invited us to AMC 84th to see Star Trek Beyond in Digital 3D.  We hadn't heard anything about this theater before so we were surprised to walk in and see reclining leather couch chairs in a spaced apart theater with plenty of great angles to watch the screen.What a great idea!  Combine the leisure of your home and the full experience of the theater.  The space is well conditioned and the concession stand has some great selections including a Coca Cola machine that combines flavors for you and allows refills right outside the doors.,2,2,
59,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,7/5/2016,"The previous time I had been to the AMC 84th Street theater was in October 2009. I was a new resident of the Upper West Side, and an old roommate and I went to see ""Where The Wild Things Are"". At that time, this was a rather rank and depressing theater, reeking of mold and...goodness knows what else. The entire atmosphere was depressing, and it didn't help that I recall that movie being a bit of a buzzkill as well. Flash forward seven years, and I finally got to enjoy the renovation! I've known about it for a few years, but I usually end up seeing my movies at the Loews down at West 66th. My friends and I decided to treat ourselves to some reclining chairs! Though still a small theater, it has vastly improved since I last went. The theater as a whole is much cleaner, and the bathrooms aren't as scary as I last remember. (Ha!) The chairs are, indeed, rather comfortable, and I love that you can reserve your seats ahead of time. Admittedly, being able to kick back and recline while watching a movie as horrible as ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" almost made it worth it, even at $20 bucks a pop for seats. ;-) You pay a little more for some comfort and luxury, so I'll probably stick to seeing my films elsewhere, on the whole, but I was glad to finally see how well this renovation turned out!",2,1,1

However, it's been a fiasco. The lines for tickets were basically out of the door and there was no one trying to coordinate it. The woman that was booking my ticket kept answering the questions of others instead of mine and was very brief when I did have questions. In the theatre, almost half of the seats were double booked. Thus, most people basically had seats that didn't exist. After waiting for 45 minutes, they told us they wouldn't even be playing the movie. We had to negotiate with theatre staff to even get a refund. Ultimately, I really would suggest going to any other theatre in the city. The recliners are not worth the headache.

Unless, of course, the movie is popular. Then it is a race for the Front Row.The recliner seats are a gem. Hands down comfy! I've only fell asleep on a few-ish movies. But they deserved it! I mean c'mon 22 Jump Street?! After the renovation of this theater though, I feel that some attention should have went elsewhere. The food, for its price, is lackluster at best. The five dollar Big Bite hot dogs and the six dollar basic popcorn really needed a makeover. And depending upon the counter person, sometimes they ring up the combo prices, like everyone wants to spend 15 bucks for the barely warm stuff. The Men's Bathroom seems a tad small. If two movies let out at the same time, and, if you are like me in finishing your large soda, you are dancing and prancing for a ""me time"" spot. Could 'recycle' with the large cup, in a pinch, but, y'know.It is very easy to get to. Public Transportation, Uber friendly, and has a large Citi Bike station, on the side street. So depending on the date, one can be cool or way cool.Now a plus is having Five Napkins Burger spot across the street. It almost creates a nice dinner and movie vibe.

The pros: sitting in the front row is not an issue; obviously roomier; great for snuggling; and reserved seating means you won't have to arrive early to find good seats. This can also be a bad thing because you can't really come here on a whim. We tried,and all the seats were taken. That pretty much kills spontaneity. Also, you have to come in even numbered groups.

Updated review","This theater should have all previous reviews stricken from the record and be allowed to start from scratch since its renovation.Yes, the concession stand lines are still unbelievably slow, and yes a lot of the staff are out of it, but I have two words that should get this place a solid 5-star rating:RECLINING SEATSI no longer want to see movies anywhere else now that more of these types of AMC theaters are popping up (there's also one in Fresh Meadows, Queens, that's great too).They have reserved seating, which is both good and bad - good, because you don't have to worry about getting there early since you get exactly the seat you purchase ahead of time, and you can get there during the 20 minutes of trailers, but bad because you have to make sure to plan ahead for really crowded movies to make sure you can secure a good seat.These theaters also always have the self-serve soda machines, which is also great, and cuts down slightly on the infuriatingly slow concession stand lines.This is the best theater in the city now based solely on the strength of those ridiculously comfortable seats. Now we just need to get all those dingy AMCs across the city to get renovated too.",15,11,10
91,Beth M.,"New York, NY",94,12,15,4.0,12/26/2016,"Pros: Electric reclining, comfortable seats which you can reserve in advance! Decently clean theater & bathrooms. Fancy ""freestyle"" soda machine with 100+ different sodas which has free refills on every floor. Large screening rooms with very nice digital screens.Cons:A bit pricier than other theaters which don't have reclining seats you can reserve. Not a huge selection of movies--it is an AMC ""6"" after all. Movies are not announced for the week until Wednesday or Thursday which means if you want to see a movie on Friday or Saturday, you can't plan ahead.",,,
92,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1372,384,370,5.0,8/9/2013,"This theater has been renovated and it is FANTASTIC.First of all, you have assigned seats when you buy your tickets. This means you don't have to shop up early, or even on time and you will still get a good seat if you purchased one. That being said, there is not one bad seat in this theater. Each seat is a leather recliner with electronic recline, 2 full sized armrests, big cup-holders and a ton of floor space. Each seat can recline nearly flat. Even the very front row seats are comfortable to view the screen in as they recline all the way back.Because the seats are so big and spacious, the attendance is also lower, meaning they charge more per ticket. I think a ticket was $15 per person for a prime time seat, but it was totally worth it. With fewer people per theater, the concession stand lines are also much shorter, and because people can arrive at any time they want, there is almost no reason for you to have to wait in line, ever.The theater itself has only a limited number of theaters (6?) so the selection can be kind of slim, but they tend to get the big name movies.Right now, the only downside I see is that it is in the UWS and not Downtown, but it still gets 5 stars. Well done AMC.",3,,2
93,Krissy L.,"Bronx, NY",268,204,79,4.0,2/16/2016,"If it weren't for those luscious leather butt-hugging seats, this place would easily get a 2 in my books. It's not the cleanest, biggest, or well maintained theatre out there, but dear lord it's so comfy and every seat is a good seat. What sucks about this place is the lack of employees. There's probably one human usher, 4 of those electronic ticket thingies, and a small concession stand that's SUPER SLOW.On the upside of everything, this location is far from the touristy Times Square, and you can reserve your seats so you never have to stress about ending up with the front-row seats (which aren't super bad either). They also have those butter dispensers, which always has a special spot in my arteries. If you're not already an AMC member, do it. This theatre will become your new home away from home and those extra pennies you save on waived service fees (if you purchase online) or free size upgrades for popcorn and drinks will be well worth it.",7,6,7
94,Corey C.,"Astoria, NY",30,117,4,5.0,5/14/2016,"I went to an opening-night showing of a major blockbuster (Captain America: Civil War) and it was actually a pleasant experience! I have AMC 84th Street 6 to thank for this.I've been hesitant to go to the theaters on the opening weekend (or the weekend after) for bigger movies because it's typically a slog: you have to wait in a long line to even enter the theater, wait until you're let loose and then make a mad dash to find an appropriate number of seats, and then brace yourself for a packed room with a lot of noisy people. So if you want to see a newly released title, you have to endure longer waits and a more chaotic environment.AMC 84th Street 6 solves all of this. You buy your tickets ahead of time and reserve your seat. We ordered tickets just over a month in advance for a movie that ended up having the 5th biggest opening weekend, and we ended up with a great spot: the center of roughly the third row from the back. By the time we arrived at the theater our total time waiting on line was a grand total of 10 seconds (basically for my group lining up and waiting for the guy to tear off our ticket stubs).But wait, there's more! The seats are leather, reclineable, and are wide enough so you can move your arms and legs around in a snow-angel motion if you wanted to. Each seat also has its own set of armrests, so you don't have to worry about the social politics of claiming armrest territory. Phew. My only complaint - and it's a minor one - is that from where I was sitting if you recline back far enough, the seat in front of you blocks off a small portion of the bottom of the screen.Since seats are wider than normal, people are more widely distributed throughout the auditorium and hence fewer people can fit in it overall. The wide distribution and fewer people leads to less noise, even if the movie is sold out.Independent of cost, this is the best movie theater experience you can go for in the area. But factoring in cost, as the tickets ($20) were about $5 more expensive than nearby theaters I would recommend it most for busy times for a big-budget movie. If it doesn't fit both those criteria then feel free to consider more cost-conscious alternatives.In terms of how it compares to other reserved theaters I've been to: it's basically the same as the AMC Fresh Meadows 7, and both of these AMC's are better than Bow Tie Cinemas in Chelsea. While Bow Tie doesn't have that obstructed visibility, the seats are relatively slightly narrower and do not recline.",1,,1

So glad I found this place that I consider better than the ones am used to!  Here's why this place deserves a 5-star.* Large power recliner seats that are well spaced out. Generous space between rows.  * Reserved seating, so suggest booking the tickets online. Buy using AMC stubs to waive off the $3 convenience fee.* Matinee shows (even on a weekend) here are just $8.50.* The armrest between 2 adjacent seats can be folded up if you plan on getting cosy with your date. So, perfect for a movie-date! It's like watching a movie with your partner on a sofa bed at home, but on a bigger, better screen.* The vending machine here has 100+ drink options!  It's apparently called the 'coca-cola freestyle' and the only such machine in Manhattan. Did you know flavors like Coca-cola lime,  Fanta lime, Grape Ginger-ale, etc exist?!* Although refills are usually only for large cups, there's surprisingly nobody to keep a check on the refills.* Just 2 blocks away from the 86th subway station.Service, both at the entrance and the food counters are fast.  Another tip not specific to this theater is to use visa signature cards to buy Fandango bucks at a discounted rate.",3,1,3

103,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",563,92,600,4.0,10/11/2015,"This AMC is the best for one reason: the seats. Unlike most theaters with fold-out seats and narrow aisles, the 84th St AMC has a bunch of reclining couches. The fold-out leg rest forces them to keep a ton of space in between rows -- no more tripping over your neighbors to get in. Those who still remember high school geometry know that this also means they can reduce the slope of the floor. All the seats are at roughly the same level -- so sitting in the first or last row doesn't mean your neck will hurt the next day. Ticketing is fast as long as you buy online. There's a short line to get past the ticket scanner, but it moves quickly. The non-theater parts of this AMC feel kind of run down. I wouldn't mind if they were a bit more aggressive about vacuuming the carpets. (Not like it matters: you're there for the movie, after all.)",3,2,3

112,Sim L.,"New York, NY",409,134,417,4.0,5/26/2014,"Normally, if I pay for a movie (instead of downloading it) I go for the IMAX experience at Lincoln Sq with a three story screen and reserved seating. A few months ago one of my friends took me to Menlo Park, and that was certainly a nice experience with their big recliners and people who serve you food & drinks. I wouldn't want to drive to NJ for a flick though, and now I really don't have to.I stopped by around noon to redeem some Gold passes for X-Men and, to my delight, I found out that this theater has reserved seating just like the IMAX at Lincoln Sq. That's perfect since I don't like waiting in lines or searching for seats. My worry though was that the seats I reserved weren't going to provide a good view, but, unlike Lincoln Sq's super IMAX, you really can't go wrong with any of the seats here unless it's the front row. So since the screen rooms here completely decimate Lincoln Sq's IMAX room. Let's compare this to Menlo Park. Food: Menlo serves food and 84th st doesn't but the food at Menlo is similar to diner food or Applebees, which means if you go to the 5 Napkin Burger across the street from 84th St or any of the restaurants on Amsterdam/Columbus, then you'll eat something much better.Drinks: Menlo serves you whatever you'd like to imbibe, whereas you'd have to plan ahead and bring something to 84th st. Menlo obviously has a clear advantage but I did enjoy my Honey Jack at 84th st so...Seating: The recliners are almost identical in their size and that you can lift the armrest out of the way. The only difference is that 84th St is motorized and pretty much turns into a bed. Bring a blanket and you'll likely fall asleep. The only bad thing about this is that since the chairs recline so much there may be less room to walk depending on how tall someone is and how far they're reclined. Menlo & Essex don't have this issue.The other thing is that Menlo and most other theaters are much bigger than 84th  St. 84th only has 1 ticket counter inside, which is right next to the snack counter. Bathrooms are on the main level but there weren't any upstairs. There's also a downstairs but I have no clue what's down there. Most likely the few screens here funnel everyone to the 1 snack bar and bathroom.Oh, there was tons of parking at night, but when I went there in the afternoon to get the tickets I had to leave the car by a hydrant. So, with all that said, there's basically no reason for me to visit any other theater in Manhattan anymore...until someone makes an IMAX theater with motorized recliners.",7,,
113,Marika C.,"Manhattan, NY",85,162,56,5.0,11/30/2015,I never want to see a movie any other way. Great location two blocks from the subway stop at 86th.

The reclining seats were amazing. It was the most comfortable I have ever been in a theather. There is a button that lowers the foot rest up and down. Reserved seating is also a must for me nowadays. I just do not want to show up early for a movie. The $1.50 convenience fee on Fandango to select and reserve my seat ahead of time is money well spent. In addition, the morning showing was $8.50 ($10 after the convenience fee) and cheaper than every other theater I was looking at going to see the movie.AMC Lincoln Square 13 is still my favorite place to watch a movie in IMAX.

For being an AMC, I was blown away the first time I went because the chairs are giant comfortable lounge chairs, there is a ton of space (unlike everywhere else in NY) and even front row seats tend to be pretty decent. This is generally the only chain theatre I will go to in NY.The chairs recline super far, and you can actually lift up the arm rest between every two-set of chairs, which makes for some awesome movie-cuddle business.Pro-tip: Tickets are not cheap (anywhere in NYC), but a lot of universities, employers, and even Costco, offer AMC gold tickets, which are usually between 8-10 dollars, and are redeemable for a movie ticket at this theatre (instead of the $25-$30 you might pay per ticket otherwise).",6,,1

Updated review","Well, damn.Nice job AMC...you found a way to take a terrible movie theater and make it one of the best places to catch a film in New York City. Not only can you make reservations ahead of time online and pick your seats, but they offer huge, electrically powered recliners that make it the next best thing to watching a movie in your living room. It's the perfect date movie theater. The center arm rest lifts up and you have one nice love seat! There's not a bad seat in the house, the sound/picture quality is top-notch, they have great food offerings and the drink machine is the best in NYC. And free refills? on all levels of the theater?

The cleanliness of the place is very good.The only cons are;*the long waits on the food & beverage line (but it varies on the days and time you go). *super limited options for show times (movie shows).*it's a few more extra bucks from a regular movie ticket but, it's worth it.

(Warning to those who easily fall asleep at Movie theatres, this theatre is not for you lol). I am not sure if seating such as these are available anywhere else in the city but I've heard a rumor that all Lowes theatres plan to renovate and upgrade to this particular style of ""recline"" seating, nevertheless it is was my first experience such as this in NYC.We were in the 3rd before the front and the viewing was excellent... it seemed that there are no bad seats in the house... this is how this movie theatre is designed (unless your super picky and prefer a specific row).The Sound system was excellent which made the movie experience even more enjoyable.They have a variety of food menu options available for purchase, menu options include anything from Chicken fingers to Pop Corn.... perfect for those of you who like to Feast (I mean snack) while enjoying a good movie in comfy reclining seats.Yes this is not the best movie theatre in NYC but the first movie theatre with reclining seats (that I know of) in NYC.Tip: You can purchase advanced tickets and RSVP your seat & row in advance.",8,1,6

AMC has officially spoiled me for all others. I only wish the screen was bigger for the amount of seating. If you don't get something in the middle, you will be taken out of the experience a bit. I have yet to be in the IMAX theater, where that may be less of an issue. This type of personalized seating comfort might... just might get people back into the theater. All AMC needs to do to make it absolutely perfect is to enforce their own policy against talking and cell phone use.

I would recommend purchasing your tickets online ahead of time so you have your choice of seating.Get your tickets at Costco if you are a member and only pay around 8 dollars a piece vs 18!!!!",5,2,1

152,Lucinda H.,"ASTORIA, NY",159,47,7,3.0,12/21/2014,I love the convenience of reserving our seat ahead of time and the pick your flavor coke machines. My only main gripe is that seats only go on sale a few days in advance which makes planning ahead somewhat uncertain.Also the bathrooms here are very small and not proportionate to the number of people who are normally here.Overall I would recommend this theater for overall cleanliness and comfort. And the staff has always been polite/accommodating.,2,2,1

156,David G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,78,0,4.0,9/18/2016,Lovely theatre and great staff! One serious caveat - the seats do not have flip-up armrests AND each armrest has a cupholder at the end of it. You know who you are if this effects you. :-),,,

158,Mark L.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,22,0,5.0,6/17/2015,"So I went to this theater for the first time with my lady the other day. I'm impressed.Assigned seating is absolutely genius. The red leather seats are comfy, and the recline function works well. Lay back a little bit or a lot, as much as your hearts content. You can lift up the arm rest and get nice and cozy with your loved one too. This movie theater is best for an intimate date, not so much a large gathering with friends, but that's just the way I see it. The price of a ticket here is definitely higher than average, but it's definitely worth the price of admission. The only potential issue is that the movie selection here is small, and it looks like it only keeps the money making big hits. That said, I'm totally in love with this movie theater.",,,
159,Pual D.,"New York, NY",13,30,49,5.0,5/9/2015,Seats where perfect. Movie quality was great popcorn was good also and having a soda machine right outside the theater was very convenient. The seats where the standout about this theater though because they like lazy boys. And to control them they had a modern switch that was pretty accurate,,,

AWESOME!!Came to see dawn of the apes, awesome time, seats where great(little weird to move during movie as they make fart noises) but was Awesome.Got the chicken fingers combo with curly fries and cheese sauce, DELICIOUS my go to meal from now on.Just bought tickets today to see hercules this saturday.MY GO TO THEATER FROM NOW ON!!",3,3,

You get what you pay for though because the theatre is comfortable clean and updated. It just gets reallllllly busy, with all the money they make off 6$ small popcorns they should expand the lobby area due to the high capacity of people coming to get their tickets and the people ordering food its just a mad house.",,,

Lazy boy style seating and well maintained. Don't try and buy tix at the theatre though. Usually good showings are all sold out. Plan ahead and buy online! That's my only complaint, because sometimes I decide last minute I feel like a movie and I'm outta luck. Oh well.",2,,
167,Michael W.,"New York, NY",741,1013,236,5.0,6/15/2014,"Before you even consider watching a movie anywhere else aside from this AMC, please stop yourself. This theater is, hands down, the best theater in Manhattan. No matter if you live in the LES or right around the corner, this place is worth a 30 second or 30 minute trek. Like every other review of this place, what puts this place 10 notches above every other theater is that they have automatic reclining chairs. These aren't your regular cloth chairs that rock. These are ""leather-esque"" lazy boys that recline with a push of a button. I cannot say how mind blown I was when I got in here and saw these amazing chars. They're wide, there is plenty of leg room and walk space between each row, and dare I even say that these seats are more comfortable than my bed?Price-wise, after your Fandango fees, each ticket comes to right around $20. That's not even that bad considering the fact that aside from their amazing seats, you also have assigned seats. What that means, is that you can forget coming to the theater 45 minutes early on opening night. What you can do is show up 5 minutes before, stroll into the theater, and go right up to the seats that you have reserved. If you can manage to think of a theater in the city that can give you a better experience, then by all means please go there. However, I don't think that that kind of place exists. Hence AMC Loews on 84th St. is the place to be. The seats are amazing, you can select your seats when you buy your ticket online, and the price per ticket is more than reasonable. Because of this place, I don't think I can ever watch a movie at any other theater.",3,2,3
168,Vivian S.,"Manhattan, NY",251,247,288,4.0,3/16/2016,"I really enjoying visiting this AMC! I love that you can pre-select your seats for a non-rushed relaxed movie experience. If you plan in advance, you can get some really great seats, but even if you are on the first or second row, it doesn't feel uncomfortable or like you're too close to the screen. The reclining chairs are super comfy and spacious. I like that you do not feel super close to the person next to you, especially if you're by yourself. There are many eating options around the theater, my preference is 5 Napkins - which is right across the street. The theater also has good food options: nachos, popcorn, and hotdogs...typical theater food. It is also located steps away from the 1 & 2 trains. Fun times here! I recommend you visit if you can.",,,

172,Muhammad A.,"Bronx, NY",43,15,5,5.0,3/21/2016,My second most favorite theater in NYC after AMC at Lincoln Square.  You cannot get enough of those cozy recliner seats they have.

174,Ricky O.,"Churchville, PA",0,16,0,4.0,11/10/2014,"The reclining seats and assigned seating making this theater a real treat. I love the smaller theater size. Do plan on purchasing your tickets early if you can. If you go last minute, you'll more than likely be stuck in the first three rows. My only complaint is that, if you sit near the back, you can hear the advertisements or trailers they play in the lobby during the quiet parts of the film, which is annoying. It would be great if that could get rectified, but overall it's a really enjoyable experience.",1,1,
175,Nicole H.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",72,128,54,5.0,5/27/2014,"This is an amazing theater. All of the seats are RECLINERS, so not only do you have much more comfortable seats and the ability to stretch out, but in order to allow for the recliners to extend, there is a ridiculous amount of room between the rows, allowing you to walk to your seat without stepping on feet or falling into someone's lap.Additionally, all of the seating is reserved, meaning that if you purchase your ticket online ahead of time, you don't have to show up an hour before the opening of a big summer blockbuster to ensure that your group gets to sit together somewhere other than the very first row.Now, yes, you're going to pay a couple more bucks for all this comfort and convenience, but in my mind, it's worth it. And these days you're shelling out $15 per person on a movie ticket regardless of where you go, so you may as well go $16.50 and get a reserved recliner.This is the only place to go if you're seeing a movie in NYC.",2,,2
176,Josmanuel A.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",143,124,763,5.0,7/19/2014,Best movie theater in NYC.. The seats are great. The atmosphere is awesome. The early movies are 8.50. The seats recline and are comfortable ..,1,,2
177,Jason E.,"New York, NY",0,29,0,4.0,12/19/2015,"It's not really fair to other theaters, when you think about it. It's not just that they have leather chairs that recline, but they are set up almost like love seats, so that if you're a couple going, you can snuggle while watching a movie (says the guy without an SO, but that's not the point). I work freelance and see big movies here during the day. I live uptown so this kicks the snot out of going to Times Square. The 3D here is top notch. I've seen ""Mad Max"",""Jurassic World"", and a couple of other big block busters here. A great experience, regardless of the quality of the actual film. Also, with the way the chairs are set up, it's not as easy to see pesky cell phone screens that some people can't resist looking at during the movie. And Reserved Seating?!? Need I say more? Thought not.",,,1
178,Amy W.,"Edison, NJ",19,25,0,4.0,9/8/2014,"The seating in this theatre is designed for some serious mid-movie snuggling. Literally reclining leather couches.  Downside, sometimes people get a little carried away - I know it feels like you're alone in your living room watching a movie with your boo, but in fact, you are sitting only a few feet away from me and my friend, so please keep your belt buckled. But damn, these seats are comfy. Can't even complain.Sure, ticket prices are astronomical, and the assigned seating is annoying (though ultimately pragmatic and necessary)... but, the seats.

180,Jamie D.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2,4,0,4.0,11/12/2015,"I liked the theatre and the reclined seats. Best seats (I think) are between rows D and F, seats 8-12. I like the kinda date night feeling of the seat groupings - each is a pair where the middle armrest goes up, and you can cozy with your lovey. The screen is nice and the acoustics are great. So great in fact, that when I saw James Bond a few days ago, I could hear the dude behind me snoring sonorously (from beginning to end credits) even when I moved to some empty seats several rows in front of me (I could actually hear it better).Though it costs more than other theatres, I like going there. However, the floors inside and just outside of the toilets are...sticky. Even two minutes after a mop. Sticky floors are not pleasant.",1,,

183,C T.,"New York, NY",2,24,0,4.0,2/27/2016,"The reclining seats are awesome! This place originally converted me to a reclining seat movie junkie. The one problem with their seating is that it's set up in twos. This is awesome for a date but can be kind of awkward if you are trying to see a movie in a group of 3. In addition to the usual sadness that accompanies being a third wheel, a third wheel is stuck in a seat potentially next to a stranger if the movie theater is full.This theater is a great set up for a romantic date, but maybe check out if the same movie is playing at City Cinemas on E 59th street if you're with an odd numbered group of friends---same reclining seats, but seats in standard rows instead of twos.",,,
184,Jennifer R.,"Bronx, NY",9,51,0,4.0,1/4/2016,"Before I proceed with my review of this theater, allow me to share that I am a bigger fan of classic movie house (like Music Box in Chicago), but this theater is full of all that a modern theater should have.  So why a 4:5 and not a solid rating?  Well, the architecture is terrible and the stairs/escalators can get a bit bottle necked when it's busy in there.  Also don't love having to run down stairs to use the restroom mid-show.  I've seen ""Terminator: Genesys"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and both made the movie experience perfect; screen is big enough but not too big (like IMAX can be), sound is phenomenal but not overwhelming (like stadiums can be), and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxing.",,,

CHECK.Decent popcorn? Meh.Definitely the best movie theater I've ever been to (other than the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, TX). Seats full on recline and the arm rest goes up. Plenty of room for even the largest of people. The theater itself is very well maintained, even on the busiest of nights. The bathroom has yet to skeeve me out...and I haven't sat on melted candy as of yet. The fact that I can reserve where I'm sitting - even with a huge group of people - is a HUGE draw for me. No need to worry about not being able to sit together or having to get there 20 minutes before the coming attractions even begin. Why don't all theaters have this neat feature?

Updated review","Still fantastic theater and I wish there were more of these type of theaters with large reclining seats that you can reserve ahead of time. It is so civilized. But I have an issue with the theater planning. On Monday (a holiday), they had 4 movies starting within 15 minutes of each other. One ticket taker and 2 people at the concessions. The lines just to get into the theater were ridiculous and the concession lines were practically out the door. Fix the scheduling AMC 84th St. and please clean up after yourselves, our movie started late because it took a long time for the staff to clean up from the show before.",,,
