Who would have known that right on the outside of china town would be a livley hopping tropical bar?As I sat to enjoy happy hour, I couldnt happen to realize a hopping disco bar in the back. I really have to say that this was by far the most interesting places ive found happy hour at sence I have been in nyc. Happy hour drinks were $5 mixed drinks and $3 wells. They had a frozen margarita machine and I got a taco for like $3 and fries! Just one taco came on my platter. It was alittle on the spicy side. I had a sex on the beach too which was amazing. Overall, it was an intresting expirence and I will be back to try the dance area when I have time at night!",1,,2

2,Aaron R.,"New York, NY",239,13,37,4.0,8/31/2018,"Walking into the bar, I wasn't sure what I was going to get myself into. I walked in and I heard Blackpink's ""DDU-DU DDU-DU"" playing through the speakers and I knew I was sold on the place. Under a mix of KPop, Top 40, etc, I went to the front of the bar. I went during happy hour and got a Heineken draft for $3. While the atmosphere was fun, sometimes it was a little hard to talk to the person next to you. On one side, there's a bunch of aquariums and water areas full of various types of fish. On the other side in the front corner is a grill. I'm not in this area too often but if I had the chance to be there again I would like to visit again to get a better feel for the place and try some of the food from the grill.",1,1,1

I knew I wasn't being crazy about this place, when every single person in my group said, ""Nah. Let's not go back.""Let start with the good. The decor is cute. It's Tiki-ish. Rainforest. It's Otto's Shrunken Head meets Congee Village. Happy Hour is a good decent price. Afterwards, the prices sky rocket. I went on an empty Sunday. Two beers were 15 dollars. We booked it out of there fast.I think they book on you staying there after HH because you have a tab open and you're too drunk to realize they're over charging you.",,,
4,Erica K.,"Livingston, NJ",11,86,120,5.0,10/6/2018,"I think this may be a gay bar? I'm not sure. Either way, I had a great time here. I got a free drink just by checkout my in on Yelp, so you could try it! The bar is in the center, and there are tables and a dance floor in the back. The DJ area is slightly raised up on a stage, so that's fun. the front of the bar had standing tables and is a bit quieter. My favorite thing.. FISHTANK! Statin. at fishies swimming around after a few drinks is amazing! I would definetly recommend coming here for a fun night or planning a party/celebration here.",,,

The music is great with a broad range from throwbacks like biggie and tlc to hip hop to top 40. Crowd varies (as in ny) but generally good vibes in this place. I've seen birthday parties, motley crews, pool playing finessers, and more dance moves busted here then elsewhere.Generally 20's, 30's but not the fratty feel of other bars in LES. Drinks are standard/ cheap (around 10-12$ standard well) and have decent beer selection w classic like blue moon bud light and some trendier local offers.Hit it up for games of pool, video games, a bar, and a dance floor with a generally banging dj",1,,2

7,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",331,105,2516,4.0,3/27/2018,Stumbled upon this place while wondering around town Friday night. Came in around 9pm and there was no cover. Inside it is nicely decored with fake frees to the roof and there was a fish tank. Felt like a tiki bar but more just a tropical bar hence the name I guess. Few tables in the front for sitting and grabbing tacos and fries if you wanted to eat something as well. Large bar area in the middle and some floor space for dancing. There is also a billiard section in the back. People were definitely playing pool. I liked the DJ's music but it was still early so no one was really dancing and it wasn't crowded at all. Over all a very fun atmosphere and wonder how crazy it gets when there's a crowd feeling like dancing.,,,
8,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,988,6100,3.0,11/23/2017,"I happen to be in the area & needed to kill sometime we took a quick look on yelp & noticed this place, we figured why not give it a try. Tropical paradise in the middle of china town? Sure why not!! This place looks like something u find when u get lost on vacation little bit of everything with  enough to entertain. U got the bars on each sides, I've heard they have karaoke then there's pool tables & enough open space where u can dance. We sat in the front area, drinks it was still happy hour which was good, mix drinks, piña colada & beer go for $5 & $3 certainly not bad. First I had a Heineken beer would have been great but warm beer really upsets me, I switched to the Piña colada since my friend said it was great & she was correct nice & frozen very tasty & good amount of alcohol decent choice. Checking in through yelp gets u a free buy back unfortunately we couldn't grab another Piña colada boooo, got stuck with a Rum & coke ahh this was basically coke but oh well. Interesting crowd here very mixed, great music playing this was a nice find will for sure keep in mind for future visits.",12,3,4
9,Evan J.,"Austin, TX",97,173,15,1.0,11/17/2017,"It has 4 pool tables (but they're all unmaintained and the felt is in bad shape.) Overall I was really dissatisfied with this place. They claimed to have no flavored liquors and when asked if they had a drink menu -- since they're a tiki bar, you think they had some tiki drinks -- they said no. 5 minutes later some girls came up to the bar and asked for a menu and the bartender gave them one. Like wtf?Don't waste your time and money. Go somewhere else.",1,,
10,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1398,568,597,4.0,7/13/2017,"Honestly, truly good times...Not too much to say but I came here for a night out and had a great time. I honestly thought that this was the place where I was going to start my night pregaming and move on from there. Instead I ended up staying all night literally till close. What got me staying put was the music. The music was so good it was right on the money. The variety of songs played was the perfect combination to please the entire crowd and this place was packed. The only thing I would say beware of is that it does get super hot in here. Other than that if you want to dance the night away without the hassle of doormen and cover charges this is a great spot to do so. They also have pool tables in the back if dancing isn't your thing! I definitely recommend!",8,4,6

13,Nick M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,160,390,4.0,5/25/2017,"So here's the deal, Tropical 128 is a dive bar. And it's tropical island themed. I am rating Tropical 128 on being a island themed dive bar and it totally excels at that. I'm going to repeat that, as it bares repeating: Tropical 128 gets 4 stars at being a island themed dive bar. If you are looking for something else, like a wine bar, or whiskey lounge, look elsewhere. Loud music, cheap drinks, good seating, a dance floor in the back, dim lights, it has it all. I mean, really what else are you looking for in a good dive? We did two rounds, had some laughs and avoided the food for a feast a few blocks away in Chinatown. However, from what I saw passing by me, I'm sure the food is tasty and suits this spot perfectly.A fun way to start the night, spend it, or finish it. If you're in the area, stop by Tropical 128.",2,1,3

There are tall tables throughout so you always have a place to stand with your beer. And speaking of beer, there aren't many places that have both a Sam Adams and a Blue Moon on tap for $3 a pop. The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. There's also pool in the back, but personally it seemed a bit overpriced to me. That's the trade off you get with such cheap drinks though.

There's also only two tables, so a decent sized party could occupy it completely. The arcade in the backroom near the pool tables seems to be in sorry shape. The skee ball machine was broken on our last visit. The staff is pretty friendly, but it took them a little longer to get to us.

23,John M.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,216,83,1.0,4/30/2016,"New management has ruined what was great about Tropical 128 in the past. It was a divey place, where whiskey met Rainforest Cafe with a couple pool tables in the back and an always welcoming dance floor. Cheap drinks, a fun crowd, and decent DJs made it a fun place to come. Now cocktails are $10+, the pool tables get covered in tarps by 10pm on a Saturday, the credit card minimum is $30, and menus for bottle service are on tables with options from $200-300. There is clearly a cash grab going in here without actually improving the quality of the environment, drinks, or food. Whatever was good, weird, and great about Tropical 128 is now ruined by an increase in prices and an influx of yuppie clientele. And to top if off, we had made a reservation for a birthday party at 9pm and after 8 of us were drinking for several hours, we were informed at 10:58pm we had to leave our table unless we were buying bottle service because it's bottle only for a table after 11pm.

26,Anderson C.,"Queens, NY",1076,656,866,3.0,1/30/2015,"The bouncers to this place (Saturdays) are pretty nice.  Especially the black dude.  But being nice doesn't mean letting you slide in.  Don't be THAT guy/girl.  Still for NYC standards I'd consider it cordial.This place is like a bunch of things mixed into one.  It LOOKS like a theme restaurant from the outside.  You walk in and see fish tanks tables for sit down (more like club tables).  There are bars on both sides of the main floor (lounge-y feel).  Then you walk all the way in the back and it's billiards galore.  I mean, I guess if you're bored with dancing or ogling at hot girls or both, you won't be hard pressed to find other means of entertainment.   You go downstairs and it's another bar with a definitely lounge like feel.  I'm not sure if the music upstairs is the same as the music downstairs because they weren't open at the same time due to some kid's birthday being there.  BUT I'm curious to find that out on the next trip here.The clientele here RANGES.  I mean REALLY ranges.  On on hand you got people who are clearly starting out in college in here.  And when I said clearly starting out in college I simply mean just turned 21.  Then you got those in betweeners quite possibly just out of college looking for a good time with still in college chicks.  Then you got people here on their birthdays celebrating which could go either way.  Then you got people like me who are just chilling but are with friends or a smaller group.  Then you got solo dolo people's that are just taking in the vibe.  You add these all up and you get a smorgasbord of people.When this place gets packed it gets PACKED.  I can't recalled how many buttcheeks and fronts I rubbed by every time that I needed to re-up on a drink or going to the billiards area or just trying now to rub cheeks.  Some accidentally cheek rubbings were hot chicks which was okay I guess.  But then a lot were of other men and just other people that I'm not quite sure where their pants have been this evening.I did 2 full laundry loads that night to rectify that.  Ew.Did I have a great time?  Yup, my homie were sporting me drinks and the company was cool.Would I come back?  Yup, but I will bubble wrap myself...at least the jacket area and maybe the crotch side of my jeans.FAN.",3,7,1

28,Cait M.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,103,30,5.0,1/4/2016,This place is so dope! The new owners have done a stellar job of revamping since the summer of 2015 when they took it over. They have an awesome bar menu now with amazing food which includes everything from oysters to your juicy burgers. This place is live on the weekends and I mean live. The line is known to wrap around the block but it moves quick. There's never a cover and it's far from a pretentious crowd. The bartenders are so on point here as well. Solid crew until the wee hours and the music is always fire w some of NYC's best and well known dj's. Spotted Alexander Wang one weekend and Zoe Kravitz another. This place is blowing up. Def recommend!,1,,1

It lacked consistency in its jams (perhaps trying to please all the masses?) and, most notably, did not offer piña coladas despite being a tropical-themed establishment. If you look and are 33 but feel 18 inside and want to bust a move while drinking $11 heavily-tequila-d frozen margaritas and $8 bottles of Heineken and vibing to music so loud you can't hear the people around you, then perhaps this is a place you would like to frequent. We, however, will not be back. (Came here as part of a birthday celebration-I promise we're fun, but this was not our kind of fun.)I was going to give a third star exclusively for the odd chains and caribiners hanging from the ceiling (Do people come here harnessed?!?), but then I remembered that there were no piña coladas.",1,2,

I went on a Friday night with a bunch of friends up in NY for a weekend kegger. This place was a good springboard into the weekend. The music was solid and they have pool tables in the back. It was far from packed though and I think my group did a good job of keeping the place pretty live. The draft beer selection is pretty dismal though so if you like a solid craft brew this really isn't the place for that. The drinks prices weren't horrible but I was paying 6 bucks for a Sam Adams summer ale so,,,the jury is out on that.

Mind you, my friend is a young male who was fully clothed from head to toe, but was wearing six inch platform boots. This bouncer denied entry to someone solely because of his choice to express himself (my friend was completely sober, quiet, and well-mannered). There is absolutely no dress code for this grimy dive bar, and this sad man was clearly acting on his own homophobic thoughts that were triggered because of some damn shoes?

Koi fish, plants, ""cajun"" food (it's not), and really crappy beers on tap. In the back, there is another bar with even crappier beers and a ""dance floor"". It also smells like urine. Finally, even further in the back is what I like to call mafia alley. Pool tables and some bar games, really sketchy asian guys playing pool and leering at girls. Not a lot of people.

Friendly bouncer, though bartenders are not exactly the most experienced on mixing drinks.. Yes they do the job, but not I can tell that it is probably their first bar job. A mojito is $10, beer is fairly cheaper. With BOGO, drinks end up to be a fiver, which is alright I guess.The interior deco is tacky hipster (in a good way)- fish tank, palm tree, wood benches, big rocks, pool tables and jukebox machine, this place is fun to chill with a few friends, and just sit for a bit before heading out to a club or so. In conclusion, decent, fairly priced and good to hang around at before hitting a real club.

44,Monique M.,"Queens, NY",198,218,837,3.0,1/15/2016,"Came here Thursday evening as part of a meet-up event for a group of 8 ladies. The place has a unique tropical/aquatic décor, but the music is bad and it's too dark. There are a few tables in the front of the establishment and smaller sized tables toward the back. There are also pool tables in the far back. The bar is shaped like a 360 degree circle, so you can order from either the front or back of the restaurant, depending on where you are. We ordered a variety of appetizers, mine being french fries and spring rolls. Everyone else had wings and calamari. I did not like the spring rolls. On their website, it states that the rolls are vegetarian, perfect for someone like me on a modified fast. But the rolls I received were filled with a mix of crab and shrimp wrapped in a brown crispy stringy wrap; I have no idea what it was but it wasn't the typical spring roll I was used to and I felt sick afterwards. The fries were good and crispy, just like I would expect. It seems they do a lot of fresh seafood and sushi along with burgers and wings. Drinks were good but we were told servers don't come until 11PM, so you have to go to the bar and order your drinks. Lastly, the music. The music was bad and too loud for a place that seems to be a bar to socialize. I could barely hear the people in my group speaking, I just kept nodding and smiling like a crazy person. I read other reviews that mentioned dancing, none of that was going on. The music was a mix of underground hip-hop and pop. Overall, it's a nice place for drinks and small appetizers, but I don't think I'll be returning. I would recommend anyone in the area try it out though.",,,

But they were a bit unorganized for New Years Eve. I honestly expected things to run smooth given they might have anticipated a crowd. Bartenders was setting up while party goers are coming in and ready to start drinking. When they finally got things going the drinks weren't up to par at all, taste so watered down. Oh and lets discuss the music or lack of... When the speakers worked it was awesome. But they the speakers would go out for a while and they spent most of the night trying to fix it. Everything was up and around again by 11pm. It kept the vibe going until about 12:30 and bam off it goes again!!! So my friends and I left!!!Geez I hope its not like this all the time...",,,

47,Ashley P.,"New York, NY",0,11,6,1.0,7/28/2017,"This place was awful and the bartender was even worse! Her service couldn't even be considered service. I guess she doesn't like working here? Asked form a drink menu and she said she didn't have one when I could see it behind her on the counter. I'm supposing she did this to avoid charging us the right price, then laughed when we said we needed a minute to decide what we want then and showed us the ""full"" bar and to just pick something. I'm not sure who speaks to patrons like this. She made a drink for us and took sips out of the shaker cup! Can you be anymore disgusting? Never checked on us- then when we asked for the check to leave had to actual nerve to say ""so you're not going to tip me? Only 20 year olds do that"" .... totally floored at her audacity and her behaviour. Awful service and terrible demeanor. Need new help because the current help is horrible.",,,

I expected it to be more 'hoppin' - but the DJ was still playing some good music, a combo of modern pop and throwback tunes, and he took most of our requests too! Drinks were relatively cheap, cool colorful and vibrant atmosphere inside. But nothing too special or memorable about this place. A little cheesy to be honest!",3,,
53,M d.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,2,1.0,12/7/2016,"Have been here many times over the years, and it has never been anything special. Has always smelled of puke and I have noted to myself not to come back, until a few years later when I forget and try again. Pool tables are in poor condition if that is what you are looking for. Came here for a happy hour drink tonight with my 15mo old (who was sleeping soundly and can sleep through anything) and my friend and were turned away. First of all we came here because we were cold and had a half an hour before we met others for dinner. We sat down at the bar and ordered; the bartender took our order and then realized I had the baby with me. He said that we had to leave because of the baby. There is NO law in NY that prohibit children from being at bars as long as they are accompanied and not drinking. This is therefore an illegal discriminatory practice. I am not one to take my child to bars late at night, and I am equally annoyed with people who take their children to ""adult"" places and demand accommodation. This was however a baseless practice.",,,

56,Jeri P.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,25,6,3.0,11/19/2017,"Well its my second time here and all I can say is thank goodness the music was good because everything else was pretty crappy. I ordered a sex in the beach which was made by a hispanic looking guy with a bun. I asked him to make the drink and add more alcohol, which of course ill pay for the extra shot. I saw him make the drink and he juice was flowing and by the way he made it, I could tell it was gonna be really sweet. So he charged me $11 and I tipped $2 and was dissapointed that he didnt add the extra shot, because $11 can not be the price of a drink plus extra shot, so whatever, drink was disgustingly sweet, still drank it because I didnt want to complain and Ive read the negative review. Also noticed an asian bartender who was really upset and had a bad attitude while serving people and the same goes for a balding white guy with a beard, who ignored my cousin who wanted to order bottle service and paid $400 for it, it was her birthday so she wanted to have fun but that guy deserves a punch in the face or to get fired for treating her like that. Anyway the ladies bathhrooms has two stalls, and the sink is outside and there was security standing there by the bathroom, not sure why, maybe complaints of people having sex in there or doing drugs, dont know but found it weird, he was standing there most of the time I was there, which was 10pm till close. The decor looks kinda dingy and unclean. I noticed a pond but no fish in it. The bouncer/ door guy was pretty nice to us. Had a situation where one of the ladies in our group got kicked out because she was acting up, lucky it was close to closing time, so we all left by like 1:45. I probably would come back to dance, as long as the dj is still putting out good music. It was hard to dance because it got pretty packed. I wouldnt order any drink from here because I dont think there bartender are any good, also its kinda gross inside, so I would not bring people you want to impress with a good night out, but just to hang with a few girls and pre-game somewhere else, maybe Ill stop by.",,,

Is it a karaoke bar? Is it a pool hall? Is it an alcoholic aquarium? The answer is... it's all of them. And in a Tim Burton sort of way, it's pretty darn intriguing.No matter your race, gender, or sexual preference... there's a person there that fits within your comfort zone and sipping some sizz-urup within arm's reach.

68,Shell L.,"New York, NY",146,115,13,1.0,5/5/2014,"The bald bartender with the beard is the laziest scumbag ever. I was having a great Monday, came in with a very big group that is literally 90% of the customers in here right now. I ordered a stoli raspberry with diet coke. I drink this drink all of the time. I know what it looks like, what it smells like, and what it tastes like. He gives me a drink that is totally clear (see photo). I politely asked if there was diet coke in it (obviously not), he puts a single spray of coke in instead of remaking it, and says ""there"" after snubbing me.Despite knowing this drink was wrong, I tasted it anyway. It was not raspberry and didn't smell like it. I didn't watch him make it, so I don't know what it was, but I knew it wasn't what I ordered.  I try to get him again. He ignores me, I get him eventually as he is the only bartender and politely say this is not raspberry. He says it's what you ordered he tastes it tells me it is . I said well then it's bad can I have another. He thinks I'm not looking and tries to pour me a 1/4 glass of diet coke which he rudly throws on the bar in a way such  that more pours out of the already meager amount that was in the glass, and tries to charges me an additional $7 for it. I said I asked for vodka in that. Then he hesitated, looked at the vodka behind him, and said I don't want to make you another drink, there are plenty of other bars around the corner (seriously I'm with 30 people and 90% of your clients, you want to steal my money and send us out because you made my drink wrong and then wanted to be a dick about it). I then asked for the manager (bet he wasn't expecting that )who made my drink correctly. I have never experienced a bartender as disgusting as this one.What does that have to show for the establishment that allows him to work there, and treat people who were otherwise having a good day, in such a manner.

72,Soh R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,15,0,2.0,2/17/2014,"A pretty fun novelty spot. Two stars seems harsh, I know. Here's why I'm giving this place such a low rating: The other night I was here and ordered a well drink and a water. The bartender poured my drink and said $8 -- which was $2 more than the previous well drink I'd purchased that night. I asked him why my rudimentary whiskey-coke was suddenly $2 more expensive. He said the $2 was for the water. ""We're too busy to give out water,"" he said. ""I'm only selling bottles.""Wow. That is some Woodstock '99 shit. The bar wasn't even *that* busy. And even if it was, that is one reprehensible, cheap-shit policy. Not to mention irresponsible. So whenever it gets busy here, the bartenders just say, ""Fuck it, we're charging for water""?I suppose I could see some high-end place pulling this move, but Tropical 128? The Rainforest Cafe bar?

Their drinks are super cheap too (~$8) and there is a card minimum of approx $20, so I always get 2 drinks minimum before closing my tab. Also, although I was skeptical of their food at first - this place actually has decent food to snack on! I recommend their chicken wings, fries, and dumplings if you are feeling the drunchies!

The clientele is as diverse as the place itself. They do have a good hh deal for $3 beers and $5 well drinks. When we went they were giving out free Heinekens so we didn't end up paying anything for drinks. We saw some people ordering those giant beer bongs and they had some interesting cocktails that  were being shared by a group.It wasn't my kind of scene and I was bored after a while especially since the music lacked any creativity or originality whatsoever. My wife wanted to hear Gungnam Style so I took that request to the DJ but he said he had never heard of it.WHAAAAT????You're spinning crappy pop music in Chinatown and you have never heard of Gungnam Style?

The 4 pool tables in the back are usually taken if you go later at night, like after dinner/happy hour, but if you get there right at happy hour, at least one or two are open. The tables aren't the best kept, but it's nice that they have ledges along the wall so that people can sit and watch their friends play. Also, it's charged per hour, regardless of the number of people playing. The alcohol is decent. They have happy hour specials for draft, but they also have a selection of liquor to choose from.

Drinks are a pretty good deal during happy hour, and food is okay. The lighting is incredibly dim; when the candles go out, you are actually in the dark. Maybe I'm just getting old, but my eyes can't really take that anymore.Overall, I think this is a hidden gem in Chinatown/Little Italy - a totally unexpected dive bar - but it's not quite for me.

Which might have been a good thing because I kind of felt the place was a little dirty so what I can't see can't hurt me, right? The bathrooms were pretty horrendous, I can only speak for the ladies room but it was tight and awkward and the communal sick was outside the bathroom area and had no mirror. Aside from the group of people that showed up for a friend's birthday the place was pretty empty. They did play some 80s songs and top 40s so I enjoyed the music.

99,King C.,"New York, NY",56,27,2,2.0,7/17/2016,"The owners have made this place from what use to be a nice place to hangout and drink to an over price boring once a month spot.  I've been going to this spot since it first opened when it was just a pool hall with three arcade games and a bubble tea at one point.  I've seen all the changes they made, from fighting for their liquor license, to turning their basement into another bar.  I've seen bartenders come and go, I've seen managers come and go.  And what was constant was the owners.  Two cheap, poor decision making people that care about their own revenue than making their regulars happy.  I was definitely a regular but there are just so many other bars near by that they can't compete with.  Even if I wasn't a regular, there's nothing special about this place that would make me want to become a regular.  I've seen the transformation from birth to what it is now and I want to tell the owners this...sell the bar.",,,

Clearly the staff takes no effort to ensure your card is safe behind the bar or gives a shit when they screw up. The money isn't the issue here. It's that they tried to use ""free"" shots as a way to get me to sign off on the bill. Never going back.",1,,

A friend of ours told it to check it, it has quirky jungle tropical theme, with faux trees, vines, rocks, etc. its a pretty large venue, they have a bunch of pool tables in the back and there's a dance floor in front of that. People were really getting down, so if your like to dance, this might be a good place for cutting rugs. Sat in the front, got a Brooklyn lager. I checked in on Yelp, and got a free buy back. That was the pretty awesome.Thanks Yelp!",1,,1

My only gripe is that they took the snooker table out from the back. It was the only one that was open to the general public in Manhattan.Oh and don't turn the lights on in the bathroom. The wall is a fish tank that is adjacent to the bar, so if you turn the light on you will have a little less privacy than you might like!",7,2,1

Sorry but there is no other way to say it. It's just plain shabby. I went to the other side of the bar to meet my date and it was like a different place. We wanted to be where the action was so we went back to the front.

Settle in with a tower of beer (about 7 pints) for just yourself or share it with the few co-workers you tolerate. Tropical 128 is surprisingly spacious and mercifully cheaper than the next closest tropical drinks locale (Painkiller on Essex). And anyone who appreciates quality kitsch will be mesmerized by the myriad tacky details of the decor. Weeknights before 8 are your safest bet for civilized noise level, bargain booze and patrons who also regard the place as a guilty pleasure.

I was here with a group of about 8 - complete mix of guys & girls... and we were nearly the only people there. The decor & the signage outside are bizarre and cheesy... it's like a grownup Rainforest Cafe, but not nearly as cool because it doesn't rain indoors, like the Rainforest Cafe! I'd be curious to come back since so many people seem to enjoy it... maybe it was an off night.

They have pool tables in the back and some people who were sitting across from us were playing some kind of drinking game. I loved the music they were playing which was mostly reggae rock. All in all, a cool, chill vibe.The food was decent. The burgers were mm, mm good and the perfect size, but the dumplings, eh .. I've had better. The service was on point. Every time we needed something, just raise a hand and they were there. Prices were also amazing, seeing that all of my friends and I weren't looking to spend a shit ton of money.Before I forget, this place does NOT accept credit cards. Cash only.

After 9pm it went up to 5 bucks (i THINK). We got cheese fries, they were good, nothing like amazing or anything but good bar food.

Honestly, the cheesiness makes it that much more fun because it made for some great jokes. We sat at a table next to a fake snake mid-lunge, which amused us greatly. The beers are affordable and the cocktails aren't too bad, but my favorite part is their awesome tacos that they serve till closing time.

If you know what I'm talkin' about...The interior is modeled exactly like a plastic rain forest. If you go to the restroom  you are allowed the luxury of a one-way mirror into an exotic fish tank as you do your person business. You also have a view of the bar so you can keep an eye on your date.The crowd is filled with young professionals and the TVs are generally tuned to basketball, much to the feigned excitement of my accomplices. I did my first sake bomb here! Looking like a nerd I just poured the contents of my sake thimble into my beer--- apparently you're just supposed to drop the whole thing in--- ahh well, I'm just starting to learn this stuff. This is perhaps the easiest bar in the world to score a drink from a hottie if you're an Asian/blonde young thing. I got so drunk that I feel like I'm sober.Uhhh, in addition to a gazillion pool tables in the back they also have a sushi chef on staff that can make you a 4 dollar caesar salad so you can get the crunk munchies on in a classy, smart way.

148,Mary F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,18,0,5.0,1/12/2012,wednesday at tropical are my fav.they have great prices for happy hour and the bar food they serve is so good =) kudos to the chef!but they do not accept any debit or credit cards. they will hold a tab with your credit card but do not warn you that they only accept cash. also they got new bartenders. and the only guy bartender is very rude. the only good one they have left is olga! she actually says hello and smiles unlike the others. its true. just ask for olga and she will take care of you.,1,,
149,Heather C.,"Hillsdale, NJ",2,36,20,3.0,6/24/2012,"Ok, so my friends and I went to this place to play pool. It was my first time there; the interior decoration is a bit weird to me but I definitely liked the low rate for pool ($16 per hour). But I really did not like their attitude especially when they tried so hard to sell drinks when my friend ordered just one drink. Hey, I was there to play pool, not to drink. Plus, there were some shady people in the bar, so I would not recommend for girls to go here alone- go in groups or bring some guys to avoid weirdos.",,,
150,Pauline T.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,17,0,5.0,11/11/2013,"Celebrated my birthday here because a friend recommended it, and I'll admit it - this place is hella random located in the cusp of chinatown/little italy. It's a pool hall but also has a bunch of neon lights/tropical decorations. AND IT WAS SO FUN. The manager was a sweetheart, the DJ played all the jams my friends requested (gotta have that Kendrick Lamar for a real party amiright?), there was enough space to dance, and those fishbowls were dangerously good. Thanks for such a great time!",1,,
151,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",33,44,0,4.0,10/3/2011,"After reading the writeup in the NY Times, we had to check it out.  Love this place.  Just enough tropical kitsch mixed with a good drink/snack menu to make it thoroughly enjoyable. I can only imagine it gets packed on the weekends with all the pool tables.... will definitely give it another visit.",1,,
152,Steven H.,"New York, NY",32,40,0,4.0,5/28/2008,"I believe it was my ginger-colored-hair-roommate Dominic paraphrasing Kant in saying, ""People in New York are too worried about looking cool to get fucked up drunk."" Now, I would best describe myself as a model of personal development and somewhat of a demigod when it comes to professional achievement, but at Tropical 128, you can find me completely soused, on the ground holding my knees, with a mischievous grin and a rapist wit, just like all of the other Asian or Russian patrons.Imagine my feeling of coup de main and betrayal, as I entered the bathroom, ready for a quick sob before my 5th pint and saw a fishtank acting as a wall, except  completely transparent. My surprise turned to anger, then to shock, then took a brief turn to arousal, and then to complete enlightenment, as I realized that I couldn't be seen by the dudes who look the gang that kidnapped Soo Yung in Rush Hour sitting at the bar. The wonders of modern 2-way mirror technology. Since fiscal challenges have forced me to live on Budweiser and canned meats for past couple of years, the Blue Moon on tap here tasted like God's breastmilk once it hit my lips. It's actually become my bar staple, aside from when I'm buying drinks for girls, in which I'll order a lime and tonic water next to their Long Island Ice Tea with a pinch of what I hope is nonlethal liquid cocaine.Please give this bar a chance. Don't let the Foot Clan packing TV's into tinted vans outside deter you. There's a fantastic jukebox, tons of pool tables, and as the once-Korean-always-Korean David L. said, the bartenders aren't too bad on the eyes either. See you there tonight.",6,14,5
153,Emily K.,"New York, NY",12,131,5,3.0,3/10/2011,eastern european bartenders and a mostly asian/black crowd.it was a weekday.  it was late.  there were only going to be crazies then i suppose.,2,1,
154,Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,558,36,3.0,1/2/2011,"Happy New Years everybody,starting off with my *200th review* Oh yeah!. Tropical is the place where I spent the early hours of 2011. As soon as you walk through the door, you walk into another world, perhaps the Amazon or a Sumatran jungle,you get a feel of the tropics. Its main features are a huge tree,bolder rocks,tropical plants and the indoor bridge with pond (with kois swimming in it,be careful when crossing, you might get you shoes wet and you might kill one of the fishes). The bartenders were friendly, I had shot of sake, it was the worst sake I've tasted, can you say pond water, their chicken wings were zesty pretty good,their plain nachos tasted generic nothing out of the ordinary. Behind the bar you have the pool hall. I did not play. I wasn't feeling the crowd, but I did meet a couple of nice ladies. They have a juke box,I didn't like the music that the patrons selected since it consisted of some sort of British rock that I've never heard of. Why would you ever play somber music in New Years?That made no sense whatsoever. So I took over the jukebox and played music that got the people moving ( Pitbull's ""Calle 8"" and Big Pun ""Dont Wanna B a Playa""). To make this review short, I like Tropical, its good, just wish it had a more diverse crowd. Oh and one more thing,Happy New Years to all my fellow Yelpers!",2,,1
155,Jimmy H.,"New York, NY",68,40,1,3.0,3/19/2012,"I stopped by a few weeks ago for drinks as we were waiting for our dinner reservation.  Arrived around 6 pm with a friend and the place only had a few patrons by the bar.  I checked-in on Yelp for a 2 for 1 drink special which was nice and the bartender made us pretty decent drinks.  Didn't necessary love the atmosphere, but that's just more of my preference for something more intimate and a bit polished.  I think it's the ideal place for a lazy weekend catching drinks with friends and playing some billiards.",,,
156,Lee D.,"Wantagh, NY",20,8,4,4.0,11/19/2011,For sure a good place to go just to kick back & relax. Decor is cool & attitudes are chill. If my girl friend didn't live across the street I would of never came across it. Even has a really cool fish tank.,,,
157,Andrea L.,"FLUSHING, NY",77,476,160,4.0,12/30/2008,"Kitsch me if you can, Tropical 128!  Tiki's the word on the lounge section of this bar-cum-pool hall.  From fake trees to wooden benches to waterfalls, I def felt transported to a tropical forest outpost (minus the nasty humidity).  Cute, friendly, and attentive Russian waitresses shuttle $5 drafts and $7 sake cocktails (yum, the coconut is the most popular), and the music volume is just right for catching up w/ friends.  The lounge was pretty empty, as most patrons headed straight for the back room's pool tables, but it was the perfect hideaway for a chill Saturday night out.PS - It's true about the fish tank / two-way mirror bathroom, but for modest femmes, try the infinitely cleaner ladies room by the Sexier-Perrier sign.",1,,
158,Will C.,"Seattle, WA",130,207,45,4.0,6/2/2011,"Booze and pool hall, never would have guesses it was a pool hall. But cheap chill place for some drinks.",,,
159,N S.,"Long Island City, NY",4,138,0,3.0,3/9/2009,"It is nicely set up, a nice pool hall.  I practically grew up at a pool hall and this one was nicely set up.  They have these wooden benches on the side so there's plenty of seats for everyone.  It is however quite small for a pool hall.  I think there was maybe 8 total pool tables and 1 snooker table.I was kinda disappointed in the alcohol selection and what's with the kitchen?!  Alcohol was only sake, wine and beer.  Where's the vodka, rum, gin, whiskey?!?!?!?!!!  I mean, I like sake but i just didn't feel like sake for particular nite.What's with the kitchen closing at like 6PM on a Saturday evening?!?!???Does the cook really have to go home at 6PM?  Don't they know that Saturday evening/ nite is like peak eating time?!!!??The bathroom has a two way mirror and while you're in the bathroom, you can see the fishtank and anyone looking at the fishtank ;0)It's a cute little place.  I just wish they had a better selection of adult beverage :0(",,,
160,Daniel F.,"PECK SLIP, NY",0,3,0,3.0,10/18/2011,"Very casual, good place to chill. Lounge/bar in the front, with probably 10 or so pool tables in the back. They serve towers of beer, which was cool. Only knock is the bartenders made terrible drinks so I switched to beer.",,,
161,Jim P.,"New York, NY",52,83,5,4.0,8/10/2008,"Unlike the other two Yelpers before me, I came here for pool (the back half of the place) and had a good time - enough space, light and everything was in good condition. It wasn't all that crowded either (early Saturday evening).The front bar part is the trippy pyschodelic part - the place is done up to resemble a tropical rain forest (in cheesy bar fashion) and the russian bar staff are out-of-place hotness. The Blue Moon I had was great - even in a Stella glass.",,,
162,MM A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,2.0,12/16/2012,"I walked in just for a quick drink to warm up, had a great time with my friends.. bartenders were very nice but I guess the ""manager"" was totally rude.. The bartender was taking our order and he came up and yelled at her right in front of us.. ""for not pouring his drink first""?? We ignored it because we all have bad days. We ordered some tacos and after we picked up the last one there was a HAIR on the plate.. Giving the benefit of the doubt assuming it was one of ours we laughed about it.. the absolute worst part was seeing not just one but TWO cockroaches on the bar! so grossed out we closed out and left.",,,
163,Mike B.,"New York, NY",28,152,4,3.0,9/29/2009,"Pretty tacky Hawaiian themed interior, complete with tiki torches, rain forest motifs, and lounge chairs. All of this and a massive pool hall in the back. Not quite sure what to think of this place. Very casual and low key, I stopped by to meet some friends on a Saturday night and it was really , really dead. A few people hanging around the benches and a few people shooting pool in the back . Very Asian crowd as it is near Chinatown. Prices were cheap and the staff pretty friendly.  Note: This place doesn't serve hard alcohol, just beer and wine.   I'd maybe drop in again if I felt the desire to transport myself back to the set of Hawaii 5-0.",,,
164,Wailun C.,"New York, NY",9,56,0,4.0,5/28/2009,"Being on a pool kick of late, this is the spot we've been hitting the last few weeks.  This place is generally not too crowded, as we never had any trouble getting a pool table (there's about 7 or 8 in the back, with 1 snooker table).  Beer is cheap during happy hours, from $2 wed (4 - 9 PM) to half price Monday's (4 - 7 PM).  The one drawback of this place is that it is NOT a full bar.  Outside of beer, they only serve sake and soju.  Being the alcoholics that we are, it would've been nice to throw back some Jameson shots, but alas, there was none to be had.  If you are a big drinker like we are, there is a special for after Happy Hour that is not listed - $30 for 100 Oz. of beer.  Believe you me, this is definitely cheaper than order 10 beers individually.",,,
165,Mordicai C.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,268,0,5.0,8/5/2009,"Kitschier than you could believe; also totally awesome.  The inside is a no-holds barred, everything-&-the-kitchen-sink ""rain forest"" complete with fiberglass trees, indoor streams, deer heads, & aquariums.  The bar isn't a full bar, but the place with happily put sake in everything-- saketini!  Sake & all the works & fixings, plus beer & wine.  Worth going to over & over, even if you don't play pool.",,,
166,lucas D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,1,0,4.0,9/22/2011,"Tropical 128 is an oasis in the middle of the jungle! Great place for drinks and to shoot some pool! Loved the vibe and I would have given it a 5 star review, BUT the beer menu needs at least one IPA with a decent amount of flavor and alcohol....Perhaps Southern Tier double IPA...just saying...if they would bring in something like this, I might just move in!",,,
167,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,4.0,5/20/2010,"Tropical...where do I even begin?  My boyfriend dragged me here because he wanted to watch the game on one of their big screen tvs.  Little does he know I've been back by myself 4-5 times.Tropical is one of the strangest bars I've been to in the city.  The reviewer who likened it to a ""boozy rainforest cafe"" hit the nail on the head.  My especialy favorite is the gaudy oversized fish tank blocking the bathroom and the wooden tree tables.  ""The crowd sucks.""  I wouldn't say that.  Tropical isn't an indie bar or at all trendy.  It attracts a pretty diverse group of frat boys, soho native weirdos, and non-English speaking Chinese immigrants playing dice at the bar. The perks:1. Cheap beer: the beer here is cheap.  Even without the happy hour specials the beer is cheap.  You can also get it in giant containers to share with your friends.  It's awesome.2. There's asian food (and it's cheap and good).   I've had their spring rolls and wontons and it's good Asian beer munchie food.3. There's a PHOTO HUNT game machine.  OH GOD I LOVE PHOTOHUNT.  Erotic photo hunt, regular photohunt, Chipendale's photohunt.  Guys: if you like playing pool and your girlfriend hates it but you want to bring her anyway, come to tropical, give her $10 in ones, and tell her you'll see her in a few hours.4. It's never packed.  I swear, sometimes in Manhattan on a friday at 11 pm I feel like EVERY bar is packed the brim.  Sometimes you just want a low-key venue to sit and hang with friends without feeling like a sardine or having to yell over obnoxious music.  Tropical is good for that.  Also: there are always a lot of pool tables open.Cons:*Cash only, creepy Asians.",1,,
168,Kelvin L.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,7,0,5.0,6/4/2010,"Somehow I stumble into this place. This is a bar/sushi/pool hall. The decor is okay but it works for some of my friends. The sushi is really fresh and I am a sushi lover. They also sell slices of sashimi for a dollar a piece which i think is awesome. Usually, they are pretty generous. There are 8 pool tables and 1 snooker table. The alcohol is average imo, nothing too fancy and I really came for the sushi and the pool.",,,
169,Peter T.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,4.0,2/22/2009,"This place is classic.  We wandered in here randomly because we were walking around trying to find another bar and desperately needed to warm up with a drink before we ventured on.  We all started laughing when we walked in the front door.  The decorations at this place are classic to say the least.  It's worth going just to see it (and of course the bathroom inside the fish tank!).  The only downfall... no liquor!!! We really wanted to do shots and we were sorely disappointed.  However, the fact that the beers are massive and cheap more than made up for it.",,,
