Pancetta was a great addition as usual.  4.5 stars - Branzino: well cooked fresh fish and olives on top added a subtle briney salt to round it out. Only issue was it was deboned yet both large and small bones were found while eating it. 4 stars - Meat and cheese boards: ok variety though enjoyed the thinly sliced meat more. Did enjoy the sweet and spicy pecans. Was disappointed none of the staff let us know which meats and cheeses were there upon delivery so we had to guess. 3.5 stars- Atmosphere: upscale diner with large bar in the front. Not as swanky as the website presents but comfortable.Midlights:- Mac and cheese: served in a baked dish but not cheesy enough for me and lacked flavor. 2.5 starsLowlights:- Scallops: overcooked rubbery and tasted bit fishy. 2 stars- Pictures looked more upscale than the actual placeOk spot for a small group but can find better in this city.",1,2,
2,Katherine C.,"Weehawken, NJ",133,186,84,5.0,11/8/2018,"Incredible. Had a show at MSG so we decided to have dinner here beforehand. We started off with the meatballs (weren't as hot as I would've liked them to be but the taste made up for it), kale salad to split (loved the pieces of grapefruit!), and the French Dip was a must. We substituted the side for fries. Fries is always the answer...Our service was great and for Manhattan, I was surprised how spacious it was inside! Multiple bar areas, intimidate 2 seaters, cozy booths, plenty of seating arrangements.Parker & Quinn deserves a 5 star stamp of approval!",2,,
3,Gabby S.,"New York, NY",475,254,121,5.0,10/24/2018,I'm always anxious when I go eat in a restaurant so full of activity cause it will either be a hit or miss. But Parker and  Quinn was definitely a hit.I had this crazy craving for like a pizza flatbread sort of thing. I wanted something to really wow me and not just be mediocre. I saw pictures posted here and I was like wows plz be as good as pictures and boy it wasI ordered the pepperoni flatbread and I have no regrets I still think about it. It was perfection from watching it being made because you can literally watch.( I enjoy open kitchen concepts) when I got it I didn't even want to eat cause it was so picture perfect so I just took a picture haha From the sauce to the way it was cooked so perfectly I love a nice crust. I will definitely be back and if you are in the area and you wanna wow someone with delicious food bring them here.The host and hostess were super engaging saying hello and bye when we left which I really enjoyed the servers are also super friendly and very honest which I love I see some people down here bitching and moaning oh server told me kitchen will close at 10:45 they are so rude. No they aren't being rude they are doing their job and letting you know in case someone wants to put in another order I have seeeen that at so many nyc restaurants and even around the world and if you haven't then y'all need to step out more often For dessert I got the cheesecake and it was deeeeeelicious I have a thing for whipped cream like good solid whipped cream and they definitely did it delicious and in house and it really made the whole dessert fantastic,2,,1

The restaurant is 20's themed, with a full bar, comfortable seating, courteous staff, and fast and friendly service (Thank You, Reeves!).We had a Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken (salad $15.00, chicken $9.00); and a Fennel Flatbread ($16.00).

There is a good young professional crowd that comes here after work too. My staples are their flatbreads and Brussels sprouts.Fun fact, there are outlets underneath the bar so if you are running low on your cell phone's battery you can plug in here.

8,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,3.0,8/22/2018,"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Had specific instructions from a friend to try the quinoa veggie burger (with chipotle aioli, feta yogurt, and pickles). Got that with a side of arugula salad. Also tried the regular burger (served in brioche bun with sour pickle; requested the goat cheese ; and added avocado) with a side of fries. The sad slim slices of avocado for $4 were a ripoff Typically I do not like brioche but the burgers overall were good/standard. Salad was basic; fries were perfectly salted although rather limp (I generally like double or thrice fried fries). No major complaints however also no lasting impression. If you're in the area and need a bite, this would do. Or just walk a little more to find other, albeit limited, interesting eats. I would even dare to just stop by Whole Foods for grub.",1,,

The food was great and creative. We also ordered the bloody board - doesn't sound appetizing but was jam packed with every topping imaginable for the perfect Bloody Mary.

The staff was super attentive and friendly. I ordered a delicious cappuccino, their signature  pancakes with lemon and blueberry compote - which was completely out of this world. So flavorful and fluffy, it was hard to stop myself for eating the entire large stack of 3. I also ordered a side of the bacon which was a perfect amount of crispy and generous size of 4 pieces. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was also very nice. A bit on the pricey side for breakfast but good for when it's on your company's dime! Would definitely come back.",1,,1
15,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",650,1624,413,4.0,5/27/2018,"It's tough, when you come in here late on a Saturday morning, trying to figure out whether to order something classified as breakfast, brunch, or lunch from their Saturday menu. All choices work well.  More important, and higher priority, is that first cup of coffee. In this case it was large and steaming hot.  Also equally important, having an efficient and fun server, as was our case with Johanna today. She rolled with our banter and didn't miss a beat taking or serving our food and drink. We started with doughnuts, because they exist. These were three smaller (think 2-3 times the size of a doughnut hole), filled with creme, garnished with a raspberry and I believe lightly dusted with a cinnamon-sugar mixture - enough to taste, not enough to overwhelm. They were enough to whet the palate without giving you any fullness.We all went for the omelet brunch specials, which come with ""a nice little salad."" That little salad was probably as large as the omelet itself, with mixed greens, small amounts of onions, lots of cherry or grape tomatoes, and a nice texture overall. The omelets came with lots of those tomatoes too, so if you like tomatoes, this is a nice choice for you. The omelets themselves are pretty simple, the ingredients are exactly what you ordered in them (with the tomatoes). Mine was the wild mushrooms, chopped into bite-sized pieces. But the egg batter for the omelets was modified somehow, as it was more puffy/spongy than a traditional egg mix, so I wonder what else is in it. The decor is quite interesting here too, with lots of throwback artwork and photos.  Overall, it was a very good way to start a Saturday.",4,1,4

My cousin and I shared the steak and eggs and let me tell you, this is definitely worth every bite! the potatoes were crispy on the outside and well-cooked on the inside, the steak was medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection. The prices are expensive, our meal was $27 but for the portion that they serve aren't that bad at all. It was just enough and made us full super quick. -The interior of this restaurant reminded me of something you'd see in the movies, with the big lights classy chairs and the high top bar which was pretty nice. -One of the things that I disliked were how the servers/staff treat you as if you don't have enough money to pay for this meal etc etc..",2,2,3

The convenience of being able to reserve a table online was nice, I was able to get a confirmation email within a few hours. They had so many accommodations such as any allergies or celebrations they should know about. Food came out fairly fast, server was friendly. They definitely made sure we had a good time. We got free donuts since it was a bachelorette party which I thought was nice. So many amazing options, I was stuck between two choices and one of the girls was also stuck between the same two choices so we each ordered one thing and just shared our plates which worked out perfectly.One of the dishes was the apple French toast. Bread was sooo soft, reminded me of a dough consistency but didn't have the same texture. It didn't feel like you were eating raw dough, it was just chewy and soft. We also didn't have to add too much syrup since the apples soaked it up nicely, with the combination of the chopped up apples and syrup, just perfect.

23,Sarah L.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",79,183,341,5.0,2/15/2018,"Parker & Quinn is the signature restaurant at the Refinery Hotel. Serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and cocktails in a nostalgic atmosphere that offers an American dining and creative cocktail experience. Parker and Quinn features classic, 1900's New York City design with a vintage feel in the Refinery Hotel. My friend and I decided to eat here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning around 10am. We had made reservations but they were not necessary. If you head there for brunch or dinner, I would definitely suggest making reservations as they tend to be a little busier. The two of us were seated in a cozy elevated booth, which is the perfect size for a group of friends to brunch in. Brunch drinks are a must so to start we ordered two drink boards. The drink boards are a fun and cute idea when you are having brunch with friends. We ordered one Bubbly Board which included raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, chantilly whipped cream, elderflower liqueur, peach purée, and blood orange purée. You then are able to make the drink of your choice at the table. We also ordered one of the Bloody Boards which included bloody carafe, accompanied by: pickled veggies, pimento olives, bacon, pepperjack cheese, celery, horseradish, beef boullion, and assorted hot sauces to make your own table-side Bloody Mary drinks. I would definitely recommend trying either of these boards. They were a unique twist on ordering your everyday mimosa and bloody mary. The breakfast and the brunch menus have a ton of delicious options. I was torn between ordering the Greek yogurt with trademark's granola, berries or honey and the malted waffle with New Hampshire maple syrup, and whipped salted butter. So I just decided to ordered both and was very happy I did! Whether you are dining as a guest in the hotel, or enjoying a night out on the town. Parker & Quinn is the perfect laid back yet classy spot. Prices are average for the area. Most entrees will run you around $20 per person and the portions are large!",5,2,6

The brunch menu has a ton of options and it was honestly hard figuring out what to order. I was torn between the soup n' sammy (bacon tomato soup with grilled cheese) and the quiche. I ended  up with the quiche and was very happy with my decision. Typically quiches have things like broccoli, cheddar and ham, but this was unlike any quiche that I've ever tried before. It was stuffed with chorizo, kale and potato. A very interesting mix and the ingredients worked great together. My only complaint was the thick buttery crust (complaint - yes) which made this dish alot richer than I had wanted it to be. The meal, along with many of the other dishes, came with a small salad. Brunch drinks are a must - the sparkle & rose was an interesting take on an aperol spritz and also had gin and grapefruit juice. Very delicious, and a nice upgrade from the typical brunch mimosa that I normally would have ordered. Prices are average for the area - most entrees will run you around 15-20 bills, cocktails are 10.

29,Libby B.,"Indianapolis, IN",146,488,1998,5.0,3/5/2018,"Crabcake Eggs Benedict. Brunch perfection! The crabcake was ALL crab, none of that extra bread crumb stuff you sometimes get at sub-par brunch places. So tender and delicious with the rest of the eggs benedict. I really loved the arugula salad with fennel, tomatoes, and red onions, simply dressed. Paired with the Parker & Pear cocktail, it made for a perfect start to the day. The staff was very nice and accommodating especially since we arrived without reservations. (Definitely get reservations if you can. We were out before they needed the table back.) You can enter from the Refinery hotel if you are a guest and walk back to the entrance through what feels like the kitchen at first, but it's the right way to go. It took us a little while to get served after our water was brought out, but that at least gave us time to figure out what drinks and entrees we wanted. My husband got some oatmeal and a side of bacon. He let me sample the bacon, and it was nice and smoky! It had a sort of smokiness that reminds me of a campfire. Very good if you're a bacon fan! I would love to come back for dinner or just for drinks. The bar area looks fantastic. The interior of the restaurant is very vintage early 20th century. I loved those red chairs!",,,

Food and drinks were served fast. The highlight of the night was their cocktails. They were uniquely named -at least for me they were- and tasted so goooood. My friend and i definitely went home booze-loaded. The food was alright. We ordered pasta which was a little salty for me. We also had their skirt steak which was the better order for the evening.

The crab cake was crispy,  and not soggy at all from the sauce on top. It also was came with a small green salad that was delicious. The bacon cheddar grits- also on point l. The bacon pieces were very small and were truly integrated into the grits. The drinks, however, were just ok. There isn't unlimited cocktails, that's sort of disappointing. But the two brunch cocktails we did have were ok. The tyme-y cocktail was a bit too sweet. Overall I would definitely come back to Parker& Quinn because the food was excellent.

The test tube mimosa is such a cute idea, and a great fun when you brunch with friends.  Food wise the lamb pasta is always a great choice, so is the french toast (i'm always a french toast person); omelet is not what you are picturing (and not in the good way); grits is splendid and to die for!  I got bagel and lox, bagel is totally over toasted and hard as rock ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The booths are super adorable and i would highly recommend for group brunch!",3,2,3
35,Briaunté W.,"New York, NY",955,600,3973,4.0,12/4/2017,"My hunny made reservations for my Dirty 30 at Parker & Quinn a few months back. The moment we walked in I thought perhaps we're going to have a round of drinks and head to the actual birthday spot. Much to my surprise we stayed.  I didn't understand why he chose Parker & Quinn as the spot to celebrate my Dirty 30 because it was not our typical intimate setting. Holy crap this place is loud. However, once I settled in my opinion changed drastically. Parker and Quinn offers an American dining & creative cocktails experience. The decor and ambiance offer you a 1920s feel with a vintage backdrop in the Refinery Hotel. Parker & Quinn you may not have had me at hello but, it was certainly hard to say goodbye.Although there was a lot of hustle a bustle we had an exceptional evening. We started off with the cocktail menu, ordered a flatbread app and proceeded to order our entrees. He had the hanger steak with mashed potatoes and I had the hot and honey fried chicken with a side of the Mac and cheese. I tasted his mashed potatoes and they were out of this world. My friend chicken was juicy and crunchy. It had the perfect balance of sweet heat. I love mac and cheese that's gooey and has breadcrumbs on top.The staff made me feel special and made sure to pay extra attention to my wants and needs.

39,Cri C.,"New York, NY",271,221,1526,3.0,11/7/2017,"Parker & Quinn is a pretty decent spot for a sit down meal in midtown, in an area where such a place is lacking. It has a retro diner/saloon vibe and is operated at the back of the Refinery Hotel. It has a central bar and variety of seating options including booths, tables and high tables with funky red leather stools. The restrooms are beautiful and located in the hotel lobby, which is easily accessed once you walk past the kitchen.I've been here for both a weekday lunch and a weekday breakfast. The lunch service was pretty busy, while the weekday breakfast was pretty quiet. I ordered a veggie burger at the lunch. It was sizeable and decent, not the best I've ever had but reasonable for such a place. The server was alright, not particularly attentive. She seemed busy. I recall thinking it took a very long time for the food/drinks to come out. The place was fairly full, but still.The second time I ordered an acai bowl. I wasn't really a fan of this because it was basically liquefied when it came out so that all of the fresh fruit/granola had sunk and I needed to dig it out. It kind of had an aftertaste of dairy yoghurt. I could be wrong because the yoghurt was not mentioned on the menu, and acai bowls are typically dairy free. But I'm not sure what they blended it with because if it had have been frozen banana it would have been much more solid. And thus yoghurt does make sense.During this breakfast my friends ordered a big breakfast and a waffle (they were out of pancakes). I paid the bill and it ended up being over $100 for 3 people. My portion was only about $25. My friends ordered juice and coffee and some of their other add ons to be pretty steep. $8 for a side of bacon and $6 to add berries and cream to the waffles. That seemed to be all the waffles came with so I'm assuming it would have been $16 odd bucks for plain waffle and syrup if they hadn't made the add on. Regardless, they were really happy with their meals.The server for breakfast was pretty good. She was friendly, helpful and had a sense of humor. I think the food was also a tad slow considering it was fairly quiet. Had to follow up on the bill and paying. But they probably assumed we were tourists and not people who were going to work.Would I come back again? Yes. I'd be more keen for drinks than a substantial meal. I think it errs on a little expensive. Their target customer is probably not a vegan/vegetarian health nut. I do think the vibe here is nice. It is a great place to sit down in the area and the look and feel is classy and chic.",3,,3
40,Kelly L.,"New York, NY",39,8,19,5.0,8/1/2018,"Went to brunch here with friends on a Sunday. The server was quick and attentive, I never had an empty glass of water. The place had a decent amount of seating and had multiple booths that could easily sit our party of 5. We made reservations so I am not sure about a wait time or anything like that.I had a Strawberry Belinni which was very good and strong, you really only need one (but I definitely had 2). I had the Crabcake Benedict which came with a large salad. The portions were much larger than I expected and I was very full after my meal. This place is a good spot for brunch with a group of 5 people and I think there is something for everyone.",,,
41,Paulina P.,"Boston, MA",88,30,82,4.0,5/12/2018,"Decent restaurant. The decorations is a hipsterish with  great lighting no flash needed. Came here with 7 other ladies for a bachelorette brunch. This place is a bit pricey but a fancy brunch location. They gave us a free app bc of the occasion only we didn't know since the runner just dropped it off at the table. It was the donuts. They were delicious! Very light, not overly sweet, and I'd say a good choice to order.Service was alright. Our server was here sparsely and only showed up when he was needed. On a higher note he was cute. Dishes that were ordered:Greek Yogurt with fruit, honey, and granola. Your typical yogurt. Not worth the price at all and the granola was stale.Soup N' Sammy. Basically like a grilled cheese with a tomato bacon soup. Delicious! Better than your average typical grilled cheese and tomato bacon soup. The soup has a nice texture not overly liquid-y and has croutons in it. Make sure to mix it because the soup bottom is a bit salty.Salmon Platter. It was basically a make it yourself salmon bagel with tomatoes, onions, cream cheese, and cucumbers. Fun to put together and delicious. However the bagel was a bit over toasted and started cutting the top of her mouth.Malted Waffle. Extremely aestheic and great for thanks pictures. An enjoyable meal and there was nothing wrong with it.Crab Cake Benedict. Also very delicious and they had nothing bad to say about it.Caramelized Apple French Toast. A super sweet french toast. If you like really sweet foods this is for you but for the ladies who ate this it was too much a difficult to eat a lot of it because of the sweetness. Sickeningly sweet.Overall this place is very aesthetic and has decent food. A good place if you just want to be a bit fancy for  a meal but wouldn't frequent. I'd give this restaurant a 3.5.",2,,1

45,Shara C.,"Irvine, CA",362,162,40,3.0,5/3/2018,First time trying this restaurant. I took an Uber to the location but not sure where one would park if you had a car. The minute I walked in and asked for a table the hostess asked if I want to sit at the bar. I said no and she informed me that my table had a reservation so I could only stay for an hour. I was in ny on a work trip and was there alone I told her I wouldn't take longer than an hour. I get to my seat and literally (I counted) there were 12 open seats. Not the most welcoming of greetings to set a time limit before I even sit down. I guess I had just gotten in before lunch rush because right at 12 it got busy. I got  there at 11:50 to try the crab cakes Benedict but apparently weekdays 11:30 is cut off I believe she said. I asked if they could make an exception one time since I'm from LA and it was a hard no. I get the special of the day sea bass which was cooked well but I wasn't notified it had skin on and they had missed some of the bones. It was ok but for 30 bucks I could have had a much better meal elsewhere in LA. It was also somewhat bland. The diet soda was flat with no refills and service was slow. I asked a diff waitress for the check and after 20 min it was clear she had forgotten. You wanna rush me out of there but you don't want me to pay? So I finally found my waitress and she took my card. All in all mediocre food at best and bad service. I get that it's busy I don't expect constant attention but seriously the waitress that forgot my check when I saw her again I reminded her and she still didn't come back. The waitress that was serving my table said she's prob busy.... I might be in ny next month but I will definitely not be going back.  Service alone I would give it two stars because from the other reviews it looks like the one hour time limit is a restaurant policy. No thanks.,1,1,

We got a two bottles of rose, glasses of red wine, and two cocktails that started with""fluer."" For entrees we got the salmon, scallops, salad, mac&cheese, tuna, tomato bisque soup with bread, and side of mashed potatoes. We'd seriously recommend it all. I loved my salmon and everyone loved their own dishes. For dessert we got two cookie skillets (which came with vanilla ice cream), and a flourless chocolate cake (which came with green tea ice cream). We asked for writing on the plate of one of the desserts as a surprise and the staff was so accommodating. Our server Cory was the best and another waiter also assisted who was phenomenal. They never let our waters go empty and they were the kindest, and most relaxed, and friendly. We loved this place! The interior decor is also a 10/10. Would definitely recommend.",1,,

The crab cakes were delicious, but the presentation of the waffle was a bit underwhelming. It looked like a nice waffle made out at my house with a waffle iron. The service was good, water refilled promptly and sharing plates were offered.

We were seated immediately and food came out really fast! Our server was helpful, giving us some specific recommendations as opposed to the usual (and unhelpful) ""everything's great!"" My friend got the Acai Bowl and enjoyed how refreshing it was. A big plus for the great textures going on - with a fun mixture of granola, fresh berries, bananas, and chocolate! I got the recommended Mushroom Omelette and thought it was just alright. There are 2 camps for omelette lovers: Camp 1 for those that like the toppings/ingredients tossed in with the eggs and Camp 2 for those that like the egg to be separated and serve almost like a case for the toppings. I'm a happy member of Camp 1 so I was a little disappointed that my omelette was more like an egg burrito for the mushrooms. the eggs themselves were fluffy but almost tasted artificial. The texture was very reminiscent of the types of omelettes I would be served on long international flights - just abnormally thick and soft. The filling was a combo of mushroom and gruyere, with a light sprinkling of tomatoes. It felt a bit too oily for my taste and I didn't love it. Overall, not the best brunch option in the city but def a good find if you're looking for a fast, stress-free meal.",2,,1

I also love the small arugula salad that comes with it. I've had the grilled cheese, which is delicious as well, but you want to be in a food coma after it.

We also ordered a waffle which was great. The drinks were wonderful, the usual Mamosa and Bloody Mary. The menu was a little bit small though. The staff was fantastic, I accidentally spilled my drink and they were super nice and made me another one right away. The bathrooms were gender neutral and very clean. Awesome place!",,,

The ambiance is casual, with dim lighting and loud conversations reverberating from every surface. Oddly, you stop noticing the noise level and relax into the experience very quickly.The service is always courteous and swift. You won't be disappointed.First visited in February 2017. A group of 15, we showed up on a Monday 8:30PM without a reservation, and were quickly and pleasantly seated. The staff pushed together booth tables in the corner to fit us all. Points for being so proactive and accommodating. We were celebrating a surprise engagement, so everyone received a complementary glass of rose from the establishment. A nice touch. Ordered Greek and kale salads--light and fresh, nothing crazy, preferred the kale salad with quinoa. Also got several 8 oz steaks. A tiny piece and guys were hungry even after a side of fries (that you had to order separately). But that's to be expected of a $20 small steak that comes without a side, just a lonely piece of protein.The second visit happened exactly a year later, for a date. The menu was updated, which was a surprise. Got the mac and cheese and the lamb burger. Mac and cheese was good, but nothing that you won't find anywhere else. You can get the appetizer or the entree portion. The lamb burger was very juicy and delicious. The grilled peppers and spicy mayo sauce paired well with the tender meat. Exceeded my expectations. The side of fries was on the bland side.Overall, nothing extraordinary but do recommend for a visit.",1,,

63,Liz A.,"Islip, NY",165,44,36,3.0,12/17/2017,"For brunch in the city, unimpressive overall. The service sucked and honestly seemed super judgmental? Like the waiter helping us had such an attitude. And then he disappears half way through the meal..I understand the food industry, how it works, etc. I know wait staff has to take breaks and sometimes those happen to be mid-meal. But this guy gave us no notice he was leaving, didn't ask how our omelettes came out, and then we sat waiting for the check for 20 minutes until a different waitress came up to take our plates and said he was on his break. Not cool. Other than that, food came relatively quickly and was good. At first glance the omelette seems small but is very filling. I got the seasonal vegetable omelette and it was delish, except they don't make modifications to a meal so when I asked if they could sub mushrooms (currently on the menu for other omelettes) for the tomatoes, they refused. No big deal, I understand why that happens, but just good to know before going in. Also got a blueberry muffin on the side which was one of the best I've had. Coffee was average, nothing great. No sweet n low on the table and when the table next to us (who got four coffees and only one tiny creamer pitcher) asked for extra milk, I heard the waiter (same as ours) curse under his breath about it. So unprofessional!!Lastly, they stop serving breakfast after 10:45 which also isn't a big deal, but I HATE feeling like I'm being rushed out. The kitchen is open so you hear everything that goes on & it sounded like they were throwing plates at the walls it was so loud. They were cleaning the kitchen (I guess) after the brunch crowd but it was so loud and rude I couldn't even hear my bf talking!! Seemed rude. If you need more time to clean between breakfast and lunch, stop serving at 10:30 or earlier. It's not the customers' faults for coming later when it's available. I felt so badly for the people sitting right next to the kitchen...it must have sounded like a war zone. Overall, good meal but wouldn't go back. Of all the brunch spots in the city this was definitely sub-par. It probably was sub-par compared to others just on that block. Came to $51 for two omelettes and two cups of coffee & the muffin. A little much, but kind of expected from an uppity little place like that.",3,,

My friend and I risked our chances and arrived at 12PM and was able to get seated right away. The restaurant was fairly empty at the time but quickly filled up with reservations by the time we left.I had the chilled corn, Maine lobster, chili and scallion oil soup for $14, which was fairly interesting. It is cold like gazpacho, but has the creaminess of a bisque. I couldn't really taste any corn, but I did come across small chunks of lobster. The chili and scallion oil is drizzled on top so be sure to mix it in, since it's spicy. My friend made the mistake of not mixing it in and coughed from the spiciness.For my entree, I had the wild king salmon for $28. It was beautifully done - the skin was super crispy and the portion size was decent. It was paired with a delicious pea sauce and wild mushrooms on the bottom. On top, it was covered with alfalfa sprouts, which I find incredibly hard to eat elegantly so I left those mostly untouched.Service was great - my waitress and the manager both checked in with us a few times (this was before they got busy). Everything came out in a timely manner.The funny quirk of this place is that it's located on the ground floor attached to a hotel so the bathroom is part of the hotel.",2,,1

Updated review","Only went here because an out of town guest was staying nearby, and it was an absolutely miserable experience. We made an 8pm reservation and showed up 10 minutes early. Our table wasn't ready yet, which wasn't a problem, we waited about 15 minutes. We then checked again and were told it would be another 20 minutes. Very frustrating to make a reservation and still have a long wait, but we understand how NYC restaurants work. We were seated and ordered apps. We made sure to check if one of the dishes contained my allergen, which it did, so I ordered oysters instead and the rest of the party ate the other dish. The oysters were bad - literally had gone bad. I had to spit one out and left the remaining ones. We ordered dinner and I again asked about my allergen. The waiter said it did contain it, so I asked for a slight modification. He then said ""I cannot guarantee no cross contamination."" What? I told him it was an allergy, and I cannot eat it without becoming sick. He wrote something down then took the orders of the rest of the table. The food was just fine, definitely not worth the nearly $30 for a pork shank with no sides. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. 45 minutes at which point we asked multiple different people for a check because our waiter had disappeared (different waiters, the host, and even the manager of the restaurant). Finally we said if we didn't get the bill in 5 minutes we'd be leaving. They then brought over the bill and said ""we took off your drinks as an apology,"" which was appreciated. We paid and left, and the host yelled out a snobby response as we were leaving, saying what a bad time we had. All in all, a poor dinner indeed.",,,

Didn't make a reservation but strangely when I walked in the host asked me to provide my full name & phone # to make a reservation on the spot? Was seated promptly even though my friend didn't come for about another 20 minutes. But once she showed, it was really hard to get their attention. Like even with waving and whatnot. The servers were all clumped in a group attending to something else. So half a star off for occasionally inattentive service.Ordered the tomato & bacon bisque, mac & cheese, burger with fries, and the kale & quinoa salad.I love kale salads, and I really liked that it was mostly kale and not all grains. Really refreshing, which was necessary for all the other heavy food.The bisque tasted more bacon than tomato. Personally not the biggest fan of bacon (I know, gasp), so I'd pass on this next time. It also came out a little colder than I usually want my soup? Loved the mac & cheese. Not stringy, more like soupyish? But so hot & yum. Burger was good! You also pick the type of cheese you want. They cut it in half for us. It usually comes with salad or chips, and you have to unfortunately pay $3 more for fries :( Had two glasses of wine and total came out a lot higher than I had expected, over $100. But I would come back if I'm trying to eat around the Bryant Park area!",,,1

The entrance is the bar area and it was filled with people who were probably there for happy hour/waiting for available tables. It was pretty packed for a Thursday. Two friends were running late but they seated us first, in the back corner. I ordered the squid ink spaghetti (side dish size) an order of fries, and a glass of Rose. They offer the pastas in two sizes: side $16 or regular entree $26. The portion they give you is palm sized. There are a few pieces of squid on top, and a wedge of lemon on the side. This dish was flavorful and the lemony taste complimented the dish well. The eggplant french fries were delicious. I usually stay away from eggplant because of the texture but the way they made it was perfectly fried and tasty, especially with the sauce they provide.

It was quite pricey for the taste of food even by New York standards and the portions a bit small, though the brunch reviews look promising and perhaps dinner is more worth it. The restaurant interior itself is lovely though, the booths are raised and quite cozy! Our server was great as well.",,,

Eggplant fries!? Yes curry aioli!? Oh yes! So yum! My cousin ordered the hanger steak she said was awesome and then there was her side of mashed potatoes. They were hands down the best mashed potatoes any of us had ever had. We joked they were like a cloud of delicious happiness lol,,,
77,Van P.,"Sterling, VA",1,23,40,4.0,12/4/2017,We decided to come to Parker & Quinn for breakfast. Sunday morning at 9am is the way to go. NYC streets weren't full yet (I'm sure most people were still sleeping and hungover) and we got seated quickly with our reservation. The food was great! My husband had the malted waffles and sausages and I got the Crab cake eggs Benedict with a side of cheddar bacon grits. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach. The portion sizes here did not disappoint! Everything was huge and everything tasted amazing. The reason for the 4 star is because our waitress took about 15 minutes to get to us for our order. She looked like she was still waking up/would love to join us for some greasy delicious food to cure her hangover. She seemed to have woken up a bit right before we left though and was fairly friendly which was why I kept it at 4 stars!,1,,

79,Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,112,10,3.0,11/1/2018,"Went here for lunch with friends and sat at the hotel bar because it was too crowded. We actually preferred this as it was quite loud at lunchtime in the main dining room. Tables also looked very close together. We ordered the mozzarella which I highly recommend! It feeds more than 2 people... but ask for more bread. They don't give you enough. The appetizer came quickly but then our entrees took forever. The runner kept coming up with other people's food and we kept saying nope not ours. When it finally came it was mediocre. My friends got the veggie burger and they said the yogurt spread was weird but they got used to it and ultimately liked the burger. I got a Caesar salad with salmon and was asked how I wanted it cooked.  I said medium well. When it arrived, the salmon was severely undercooked for my taste but we had waited so long I didn't want to wait more time to get just a salad. The salad was watery, worst Caesar salad I have ever had. The dressing was loose and watery and had no flavor at all. The lettuce was in large chunks making it hard to eat as well. The croutons and the cheese crisps were the same size and texture and they did not work on the salad. The burgers came with chips and we opted for one order of fries. The chips are nothing special, kettle chips probably straight from a bag and the fries were way too overdone for my taste. Go for the cheese but skip the salad...",,,
80,Mahmood S.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",46,177,304,2.0,4/21/2017,"Had really high hopes for this place and was pretty disappointed in just about all of it.From the start, the place was half empty and the lady in the front asked if we had a reservation, fair question if we called ahead, we didn't and just needed a table for two. She proceeds to ask for a full name and phone number? Ok, weird start but I want some breakfast.Get to the table, no water served, asked for water, food came, still no water, ask for water, get a cup, no bottle. Ok I'm not that thirsty anyway.16 dollar waffle. Yes, a waffle. A single waffle for 16.00 USD. Has to be a great waffle, right? Wrong. It's completely average. In fact the best thing about the waffle wasn't even the waffle, it was the cream topping. Surly my friend got a better deal with his acai bowl? Again, wrong. The bowl was a third ice and half made up of blueberries. Maybe 1/6 of the paste itself was acai. Something I'd expect from a corner store or a tourist trap. Bill came out, payed 40.00 for this meal. Now I don't mind paying 40 bucks for breakfast. I DO mind paying 40 bucks for a breakfast worth 10. Wouldn't recommend or return to this place in my lifetime. It got 2/5 starts because 1. The food was clean and I didn't get sick2. The place was well decorated",4,,

I was hungry so I didn't care where we went as long as I had food in me.They were serving brunch until 3pm and Mahmoud wanted a pancake (which they were not serving as it is only on the breakfast menu) so he unhappily opted for the waffle. I, on the other hand, ordered an acai bowl. I enjoyed my bowl, my friend on the other hand was not satisfied with his waffle. You could tell it didn't fill him up because it was only one waffle.I thought the acai bowl was pretty good. A good portion filled with fruits and It had pieces of chocolate too. It comes with peanut butter but I told them to hold off on that because hat didn't sound too good",1,2,2

My drink was just okay. Drinks in NYC everywhere we went including Parker and Quinn are $12-19 each and not even strong. We also had French dip and a flatbread. All good!

83,Jay K.,"New York, NY",31,174,139,5.0,6/10/2017,"Great place in midtown. Located inside The Refinery Hotel. Here are my thoughts:Space- casual, but very lively vibe; 1920s/sporty decorMenu(dinner)- has a little bit of everything. Got the octopus, tuna tartar, and the spread as starters. Octopus was my favorite. Ordered the scallop for my entree and it was delicious. Drinks- were made perfectly and the wine selection was nice too.Service- exceptional. Our server was great and the manager(Kevin) and maitre d'(Ana) were great. They made sure everyone was taken care of and seemed to be checking every table to make sure all was well, which was definitely a very nice touch.This is a great place for casual dates, groups gatherings, and/or to catch up with a friend or two over drinks and bites. They have a fairly large menu and have a wide selection of everything, even for vegetarians. I would highly recommend this place for dinner. Heard their brunch is just as good, but haven't tried it yet- will soon!",,,

Moscow mule and glass of Riesling.  The pizza came out in like 5 min, which was impressive and the Greek salad was very filling as well.  I was a little turned off that as soon as I sat down and ordered the Moscow they asked for my credit card,  a little rude and tacky, but I'm guessing they been stood up one time too many. The pizza was flavorful although they don't have gluten free,but I will be ok I hope!!!!",,,

Updated review",Hilarious and insulting... the hotel screwed up yesterday and the day before. We woke up this morning and manager left 2 complimentary breakfast vouchers and a note for their mistake. We didn't expect a thing. We thought it was kind so headed down for breakfast. Our server brings this bill to our table as if we weren't going to give him a tip?!? Wooow we were planning on giving the server a larger tip until the insult arrived. Did they think we are cheap and have no class? Yesterday when we had breakfast here our bill NEVER had a gratuity added ... and we left a very nice tip for our server .... hmmmm unbelievable!! Horrible negative stars Update: I appreciate the owner sending a note to apologize and stating it's their policy to add gratuity to the bill to protect their hard working servers. I find it hard to believe that anyone would assume a gratuity is automatic on a voucher. I would suggest adding gratuity to each and every bill to prevent any future mishaps when the server forgets to explain.,7,4,2

It was really loud and packed at the front during happy hour on a Tuesday evening. Fortunately made reservations for a table of 3 at 7PM. we were seated instantly at the cute booths they have right next to the bar in the front. Thought it was nice seating, it's super loud in that area. So I wouldn't recommend it if you're trying to cAtch up with someone. We ordered the 3 for $35 flat breads. I rly liked the mushroom one. The pepperoni was a little spicy. And the BBQ had pretty good mozzarella on it. Size-wise I'd say a person could prob have a flatbread to himself and be content. We also ordered the cauliflower and the Brussels sprouts on the side which were seasoned so greatly. LOVED them. I wish there was more since they were $10 a plate of veggies.",,,3

89,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1478,4331,4.0,3/23/2017,"Excellent brunch, though definitely at midtown prices. I will say that $17 (ouch) for the caramelized apple French toast was well spent in the end, as it was super delicious and a hearty portion, but still. I also enjoyed a side of cheesy bacon grits and the coffee was great. Decent service.Update 4/2017: Grilled cheese is amazing. Possibly the best I've ever had. Fries are also superb.Update 7/2017: Lamb burger. SO GOOD. Update 3/2018: Was a little let down during my last lunch here. The dressing on the chicken Caesar salad had an odd flavor to it - I think it was from a spice, but either way I was not into it. Iced coffee was kind of weak. I also had the Jacques Torres sampler for dessert but the chocolate seemed old to me; the truffles had that dusty look to them and they tasted a bit stale. I will say the caramel cheesecake was amazing - don't miss it!",4,2,1

Twice was for dinner and once was for brunch. For weekend brunch, my friend and I did not have reservations so we got to sit at the bar (which was full service) and eat from there. The cookie skillet is HIGHLY recommended...absolutely amazing (even better than Boulton & Watt, which I've sworn by for the past few years, but I think have since went downhill) even though it's slightly pricey. What was annoying was that for dinner, it was an absurd additional cost to change to fries or something instead of sticking with the chips that the entrees came with.

Why have reservation availability on Open Table if they aren't accepted?  And why rush patrons to complete a meal when there are multiple other available tables?  Either this hostess was mis-informed or mgmt needs to make adjustments.As for food - that was good!",1,,

My friends got the kale sale, house salad and margarita flatbread. The eggplant fries and normal fries are also good.

I could pull the steak apart with my fingers it was so tender.  The sprouts had a sauce that was decadent and wonderful. The best I have ever had (sorry mom) Service was top notch.  Had no lease then 4 different team members ensure everything was well. Outstanding !!!

100,Elly W.,"Queens, NY",53,200,45,4.0,4/1/2018,"Got a reservation and was promptly seated on time. We order the crab cake, waffle, and  acai bowl.Crab cake tasted standard, it had a lot of crab but the crab tasted like canned crab. The salad that came with it was better than the crab cake.Waffle isn't filling at all. It was warm and had a fluffy texture inside but it just tasted like a waffle, the saving grace for the waffle was the maple syrup. The syrup is better than Clinton's pancake.The acai bowl was fresh, some of the berries was sour. I like the crunch from the granola and the unexpected shaving of chocolate in it, that was a pleasant surprise. The acai tasted like a berry smoothie/icy. But once it started to melt, it became very soupy and that was hard to eat and didn't taste as great. Again, I don't know how anyone can get full with just ordering this.Staff was great.Bathroom looked very raw/ outdated. Not good for babies because they don't have a changing table in it. For the price they charge for brunch and the average tasting food, I would not be back for brunch.",1,,

Great place to meet up with friends/co-workers after a long day. But, I had just flown in from LA for a work trip and met up with my best friend for a ""nice"" dinner.  We usually have awesome dining experiences together and really relied on Yelp's reviews to find this place equidistant from my hotel and her apartment. We started with the octopus - the plate was clean.  It was cooked PERFECTLY and the couscous added nice texture.  For our entrees, we both ordered the scallops. We both had scallops left on our plates. Now, they weren't BAD by any means - but it was obvious that they were cooked inconsistently. Her plate had scallops with that looked as if they had been seared perfectly.  Mine, not so much.  Flavor was good, but we had high expectations as the server made it sound AMAZING. Maybe we should have gone with his other recommendation: a steak - but when there's so many phenomenal steak houses within walking distance, scallops seemed like a better choice.Now, the thing totally worth trying here: Eggplant fries!  Weird, right? Yes! But so good!  I have eaten all over the planet and never seen eggplant fries on any other menu.  I'm glad that they made this establishment memorable for me.

The crust was so hard that it actually CRACKED the bottom of my tooth after the first bite. I didn't notice until I got home and my mouth was bleeding, I thought a piece of bread was just stick in there. Nope. Tooth is cracked and now I have to pay a few hundred to get it fixed. The rest of the food honestly just tasted mediocre, even if they were half the price we paid it wouldn't be worth it. I barely ate half of what we ordered.

We were here for brunch and had the malted waffle, apple French toast, crab cake Benedict, and a simple 2 egg breakfast. It was all so good. The malted waffle was easily the best waffle I have eaten in my life, topped with a meaty salted butter and all natural maple syrup. The carmalized Apple French toast was served over a creek brûlée and also amazing.The vibe of this place was great too! Small booths for 4-6 lines the walls and small tables for 2 were along side.

115,Tahir N.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,53,31,3.0,11/12/2017,"So, I really wanted to give this place a higher rating. The food is OK and the service is friendly but also a little indifferent. Here is what I mean: we arrived an hour before our reservation and they accommodated us I will bring it up. Easy to do as this was a Sunday morning at 8:30 AM and the place was less than half-full. They gave plenty of time to order as we were waiting for my daughter to join us. But here's the thing, our waitress was friendly but I had to ask her each time I wanted a warm-up for my coffee. Elsewhere in the country it is the practice to have someone go around with a pot of coffee offering refills, but here they take your cup and refill it at some station out of sight.The bakers basket is 4 pastries and is supposed to come with butter but it did not. The Side order of bacon was a good portion but arrived warm rather than hot and quickly got cold.Roasted vegetable omelette, rather than having next vegetables inside, instead was an omelette placed over roasted vegetables.The blackberries in the berry medley were excellent, but at nine dollars for less than a half pint of berries I would expect the raspberries and strawberries and blueberries to be perfect as well. Well this review may sound negative, but I would go back to this place for lunch or dinner. I bet they do a burger or steak pretty well.",,,
116,Olivia T.,"San Francisco, CA",207,202,259,3.0,3/17/2018,Had brunch here yesterday.  It's pretty mediocre and overpriced.  Had a mushroom flat bread which had decent flavor but was very small and super salty.  Also had steak tartare - which was average.  Didn't like that it came with buttered white bread because the soft texture just doesnt go with tartare.  Would be better with toast points.  Also had grilled cheese with tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was the best thing here by far.  Really good.  Tomato soup was unimpressive.,,,

119,Jeff C.,"Arlington, TX",74,54,3,5.0,7/13/2017,"We were on a family vacation and chose Parker and Quinn the night we were going to a Broadway show. As another Yelp! review said, and I agree, P&Q is upscale without being fussy or stuffy. The vibe and decor is warm and inviting in a throwback almost prohibition style with oversized booths, high tops with bar stools and a lot of leather, marble and dark toned wood. My wife, daughter and I all ordered appetizers before our entrees. They had the soups- chilled lobster and corn, and the tomato bacon bisque. I opted for the greek salad. All three were excellent!  Warm bread was delivered to the table too. For our entrees they chose the salmon and hangar steak (which P&Q is known for) and I had the bone in pork chop. Once again, all three were winners. Well prepared and tasty. Special note for the street corn side too! Good stuff...especially coming from a Texan who loves elotes. This place would get 5 stars for the food, decor, and location alone from me.  But for our total experience, Parker and Quinn absolutely over-delivered on the 5 star rating with their friendly, professional and personal service from the GM Chris to the other floor managers down to our waiter.  It started before we even arrived. My teenager has a few food allergies and had contacted the restaurant before our visit to ask about ingredients in various dishes she might have ordered. Not only did they respond, they sent a special menu outlining all allergens. Even as she emailed back and forth a few times the responses were always timely, friendly and informative. Once we checked in for our reservation Chris and members of his team came to our table to personally introduce themselves, say hi to my daughter and to ensure we had a great dining experience. Wow. Is this New York City? Very impressive.  And as noted, that management team sets the tone for the entire staff at Parker and Quinn. And literally, the ""cherry' on top was the complimentary bowl of fresh berries delivered to our table for desert.  Highly recommended!",3,,
120,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, NY",202,201,22,4.0,7/17/2017,"Really enjoyed dinner at Parker and Quinn last week.The best thing, in my eyes, about this place is the atmosphere. Bustling space for those looking for a post-work bite or happy hour. The layout is beautiful - modern and elegant yet non-pretentious. Almost reminded me of a more laid-back version of American Cut or North End Grill.The menu can get pricey, so pick and choose wisely. We opted for the 3 for $35 flatbread pizzas, which were generously-sized and delicious. The mushroom with truffle and caramelized onions was especially good!Good to note that you can make a reservation here, for even a party of two!",2,,

We got a mozzarella appetizer and tuna tartare to share. I got the kale salad with salmon and my friend got the mushroom flatbread. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the tuna tartare and the kale salad. Tuna tarter was really nice and refreshing. The salmon in the salad was cooked to perfection, skin was nice and crispy. Food portion is on the bigger side, the mozzarella appetizer can easily be an entree and the kale salad will probably feed two ladies! All waitstaff was very nice, my water glass was never empty, and everyone always came with a smile! We were too full to try out their dessert but we'll come back next time for sure!",,,

After walking the city up and down, speaking several langugaes, and jockeying for a free breakfast, I. came across a sign. ""The best breakfast in New York"". I had one thought. Hyperbole. Making it a mission of mine to counter commercial mendacity wherever it rears its ubiquitous head, I walked straight through those art deco doors and asked the hostess with Socratic severity, ""Is this really the best breakfast in New York?"" She answers steadfast and true. ""It is"". Showing my alacrity to test that claim, I ordered two breakfasts instead of one. Why not? I had no money left but make it a point to lose nothing. As soon as the food arrived, I was rewarded for my faith. A perfectly cooked omelette! I whispered Keats into my own ear... ""Do I wake? Or do I sleep"". End of Part 1.",,,
128,Lauren G.,"Verona, NJ",60,91,65,5.0,7/11/2018,Came to Parker and Quinn yesterday with a small group of coworkers for dinner around 7:30 pm. We had a reservation and were seated quickly in a cool higher up booth (you have about three steps from main floor to your booth). Very comfy seating ! I would highly recommend a reservation as it was very busy- for good reason because it was delicious! I ordered the quinoa burger without the buns- it was so delicious and moist - I was blown away. We also ordered the eggplant fries and shishito peppers which were really tasty as well. My spicy pineapple drink was made superbly - strong and spicy ( how I like it). Be mindful this is not a cheap drink spot but I think it is worth shelling out the extra bucks,,,

131,Nicole L.,"Queens, NY",364,8,16,5.0,10/25/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The place was pretty full and I didn't have a reservation. Just me and one other person and it took about 10 minutes to be seated but we had a small little high top, which was fine, but I would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time just in case. The decor and ambience of the restaurant/bar was very nice looking. The lunch menu has a good amount of options and I was very tempted with multiple different meals to order. I haven't read a ton of reviews for here so I didn't know what to except really but was very pleasantly surprised. We ended up going with the meatballs as the appetizer. Honestly they were mouthwatering. I could have kept eating them if I had more. For our meal we both ended up going with the French dip sandwich. Also went out of my norm here with the shredded steak being the meat on the sandwich. But it was literally so good. The meat was also mouthwatering like the meatballs. I chose the French fries as my side which did not disappoint at all. Overall no complaints for Parker & Quinn. I especially recommend it if you work in midtown and are looking for a longer lunch or special occasion lunch.",,,

137,Hasan Y.,"New Haven, CT",21,2,1,1.0,8/12/2018,"Highly unrecommended. Not because of food, but the waiters brough a bill with slightly more expensive prices compared to the menu for some of the items. It was possible that we could not notice it if we did not check it carefully. When we warned them, they immediately took action (without doubt) and brought a new bill where they did not charge some of the things we ordered (felt like bribe). Very unprofessional. I highly suspect that lots of people are scammed in this place (small amounts but when you add all on a big city like NYC it can be enormous).",,,

The food quality is good but not great. The burrata skin was a bit thick and slightly chewy and the flavors just weren't bursting in any way. The squid ink pasta was fine and it's sauce was yummy but the calamari was rubbery and the ""large"" portion size is quite small for $26. In a previous visit, the chicken sliders were good and the ""small"" mac n cheese was tasty but tiny. Overall this place might slide by for 4 stars on atmosphere, service, and food if it weren't for high prices and small portions that make me mark down its overall value.",,,

Now I'm already on my way down and we need to figure out another place in the area that's super close. It was freezing outside and neither of us wanted to roam around.

The bagel tasted as if it was from yesterday, it was toasted when I ordered and then left on the plate until the hot food was ready. The mushroom omelet was boring, missing flavor, and could have used more cheese. Grits were the only thing that was good.Now service: again understaffed I get that, but our server took over 7 min to greet us, forgot our coffee, and never came back to fill up our water glasses.

I also find the staff in here to be super accommodating. I took two of my friends here who were visiting. We were told that a table would be an hours wait (granted, we didn't book so expected this).

I desperately needed an outlet to charge my phone. The hostess advised me that there was an outlet at the bar, offered to take my phone over and plug it in, and gave me the disclaimer that the restaurant would, understandably, not be responsible if someone walked off with my phone. I was gracious for her offering to help AND sort of reminding me that people will be people. My phone stayed plugged in at the bar behind me and was left untouched, thankfully.This place seems to be good for a party of about 8 or 10 to gather for a special occasion. The ambiance gives that typical ""NYC"" feel in my opinion - dark walls and furniture with a ""retro"" design. The location is just a few blocks from Herald Square.I had the French toast topped with caramelized apples. It was tasty, not too sweet (even after adding maple syrup), and just the right serving amount where I didn't feel over-stuffed after finishing the whole dish. To drink, I had the strawberry Bellini. The taste of fresh strawberries was apparent, and I definitely savored every sip. Make the trip into Manhattan and try this place out!",,,
161,Ray Y.,"Greenfield, IN",8,296,340,3.0,6/9/2017,"This is my first time here and it impresses me with a very weird service attitude at the front desk. We came here at 11:30 am which is the opening time for this place on a Friday morning. We only asked a table for two and the lady at the front desk asked for full name and phone number for a ""quick reservation"". After we came in, there were only a few tables taken, but we were still arranged at a high table which is very tiny and we felt very uncomfortable. Are you serious? You got almost all your tables reserved at 11:30am so that we have to be put on a what they called ""quick reservation list"" and be arranged to be seated at a tiny high table? Luckily the server for our table move us to another table after we order large plate dishes.We had a full dozen of raw oysters, lamb rigatoni and Portugal octopus. Portugal octopus itself worths a five star rate because it is well baked and comes with mashed potato and salad on the base. Tasty and well done! Raw oysters are fair too. However, lamb rigatoni is nothing special and makes me feel like some kind of rigatoni from cheap Italian restaurants in Italian town. For an overall rate, this place worths a 3* rate.",,,

The arugula salad has the best simple and tasty dressing I ever had. The French toast is served with real maple syrup, not like other places that brag about real maple syrup and what you got it's corn syrup. These people know business and I mean it.Everything was super delicious. Our waitress Joanna was great and helpful, she knew what to suggest and how to guide us while making up our minds to order. Since the menu was so good, it was really hard to choose, but she helped us and we appreciated it!If you try to book a table through open table, the system would tell you that they aren't accepting people until 4pm, but don't believe it. Just go and show up there and you will get a table really fast. That happened to us.I'm giving them 5 stars because they deserve it and this is the best brunch place on Midtown.

The tomato-bacon bisque was warm and well seasoned. Our burger, ordered medium-rare came out as expected , and tasted great! My rigatoni with lamb meat sauce was also delicious! We're grateful for the great food and service from the staff at Parker and Quinn. God bless",,,
165,Tom R.,"Laytonsville, MD",20,7,0,5.0,3/11/2018,Wait was 30-45 minutes on a Saturday evening. We were able to get immediate seating at the chefs bar area and it was nice and fairly quiet. Really enjoyed the quinoa veggie burger and salad. Got all the toppings for the burger on the side and fixed it the way I wanted. Staff was friendly and service was good. No complaints about this place.,,,
166,Kristin S.,"Charlotte, NC",11,6,7,5.0,11/15/2017,"Great find in the city!  Retro, classy feel - with an excellent brunch menu.  I recommend the donuts - they're more of a cream puff drizzled with caramel - I had to hold myself back from ordering a second round!  If you like a little alcohol with your brunch - try the Parker and Pear - now THAT I did order two of!  The fried chicken sandwich is the best I've ever had.  The service was excellent.  I will definitely be back!",1,,

We ordered the Margherita flatbread and burger that comes with side of fries/ chips/ salad. They were out of chips so we got the fries which were decent. The food was average, a bit expensive. The ambience is nice and if I am in the area I wouldn't mind sitting here for a couple of drinks. The servers were super nice and ambience quite good.",,,
168,Jennifer S.,"New York, NY",16,663,0,3.0,5/26/2018,"Parker & Quinn offered a nice spot to celebrate a friend's birthday!  The atmosphere is trendy, yet classic.  Our party of five sat in the elevated green-leathered booths that look over the bar/restaurant so we felt extra special.  We ordered several goodies for the table to split: two mushroom flatbreads, the sausage/burrata flatbread, the large mac/cheese, the kale/quinoa salad, and the eggplant fries.  Together, this combo was plenty of food.  Overall, each dish was enjoyable.  The kale/quinoa salad was my favorite; it was exceptionally made.  I also really liked the eggplant fries.  I was afraid when we ordered them that they'd be soggy/oily, yet somehow they were firm and crisp!  The mac/cheese and flatbreads, particularly the mushroom, were solid but also nothing to rush back for.  It was crowded so I highly recommend making a reservation in advance if you want to sit, especially with a larger party.  (we had reservations)",,,
169,Annie L.,"New York, NY",282,129,15,3.0,5/29/2017,"Came here for breakfast/brunch with some college friends on Memorial Day. We came quite early, probably around 10am, so it wasn't crowded. I got a coffee, which came in a huge Parker & Quinn mug. They serve Kobrick's, which is decent in my opinion. For my entree, I ordered the waffle with the add-on of rum-coated fruits, thinking it'd include fresh berries or bananas or something of the sort. It was disappointing to be frank. The dish wasn't cheap and the so called ""fruits"" were an additional $3...What I ended up with was an average looking Belgium waffle with some candied-looking dried fruits, whcih I couldn't even really figure out, and a side of maple syrup that was a tad too watery. However, I may have just ordered the wrong dish, because my friends' food all looked delicious. Two of them got the crab cake benedict, which came with an arugula side salad. The other got the ""eggs from hell"", which came with focaccia. He also ordered an everything bagel on the side. Those other dishes looked very ""gram""-worthy, unlike my waffle. We all cleared our plates though.The waitress was pretty nice, and the manager also stopped by and asked us how our food was. All in all, a relatively decent option for brunch/breakfast if I was back in the area, but I sure won't be ordering the waffle again...",,,

171,Stephen K.,"Middletown, NJ",1,4,2,5.0,4/16/2018,"My girlfriend & I went on a Friday night for dinner (drove in from New Jersey).We had a 6:30 reservation, but were not able to make a showing until a few minutes before 7:00 due to traffic/parking. The hostess informed us we were out of luck because reservations are only held for 15 minutes and the next available time to sit & eat was 8:30. This was a bummer, but this was the only negative to our experience; and this is admittedly on us.We were told we could either go to the rooftop (with a different menu) or walk through to the attached Refinery Hotel and find seating in the Jazz lounge (where the same P&Q menu is found). We found an open couch with cocktail tables in front of it & the rest was fantastic. We started with the shishito peppers as an app -- LARGE portion, seasoned/cooked great, and the miso ranch they serve them with was the perfect compliment.We then ordered a few things to split.Pork chops -- great portion size (2 whole pork chops!) served in a korean bbq sauce. The flavor was incredible and they were some of the best cooked pork chops i've had. They gave 2 cloves of roasted garlic on the side, which was delicious spread on top of the chops.8oz. Hanger steak -- great steak, nothing out of the ordinary; but cooked well and the seasoning/sauce it was laying in was very good.Mac & Cheese -- very good breadcrumb top & good sauce (not just a lame cheese mix) on the inside. Very creamy and tasty. True comfort food. The only negative I can think of is that it was $16 for a side portion.Thai chili brussel sprouts -- delicious sauce, cooked very well (they seemed roasted to me), and nice cherry peppers as a garnish.The presentation of all the food was great, the service was admirable, and the Jazz lounge was a nice touch. A live band set up halfway through our meal and added a little bit extra to our experience at P&Q.Would recommend this spot to anyone staying at the Refinery Hotel, or anyone who lives/happens to be in the area & feeling hungry!",1,1,1
172,Carly F.,"New York, NY",31,56,8,3.0,4/8/2017,"Went here for lunch. I would describe the place as a gastropub. It is a good place for midtown, which doesn't have a lot of foodie places.  The bartender served us and he was very friendly.   The food came out quickly, which was great for a work lunch.  I  split the Mac and cheese and the grilled cheese.   Both were very tasty. However, the eggplant dip was served with only a few cucumber slices and chips. Since there were three of us, we asked for more cucumber and chips. Plus there was way too much dip for that amount of chips. However, when we got the bill we were shocked to see we were charged $7 for more chips and cucumbers.",2,,

The others at the table have the grilled veggie omelets and the eggs in hell.  They seemed to enjoy them.  However there were two curiosities.  One was that no bread was offered or served with any of the dishes, except for my bagel.  Personally, I think that's wrong.  The other was that we couldn't get iced coffee, or decaf tea, and no lemon came with the iced tea (we had to ask).",,,

Ambiance was beautiful, very chic somewhat mid century meets Art Deco. Started with a glass of rose which the server let me trade taste of complementary. We decided to get the kale salad and a cheeseburger which were both pretty good. I got the burger which was perfectly cooked with fries and my mom got the kill salad. I thought the kale salad was just OK but she seem to enjoy it very much. Manager came by to check on us at the end of our meal and was super friendly; wanted to make sure everything was perfect, which overall it was a great experience. Bill came to about $60 with the tip, which seems a little pricey for what we got, but then again, it is NYC.",,,

We made reservations for 130pm on a Saturday and were seated right away in one of the raised booths. We started off with the bubbly board ($45), which was a bottle of champagne (or was it prosecco? I can't recall.) and all the fixins to make your own Bellini. This was a big hit with our crew. Our party of 4 then ordered a couple plates each so we got to try a good portion of the menu and everything was simply delicious and on point. The wild mushroom omelet I had was fantastic along with the smashed potatoes which were cooked to a perfect crisp. The décor was beautiful which made for a wonderful ambiance and the staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating...even when I broke a glass on my foot, they quickly ran over to help me clean off. Thankfully, I didn't sustain any cuts. All in all, I will be back with others in tows.",1,,

Updated review","My second time returning to PQ turned into an epic fail, leaving myself and my friend disappointed in our meals.  We came on a Saturday afternoon around 12pm.  We were able to be seated right away which was nice, since we did not have a reservation.  That's about the best part of this meal.  We both ordered omelettes - mine being the wild mushroom and hers being the veggie omelette (with assorted vegetables) along with 2 ice coffees and a side of bacon and 2 sides of avocado.Our server seemed uninterested in general - fine, we weren't looking for amazing service.  Our coffee was surprisingly good and V strong. Our omelettes came out and we both have never seen a stranger looking omelette.The coloring of it and the smooth exterior of the omelette was odd, it almost looked like the fake eggs you get at McDonalds.  Neither omelette tasted good - My friends ""veggie"" omelette (with assorted veggies) had literally like 2 vegetables in it. My omelette had mushrooms that came out of a can just thrown inside with un-melted cheese. I will not be returning or recommending PQ anytime soon for brunch/any other meal - there are so many better options in the area.",1,,
182,Raina G.,"Edison, NJ",3,19,32,4.0,8/27/2018,"Stopped by after an internship, ready to feast on some great food. And fortunately, that is just what my dad and i had been served. We started off with the mozzarella + foccacia and the octopus carpaccio. The mozzarella app was mediocre; it was soft and fresh, the bread went well with it. But the octopus carpaccio.. that dish won my heart. The octopus was sliced thinly, topped with dashes of different seasonings that complemented it perfectly. Every bite had a variation of textures and flavors. For the entree, my dad and i shared the lamburger. There was a little too much goat cheese for my liking. However, the meat was tender and juicy. I would say it was a pretty solid burger, but I believe that it is a little over-hyped. Overall, I think that the restaurant's best quality is definitely the quality of the food- that octopus tasted so fresh! Not to mention, the prices are decent as well. I wouldn't mind coming back here!",,,

For breakfast we got the breakfast sandwich, the mushroom omelette, French toast and two orders of waffles, one with the fresh berries and cream. All was delicious! Would return for sure!

Every aspect of the dinner was great; I really have no complaints. The leather booths gave the place a modern day Mad Men feel, and the friendly and attentive servers added to the upscale but not fussy vibe. The menu is extensive and varied, so you'll find multiple options whether you're in the mood for a salad, a burger, a sandwich, pasta, or a meat-based entrée. My date and I started with the tomato and bacon bisque and shishito peppers, and we loved both of them. I ordered the kale and quinoa salad with grilled chicken as my main meal along with a side of the crispy cauliflower with vinegar golden raisins and was very happy with my choice. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, and the cauliflower is a must-order. There were so many veggie-based sides that I wanted to order, so I'll have to branch out next time. Make sure to save room for dessert, as they have quite a few tempting sweets. I was torn between the skillet chocolate chip cookie and the plum crisp, but ended up really happy I chose the crisp.

The food was great, but the service was horrible.Brussels- Seasoned with fish sauce, sweet chili, and sesame. It was uniquely flavorful. Definitely worth trying. ($9)Margherita Flatbread- I wish I took a photo of the incredibly uneven slices. How difficult is it to cut even slices for four people? One slice was insanely huge, one was skinny, another was super tiny, and luckily there was one normal looking slice. It tasted great though. ($12)Grilled Octopus- It was alright. ($13)Hanger Steak- It was salty, gamey, and left such an odd taste in my mouth. ($21)Salted Caramel Cheesecake- It was delicious! ($10)S'mores- Two scoops of Nutella gelato laid on a bed of crunchy wafer balls covered in chocolate sauce, and topped with graham crackers and toasted marshmallows. Wow, this was my favorite part of the night. Lovely presentation and amazing taste. The taste reminded me of Ferrero Rocher, but mixed with s'mores. I highly recommend it. ($10)Now, onto the service.Good thing my friend made reservations prior to dinner because it was insanely crowded. I loved the little vintage booth they seated us in. Our server left us with menus. Then, he disappeared for over half an hour. After he delivered the food, he disappeared into the darkness once again.After our entrees, we thought they would come with a dessert menu, but they cleaned up our table and forgot about us. I had to walk around to find a server and ask them for the dessert menu.After dessert, we sat there for close to an hour, without any servers in sight. I had to search for a server once again to ask for the check. Apparently, our server had left for the night, and they forgot to assign a new one to us.",8,2,2
