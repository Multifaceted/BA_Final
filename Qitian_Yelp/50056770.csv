0,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",58,130,510,4.0,9/11/2018,"They did the job. I was hungry and craving food. Breakfast food. After the cafeteria debacle I decided to walk home. With food still in my mind I asked a construction worker mining traffic what he had from breakfast. He directed me to Essen. I've spotted Essen around the city but I can honestly say I've never entered or eaten there. Well, when you're hungry and cannot find a decent restaurant - Essen steps in to save the day. I had the  mediterranean omelette and a mash pop. Service was quick, fresh made, and effectively executed. It was my first time so I was a little lost as to where to order.  Thankfully everyone was friendly and directed me. Oh and I had a side of bacon. There is seating on the upper level. I quietly sat upstairs and enjoyed my much sort after breakfast.  Thank You Essen!",1,,
1,Ben P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,1.0,9/18/2018,"The staff is simply unfriendly, unhelpful and rude. The convince and great selection is far outweighed by the shortcomings of the staff. Ask for eggs the way you like them, big inconvenience to the grill guy, they come out how he decide does to cook them. Stood at the counter waiting to get Ramen. All three people behind the counter see me, no one says anything. I ask for a Ramen am told I have to wait 10 min because they are not ready. I can see all that is needed. It's all prepped needs to be assembled. Nope I have to wait. Too crowded, unfriendly and just ok food. I'm done.",,,
2,Edward K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,88,6,2.0,8/9/2018,"Horrible management. good quality food, but pricey.1. Tried to order a pastrami and egg breakfast sandwich, but was told they only have pastrami for lunch. What? You literally have it, but refuse to sell it before lunchtime?...They lost a sale and I went to another place.2. Self-serve ice tea looked inviting, but when I got back to my office, it was ice coffee. NOT what I wanted.3. Came in at 11:05 to get lunch, but they were switching over from breakfast. I asked when I could order a sandwich and was told that started at 11:30. Fine. I saw pre-made chicken cesar wraps in the display case (about 20 of them) and asked the man if I could take one of those. He said no. So, the sandwiches will just sit there for 25 minutes before I can purchase? I said, should I really walk out and go to another place? Just got a blank stare.3 strikes Essen, this is a busy area, I can go elsewhere and tell all my friends and co-workers of your horrid customer service. Good-bye.",,,
3,Candice K.,"Atlantic Highlands, NJ",181,129,780,4.0,7/25/2018,"All in a New York Minute.   The coffee and juice is good, plenty of options for food.   One thing great about here is speed.   I tried the Super 6 (carrot, apple, celery, beet, cucumber) and it tastes great.  Juice was made in less than 30 seconds, I paid with credit card in less than 4 seconds.   Waited in line for maybe 20 seconds?  Lunch buffet is 10.99/lb and starts at 11:30 am.   There are so many options.   There is an upstairs too if you wanted to stay and eat.",3,1,3
4,Fateha A.,"Queens, NY",79,224,462,2.0,4/14/2018,I love buffets. I always get 50% more food than I can finish. I got lobster which was really good. The veggie dumplings were good. The salmon was good. The steak was good though although I didn't like how the flesh was pink on the inside (slightly blood too). The Fried wings were 1 of the WORST I've ever had. It was so bland. There wasn't even enough salt in it. I wonder whoever came up with the recipe ever heard of seasoning. The shrimp pasta was way too oily & the shrimp was bland. The Turkey breast was kinda dry & bland.,1,,
5,Stephanie S.,"Irvington, NJ",74,136,68,2.0,4/21/2018,This place is next door to my job so its convenient  but baby these prices are crazy. I think it's $10 a pound or something close to it which is high but we're on 8th so it's competitive pricing. As for the food it's ok I didn't try anything spectacular. The chicken and broccoli is not like ordering from a Chinese food restaurant it had a different taste it was ok. Sesame chicken chunk (the one piece I had) was ok. And the two wing flats I had was just ok. Nothing stood out to me and for $10 for that plate I should have been floored.I'm sure I'll be back since it's so close but only for emergency purposes lmao. I'll try something else and give an update.,,,
6,Wesley M.,"New York, NY",80,71,171,2.0,3/4/2018,"I have to mention how clean this place is. The food section had no spills around or on the counters and the floors had no stains or messes on them. I did visit early in the morning, so maybe that played a factor. I believe this place is fairly overpriced. At the buffet they charge by the pound so be aware of how much food you're piling on. It is $10+ per pound. There wasn't anything special about my meal. I had home fries, tater tots, a grilled chicken omelette and Turkey sausage. The home fries were soggy. The tater tots were oily and lacked basic seasoning. By far the omelette was the worse. It wasn't cooked properly... still runny and had a certain unpleasant taste. The only thing I enjoyed was the sausage which wasn't oily, and still had a snap to it. Won't be back.",,,
7,Ping K.,"Lake Oswego, OR",163,130,1223,5.0,2/8/2018,"Omg!! This place is a breakfast paradise! From 10's different types of scrambled eggs to hot noodle soup made fresh, to gazillion type of breakfast pastries, salad rolls, tarts, soups and donuts... and fresh fruits, all types including papayas!!!! I was speechless!! Their business model is awesome. Customers pack whatever they want in the to-go box and pay their food according to the weight. Check out is fast, food is fresh and all items are clearly marked and well displayed. Customers can pick up breakfast or brunch and be out within 10 min I will definitely come back when I am back to NY.",,,
8,Pamela L.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,26,6,2.0,4/2/2018,"There is no shortage of pay per pound eateries in midtown. It's not easy to make an impact unless you feature  salad, juice, noodle, rice bowl, and roast bars. 'ESSEN is equipped with these yet has managed to be one of the most expensive with poorest quality of service.  I went around 2pm, the eatery wasn't too crowded.  I stopped at the Pho station, caught the attention of one of the cooks and was given the equivalent of ""that's not my job"". Apparently it's also not his job to get the attention of the other cook.  When the Pho man finally came back, he served the guy BEHIND me.  I sat down to eat and there was a 6"" long strip of plastic intangled in the soup, the kind that might be discarded after opening a cigarette box. Never Again.",3,,
9,Laurie P.,"Oakland, CA",146,17,3,1.0,2/20/2018,"If I could give this place negative reviews I would. I just had a very tough 4 days of food poisoning thanks to eating what I'll admit looked like pre-made salads at their salad bar that had sat out way too long. When I just went in to let them know, in hopes it would prompt them to take more care in the future, the employee was hostile towards me and responded with ""how do you expect me to react when you come in here and insult us?""  I responded that I had been trying to do them a courtesy. I had hoped for an apology, and a response that they would likely into it. I entered in a good mood, finally well enough to walk over to let them know, and left crying and yelling. For the sake of public health, Do not eat here!!!!!!!!!!!!!",7,,
10,Yolanda R.,"Houston, TX",138,132,176,5.0,8/20/2018,"One word for this place AMAZING! I ate at this place over 7 times while in New York. They have so many food options. They have everything you would want for breakfast or lunch. They make fresh salads, sandwiches among many options. They are a big pricy and go by weight for the fresh food options. I wish this would open in Houston.",,,
11,Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",205,509,2651,4.0,9/3/2017,"This was pretty much my go-to place for getting a salad or a quick lunch. I didn't know before that the custom small salad cost $9 with one protein and unlimited toppings, which was a lot cheaper than the major salad chains. I liked how fresh the ingredients were. There normally had a line though.The food bar offered a variety of options. I finally tried it a few weeks ago, which wasn't bad at all.There were other stations like the noodle and sandwich stations. I definitely will give them a try one day.",3,,
12,Steven K.,"New York, NY",9,20,0,1.0,7/20/2018,"I was a regular customer...yep WAS a regular customer...My salad was overpriced by one dollar. I didn't see it until after I paid - incidentally, they throw the tiny receipt into the bottom of your bag, probably so you don't see how much they overcharge you until after you leave. So, I went back to the salad bar to ask the guy why I was overpriced. He explained to me that I ordered two dairy items and they charge a dollar for more than one. It would have been nice if the person who took my order had explained that to me beforehand. They seem to omit a lot of price information on their boards. I wanted to be polite so I told the man ""I understand, thank you for clearing it up for me!"". He then gave me the rudest look you would have thought I had insulted him. The cashiers are always rude so thats not a surprise. Yup, never going back there again...",1,,

WAY to many options for lunch to give them my money.",,,
14,Vaannila A.,"Louisville, KY",190,14,0,2.0,7/17/2018,"I've been here a couple times because its on my way home from work so I thought it might be a nice way to pick up a quick meal for dinner.Overall, the food is really poorly cooked. It's either way to greasy, undercooked, or incredibly stale. I felt a little sick from the last time I ate there, not sure from what exactly, but most of the items from the hot and cold food area is kind of gross to eat.I once tried the premade bowl of Poke they had out, and while this was a bit better than the rest of their food, the rice was way too hard and it was difficult to swallow. Still, it's OK food if you're in a pinch.",1,,

You can order some food for to go or grab anything you want from buffet style counters. Everything looks so fresh and delicious. We came there twice for breakfast. It's very convenient if you are in a hurry and need to grab real quick some food. We loved bagel with salmon and wraps with peanut butter and banana! The place has lots of healthy choices!

16,Adjoa N.,"New York, NY",3,28,5,2.0,7/9/2018,"I'm just tired of getting things so small, from the hot food area and having to leave it at the counter because the price is way too high!! wassup with the scale Essen?5 tiny sausage links in a counter and its over $6? Doesn't make sense. Left it right there at the register and took my oatmeal (btw oatmeal and soup are always a fixed price, the only reason I still go...)One time I paid about $16 for a soup and 2 small PIECES of a wrap....see the inconsistencies? overpriced scale. I do not suggest getting hot food here, but anything else that has a fixed price is your best bet. My advice is for Essen to adjust that scale so it actually makes sense. so us people who literally work across the street can eat there.",,,
17,Andrey L.,"San Francisco, CA",24,18,4,3.0,7/31/2018,"That's an OK place to have breakfast.

They have a wide range of options, including a sandwiches, soups, smoothies, and breakfast foods. As a health nut, I enjoy their cafeteria-style salads, including a couple different kale ones, an oriental one, a couscous one, an asparagus one, and more. Their service sucks, but that comes with the territory at these kinds of places. Lots of seating upstairs. Bathrooms downstairs. And free WiFi.

19,Alex W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,38,151,2.0,7/9/2018,"The food is really good however, the staff and management team can be short, rude and very dismissive. The establishment is very busy and attracts a lot of tourists throughout their business day. They open pretty early about 7:30 am, for breakfast.

20,Annette V.,"New York, NY",778,234,34,1.0,3/29/2018,"Took a quick look around and decided on the buffet. French toast was like a rock, eggs were tasteless and the hash browns were inedible. I had to go back down and purchase a smoothie since I just wasted $11 bucks and that was ok but let them know how you want the drink since they add juice to most all of them.

Then we were told that bagels could not be toasted because their toaster was broken. Okay. Then we were told that we couldn't order any brick oven sandwiches, eliminating another big portion of their menu. By this time I wondered what exactly we could have!We finally arrived at ordering chicken philly and a regular philly.

23,Leo L.,"New York, NY",99,377,1225,1.0,8/8/2017,"A little history for all my Midtown West-er. Before this stellar ( I use this term VERY loosely) deli changed their name to Essen, it was once called Amici 36. If you looked up their Yelp rating, you'd find that it was about the same as this place. Now, as a person who has visited both many times, I can safely say that there is no difference in the food or even the coffee. The only thing that has changed is the lay out. I usually come in to get coffee because its really hard to get sick from water that has been boiled w/ packaged coffee grinds. With that being said, the food here is another story. In the time that Essen has been open at this location, I've maybe bought food they've made personally under a handful of times. Out of those times, i felt sick after about half. Today was the final straw that broke the camel's back. After deciding to order a shrimp quesadilla and consuming it, 45 mins later at work, I was praying to the porcelain gods. Also, drinking any liquids will come straight out. Beautiful site, I know.So like any person whos been poisoned, I looked up their health grade. It was a B. What does that mean? Well let's see. "" Violations recorded in the following area (s) and a Notice of Violation issued at the reinspection conducted on 01/18/2017.""Critical"" violations are displayed in red.Violation points: 21Sanitary Violations1) Hot food item not held at or above 140º F.2) Cold food item held above 41º F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ºF) except during necessary preparation.3) Filth flies or food/refuse/sewage-associated (FRSA) flies present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Filth flies include house flies, little house flies, blow flies, bottle flies and flesh flies. Food/refuse/sewage-associated flies include fruit flies, drain flies and Phorid flies. ""TLDR - As of their last inspection in Jan 2017 their main violations was not keeping food at the proper temperature, hot or cold. What does this mean? That means that you can get sick very easily if consumed. ESPECIALLY If you do this with any seafood such as SHRIMP.  Also, the fly issue for number 3 is real. I've seen it before at the coffee section. Essen, you have a fucking buffet. What person would continue to buy food from you if they know that food you served wasn't properly handled? Do you think people like getting sick from your shitty food? I know that you guys deal in bulk and it's very easy to cut corners when dealing with a lot but for godsake, takes some pride in your business. Also, you should make a sign to declare what you charge tax on. A few times I've bought a bottle of vitamin water from you guys that sells for 2.50. Depending on which cashier I get, I either get charged 2.50 or I get charged 2.72, so I'm wondering what this is about? Get your shit together. I won't be patronizing your place anymore, and if this keeps up, no one will except those tourist who don't know any better. But hey, that's what Yelp is for. You're welcome, tourist.",17,8,8

I decided to go for the Very Berry Smoothie with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and cranberry juice as the liquid. The only thing I added to the smoothie was spinach because don't we all try to trick ourselves into thinking what we are eating is healthy even though it isn't. We are currently in peak or natural strawberry season which is April through June. All I can honestly taste in this smoothie is how tart the strawberries are. At any other time of the year I would give this a pass but not right now.

I came here today with my colleague for lunch...too bad I missed their grand opening last week! The hot buffet had many different varieties from other deli spots around Penn Station. One section had chicken, vegetables, kimichi dumplings and shrimp shu mai. I usually always get small amount of things...me and my friend both got a scotch egg (not sure if it's authentic but I just popped my cherry today). We lined up to pay for our food...I had to ask again how much mine was...$9.61 for this *mouth drops* I barely got a lot of stuff and I knew the scotch egg will weigh more but WTF that's fucking so expensive!!!My colleague and I sat upstairs and there was no AC so sweating while eating our hot foods...SMFH! Today was a HOT day duh. She told me that her food cost $16.00...seriously fucking nuts to pay so much for hot and cold buffet! As we were leaving Essen, I glanced over and checked the price per lb is $9.49 that's ridiculously expensive while other delis are $8.99 and offered a 10% discount with our badges. Welcome to Penn Station but I will never come back to this establishment! I have better, cheaper and delicious food on my list!",16,10,9

Updated review","Re: Bagels & BreakfastI stopped in for a quick bite and ordered an everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese. The bagel was thick and fresh and had a healthy layer of cream cheese without over doing it like some bagel shops tend to. The breakfast counter looked incredible though, with tons of breakfast options including eggs, french toast, pastries, pancakes, fruit - the list goes on. The bagel cost ~$1.95 + tax. My previous reviews generally are three star since this place is largely average, but I don't think you can go wrong here when it comes to breakfast.",3,,
29,Joey T.,"Manhattan, NY",83,76,6,1.0,7/13/2018,this place has over priced sub par food and the people making the sandwiches don't know what they're doing. they completely messed up my sandwich which i realized after i had left so i went back and told him i needed a new sandwich and he messed it up AGAIN and then tried to charge me for it! My sandwich was very simply and he messed it up twice: the first time by adding ingredients i didn't ask for and the second time by leaving off ingredients i asked for - i was only asking for 4 ingredients! Plenty of other places to eat in the area - i will not be going back to Essen.,,,

31,Edward C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,1.0,5/15/2018,If you're a black male beware!! They follow you around while you pick up food from the buffet. Imagine trying to eat and have a bunch of the cooks follow you around. It's really uncomfortable and I'll never eat there again.,1,,
32,Katie K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",66,120,354,2.0,3/20/2017,The pricing is inconsistent and the check out staff are rude.

Hot & cold sandwiches, korean stir fry, noodles, baked Italian pasta, salads, smoothies, were a few of the options I recall. If you're not sure what you want, this is a good place to help you decide. Quick and easy checkout. We ate upstairs in the seating area and had a nice little view of outside to people watch. Their greens bottled juice was pretty awesome. I had a turkey wrap and it was pretty good. Not like the absolutely best, but I don't know if there's such a thing as a 5 star turkey and cheese wrap. Hit the spot and was enjoyable!",,,

Cashiers are lightening fast prepping packing before you get there. Nice dinning area to sit eat and relax. Damn i wish there was something like this in my neighborhood!

38,Summer L.,"Queens, NY",68,78,432,3.0,3/31/2017,"I recently started going here more often. Compared to other cafeteria-style eateries around Manhattan, this place is pretty good. It has a nice selection of food, from sandwiches to salads, and even a smoothie bar. There's a lot of seating upstairs as well. The staff is always friendly and attentive.What I like about this Essen: they have Korean-inspired dishes which are quite tasty (the BBQ beef with rice is a favorite of mine), and they have a nice variety of vegetables at their salad bar. Their chopped salad is good and not too expensive, and the egg sandwich I got there recently was delicious.What I don't like: how the place easily turns into mayhem. I wish there were more options for healthy-ish food in that area, but this appears to be one of very few places so it gets crazy very easily. The hot food selection is OK. Nothing to brag about. And the upstairs seating area is spacious, but gets incredibly hot and is loud when full of people. Overall, I'm not super unhappy with the place, and I'll probably keep going here out of convenience, but I won't go out of my way for their food.",,,
39,Eric K.,"New York, NY",218,160,445,3.0,1/24/2017,"I had to check Essen out after hearing about it so much, so one day I went and got the hot buffet. hot buffet - $18 - I know, I was surprised but I kept on loading up so I can taste many things... Penne vodka - moist, al dente, and full of vodka sauce goodnessVegetable dumpling - a bit dried on the rack but tastyChicken marsala - A bit sauced in but chewyCod ball - soggy and smelly (old fish) avoid. chris' pork belly - pretty juicy and flavorfulvegetable fired rice - nothing to write home about, decentCollard greens - nice bite and subtle flavor Overall hearty and filling meal, but I couldn't shake the feeling that everything is a bit over sauced. Maybe it's only natural since hot buffets aren't exactly the hallmark of healthy food options. Place looked bright and inviting, and likely I'd try their breakfast and smoothies in the near future. Good place for lunch - decent food. just don't get your hopes up too much.",2,2,
40,Ankita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",646,251,895,3.0,12/6/2016,"Very solid lunch option for the Midtown area.My suggestion would be to be aware of what they do and don't specialize in. The hot and cold food bars are great, and so are salads and sandwiches. However, don't go here expecting much in the other departments. Yes, they have rice bowls, noodles, sushi, desserts, and an assortment of other goods, but I wouldn't get one and then be surprised that it isn't the best noodle bowl you've ever had. Essen is still essentially a deli, albeit a very nice one. And delis are good at the simple stuff. That said, they do seem to be Korean-owned and the Korean options I've had so far (including soondobu/soft tofu stew) have been great. But you don't go to a Korean-owned deli and expect stellar udon.I also think Essen has one of the best deals in terms of getting your money's worth. For $10, for example, you can build your own large salad from a HUGE variety of toppings, including avocado and proteins. I load mine up with a ton of veggies and some chicken and it usually lasts me for two meals. The soondobu I mentioned previously comes in a massive quantity as well, including a side of rice. This too lasts about two meals. I don't quite understand the complaints about this place. I believe it's reasonably priced and has solid variety and quality, especially given the lack of good options in the area. If you're careful about what you pick, you can make many things last more than one meal. I'm glad they've opened up on the west side.",3,,2
41,A M.,"ARVERNE, NY",3,26,4,1.0,10/17/2016,"Ugh, sucks that I have to give this place a bad review because it does look good but they messed up breakfast. How do you even do that?I ordered a western omelet. They ran out of potatoes for some reason and tried to just shove an omelet (with half-melted cheese cause they added it too late) at me. I said/thought, ""well, it has to come with toast or something or this is the worst breakfast deal in the city."" So they made me toast. Or rather I waited there for 5 minutes while they forgot to make me toast. When they remembered and shoved me down the line so I was out of the way, I waited another couple of minutes while my omelet got cold while toast with butter (after they found the butter) and jelly was made. That is not the end. After I paid and sat down, my omelet was unusually crunchy. Yep, they left tons of egg shells in my omelet and I had to spit it out every two bites. EGG SHELLS! How careless do you have to be?Breakfast is simple. If they mess that up, what else are they not getting right?",6,4,3

43,Lauren Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,46,72,4.0,2/15/2018,"Essen is one of the better choices for lunch in NYC. I highly recommend the sandwiches; they are made fresh and are delicious and filling. The prices are pretty standard for the city. You're looking at an average $8 sandwich. I honestly would not try the buffet foods; the place gets very crowded during lunch time and I feel like the food could very well be contaminated and I don't know how long the food has been sitting out. I also tried a salad from Essen and it was pretty decent; the unlimited salad toppings had me sold and they have a ton of dressing options. At Essen, stick with the sandwiches and salads and you can't go wrong. I will be back many times to Essen for lunch. Overall, I give 4 stars.",,,
44,Mark L.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,5,1,2.0,7/11/2018,"The food is typically quite good and the selection for a deli buffet very nice. They have a soup bar as well. My main complaint may be a plus for some. The chef (Korean influence) clearly believes that sugar makes EVERYTHING taste better, because you can taste it as a forward flavor in almost everything - literally. I had a lovely New England Clam Chowder today - large pieces of very tender succulent clam, potato cooked perfectly, herbal, and the cream base a very nice consistency - but this is a savory dish and I swear it was like someone had dumped 4 teaspoons of sugar in my bowl... it just ruins an otherwise really spot on execution. The chef shoots him or herself in the foot everyday but throwing the sugar bowl at otherwise fine dishes with savory or spicy or salty characteristics.",,,
45,P G.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,22,3,2.0,5/15/2017,"First may I say that I dearly miss Amici 36, which used to be at this location. Essen is overpriced, overcrowded. The signage is very confusing. Menu boards are over the wrong stations so you are always wasting time waiting in the wrong lines only to be diverted by the grill staff. due to the crowded layout, people are bumping into each other dropping tongs, etc. Not safe or sanitary.  The pay station lines snake in erratic ways so that it is hard to tell who is in line to pay vs getting their food at a steam table. Hard to gauge what line is longest or shortest. Got a ""spicy chicken"" which was posted at one station but actually made at another.  It's all random.   The sandwich was soggy and used slimy canned mushrooms.  Horrible. I had to toss it out. $8.25 into the trash. Not as good as Amici 36 was, and more expensive.If you enjoy a stressful, confusing experience and mediocre food, and are willing to pay for it, Essen is your kind of place.",2,1,1

In any case we took from the pre packed  salads and we went upstairs to eat (just to kill time to avoid a mad rush of humanity to the NJ buses).  It's funny that the word ""Essen""  means ""To eat"" in Yiddish, but this place is so far away from Jewish food as possible.",,,1

Fresh mozerella like u would get at an italian market!!!!Overall the place is very very clean and again has lots of options.

The woman (who I believe runs this place) could not be more rude. Asked for a straw for my drink and she essentially flat out said no, she can't help me.

55,Geoffrey N.,"New York, NY",77,152,8,2.0,2/7/2017,"So Essen is starting with the inconsistency pricing. They're taking after their crappy competition IGK and Bistro which are both nearby.  My two buddies and I come in twice a week to buy Pho.  That's 12 orders a week.  Sometimes I ask for an empty styrofoam container so I can share with a co-worker.  Up until today this want as issue.  Today they wanted 50 cents for it.  It's not about the money, it's the principle.  I told them if they insist on charging me 50 cents for the cup, I don't want this lunch.  And they let me walk.  I'm glad Essen is going good enough to let people walk.  Keep this up and your store will be desolate like Bistro and Essen.Oh, I went to zoob zib nearby...

58,Dee P.,"Manhattan, NY",140,31,8,2.0,1/19/2017,"Where do I begin? I have always been a fan of Essen since I used to go to the one near 38&39th on Madison. I now work right next to this one, so I come here. I had high expectations when this first opened. Don't get me wrong, they have tons of variety.However, I have an issue with how they place their food and their vegetarian options. First of all, they always place vegetarian items next to the meat items, so then it becomes mixed up. Today, I saw their baked potatoes right next to the steak, with nothing separating the two from mixing, because they were already mixed!!!! The tongs were even mixed. Huge turnoff!!!!It's not fair to those who do not eat meat because now that person will not eat those items. Often times, they will mix their steamed vegetables with their meat items, in order to make room for other things. Again, not cool.I went up to the ramen station and asked for a vegetarian ramen. I asked to confirm if their broth is also vegetarian. Guess what?! It's NOT. The guy said its made from fish. Seriously?! How can you claim it's vegetarian of the broth isn't vegetarian?Vegetarian means no meat and no seafood ... Basically nothing made from an animal that was killed to be food. If you go to restaurants, most of them have ramen with vegetarian friendly broths.So, Essen, please do us vegetarians a favor and be more thoughtful our diet restrictions. This includes separating meat from veggies and also having the right broth. Thanks!***************** UPDATE********************* 1/24/17Today I went to get a salad - a vegetarian salad (aka no meat and no seafood) and I saw the guy behind the counter use the same tongs that he used for the grilled chicken, to grab shredded cheese. Like WHAT?! This is a surprise to me because I have been to other salad places, including an Essen at a different location (as mentioned before), where they use DIFFERENT tongs for the meat items.Turns out, there was chicken in my salad too. Disappointing is an understatement.",2,,1

There were 3 women working the registers.  Unfortunately I ended up paying at the first register on the left, which is run by an unsmiling, older  woman.  As she was getting my change, I took 2 napkins from the pile on the counter because the coffee sometimes leaks.

How in the word did a staple get into my salad? This is plain carelessness, not to mention dangerous as it could have punctured my mouth, if not worse.
