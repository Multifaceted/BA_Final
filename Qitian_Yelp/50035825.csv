0,Wanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",310,284,810,5.0,3/1/2017,"I just have 1 thing to say. 2 words Ma-jor!Yassss x10 for my very first drag show!I think it may have been love and first sassy remark. I loved Prada's show because I love how she clowns the audience; the Caucasians, the bottoms, the lesbians, the black girl, alllll the Yolandas'!Please keep your sensitive ass at home, Consider this your trigger warning ( particularly all you liberals with savior complexes who wanna find something to march about everywhere you go) It's not a PC show so if you are expecting that this is not the place for you.AnywaysssssSo like I was saying I love Prada G. Major. She is high energy, hilarious and real. I also appreciate her openness about her MS diagnosis. It is not easy for a Queen.Aside from my obvious crush on Prada G. Major I will say the other shows I have seen are good too. The space can get filled quickly so just know if you sit at the bar a bunch of asshole will eventually be standing in front of you blocking the stage. I read a post about someone being kicked out of the bathroom because someone felt uncomfortable (women/trans women). I can't speak on someone else experience but I will say when i was in the bathroom there was a little bit of everyone in there and it was not a problem, there is no on policing the bathroom so I can't even image how that altercation took place.The staff is ok. Don't expect much.  Other then that make sure you come Saturdays at 8pm for Prada G. Major !!!",4,2,1
1,Thomas E.,"Fort Worth, TX",283,236,225,3.0,8/21/2017,Cool place and cheap drinks. Sort of place you go at the end of the night.Came here on a Saturday afternoon and the 2-for-1 happy hour deal on well drinks was amazing. $8 for 2 drinks can't be beat.There was a show at 4 that goes on until 8 or so apparently and a new show starts).Was a lot of fun and everyone was very friendly.,2,,1
2,Cree P.,"Jamaica, NY",152,127,351,3.0,7/22/2017,"I came here with my friend yesterday for her birthday,  and it was definitely something different. I've never been to a lesbian bar before so I was intrigued to try something new. When you get to the door there is a bouncer, or more like a girl sitting in a chair asking for your ID. She she seemed nice enough, very chill, which I liked. It kind of sucks that they don't have an official bag check, though, so what happens is your bags bags are put on a staircase all out in the open. And even though nobody comes down the stairs or anything, it's still there for someone to take your Fast forward so we get downstairs and I find out that there is a cover fee. Now if it I actually had to pay to go inside I wouldn't have been the happiest camper because the experience was overall OK. But before I get to that... right when I'm about to step inside the place some dude bumps into me and gives me a death glare like I did something wrong. I just look at him and I'm thinking to myself sir what are you even doing here? Anyway when we finally get inside, the dance floor was pretty packed, not extremely but there was a good amount of people to feel it out and the music they're playing was pretty nice too. The drinks they have were also pretty decent. When it came to dancing I was trying to enjoy myself with my friends but there was this one couple, who was just all over the place. Ladies I get that you're drunk but you don't have thewhole dance to yourselves. And even when the floor cleared, they still managed to bump into me, I think they eventually got the hint and shimmed off into the distance. Another weird thing about this place is that around 2 AM the dance floor was completely empty like everyone just up and left at the same time. I was like usually dance clubs and bars start to get filled around that time. It was really weird to see everyone all just disappear, especially since it was a Friday/Saturday night. Overall my experience here was OK, I probably won't go out of my way to come back here unless some other friends want to come here, but not by choice. Not my cup of",1,,
3,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,4.0,11/9/2016,"This strange little gay bar is a bit hidden amid west village restaurants, but worth the find. Happy gayness flared in happy conversations on the small outdoor ground floor patio proved an iceberg tipas we took the stairs down to the bar.A monday amateur night drag show was pretty wild, with a group drag queen monster number where they killed the dancer, and performed a creepy synchronized number ala Marilyn manson.  Other contestants were equally delightful bizzare, creative and enjoyable.Beers were a steep $9, but you do get a show.Atmosphere - divish communalDrinks - flowing but not cheap",4,1,3
4,Greg K.,"Manhattan, NY",70,39,4,1.0,4/8/2017,"Awful staff, with the most dismissive and obnoxious bartenders i've encountered, and that's in a lifetime in this city.   Out in the WV? Go to Monster, Cubby Hole or Duplex but skip this place unless you enjoy being made to feel:Like having a $9 beer poured for you is a colossal  favor.That 2 seconds of attention is too long for the bartender to spend on taking your drink order before he rolls his eyes, waves you off and goes to someone else. Was definitely the last time for me.  I'd recommend the owner find a new manager and some new bartenders who understand how to be respectful to guests.  In discussing with friends, and reading some of the other reviews here, it's clear that i'm not the first person to experience this.  Get it together!",6,,
5,Jimmy W.,"New York, NY",292,80,57,5.0,8/21/2015,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. This is the story of how a gay boy entered a bar and has been back every week since. The drinks are cheap, service is very attentive and the drag is 24/7. The staff here is amazing. They're really a close group of friends that make you feel very welcomed.I do miss the old location. There was something divy that's missing from the new location. UIt's almost too polished. I like that the new space is a lot bigger. This was especially great during Pride cause everyone had space to dance or lounge.",5,1,1
6,Froilan O.,"Manhattan, NY",95,101,93,4.0,10/20/2016,Boots and Saddles has been a Greenwich Village staple for over 40 years. They have a very awesome staff that make you feel right at home when you are there. Their drags queens are very talented and are worth sticking around for their shows. The best time to pass by is during happy hour since it's two for one!,1,,
7,Desmond H.,"Manhattan, NY",119,23,3,1.0,10/15/2017,"I'm a grown ass man with grown ass friends. We came in last night and had a great time, with each other. But towards the end, some shirtless bartender literally started making fun of me and my friends. He went and started laughing with the other bartenders and made it obvious by pointing at us. He even kept talking down to us, but it's like, you look dusty and crazy in this dingy ass bar. You're not better than anyone. I could care less about this place until the day I hear it closes down. I will laugh and then worry about where the cockroaches will go from there.",1,,
8,Katherine B.,"West New York, NJ",175,146,181,4.0,5/10/2016,"Where do I start? Well I guess for starters, I love the new location although I wish it stayed in the little dump it was around the corner. Regardless, this venue is a lot larger and can accommodate many more patrons. Yet, the coziness and raunchiness of the previous is second to none. If you're in the mood for a good time, some laughs and drinks, B&S is the way to go. You will always have a good time, as there is drag during most of the day and for every day of the week.Aside for drag and all of the other events B&S holds, this place is your normal, in the basement (dungeon) bar with your regular bar and stuff. Nothing special in this department.",2,,
9,Babs D.,"Vienna, VA",19,5,0,5.0,8/27/2017,Amazing show this evening!! Sparkle Monster blew us away...talent...energy...poise and beauty!!  The whole package sandwiched with fun food!  Tourist Mecca!  Local treasure.  Dont miss the fun!!,1,,
10,Ben H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,22,0,1.0,10/25/2016,"I went on Sunday 10/23 with a friend to grab a drink and see the drag show. Boots was busy for the show - not a jam packed full house which is great because we were taking it easy.From the moment we arrived, the server on the floor was a dick. He begrudgingly seated us and barked at us to get our drink orders. Totally rude, but whatever. Probably had a crummy day blah blah blah. The drag show started and the mood in the room lightened up a bit. When our drinks arrived, my boyfriend showed up to sit with us. The server barked at him for his order too..but he doesn't drink, so he respectfully declined. The server continued to be a total jerk..rolling his eyes, waving his fingers and demanding a 2 drink minimum order, or that he could find the door..so he left. I thought this interaction was a JOKE because it was so unreal and asked my boyfriend if he knew the guy, because he also works in the service industry (server for 12+ years and works at a bar right around the corner). As he put his jacket on and walked out I realized that we were really just being treated like shit for no reason, so my friend and I left too after a little more attitude from the server when closing out. It took self control not to cause a scene, so I am glad we left without finishing our drinks.The experience could've earned a 0 star rating - while the bar itself actually warrants a 2 or 3. It's nothing special, which is great because it doesn't claim to be. It's your standard gay bar, another dive nestled in west village.But literally you can go anywhere else. I suggest that management cleans it up a bit and fires the pathetic brat they had representing their establishment on Sunday. The only tip I am willing to leave for the guy: get a new job! Life's short. Don't be miserable.",7,1,1

12,Kim P.,"Providence, RI",0,8,6,1.0,8/7/2016,"How dare you and your staff behave the way you did towards a trans-identifying individual. Forcing them to leave simply because a cis-woman felt uncomfortable with a trans individual using the ""women's"" bathroom? That is reprehensible on so many levels. I am disgusted.",12,1,
13,Suresh D.,"Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, NY",101,973,1064,4.0,7/13/2015,"I was in here yesterday around 3PM.  This was my first time at the new location. When I got to the entrance, Robert, the owner was outside. I didn't realize I would have to go downstairs to where the bar was.  I ordered a drink and was surprised that he kept the well drinks at the same price.This space is much bigger than the old space. And they serve food now. And not just the quick stuff they used to have They have salads and wings and pizza among other items. TO me that makes it a good weekend spot for day drinking and eating. There are booths or you can just sit at the bar.",7,4,4
14,Gabriella C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,2,2.0,5/10/2017,I used to go all the time yrs ago and this bar was much much much better before. I'm not sure what happened but even the drags are so f* ugly right now.. =(,2,1,

16,A M.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,64,13,4.0,5/7/2017,This place is so campy. It's literally a dank basement rec room. I wish you could get to the men's room without walking across the performance space but what you gonna do. Better specials than a lot of neighborhood competitors.,1,,

Updated review",Love the drag queens and bar staff but security is very disrespectful and degrading....never again will i go to this establishment.,2,,
21,Alana H.,"Denver, CO",0,2,0,1.0,12/16/2016,"I ordered two drinks, both mixed drinks at 7 dollars each. I opened up a tab, which I was told included a two drink minimum. When I went to close out my tab, there were four drinks listed, at over $30, which was clearly inaccurate. I complained to a manager and was told that I had to pay for at least three drinks. I was so eager to leave that I just did, but my whole experience was such a rip off. I'll be paying in cash from now on if I even choose to return. It seemed like the bartenders were aiming to take advantage of drunk people, without considering that there might be people who didn't usually drink present.",4,,
22,Lee S.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,17,2,1.0,10/28/2016,"I contemplated writing this review but I do feel like the events that took place last night at Boots and Saddles should be recorded. My friends and I had come from a nice dinner down the street and walked in here around 11:30 or so for a last drink. We had had some wine at dinner, we weren't drunk. Anyways from the moment we walked in, the vibe was off and I'm not exactly surprised at what followed. The drag queen on stage was fun until she began to sing the song  '10 little indians' .. it was awkard, she kind of looked for an applause after and I said rather loudly 'well it was kind of racist' - I guess in 2016 I was just appalled that this was okay. She did not like that I called her out on that and replied with she was Cherokee (so that makes it ok?) and I said I am too Cherokee, good thing it's America and we can have our difference of opinions. Well no, that wasn't the case because it got very aggressive. I thought we had kind of got past it and moved on but we didn't. The DJ began to belittle me in front of the crowd - whatever I just ignored it, if I dish it, I can take it and figured we're almost done with our drinks and leave it. Well the drag queen couldn't let it go. After a couple more songs she claimed that I said something about her staring at me and then she made sure to let the crowd know 'don't worry, I'm not staring at you honey you're not worth my time'. Again I actually was just chatting with friends and done with the confrontation-- I replied 'look I'm sorry,  it's not my problem you didn't like my opinion"". AND THAT IS WHERE IT TURNED. The DJ threatened to physically 'take me outside' over the microphone with a slew of other name callings and then proceeded to storm over to the table and physically threaten me and 'take me outside'. I am a 5 foot something female, he a built man. It was completely terrifying. The bouncer then came over and they were kicking us out. Who I would assume was the floor manager when I expressed my concern at how volatile that became he said 'no one cares, no one wants you here'. Well yes, that's completely clear because your DJ just threatened to physically fight me. I waited by the exit for my friends to gather their things (one couldn't find their jacket) and apparently it took a minute too long because the floor manager walked up to me a few times as I'm standing by the exit to get in my face and tell me to JUST LEAVE - talk about the only reason I felt physically safe was the bouncer who was incredibly polite. It was honestly one of the most bazaar things I could imagine. I've been to plenty of drag shows, I know that it can always get quite sarcastic/ sassy etc. We had a difference of opinion, I was not upset by that but they clearly were. I'm not sorry I called something out that was politically incorrect. I hope The Boots and Saddles establishment doesn't stand for one, physical threats of abuse by the staff and two, understands the difference between entertainment and blatant racism.",7,3,

25,Katelyn M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,10/8/2016,"Went for the first and last time on a Friday night.  The bar staff seemed friendly and efficient, the drinks were on the pricey side, the space itself was large though cheaply appointed and not very clean.  As a place to go to sit and drink, it was pretty average - not the worst place in the world you can go for a drink with friends (especially if you like too-loud music and not being able to have your bartender hear you).  The worst part about this place was the drag show.  The performer was horrible - totally not funny, insulting to several of the audience members and simply made the atmosphere feel very non-inclusive and non-tolerant.  Just because you end every one of your sentences with - ""I was just kidding!"" - doesn't mean that everything you say to audience members is acceptable.   A significant portion of the night was uncomfortable and cringe-worthy, especially since the performer singled out females in the audience to hurl personal and unnecessarily rude comments.  Yes, it is a drag show, and yes, these kinds of things are to be expected, but if your show is 100% dependent on humiliating a specific portion of your audience, then you really need to get a new act, FAST.I HIGHLY recommend that you patronize other bars in the area over this one - particularly if your goal is to spend the night having a good time.",3,3,
26,Susan L.,"Wilmington, DE",353,224,508,4.0,3/27/2016,"This place is fun. It's totally divey and old but the vibe is great. We went on a Saturday night. The drag queen performing was everything she should be ... Funny and witty and gorgeous, of course. Fabulous indeed. She could sing, too!

28,Ken W.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,12/11/2017,"Went there for the first time on a Sunday night with friends and had the best, most amazing time ever!  It was a special night where US Marine officers were there in uniform to pick up toy gift donations for their Toys for Tots program.  The Drag Queens were incredible, colorful and all over the place!  What we liked best was that the Queens were not just on stage but mingling with us throughout the club.  And the Marines, live everyone else, were really enjoying themselves.  It was so funny that the owner/manager supported the evening by getting in Drag himself, something he obviously doesn't really do.  But he/she looked fierce with his big blond hair and it give him (and the rest of us) additional respect for the Drag performers.  Later the Queens even pulled two young men on stage and got them to strip.  Evenings like this you don't forget.  Thank you to the Queens of Boots & Saddle.  If you're looking for unique and fun times, this is the place to go!",1,,

I went to the door, the doorman asked for ID. I showed him a city ID and driver's license. He looked at the license and looked at me, then did a double-take. Of course, my name on the ID and my appearance don't match, but I CAN'T be the first person at Boots and Saddle for whom this is the case. The doorman starts looking at me like I'm trying to get in the woman's room in Fayetteville North Carolina. He wants to look inside my purse. alright, I say, but what do you think you're going to find in there? He takes his flashlight and sticks it in my bag. What's he looking for? A crack pipe? A gun? He's sure it's in there. He keeps illuminating my cosmetics case. I mean, I understand the security thing after Orlando, but c'mon, who am I? Al Queda's first Tranny jihadist? He takes so long, I assume I didn't pass inspection. I don't really feel welcome, I said walking away. IT's FOR YOUR PROTECTION! he yells at me. No, a condom is for my protection, this is just plain old boorishness, or something. If you're looking for drag and a drink, B&S can be fun, but what's up  with the doorman?",2,3,
