I always feel that the doctor is doing their Very Best to Help me.  The staff is very friendly and I have not attended one clinic where I would say anything else. So Five Stars, because they deserve it ! One of my clinics is the Dental Clinic.  I have had all my Dental work, including beautiful dental implants done at the Weill Cornell Dental Clinic.  They take my dental insurance and have a sliding scale for ""private"" dentistry.  I also want to acknowledge a really wonderful employee who works at the reception desk.  Thank you to Anita Singe for always going that extra mile to help me navigate appointments and everything else !  She is a wonderful caring person, and treats me like a friend.  Thanks so much AGAIN.  Sincerely, Eva J",,,
1,Dennis K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,11,1.0,11/19/2018,"Terrible billing practices. After paying all of our bills with the hospital we received another bill for 1,200 with little explanation what it is for. Have to call again and see what this is and whether the charges are correct. So much time spent dealing with their billing is not fun. Wouldn't it be more humane to provide the pricing at billing at the time of service rather than keep surprising patients with new bills for thousands of dollars, and that's with supposedly good insurance that my company provides. The place is a bottomless pit for your money. Stay away.P.S. totally agree with other reviewers about their ER service.",,,
2,Nicole H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/14/2018,"As a prospective patient/ family member of patient seeking substantial guidance & quality services from a renowned organization such as the NYP-Weill Cornell Medical Center, I am completely appalled by the unfair, crude, and offensive demeanor portrayed last week by multiple phone operators. It strongly believed to be 2 separate individuals, 3 separate phone encounters, when I called to make an appointment with the pediatrics neurology clinic. After I waited patiently on hold 3 times, for about 3 min each,  feeling ""passed around"" to 3 different operators, where as on the third contact, the individual gave false identity (when I asked ""whom am I speaking with and spelling?"" and they deliberately disconnected our call after I insisted on speaking to a supervisor, or transferring our call to someone who could actually provide helpful assistance. It is an extremely challenging task emotionally, to call around making hard decisions in regards to which specialist your child should seek medical attention from.  After all, calling because something is observed to be ""wrong"" with your child is heart wrenching, so the last thing any person seeking for help deserves to hear on the other end of the phone is dismissive, apathy and the dial tone. How disheartening because any unfortunate encounter with NYP-WCMC goes against the organizations core principles of compassionate & high quality. Please make amends for not only such a grievance, but such an injustice by re-training staff.",1,,

My 89 year old mother has been in the ER with s broken shoulder since yesterday at 9 am - currently going on 35 hours. We haven't seen a doctor since 9 am.  They told us they have a room at 4 pm it's now 8 pm and she's still in a cube in the ER. At a previous ER visit she wasn't given her meds for two days and began hallucinating shortly after she was released and required a two day stay in another hospital.  There are probably 100 beds in the three sections of the ER. Stack up 100 plus people at $7,000 x day and there you have it.",2,,
4,Matt T.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,24,2,1.0,9/9/2018,"This review is just for the Psychiatry department; specifically for Dr. Alexander Sheppe. This review is quite delayed. I was a patient of Dr. Sheppe's back in November of 2016. At the time I was unemployed and could no longer see my psychiatrist, because they didn't accept Medicaid. Dr. Sheppe accepted Medicaid, so I started to see him. This was an incredibly awful experience. I've had a psychiatric diagnosis (confirmed and treated by at least 4 different psychiatrists) since 2002. Not ever had there been any ambiguity from psychiatrist to psychiatrist that I had this diagnosis; never has this diagnosis been questioned; never did I feel a need to seek a different method of treatment with different medications or therapy.The moment I began treatment with Dr. Sheppe, he seemed hell-bent on questioning this long-standing, long-confirmed diagnosis. It got to the point where he exaggerated what the symptoms are supposed to be, so that mine did not qualify the minimum requisite symptoms to warrant the diagnosis. But that wasn't the most criminal thing he did. When I got understandably upset that he was spending more effort to contradict a 14-year diagnosis,  I asked him to speak with my prior psychiatrist, who I was under her treatment for many years. On our next session he said that he received my medical record, that was faxed, and spoke with the psychiatrist and he said she confirmed with him that I did not have this diagnosis. When I called her office, she admitted that at no time did she or any other medical staff member ever speak to Dr. Sheppe at all. Nor were there any voicemails left. So, basically, Dr. Sheppe lied through his teeth to try to gaslight me into believing the last 14 years of my psychiatric treatment was incorrect and I was being treated for something he strongly felt I didn't have. Needless to say I was infuriated and demanded he release me as a patient. I can't stress enough how unprofessional this is and I don't know why all of my requests to speak with his superiors were ignored; no one ever called me back. Dr. Sheppe should have his medical license revoked for the method he used and I stress nobody see him, less you want to be treated unfairly.",7,,

Two major valves needed replacing...from the time we walked into the hospital every single staff member greeted us with kindness and care. They made an unnerving situation completely bearable by their professionalism and just being on top of the ENTIRE admission, pre-test, pre op, operation, right into ICU.

11,Shang S.,"New York, NY",172,413,90,1.0,6/6/2018,"Not enough four letter words can I give for the awful, fraudulent, impersonal, incompetent, and absolutely freak show of a mess that is the billing department at this hospital. I liked the care I received. I hated the billing mess that I was left with. 1. I visited multiple times for health issues that are 100% covered under my insurance2. They billed my insurance under a bad diagnosis code3. Insurance reversed. Think I'm free right? NOPE. They end up balance billing me for the remainder of two FULLY covered items - an office visit and a lab.4. When you call into billing you have to say the right magic words to be forwarded to the right billing person - in my case, reproductive services.5. The woman I got to talk to was obscenely rude. When I explain my issue in a calm but straightforward manner, she takes offense as if I am in the wrong and that I owe them money7. Turns out the answer is that they have some bungled miscommunication from my insurance company that I ""maxed out my benefits"". I had my claims history from BCBS up at this point and I'm pretty convinced she is lying at this point. I ask her ""How do I reconcile the fact that MY insurance company is telling me I don't owe anything."" No answer that any intelligent young adult would ever accept.8. I am now on hour 2 of calls with my insurance company to straighten this out. Stay tuned.

This resulted in our being taken by ambulance to the vaunted Cornell Emergency room in the East 60s. The following very subtle letter to Cornell describes our experience. Jaffe, I can't wait to hear your ridiculous excuses for this one.----------------------------------------------------------11/20/17 NY PresbyterianPO Box1259-Dept-130182Oaks, Pa.19456RE: 41711123345Greetings:Surely you jest with your Monopoly number bills. Alas, you do not. Such is always the case with villains.  How do you fail miserably. Let me count the ways should there be enough paper.1-We. Lenore and Arthur Finn NEVER  TOOK RESPONSIBILITY for your insane billing. We NEVER knowingly signed anything to take this responsibility as we know just who you are. If you have a signature somewhere it was acquired under duress while we were in shock or we were lied to about what we were signing. You do know how to take advantage of the vulnerable.A-the ambulance driver asked for a signature which was refused. He said initials would do. Brazen, annoying, callous, unprofessional and many other adjectives. We were again pushed to sign your blank checks at least 3 or 4 more times. I REPEAT: NO RESPONSIBILITY WAS EVER TAKEN. YOUR MINIONS WERE TOLD TIME AND AGAIN THAT THE ONLY PAYMENT WOULD BE THROUGH OUR INSURANCE. 2-Your treatment is so poor that you have nerve billing anything; but you have to pay for your machines in one test  so be it. I should be billing you for Guiana pig service or malpractice or elder abuse or just plain CHUTZPAH. Thats' French for quillones. I'm as careful about spelling as you are about treatment.a-Your team of MASH wannabes is great for gunshot and knife wounds but on me and my wife it was more like rape. There is NO personal attention to individual needs. You rush the cadaver through COMPLETE testing to determine how many tests you can perform. The necessity for these tests, except for your voracious and  venal need for money is specious.b-Those reports, after charging the national debt for them ,are not even given the patient.  With great effort and persistency I acquired my report. My wife's was Never offered. c-Were it not for Dr Davidson, an ENT MD, tetanus shots and my anti biotic would not have been administered. MY wife did not get antibiotics and had to go to an urgent care center. Did you hear that? MY WIFE HAD TO GO TO AN URGENT CARE CENTER AFTER INCREDIBLY POOR TREATMENT AT YOUR VERSION OF BEDLAM. I had to really work to get your great healers to CLEAN UP our wounds;JUST BEFORE WE LEFT. The bandaging was cursory and fell off soon after. No supplies were offered except to go to a drug store. How brazen can one get??? You leave a very uncomfortable neck brace on for far too long. Is the MD in charge Torquemada?  Again, There is NO personal, individual needs service. The only thing you do real well is bill, bill, bill.d-Dr. Davidson, the ENT man was the star in your lopsided failing firmament. He put about 25 stitches in my ear and, as noted, paid a bit of attention to us. We were told to go to your ENT clinic to remove the stitches. When I called to do this some clone told me ""We don't take HUMANA"" An hour on the phone and the threat of a malpractice suit got me an appointment. The wonderfully professional MD there left a permanent stitch in.  There is more but I'm old and memory and belief fail me.e-Your organization is truly UNREAL. A machine with no efficiency, except in testing and billing, whatsoever. If, perchance, you had a conscience you would be ashamed of yourselves. We need not worry about that. You are not satisfied with taking about 20% of the largest GDP the world has ever seen. Add subsidies like my taxes paying for your residency programs. Your real estate taxes etc, etc, etc and undoubtedly you will not rest until you steal 107.3% of GDP. All this while giving incredibly poor service. Your answer is to buy a few Senators and constantly reduce your malpractice liability so you can act as irresponsibly and cavalierly callous as you do. It's good to be king of an oligopoly, for you.To wrap up: NO RESPONSIBILITY BUT PAYMENT BY MY INSURER HAS BEEN AUTHOIRIZEDI wish to receive the full reports and diagnosis on your ""treatment"".Strong letter to follow!L&A Finn",9,2,

They lost my first urine sample and blood samples, they didn't re-check my vitals for 6+ hours, at which time they finally realized I had a 102 temperature and provided tylenol. They didn't offer me anything to eat for 6+ hours -- I had to ask finally as I was feeling nauseous. And, I really don't believe they paid attention to detail - with a severe sore throat and fever, my primary care doctor said they should have definitely tested me for strep throat -- They never did, even though they ran a TON of other expensive tests (totaled $1,500+ with insurance discount).

19,Clarita H.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,35,2,2.0,1/26/2018,"This review is for the customer service we experienced after having MRI and Ultrasound appointments made for us by our ENT's assistant. The process of getting any info about what is a first time and important procedure for our 4 year old son (MRI with anesthesia) was very discouraging, tedious, and for lack of a better word, inhumane. After the ENT's assistant made appointments for our son for a 9:30 am MRI and a 1pm ultrasound, she said to call the scheduling department for further info. The scheduling department wouldn't give me ANY info, just said a nurse would call the day before the procedures with all the details. When I spoke to someone in Pediatric Anesthesia to try and find out some  preparation info and other questions I had about MRI sedation, she said she couldn't tell me anything, and wouldn't even look up my son on file. She kept saying I had to wait until the day before the procedures when the nurse would call with all the details. I called the scheduling department again, just 2 days before his MRI and ultrasound, same limp response. I pressed to see if I could at least get the location and confirm arrival time, if nothing else, and she responded with ""I promise, the nurse will call you tomorrow morning"". So the nurse called the next afternoon with details...she told me the appointment was 10:30 am, the WRONG time. When I asked about cancelling or postponing, she said I'd have to deal with the scheduling department or the ENT's office. Then I asked about where his 1pm ultrasound would be and she had no idea, said that I needed to call the ENT's office. Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service. The fact that I proactively called so many times only to be thwarted and be put through this stress is unacceptable. It was so off-putting,  that we canceled both appointments and are going to a different imaging center and hospital. So far they have been 1000% better with communication and giving us info easily (without shutting us out until the day before). It's a shame because we really like the Weill Cornell ENT doctor, but the bureaucracy and silo-ed departments that don't seem to coordinate or care create an annoying obstacle to him, and make us worry about how further treatment would be handled at this hospital.",7,,1

My uncle was just released for he was told by his primary care doctor to go to the emergency room which lead to an inpatient stay for several days.This review is based upon my experience with some of the physicians while my uncle was an inpatient at NY Presbyterian-Weil Cornell Medical Center. Endocrinologist was great with providing information on my uncle's condition as well as the results of his test. Also, what medications they placed him on. Dr. Mendelsohn took the time to explain his condition to the family. She has an excellent bedside manner. This is how all physicians should operate when coming in contact with patients and their families at the hospital.Complexities of hospitals with physicians coming in and making their rounds in groups can be scary. This happens throughout the day with residents, interns, attendee, nurses, etc... It is an added bonus when staff walks you through the process and answers your questions.My uncle is in good hands when he comes to this hospital. This is his third time.",16,9,14

23,Merry G.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",2,25,0,1.0,5/26/2018,"This lengthy review applies to the emergency room only. I haven't experienced the hospital itself but after this experience I seriously doubt I ever will. What I'd like readers of this review to do is visualize and assess for themselves, based on my experience, if Weill Cornell ER is the best ER for you. I arrived at the ER about 1:30 AM after being awakened in pain caused by diverticulitis. I know that pain and told the front desk what I suspected was causing it. The waiting area was near empty and in a short time I was taken into the ER. I was escorted down a hallway and the aide dropped my paperwork onto what I presume was a nurses station as we kept walking. Nobody was there. We walked to an area that a sign said was the ""Vertical Patient"" area. I've never heard the term before and assumed it was a triage area. It is separated by a wall and located in the absolute back from the main ER and in need of serious upgrading. Peeling paint, dust balls, etc. I was put in an open cubicle with a high backed chair and a rigid plastic divider separating me from the person in the vertical patient cubicle next to me. These cubicles are so narrow that if you move your elbows off the arm of the chair you'll hit the rigid divider. I do not exaggerate since I banged my elbows a few times. No one came to see me so I got up and looked to the nurses station where my paperwork was. Still no one there. Finally after 20-30 minutes I hear a nurse asking where did this paperwork come from? I call out. He comes. We have a brief conversation and an IV catheter is inserted and very much later blood is drawn. Quite a while passes and a PA comes so I tell her my history of diverticulitis and surgery and she performs a brief abdominal exam in that narrow cubicle while I am still sitting in the chair. I doubt this is sanctioned abdominal examination protocol. Made me wonder if I hadn't told her that I had a history of diverticulitis if she would've examined me any further. She did ask for my pain level and duration based on the 1-10 scale and decided my 9 level pain pangs which had awoken me were short lived enough, which they were, and my overall 4 pain consistency was tolerable enough for me to remain seated in the chair. I was already here so I tolerated the pain and discomfort. An hour or so goes by and from a checklist form I'm asked if I have any of the following medical conditions. Do I have diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, etc., then I'm handed the checklist form to sign. Nowhere on that form or at any time was I asked what I did have so feeling it to be of some importance I volunteered that I have moderate emphysema...but at least I don't have asthma. After another hour or so in the vertical patient chair blood was taken a second time. Seems the first blood set was lost which also happened to another recent reviewer so I wonder how much time it took anyone to realize blood was lost and how much time was added to my ER stay. I'm offered tylenol and eventually given CAT scan fluid to drink and after waiting the minimum one hour a CAT scan is done confirming early onset of diverticulitis. That is when I see for the first and only time the ER doctor...Doogie Howser. He may as well have been since I don't think anyone I had seen, excepting the registration person who needed my insurance info, was over 30. Doogie and I conversed for about 2 minutes and he left saying he'd draw up my discharge papers. A nurse came, handed me a couple of oral antibiotics, told me scripts were being sent to my pharmacy, and gave me my discharge papers and speech. It was 7AM.You need to understand that the ER is run by PA's and RN's who no doubt are recent grads from Cornell's school of medicine and probably not at the pay level of experienced doctors so it gives them the experience they need which I don't begrudge them, saves the hospital salary money, provides a passable yet extremely disorganized service to the community but does nothing to reassure me...the patient. I would think there's probably an experienced head doctor somewhere in that ER mix but the only one I saw who may have been the head doc was busy relating to a couple of male ER staff his recent fishing trip. For a patient this is a cold and aloof, disconnected, highly disorganized ER. I always heard Cornell was a revered name in medicine but based on my experience in their ER if this is their best then it has gone downhill regardless of how US News and World Report ranks it.  So this is my advice to all...If your condition based on your past episodes needs an ER, and you know what your treatment should be, and feel reasonably assured that you'll probably be released, and Cornell ER is nearby, then take the chance of going here.  BUT...if you're not sure about what's medically going on in your body then seek out an ""experienced"" ER and avoid this one.",9,,

When I arrived to bring her home,  I waited over 30 minutes for a wheelchair while nursing and other staff were giving an award out to one nurse  (see photo).  After asking several staff I discovered that a wheel chair was not required.  I walked her out while some staff were still in a party mode.Finally her blood thinner prescription was sent to some obscure pharmacist.  We never gave them the information.

I received the worst service in my life for a fracture in my foot. Not only did they misdiagnose me, they told me I would need surgery.  I broke my fifth metatarsal And they claimed it was a Jones fracture. I have one of the best Podiatrist's in the country, and he said it's an avulsion fracture when I sent him texts, still in the ER, when they gave me their diagnosis and X-Ray's. The PA young female was awful along with her co workers. The PA might have been Laura Borman. If so, she is listed on here as an MD. I am just going off of my discharge papers, which I have copies of everything. Thank God I have wonderful insurance, this hospital and doctor better think several times before they think about forwarding a bill to me personally. They gave me nothing for pain and laughed behind the desks when I became upset with them. It's okay because I'm in contact with Orin Fraser, who represents the patient services department in the ER. I am faxing him all of my Podiatrist's records that show they misdiagnosed me and also mistreated me. I'm a young healthy male who broke my foot running in Crossfit this morning. The last stresser I need is to hear is I need surgery when I don't. On top of being mistreated by waiting for two hours in an empty ER room, I was ridiculed by the PA and the young white and black male laughing along with her,  they refused pain medicine (which my podiatrist, Dr. Rock gave me real pain pills right when I left) then I waited two full hours just for the orthopedic department to come down just to bring me a boot. I will be disputing everything with management and the idiot nurse and PA should lose their jobs along with the young white man who engaged in the messiness of their behavior. What a bunch of losers in the worst hospital ever! Stay far away Note: I know my coinsurance is met along with all of my deductibles for in and out of network coverage. So don't even think about sending me a bill since you left me in pain, ridiculed me, and misdiagnosed my injury. You three should go back to school and learn how to do your job. I want to give ONE compliment to Karent Harrison from Ortho that brought me my surgical boot. She was such a sweetheart and made sure I was going to make it out of the hospital as comfortable as possible. Otherwise, the staff is garbage.

62,Annette Sara C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/8/2017,"It is rare to hear the word ""magic"" invoked by one Physician about another.  But I did, and it was not an exaggeration.  I am a 10-year plus patient of Dr. Christoper Starr of Weill Cornell Ophthalmology. For all those years he and his team have kept me well above the line where 20/20 is taken for granted and all its enemies are identified and vanquished.  My company represented ORBIS for much of that time and so I knew when the country's best ophthalmologists took their skill in medicine's fastest developing specialty  to all the world's places where preventable blindness was endemic, I would hear of miracles.  What I saw at 70th and York in Manhattan proved to me that it is a scandal that cataracts are a principal cause of blindness in countries visited by the US's finest doctors who volunteered with ORBIS and left behind their knowledge, medicines and the greatest gift, communication between dedicated  professionals.  So I was prepared for a miracle when Dr. Starr suggested cataract removal and lens implantation. In typical thoroughness he had me see a retinal surgeon in advance, and Dr. Kiss said, ""You're set to go.  Let Dr. Starr do his accustomed ""magic""  He did.  There seems to have been a tiny incision involved that made possible an excellent and more affordable lens. I don't know the fine points .  But what I know that it works, and that he and his entire team went the ""extra"" mile at every step. Now one of the thousand things I see more clearly is that we, the recipients of magic need to speak out and acknowledge that the ""Ayes"" have it when it comes to rating our extraordinary healers.  It's tough time for healers as well as  us, their patients. So I feel it is vital that we call ""magic' what it is and honor our hardworking and devoted healers.  Dr. Starr is well named, with stars to go around to his whole team of wise and caring technicians, fellows and all who heal us under his guidance. And that includes his associate who took time from her busy weekend rounds at the hospital to rescue me when I lost the tiny vial of pre-op drops that the pharmacy could not refill for days.  They all go the extra mile.  No wonder I called for a round of applause when being wheeled out of the surgery theater.Annette Sara Cunningham",1,,

I was told I could never have anymore children because I'll be on Coumadin for the rest of my life. I was good with that, because I already had Four children. I used to be a Crack addict and my doctor's I had back then was the greatest they understood me and they helped me through it all. Then I had Lung Cancer I had half of the right lung removed, after that I had a Pace Maker put in. Dr. Rosenberg was my surgery open heart doctor he's the best, even though he's retired now. Since then I've had nothing but the best of Doctor's. I was called the special case their, I still go there for my services that's was my second home at one time I believe I had to go to almost every clinic in the hospital, that's how I got to be known there. The Doctor's would say I heard about you before they even met me, I would say so my name is raining a bell around here with a smile. I'm still smiling when I go there and singing having my headphones on. I no longer have to attend all of clinic I call it I graduated all of the nurses get's a big laugh out of that and agree with me on that. Just love that hospital and the nurses are great my Cardiac floor is the best nurse Leslie from the Cardiac 4th floor is the best, that's my play daughter she took care of me like I was here mom, she brought her 3 children by to see me when I was very Ill and I was up and out of the hospital in 1 week, I was basically knocking on deaths door, seeing those children made me better and I'll always love her for that.",,,

65,David P.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,1.0,6/21/2016,"There are three things that Weill Cornell does better than anyone else: violate patient privacy, invent imaginary make-believe diagnoses that have utterly no basis whatsoever in scientific fact, and provide rich and poor with radically different care.Indeed, Cornell provides radically different care to patients, depending on whether they deem your insurance to be ""good"" or ""bad,"" and this is not something that I have experienced at NYU, Lenox Hill, or Memorial. The difference between being seen in a dilapidated Cornell clinic run by residents or fellows, and being seen in one of their bright new shiny clinics run by Cornell Medical School Professors for those who are deemed to have ""good"" insurance, is frankly extraordinary. It is not an exaggeration to say, that when it comes to providing rich and poor with radically different care, Cornell is a hospital out of a Charles Dickens novel.if you have ""bad insurance,"" It is virtually impossible to ever meet with your physician in private, and they will invite everyone and their mother to sit in on, what should otherwise be, a private session between the patient and their physician. Full body dermatology exams, news that you have some horrible disease, nothing is ever off limits.Yes, it's true, this is a teaching hospital. However, the patient also has rights, and an attending physician should be required by law to first obtain the patient's consent prior to inviting a third party to shadow a session. The fact that Cornell is a teaching hospital is not an excuse to deny patients their inalienable right to privacy. If, as a patient, you do not have the right to meet with your physician in private, then you have no privacy: and if you have no privacy, you have no rights. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if rectal and pelvic exams at Weill Cornell were observed by a resident, a nurse, a fellow, and a physician assistant. While you're at it, why not invite the hot dog seller, the ice cream truck man, and all sorts of random people in off the street?Nonconsensual physician shadowing is defended in the name of educating the younger generation of doctors, but the only message these residents are being inculcated with, is the one that says that patients with ""bad insurance"" are commodities and not human beings. Upon having a tumor removed from my neck with Cornell Otolaryngology, a frozen section was placed under the microscope, and it was immediately declared by the chief resident to be benign. When I went back to Cornell ENT a week later, for what I was told would simply be a routine visit to have the sutures removed, I was met by an extremely inexperienced resident, whom I had never even met before, and who was completely unqualified to be placed in such a grave situation. She proceeded to inform me, in a rather stumbling and bumbling fashion, that I had metastatic melanoma and that I had to go to Dermatology immediately. Suffice to say, my cowardly and knavish head and neck surgeon didn't deem it to be particularly important to show up to this session. A few days later, I was told that I didn't have Metastatic Melanoma at all, but that I had Interdigitating Dendritic Cell Sarcoma - a one in two hundred million diagnosis - and an extremely serious disease.In the months that followed, four additional pathology reports were obtained: From MD Anderson, MSKCC, Stanford, and Dana Farber, all of whom debunked, and categorically rejected the Interdigitating Dendritic Cell Sarcoma diagnosis. Consequently, I received three diagnoses from unsupervised residents at Weill Cornell ENT, and in time, each was proven to be erroneous.After a PET scan showed uptake in the liver, Cornell Oncology then had the gall to assign me an unsupervised fellow to be my oncologist.Another great department to visit at Cornell is Dermatology, an embarrassing collection of clowns, imbeciles, knaves, and people who appear to have skipped that class in the second grade where the word ""privacy"" is first introduced.In a deep and fundamental sense, Weill Cornell is a dreadfully managed zoo run by illiterate MBA's, simpletons, and people with extremely serious mental problems, who genuinely believe that they are providing patients with good care by either leaving them all alone in a room with a totally unsupervised resident or fellow; or inviting everyone and their mother to observe your session with your doctor without first obtaining your consent, thereby committing unconscionable privacy violations. And we mustn't just blame the medical students, interns, and residents for this chaos. For it is their attending physicians who have taught them that the patient is a commodity and a teaching tool - and not a real human being deserving of privacy and respectful care.",17,1,

Updated review","I have no idea how ""America's Best Hospitals"" get ranked. And if NYPWC is that high up on the list, we need to completely overhaul healthcare. Not just slap a bandage on it. This review is not based on one visit or two. This review is based on 7 visits that include the following departments: Nephrology, General Medicine, Cardiology, Neurology. They all suck. The doctors are competent. The nurses are competent. They know exactly what they are doing.What they are doing is (a) making patients feel they're trying to stay in the hospital just for fun, because we all SO enjoy hospital cuisine and bloodwork every few hours and who doesn't enjoy getting poked with needles and getting woken up every 2 hours? (b) making their relatives feel they want to keep their loved ones there because they don't want the responsibility, because - c'mon! - - how fab is it going to the hospital 3 times a day and sitting in those sublimely uncomfortable chairs and trying to chase down any info?!?! Free scavenger hunt!!!; and (c) they're just faking it, because...um...hospitals are FUN!(?)What??? Do you not DREAM to be in a hospital forever and ever??? *insert sarcasm here*The truth is they REALLY REALLY want to earn the bonuses from insurance companies for fast discharge and don't care about return for repeat ER visits because they can charge more for ER than they could for a regular bed. It's math, people. 14th floor self-pay rooms are very different from the redt of the hospital beds. They have no problem if you stay there for weeks. Months. Years. And the cuisine is better. And the view. They also kiss whichever part you point to there. And the doctors encourage you to stay one more day, just in case. Oh, c'mon! Stay!!! What if you fart after discharge? We need to smell it to make sure it's a healthy fart!(That was not us)We've just spent 24 hours in the more expensive ER even though beds were available in the unit we were going to at least for the last 12 hours. As this is our 7th trip, I know. I also know why. They look to double-charge for a room: in other words, charge the outgoing and incoming patient for the same room during the same day. PLUS charge the incoming patient for the ER room for that same day. If you're in their ER for however long (we've been there for 70+ hours 2 of the 7 times), you will eventually get a room sometime after 9 pm but before midnight. Discharges usually happen between 10 am an 2 pm. Do the math. Your attending physician will ask you in a very sympathetic voice: do you want to go home? Then put in his/her records: patient said he/she feels well enough to go home. Ask him if HE wants to go home. Everyone wants to go home. Feeling well enough to go home is a different matter altogether. They're not incompetent. Which makes it worse. Because this is deliberate and intentional, people - pushing you out before you're ready to get bonuses from insurance companies for fast turnaround. I would wish the same happenned to their loved ones, but I actually care about people, not numbers. So I hope their loved ones go to the 14th floor. Anyone who ever took the Hippocratic Oath and meant it would be embarrassed to work here and need serious councelling. But as none of them seem to have meant it (must be in the job description), I'm embarrassed for them. Please forgive me that they don't give a cr@p. A lot of our family dollars went towards their feeling that that's the way to practice medicine.It's not. Push for patients' rights and don't let them bully you into leaving before you're ready.Ask THEM if they ""want"" to go home when they ask you. Call your insurance if you feel pressured.Their expertize is worth diddly squat without care and compassion. If they don't care what happens to you the moment you sign the release, they're not doctors. They're greedy selfish a-holes, whatever their expertise. You come to a hospital when you can't not come, and IT IS THEIR DUTY to take care of you. Demand they do. 14 is just ONE floor of many. And you're not on it. Non-profit, my @ss.Two stars for level of expertise had their primary focus not been pushing you out. Being generous, because when they KNOW they're pushing sick people out it really should be minus, not plus.",14,2,1

Our daughter goes to the group affiliated with Cornell and we decided to go there instead of my own hospital so labs and studies can be accessed at our private doctor (mistake)We waited 2 hours to get to triage for one nurse to examine us in very jaded and non professional manner. Let me tell you--in my 10 years as practicing physician I observed many nurses, and that was a ""special"" case. She didn't do anything wrong, but her attitude was very demeaning. So, we got up and left without getting any care, hopefully we will not have to go to (another) ER through the night, and i hope we will never have to visit this place again.They say go to certain hospitals only if you are shot in the head...i can safely add Cornell ER to the list.As they say on billboards: ""Amazing things are happening here""",33,2,3

I arrived early for my appt and went through the silly rigmarole with wristband and forms. After my vitals were taken and finally put in an exam room, it was thirty minutes after my appointment time. At Forty five minutes, the assistant said she couldn't locate the doctor by phone or text. At an hour, some admin people came in and said the doctor had gone out of town and they didn't know. I said guys this is an hour AFTER I've arrived and waited for the doctor that you figured this out? Their excuse ""we just found out"" as if that was sufficient. In what other business would behavior like this be accepted? I've never been treated so terribly at any medical facility in my life. I'm so appalled I will never return to Weill Cornell ever again. I will not trust my health to a place run like such garbage. I of course left furious after being treated with such callous lack of respect for my time and health.

Updated review","I'd like to double downvote this establishment because of the bullsh*t billing system the have - of which I am thoroughly informed now.1. Be very careful to ask whether or not the ER is fixing you up with insurance-compliant staff. Because get this: The hospital, the physicians, and the doctors are all contracted separately for the purposes of your care. That means you have 3 separate bills you need to deal with and identify if they're in-network for your insurance.2. The hospital provides care, but the doctors and physicians separately contract with the hospital. That means you might be in network for the hospital services, but assigned an attending which is out of network, while your specialist care is in network. Let me be clear: IT IS ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO ASSIGN OUT OF NETWORK PHYSICIANS TO PATIENTS IN THE ER. They will do this. They do not care. They bank on you not knowing your rights.3. Your information changes will not be reflected across bill schemes. I changed my address for the hospital and specialists, but the physician bill I recieved did not reflect this information, because they are a completely separate entity. Your bills WILL go to collections if you do not pay them. That means you're screwed because their system sucks and the billing staff are so bored with their jobs that they won't bother to tell you any of this until you recieve that call from the collection agency.Good luck, and please go somewhere else.",6,,

During the time that I was her patient, she was operating on the incorrect assumption that I still had an internist in Queens. She prescribed a medication and told me to let the Queens internist monitor it. However, my former Queens internist discharged me after she sent my medical records to this Cornell attending, who had asked me for them. And how could this Cornell internist assume that another physician, with whom she had never had any contact, would monitor a medication which she had not prescribed?The worst thing that happened to me there is that this Cornell internist prescribed another medication, which gave me a really bad side effect, but discharged me while I was still on the medication and experiencing this bad side effect. Her discharge letter said that I had an internist in Queens, which was not true. I am so angry with this doctor and with the clinic Administrator, that I want to sue both her and the clinic for malpractice and report her to the Office of the Medical Professions.Like the reviewer named JK stated, every complaint which I ever filed with Cornell Patient Services resulted in the doctor about whom I complained being completely exonerated.

Updated review","Please Read My Original Review of Weill Cornell.  THIS UPDATE Is About Only One Of The Many Issues Raised:  Because a new supervising doctor handling my panel of residents at Weill Cornell's general medicine clinic, WCIMA, refused to refill two medications, one of which was prescribed by her predecessor who knew I was taking the second one, which had been prescribed by an outside doctor I no longer see, I had to stop both medications cold turkey, which is something everyone knows you must never do.  As a result, I wound up going through increasingly severe withdrawal symptoms which made it necessary for me to be seen at my local hospital's emergency room.  When the doctor there learned what the supervising doctor had done, he was aghast and refilled one of the prescriptions immediately and refered me to another doctor about the second.  At the risk of being denied future treatment at Weill Cornell, for everyone's benefit the name of my former supervising doctor at WCIMA is PAMELA ELIACH, M.D.LATER UPDATE: I have just received an official letter from Patient Services regarding my complaint against PAMELA ELIACH, M.D.  As expected, it exonerated her of any blame whatsoever by mis-stating facts and simply deleting others.  Never in my history at Weill Cornell has it ever found anything wrong with the actions of any of its doctors or staff. (See original review.)***There Is Absolutely No Oversight Of Anything That Goes On At Weill Cornell.  And There Is No Interest In Correcting Any Of Its Failings.

Cons-When Dr Liew went home and shifts changed I ended up with someone who was arrogant,  and didn't listen but made us wait for no reason even to the point where the nurse told us all the tests were in and we should not have had to wait ( an extra 8 hours) I even asked him and he said no!

91,Randy S.,"Chicago, IL",24,121,40,1.0,5/28/2014,"This hospital touts the ranking of its psychiatric-specific services without mentioning that you likely won't be able to utilize them. When I called today to request an appointment, I wasn't asked for any psychologically relevant information (e.g. questions to determine my mental state or level of need, among others), I was simply told to try back in a month or so with no guarantees.So, let me get this straight. You provide a ""great service,"" but someone like myself who very much needs it can't receive said service? Talk about a basic, humanistic (as well as a community) disservice.I understand that this hospital is motivated by it's bottom line. I also understand that services are provided on a first come, first served basis. These realities are the upside and downside of business operations. The problem is that this process--particularly in the realm of hospital-provided, mental health services--increasingly de-emphasizes and dehumanizes many people who need such services the most. Like me, for instance: A vet with myriad challenges who needs quality, comprehensive care that isn't being provided by his local veteran's hospitals.Whatever the case, I will obviously have to look elsewhere because this ""caring, people-centric"" organization doesn't have time to care about or for me.BOTTOM LINE: This isn't how a care-focused organization should work. This hospital may be ""the best"" in psychiatric care, but you will likely never be able to experience that firsthand.",34,2,2
92,Sharon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,733,856,4.0,10/24/2015,"This review is about my experience accompanying my friend having outpatient surgery at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.My friend had a 6:00 AM arrival time for 7:30 AM surgery on the 10th floor. We drove there and put the car in the hospital's convenient valet parking lot ($50 to park an SUV for 12 hours). The day's process seemed to move very slowly but was actually on schedule. The staff were all very competent and helpful. Recovery room nurses have clearly learned the knack for making the patient feel welcome and cared for while at the same time pushing them out the door. The facility seemed well-equipped and clean, but all the restrooms (for patients, guests and staff--we tried them all) had pee on the floor in front of every toilet, yuck. The 9th floor guest waiting area is comfortable for hours of waiting. There are long padded benches useful for napping. Two TVs quietly play news and talk shows. There's free WiFi, a Windows computer for guest use, several electrical outlets, and a Keurig machine with a variety of coffees. I signed up to receive automatic texts: ""Your family member is now in the Operating Room,"" ""The procedure has now started,"" etc. Regardless of texting, the waiting room staff notifies you when the patient is in recovery and you can see them. Inside the building, food options for guests are an Au Bon Pain in the lobby and a cafeteria in the basement. Au Bon Pain's food is adequate and there are tables in the lobby. I was pleased that there was soy milk for coffee. I didn't try the cafeteria. None of the staff in the waiting or recovery rooms objected to bringing in refreshments. Outpatient recovery has two phases. In Stage 1 the patient is in bed and attached to monitors. The nursing staff watches the patient's vitals via computer, keeps them comfortable with IV pain and nausea meds, provides a puking basin, bed pan, drinks, crackers, etc. After the patient has passed urine and hopefully finished puking they move to Stage 2, sitting on a recliner with only an IV still attached. Stage 1 bays have two chairs for guests. Stage 2 bays are tiny and have only one chair. My friend had three guests, and with a little finagling we convinced the staff to let us have three chairs. Whether or not you can have extra chairs is really a matter of the nurse's opinion, so if you get turned down ask someone else. During recovery I asked for the paper Rx for the pain med my friend would need at home and got it filled right away at the closest drugstore. That way he wouldn't have to wait for pain relief after traveling home. The Stage 2 nurse did a good job of explaining the aftercare and answering questions. It was a long exhausting day.

Very very nice man. Second time, had to go back because I was still having issues and couldn't get into a doctor quick enough. The second team of doctors put me in the proper area this time...they were very caring and did what they needed to do.My daughter was also in the peds Er one night for a rash and they are amazing there and have a wonderful ER Peds department. The doctors are kind, the nurses are great and they have nice little areas to entertain the kiddos and even though it annoyed me that they had Spongebob playing in our private room on a loop, the kids were entertained and liked it and they left with little gift bags and snacks to eat while they were there.

103,Marie S.,"New York, NY",3,40,1,1.0,5/9/2017,"I've always thought of NYP as the ""best"" hospital in New York, but I've actually had  very negative experiences there. The first was while I was pregnant and went into early labor. I had gone to a routine doctors visit within the hospital and the next thing I knew I was being admitted to the hospital. This was totally unexpected and I was understandably anxious and alarmed. A head nurse who was checking me into the hospital began taking my vitals with a resident. The resident was ""practicing"" drawing blood on me and the head nurse gasped loudly because she was doing it wrong. I of course I jumped and said you're making me nervous and the head nurse said well maybe you NEED to be nervous. I was shocked. Mind you I was being admitted because my baby's heart rate and my heart rate and blood pressure were very erratic. I reported the incident but I don't think anyone ever really believed me because she was so highly regarded at the hospital. It set the tone for my birth experience and to this day I regret not pursuing it further.  The second issue was after I had accidentally taken a medication known to cause dizziness and cardiac issues I went to the ER and a nurse let me use the bathroom by myself and I passed out and fell face down onto the leg of a rolling cart. I had a serious cut to my head and could have had a serious head injury. While I was recovering I listened to one nurse mock an elderly patient who kept calling for help.

But I decided I wanted an epidural, so I opted for the hospital.The staff at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell could NOT have been more professional OR more nurturing. Not only was my every need met without judgement, but people went above and beyond to help me adjust: through coaching my breathing and pain management, constantly checking in on me and seeing to my comfort and my husband's, and providing suggestions from burping the baby to successful latching for breastfeeding.During the two in-hospital days after the birth, I had the choice to keep the baby with me have them take him so I could sleep. There was an endless stream of experts, classes and tools to help new moms. I left he hospital having met with several lactation consultants, with a ton of mothering newborn techniques from sage nurses, and with a large supply of kit to help with my recovery (you name it, they will provide it for for you for free).

I am being generous with 2 stars.  Took my husband here who was suffering from unbearable back spasms and pain.  It was so intolerable for many nights in a row - something similar to being in labor.  Absolutely awful pain - to the point where you hope you pass out.  He had seen a dr. but no proper diagnosis and/or relief and the problem was escalating quickly.  In fact, things had progressively gotten worse for 2 weeks leading up to ER visit.1.  We were taken in immediately which is good.  But then we were sat right next to people who were discussing details of their condition with the doc. We were right there. Heard everything. Not even a curtain in between us. Looked and spoke to them - face to face!  So much for HIPAA!  No privacy whatsoever. No attempt at privacy.2.  The docs who saw us were arrogant and told my husband that they did not believe the prob was with his spine and would not order an MRI.  He was complaining mostly about hip but - having had many spine issues myself, i knew that spine probs can be referred if the nerve root is impacted.    Either way, they did not want to hear it.3.  They did an ""xray"" and said nothing was fractured.4.  They said the problem was that he was not taking medication often enough. He should take more meds and more often!5. We left with no more info than we came with and i watched and tried to help as my husband spent another screaming panicked night wondering how to get through the pain and what was causing it.  When i told them the reason we came is because the pain continued to escalate and no one knew why - and now we were leaving the ER with still no answers  - they had nothing to say about it.6.  No blood tests, scans or urine samples were taking to try to rule out kidney stones - which was something the regular doctors did (outside of cornell and unrelated to the ER visit) the next day - as we dealt with even worse pain.6.  The night following our ER visit,  my husband finally got an MRI from his regular doc and it turned out to be an emergency situation with a disc in his spine.  We had it dealt with at Mt. Sinai. Thank you very much to Cornell drs for totally missing it.7.  Just as an aside - while we were there being ignored, we heard the woman next to us being helped for a 2nd visit for a ""sore throat"".  When they told her ""we just saw you the other day and the culture came back negative. What brings you back?  She said that it still hurt a bit.  No big deal.  They treated her better than us.  Maybe this ER is a good place to go if you have a cold and they can give you some $40 advil, but if you have a serious problem, there are probably better NYC ER's to visit- they may actually try to get to the bottom of your problem!",4,,1

A friend was having severe back pain, 8 out of 10 and he was feeling chills and nauseous. A young, strappy, and healthy male with severe pain in that location could only mean one to me:  kidney stones. I told them to get to an ER immediately. I get a text a few minutes later and they are headed here. Later in the afternoon, I made a trip here. I am always skeptical of hospitals. After all, it is my profession, I am allowed to be picky.But this place really impressed me from the front desk ER receptionist to the ER doc. The ER receptionist helped me find my way and immediately I found my friends. The ER doc was in the room and explaining a bunch of things. He was friendly, and had good bedside manners. I had no complaints. They took good care of my friend and discharged him shortly afterwards. My experience here was positive, but it was also on a light day. But my friend informed me that he came previsously for another visit, and they were also great. So, with that said, I can say this is a decent ER.

The facilities are absolutely gorgeous and absolutely top-tier: the Sleep Center actually provides a gorgeous view of the Upper East Side, which in and of itself was soothing, and the bedrooms are equipped with extremely glorious beds with some serious Egyptian cotton bedding, and a soothing environment in which there are several options for lighting, and a private restroom that includes a shower. I was very impressed with the facilities as a whole, and have absolutely no complaints. It was wonderful, really.My ""sleep specialist"" was amazing: knowledge, deeply kind, incredibly interesting, and clearly concerned with the comfort of the patient. He allowed me to go outside for a few minutes as I was feeling exceedingly anxious at first, and put on the equipment after I left better. He talked to me not only about the study itself, but about topics such as neuroscience and linguistics that we have mutual interests in; which truly set me at ease. The care was amazing, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back for a second study, which may be necessary (the findings, too, were illuminating, as is the two-week sleep diary they furnish you with); and also would recommend it to anyone else in need of such services.This place absolutely lives up to its name, which I have found, unfortunately, is rather rare regarding health care, especially for behavioral health. This place is truly a breath of fresh air, and a professional and useful as it gets. A quick shout out: If anyone at the Sleep Center is reading this, thank you so much for your stellar care.

113,T N.,"Woodside, NY",16,60,20,5.0,8/14/2015,"This is for labor and delivery review. I gave birth at Weill Cornell in Jan 2014. I had an appointment at 6am to be induced and checked in at 5.45am. From what I hear, if you can get there early, then you'll have a better chance of getting a good room! The delivery suite I was appointed to was great. It was spacious and had a room for baby and another room where I would deliver. I might've been assigned this room due to special circumstances (being scheduled to induce as my baby had been diagnosed with a congenital heart condition). Everything went pretty smoothly. Gave birth around 11.29am naturally, I could hold my baby for a little bit until he went to NICU. I was transferred to a private room (we had paid extra for this) an hour later which overlooked the the east river. Having the private room, my husband could sleep next to me. Overall, the experience was good. I did a lot of research on my own to learn about delivery naturally. They allowed us to bring our yoga ball so I could stand, walk around a little bit (as much as I could connected to IV) and sit on the ball. Post-labor, there were volunteers who stopped by about twice a day to offer snacks to moms. Lactation consultants were by to offer support to moms so they can breastfeed properly. The nurses were also encouraging of breastfeeding. They also offered birth classes to help new parents. Our baby didn't stay in NICU long, he joined us later in the day at 7pm so he slept next to us in the room. Tip for new parents: if you are in the hospital for two days, have the baby sleep in the same room if you can and ask lots of questions!! Then for the second night, send them to the nursery because this will be the last full night rest you might get for a while.Our second day there, we had lots of doctor's/nurses come around to make sure everything was ok with our baby.

Our oncology doctor is awesome, attentive, and patient, and the nurses seem MOSTLY attentive. I've had some really annoying experiences though, especially with the administrative people here. Case in point: today. NOBODY CALLED US ALL DAY, despite the fact that my fiancee was scheduled to come in. I know patient discharges can take a turn for the worse, and people aren't always released in a timely manner, but have the decency TO CALL the patients waiting to be admitted, instead of allowing them to wait in anticipation. Especially considering this is our final round, it was incredibly frustrating. So at 4:30, we finally called THEM. And they farted around for 30 minutes before calling us back to say he would be admitted Monday. Thanks for wasting our day, jerks!This isn't the first time, either, that we've had to follow up with them about being admitted when we're scheduled. This is roughly half of our experience.And while our out-patient experiences have been pretty good, the inpatient experiences vary. When my fiancee was reallllllllly sick, I used to spend every night with him on the 10th floor. Those nurses were NOT TIMELY, at ALL. His machines were constantly going off for like 20-30 minutes at a time without anyone ever coming in to shut them off. Even when I'd call, sometimes it would take like 20 minutes! That is just not acceptable in the middle of the night when sick people are trying to sleep. We've had more than one older roommate blast his tv at all hours of the night, and out of the 5 nurses we talked to, only one did anything about it. I really hope that our hospital visits are NOT representative of what it's like in the ER....And we are constantly asked what medicine we're on, when we're taking it, if we've stopped taking them yet, by both the nurses and our oncologist.... ummmm, shouldn't YOU know that? Isn't that what your computer right there is for? This isn't as annoying being that we're young, he is better and able to think and operate normally again, but what if we were older/sicker? You really expect all cancer patients to be able to tell you exactly what they're taking when they have to alternate between 7 types of medicine at varying rounds post-chemo? I would say ""use a damn computer"" but the nurses walk around with iphone trackers and STILL have no idea what they've just given their patients. What's the point of computers if that info isn't being saved?I think this is a good hospital for the NYC area, with a great set of oncology doctors, but to say anything is ""good for nyc"" is like saying it'd be sub-par anywhere else.",5,,1

Too many patients for the staff. They can't handle it. To make matters worse, they act like they can handle it & you're a complainer if you can't deal with it. My wife sat on a gurney in a hallway for 25 hours with minimal-to-no care in serious condition and pain. It was the most awful experience of my life and certainly one of the worst of hers. For her, it was a prolonged torture session. I know NYC emergency rooms are notorious for being awful, and this confirms it. I hear Lenox Hill is better? And NYU Langone? I'm not sure, but I am sure this one is terrible.As for the staff that also seems to get high praise - I didn't witness that. All I saw was total incompetence. The doctors and ridiculous physician's assistants (basically college kids who think they're on the cast of Grey's Anatomy) did a terrible, terrible job. After our total time in the hospital, they ultimately didn't determine anything. Not only that, they'll discharge you as soon as they can to free up a bed. My wife still had very serious symptoms but they refused to let her stay or perform simple tests that could tell us if she should go home. After going home, she had to go back to her primary care doctor immediately for emergency care. They actually made her condition worse. Is a hospital supposed to do the opposite of that? I will never make the mistake of coming here again & will do my utmost to advise others against it. What an awful hospital. An embarrassment. To the staff that clearly don't care about the welfare of your patients: you should ashamed of yourselves, and I'm curious as to why you got into this profession in the first place. The money, I guess. Sickening.",18,2,3

My mother passed away at this hospital over two years ago, at the age of 91.  Without going into all the details, I will say simply say the following: (1) for two days, they never explained to us that the treatment that they had her on, a breathing apparatus, would keep her alive for a while, but that she would basically slowly starve to death instead, since she could not take off the mask to eat, and (2) when it finally came out what was going on and it became clear she was going to pass away one way or the other, and we attempted to get her home, which was her one wish -- to die at home rather than in the hospital -- as far as I am concerned, they basically prevented her from going home until it was too late.  The palliative care folks and the doctors in charge of her care, from my perspective, were affirmatively obstructive and duplicitous.  The nurses were great.  But my mother's one, great fear -- that she would not be allowed to die peacefully in her own home -- even though it could have happened -- she lived only 10 blocks from the hospital -- came to pass, in my opinion, for one and only one reason -- the decisions of the personnel at this hospital.  My sister and I even offered to sign any document they wanted to alleviate them of any and all responsibility for discharging her, but they simply refused until it was too late.  Shame on them.",1,,

There was no need.I think the problem with reviewing big hospitals like this is that it's possible for them ALL to be true -- yes, ERs are underfunded and horrible everywhere. But if you're going in for ambulatory surgery, you have no cause for concern. To my surprise, every part of a long prep procedure was done exactly on time. I was concerned about being seen by a large team of staff -- and I was -- but they all communicated efficiently with each other about the hand-offs, with none of the chaos I've seen at other hospitals. Everyone took the time to explain things to me thoroughly, and seemed genuinely warm and caring -- literally holding my hand during a difficult part of prep and being nothing but patient and encouraging when I needed a little more time to get past some wooziness. I've unfortunately had a few experiences with different hospitals around the country, and this one was like a ""how to"" on how things SHOULD be done but rarely are.

After being misdiagnosed at Beekman, she was examined at Cornell and told that she had a cyst. While surgery was required, it was not as drastic and would not involve having a complete hysterectomy as Beekman wanted to do. The room she received was immaculate and a private room - although it came about by an error, they had coded my friend as an outpatient procedure, so a room had to be procured for her. The nurses were nice and answered quickly when called. I have to admit they were patient as my friend was a bit cranky after the surgery and did not want to do the exercises and walking on the ward that she need to do. The wards were clean and bright, and they did not mind the number of people in the room or the times people visited. The food sucked - but that is the seemingly norm for hospitals.Ironically, a week after my friend had her surgery, another friend suffered a heart attack and was at Brooklyn Hospital. She needed a procedure to examine her heart and was actually transferred to Cornell to be treated there! Brooklyn did not have the expertise that Cornell has for cardiac care.

The only complaints I have are (1) why did I have to speak with about 4 - 5 nurses or assistants before actually speaking to a doctor?  Feel like I said the same thing to all these people - if you want to know where the bloat and fat in our healthcare system is, well, here you go.  (2) I could've been outta there in less than 2 hours, but they spent like 45 minutes getting my final paperwork ready (i think they forgot about me during that time or something as opposed to the paperwork really needing 45 mins to complete for me to sign).

146,Charles Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,10/28/2015,"We were originally sent to the pediatric endocrinology department at Weill Cornell, when our toddler was first diagnosed with type one diabetes.  We left for another hospital.  These were some of our experiences that lead to our decision to leave:1. When our daughter was first admitted into the emergency area for complications from diabetes, a teaching doctor came by with medical school students to examine our daughter.  The teaching doctor quizzed me on diabetic ketoacidosis.  When I didn't know what it was, she expressed irritation at me.  When a child is newly diagnosed with diabetes and the parents are exhausted from worry, perhaps it's not the right time to pop a quiz on them and get irritated when they don't know the answer to something that they had no time to research.2. The fast acting insulin pen that was being used to treat her in the hospital was loaded with a test cartridge that had no insulin.  When a diabetic patient is getting no fast acting insulin the blood glucose readings look very different than when a patient is getting it.  The nurses and doctors in the hospital never figured this out despite high blood glucose readings when our daughter was checked.  Instead we were told that this can be quite normal at the beginning.  We were discharged from the hospital and sent home with the fast acting insulin pen with the test cartridge in it.3.  For two weeks we were reporting to the doctors and clinic staff that the blood glucose readings would spike very high several times a day.  This was due to the fact that the fast acting insulin pen that we were using to treat her was filled with a test cartridge that had no insulin.  Interestingly, no one could tell that our child was not receiving fast acting insulin and we were told that she seemed very resistant to fast acting insulin but that this was not out of the ordinary.  It was only when this test cartridge ran out and we switched in a new cartridge with fast acting insulin, that we found out that her high blood sugar readings were due to her not getting any fast acting insulin.4.  During the two weeks we were reporting high blood sugar levels, when we were asking one of the on-call doctors if we should be trying something else, she said something to the effect of ""if that's what you want to do, then you should do it...""5.  When we were looking at the different options for an insulin pump, we were shown 5 different models that were available.  In retrospect some of the models should not have been shown to us because with very small diabetics like our toddler, you need to be able to adjust the rate of insulin drip down to very small units.  Some of the models we were shown did not go down to a small enough unit level.I am thankful to some of the staff for strong sympathy and a genuine desire to help.  Our particular episode may have been a learning experience for them as well as us.  It still bothers me though that no one could tell that this child was not receiving any fast acting insulin and instead tried to reassure us that her high blood sugar readings could be normal.",7,,
147,Michael W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0,2.0,9/8/2015,"This review is related to an outpatient surgery experience that my wife had last week. While we are very pleased with the surgeon and the surgery outcome, the treatment that my wife received from the hospital staff, both pre and post surgery, was unprofessional, uncaring and completely inappropriate. To start with, we were told to arrive 2 hrs before the surgery, but nothing happened during that time. When the time for the surgery came and went, we went to the desk to find out what was going on. The person at the desk had to look things up and then finally turned to us and said ""Oh, we're running behind today"" and when questioned, said that it would probably be another hour to an hour and 1/2.  Three hours after arriving at the hospital, someone finally came to talk with my wife, took all the information and told us that they would be back in a few minutes. Thirty minutes later someone came back and said that the operating room had to be changed and she had to go through all of the information again with a different person. Finally, almost two hours after the surgery was scheduled, they took my wife to the operating room. Pleased to say that the surgery went smoothly, but when it came to the recovery room, it was more of the same attitude and treatment that she received pre surgery. My wife was having problems with the anesthesia used and was not feeling at all well. It immediately became apparent that the role of the recovery staff was to get her to go to the bathroom so that they could get her to leave. Their was no compassion or concern for her or her condition. Their goal appeared to be to get her out of there as quickly as possible.

NYP, where I was treated over eight days for a respiratory infection, was the worst by far. My experience was so ghastly that I'm firing my doctor and finding one who has admitting privileges somewhere else -- even though I live right here in Washington Heights. This was not an E.R. situation, mind you. I was sitting right there in my pulmonologist's office when she called the nurse's station and said I was on the way. She even gave me a little card with my room number on it. I got to the floor, asked a nurse where my room was, and lay on the bed in my street clothes. Two and a half hours later, a nurse walked in. ""Who are you and what are you doing here?"" she said. She had no idea anybody was supposed to be in the room. Off to a great start.That evening, no fewer than three nurses tried and failed to get an IV line into my arm (I was supposed to get intravenous antibiotics). At that point I was in such agony I wouldn't let anyone try again that night. Result: Meds started 12 hours late. Thanks to a bad car accident back in 1995, I've had many, many IV lines put in my arms -- but I've  never seen incompetence like that of the NYP staff. Most of them don't even know how to work the pumps, and only the most highly experienced IV team members can put in a line that works for more than a day. Result: a great deal of needless pain, plus hours of listening to a loudly beeping, malfunctioning IV machine. NYP's beds are like torture boxes; the food is literally inedible. Patient communication is surreal. My first night, a nurse woke me up at midnight by banging through the door, turning on the brightest overhead light, and announcing that I should get ready to go for a chest X-ray. ""Transport will be here any minute,"" she said, ""so don't go back to sleep."" She left the room, overhead lights blazing. No transport ever arrived, and no X-ray was taken -- until noon the next day.Sure, there's the rare nurse who answers your questions honestly and tries to make you more comfortable instead of more miserable. But the ratio of those to Nurse Ratcheds is about 1 to 40. Stay away from this hospital no matter what. It's your worst medical nightmare.",8,4,1

They denied him a PICC line despite having Mannitol infused around the clock for over a week, by the time he left, a healthy 32 year old male needed a 22G placed by anesthesia. If you need REAL medical care by REAL professionals - go to Columbia. Weil Cornell's appearance is all smoke and mirrors.BTW My husband and I weren't married yet and he was visiting me from Fort Bragg, NC.

154,Sally M.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,5.0,9/4/2015,"This is a review of the pediatric department of 2012 - I have no idea if it has changed since then but I hope not because the care my infant and I recieved was stellar. I'd first gone to Wyckoff since it was right by my house, which is a hellhole but since my 6 month old baby was vomiting and drifting in and out of lucidity, I was not about to be picky. That was the one and only time Wyckoff diagnosed him correctly but told me he had to have surgery (wrong), and they couldn't perform it for whatever reason so they were sending me to Cornell. So I'm freaking out, holding my practically unconscious infant son in my arms, waiting to be transported via ambulance. The EMT that rode in the back with us was one of the most amazing people I have ever met. I was a young mom with a sick child about to lose my mind with worry and this guy sat with me the whole ride (which took 2 hours longer than normal because we were stuck in traffic the whole way since you know, New York) and talked to me about everything under the sun. His son, his ex-wife, everything. He showed me pictures of his little boy and I could tell he was a proud father. Then, once we got the the pediatric ER, he bought me a gatorade since I'd mentioned I had low blood sugar and hadn't eaten that day (I took my son to the ER around 8 in the morning, by the time we got to Cornell it was around 2 in the afternoon). I will never forget that EMT and I wish I could've gotten his name to send a thank you note. The exceptional service did not stop there. Once we got into the ER, they set my son and I up in the room, immediately gave us 2 trays of food, a movie, and brought me a top of the line breast-pump, since I was exclusively nursing my son and he hadn't eaten at all. Then when it was time for the ""procedure"" they informed me they were going to do an enema - way more simple and less risky than surgery! Once this was over, my son woke up almost instantly and became his usual hungry, bubbly self. They kept us overnight for observation, which was hardly an issue, as the staff on 6 North were all super accommodating and friendly. The playroom was very clean and filled to the max with toys for all ages. On top of that, since it was right before Christmas, care packages were passed to each child with a book and stuffed animal inside, which my son still has today. I usually hate hospitals and I was an awful nervous wreck that day but Cornell managed to turn one of the worst experiences of my life into a positive one. I am forever grateful!",5,2,1

Updated review","I wish i could Rate it -less stars. At the present time we are having a horrible experience, they only care about how rich this hospital looks and the life quality is the poorest of the world, my grandmas life is at risk now because of them, today July 7 2013, a part of her skin in her right hand was removed because of the way that she was mishandled while nurses were washing her, she has a sand bed, this ""professionals"" turn off the bed, even do my mother try to explain to them they declined to listen to my mother and they throw my grandma like if she was a potato bag and when they did that her skin completely ripp of from the top of her right hand exposing her veins and creating a serious injury, now her arm is completely swollen and in danger to get infected. After doing that, they look at each other, my mother requested help, they declined to help us, and the RN nurse came and saw and we requested for a doctor to come, and she lied to us the doctor never came, I spoke with many patients and all feel the same, many nurses think they own this place, they are nasty, lazy and do whatever they want because there is no doctor around specially at night time.The doctor in charge of her think she may have an stroke but nobody attach a device to her heart to tell us if she did have one or not, she is to fragil to be transported out at the present time.Either the Directors, Doctors and managers, the do not care or when they give the orders the medical staff do whatever they want, it is a shame.This place has a webpage in facebook where they protect the elderly against abuse, but my poor grandmother has been abused AND NOBODY PROTECTED HER.Her life is at risk and because she is too weak we cant take her out or transfer her to another place.Since we have an accent we are treated like if we are crazy, or if we create problems, nurses and doctors think they know my grandmother, but they do not know anything, and we try to let them know so it is better for them an instead we obtain dirty looks, mistreated.We have been requesting her medical records and they declined that to us.One day they tell us she is critical and she may die, then the next day a doctor comes and tell us that she will do physical therapy I do not know who rank them #1 that person must be crazier because their treatment is worst than a 3 world country, because at least in a 3 world country they do not have all the equipments, but they have a heart for sick patients.I do have to blessed the work of the volunteers, cleaning  and kitchen stuff they are the kindest of them all, very human and caring.IF YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS DO NOT BRING THEM HERE THEY WILL NOT CARE FOR THEM.",1,,
157,Blair F.,"Jackson Heights, NY",5,12,0,1.0,4/1/2015,Our ER experience tonight was a nightmare. The heavy older male nurse named Jim Yates was horrific and rude. I had to ask four times for my partner to have a way to call for the nurses in his filthy closed door room. I had to ask for a pillow a urinal and a glass of water for him. Nurse Yates refused to tell me where the call device was. As if I was insulting him. When I tried to explain how he was being rude and unhelpful I got threatened with expulsion. Awful people.,15,1,
158,Joan H.,"New York, NY",208,484,3,4.0,1/11/2012,"Overall a good hospital experience, that is better than most NYC area hospitals! As I may have mentioned in other hospital reviews, I've unfortunately had a lot of experience in and out of them - not personally, but as a visitor.  My grandma had broken her (second) hip, and the ambulance took this LIC resident to NY Presbyterian, because it was actually closer and more available than other nearby hospitals.  The atmosphere: this hospital is so fancy, it's like a 5-star hotel (that was how my uncle described it).  There's a beautiful airy atrium with computer terminals, comfy chairs and tv.  it's spacious -- I did not see 4- or even 6- person rooms (which you can find in NYU or NY Hospital Queens).  Though there technically is an official visiting hours, no one will ever kick you out and if your relation is feeling really uneasy, you're welcome to overnight (which I did).The guest lounges are nice and comfortable, and clean.  There's free wifi and even terminals you can login if you don't have your own computer!  On the 6th floor at least - there's even visitor bathrooms with showers, coin laundry and a quiet room where you can properly lay out to sleep.  I think this has to do with being by the NICU, but stll - that's nice!The care: The nurses were all kind; the nurses aides, though they could be flustered, always had a nice demeanor.  Everyone was always friendly and kind - which is definitely not the norm in these high stress environs.  The anesthesiologists who handled grandma pre-surgery very expertly and skillfully gave her the very minimum needed to get her through hip surgery.  In other situations, grandma has always been intubated and knocked out with dangerously too much.  She didn't have to deal with confusion and anxiety from waking up out of the medicine induced coma, which was the biggest plus of our stay!No five stars because -- food was pretty gross (average for hospitals), and we never got what we circled the day before.  Also, I can't say the staff was always too quick -- during change shift especially, staff could be quite slow (though I noticed never the case under Novie's watch!).I'd definitely recommend going to this hospital over others for its generous visitor services - and having family and friends with you when you are in the hospital, IMO, is a great factor in getting you well.",5,3,3

160,Fluffy R.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",15,10,1,1.0,4/6/2015,"So far I'm very disappointed with my office visit here to the rheumatologist Dr. Laura Geraldino-Perdilla. She told me I was going to get standing X-Rays on my knees. This never happened. Instead, I got everything but...I got about 35 X-Rays on my whole entire body. She should have asked me ahead of time if this was okay with me. I can't afford this, and some of them were unnecessary duplicates that I already had done elsewhere. She also gave me unnecessary duplicate blood work without telling me first. The X-Rays were very hard for me. At one point I had to bend backwards & hold my breath. This caused me to black out & fall over. The doctor told me she would call me in a week with the results of the tests. She never called so I left a message after 2 weeks. She never returned my call. When I complained to the X-Ray tech about the head to toe X-Rays, he said she does that to everyone, & that doctors think money is no object. This doctor told me to take about 6 Tylenol a day for a limited time, & that I probably have a torn meniscus in my knee. Tylenol is a bunch of b.s.

165,Col P.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,10,0,2.0,2/23/2013,"I thought Weill Cornell would have been a safe bet for an emergency room visit- but I was wrong.   TERRIBLE experience in ER, URGENT CARE, and HOSPITAL.The ER shifted me over to Urgent Care, where there were no beds available.  The doctor saw me and we discussed a treatment plan, then his shift ended around midnight.  This whole time I was in the hallway next to the waiting area, across from the nurses desk, where I could see and hear the nurses say bad things about their colleagues, including eye rolling and inappropriate language.Around 1AM the nurse comes in to start my treatment- but it's the plan that I did not choose.  It's the nurse that the others were being uncomplimentary about, so even though I'm exhausted , scared, and in a life threatening situation in need of treatment I request someone else come and talk to me about why the plan changed.  Someone else comes in (one of the staff being rude to my nurse) and throws a bunch of attitude at me about how the doctor changed his mind about the treatment, and no- I can't talk to him (or any other doctor) because they're gone for the night.So by 3A I've been moved into a room in the ER, and finally fall asleep just in time for a hospital staff person to come in to wake me and get my insurance card, which I had already shown at registration.Around 6A I'm moved to the burn unit (despite having no burns- it's just where they have beds) and see a PA.  She tells me a doctor will come and see me shortly- which she does.  I get 4 minutes with the doctor who answers my questions with annoyance.  I'm confused and sick, so  she promises to come back later but never does.  In fact, I never see another doctor in my 2 day hospital stay. The PA comes back but gives me bad information, which thankfully my primary care is able to correct her a few days later.

168,Peter K.,"Hoboken, NJ",82,507,21,4.0,11/29/2010,"You should have your baby here. Why? Free Chanel goody bag upon discharge. Okay, maybe that's a silly criteria for picking the hospital you will have your baby at but the goody bag probably has about $200 worth of Chanel cosmetics in it! We asked our friend who had their babies at other hospitals in Manhattan, Brooklyn and outside of NYC and no one else got special goody bags like we did at New York Presbyterian.In terms of other freebies, we also got a Medela bottle bag and the nurses were pretty generous in stocking us up with a ton of diapers, formula, etc. on our way out.In terms of the actual care... it was pretty good. I'm a first time dad so I don't really have anything to compare it to but the nurses were pretty responsive and gave a lot of good advice. Different nurses had different methods and philosophies on breast feeding and other topics but I think that's to be expected anywhere. From the moment we walked in to when we were discharged, the care was excellent. It's a teaching hospital so there were plenty of nursing and medical students who came by. We didn't mind. In fact, I actually liked it -- it meant that more people were checking up on us, even if they were just students. The cafeteria had strange hours so unless you time it right (which is impossible since when you have a baby, you'll realize the clock goes out the window) so you'll probably have to walk over to 1st or 2nd Ave to get food. Maybe most importantly, I think they do the billing appropriately. Many of my friends and coworkers (on the same insurance plan) had out of pocket expenses for routine child births because their hospitals made billing mistakes. Those types of mistakes can take *months* of calling the hospital, insurance company, doctors, etc. to correct. It's been over 2 months since the birth and my insurance has covered everything.In the end, I would definitely have my next baby at New York Pres/Weill Cornell.",26,15,8

170,Moet S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,3/18/2016,"Please be alert my son is still a patient at Weill Cordell's child development unit (in the process of changing him) I have been here since he was six he is now twelve; he suffers from ADHD and odd in which a doctor cross diagnosed him and was treating him. Idk how many different Meds he has been on but it has been quite a few including the changes of dosages. As a nursing student and having an LPN for a mother I stated from our couple of visits over the years that I was tired and concerned with the constant changing of his Meds and dosage since he isn't a gineui pig, the doctor stated that all the parents and children go they this until we find the right Meds that work in his favor. Fast forward to this year Dr. Cross has been pulled from doctoring children in this unit and the reason given was not good enough. Now a Rachel Kaplan an NP has taken over stating that once more we should change he Meds again??? What???,  ok whatever is best and will help him to focus and gain weight (as that was a side effect from the Adderall XR) she changes him to Vyvanse stating this is not as strong as the last meds and at a low dosage he should begin to eat more gaining weight. She ask that I bring in a age bone document from his PCP (which he sees else where) since for twelve he's really short. I stated thru genes we are all short for our age. Hell,  Kevin Hart is famous and wayyyyy short for a man so life isn't over. She states that she's committed to continuing his new Meds as long as I provide the document. I do just that then when I say my son needs a refill she backtracks and states the bone age document doesn't sit well and that she's with holding his Meds until she speaks to his PCP. Wtf now I'm like how do you hold a child's Meds after I provide you with what you asked for? Something isn't adding up, I email her my concern and state how do you deny a child with document issues medicine in which this is to aid him in everyday life? I gave her permission to speak with his PCP but as I was sharing this info with others it was brought up that maybe they F'd up maybe the medicines he was previously taking had a side effect that stunned his growth. As I shared my concern she emailed me back stating after talking to her colleagues that they want to make sure they didn't miss anything. What?? That answer doesn't sit well with me what do you mean miss! I am him mother don't speak in riddles, don't use choice words that down play the concern and what is really the issue and why are you withholding this concern from me his mother? I have read the complaints about this hospital and their other units but never would I imagine that I would be going thru this bs especially since this is about dealing with a child development. I don't know if she's trying to cover her ass, fix an issue without me noticing and sweeping under the rug what caused the issue/ concern in the first place to keep from catching a law suite but I will be contacting a lawyer about this seeing how, I will proceed with this matter and I am removing him from their care immediately. Please be aware of this unit make sure you ask questions as I did and do research where I failed because I put trust into the Dr's and NP's. His being short for his age isn't the issue as explained with the whole Kevin heart thing but to deal with staff that you put trust into and they break that trust to cover their asses isn't ok. To have an NP tell you to your face one thing then when the child is in need to withhold anything from the child or do another thing is the final straw. Don't believe the hype about this hospital they can not the best hospital pulling stunts like this. The worst and I'm a strong believer In Karma this is a child for GOD sake.",6,1,2

A new hospital gown? Done. A package of diapers? Done. Did I want to pump? No, I was fine with breast-feeding directly, but thanks anyways. We spent a total of four days in the hospital, three in a private room. At one point, Nurse Katie told me that if I ever wanted to go grab something to eat or just go for a little walk, to just let her know and she would make sure to check on my son frequently until I returned. I didn't take her up on the offer, but it was very considerate, and I appreciated it very much since I was starting to go a little stir-crazy.After he was deemed flu-free, we were transferred to shared room, which was basically the same size as the isolated room, except with 2x the furniture/equipment/etc.Seriously though, everyone was helpful, on the ball, and went out of their way to make you feel like they really cared.If you have to go to the ER, this is the one to go to...",3,1,2

I am twenty years old, I was involved in a minor car accident when I was 18. I ended up having a herniated/bulging disc leaning on my sciatic nerve in my lower lumbar spine between L4 and L5. At first I wasn't able to walk at all for about 5 months after getting multiple shots in my spine I could finally stand up again but it was only masking the pain temporarily. I was not able to stand up for more than five minutes without it resulting in excruciating pain shooting down my leg . Little things like doing the dishes and taking the shower was almost impossible without a chair. For two years if I left the house it was most likely to go to a doctors appointment.  I went through every type of therapy option available. I avoided surgery by all means like most doctors recommend at my age. I was told by two different surgeons that there was no surgery that was going to help me and that I would have to deal with it. I am a strong person and I can take a lot of pain but I couldn't deal with that pain for the rest of my life it would have drove me crazy. Anyway thankfully I was recommended to Dr. Kai-Ming Fu who worked at the New York Presbyterian and took my insurance. He took a look at my MRI and said that he could help me. I will spare you the details but I will say that Dr. Fu is a great doctor. I would recommend him to anyone with a spinal injury because he definitely knows what he is doing. Everyone from the front desk to the nursing staff was very pleasant and comforting. I was there a total of four separate appointments and I can honestly say I did not have any issues or complaints what so ever. It has been seven weeks since my surgery and I am finally standing tall with no time limit and no pain.

For orthopedics/bone trauma, Dr Dean Lorich is the best best best! The in patient rehab facility is truly incredible and the Pat group has first class therapists.  Even the doormen are wonderful. When something bad or scary happens, life can be overwhelming.  NY Presbyterian can make that overwhelming feeling more palatable.",3,1,
184,D E.,"Manhattan, NY",2,45,25,1.0,12/10/2014,Worst ER I've ever been to had to wait three hours just to be seen by a doctor. If you're by either you're better off going to Lenox Hill Hospital.,7,,
185,Carol N.,"Westminster, CO",47,83,9,3.0,3/29/2013,I waited for a long time. The doc did a bunch of test on me (which costed me a lot) and told me I need to see another specialist. What a waste of money.,4,1,
186,Juanita G.,"New York, NY",6,10,0,5.0,9/16/2013,"I must say, NYP is one of the best hospital out there. My grandson's was born there and I can say the environment was beautiful my family was in good hands.",2,,
187,R G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,18,0,1.0,9/18/2014,"Only go to this ER if you have something really easy to diagnose, and really dangerous, and where the treatment is clearly identified.My daughter went in this ER twice in a 2-week period.  The first time, she went in with a severe reaction to antibiotics, which caused a very, very high fever and intense skin inflammation.  This is a potentially life-threatening reaction, but is easy to identify and diagnose.  She was seen fairly quickly and put into what we later learned is the ""A"" section of the ER, where she was treated and monitored.  They were attentive and acted quickly, and it was a good ER experience.She subsequently had another reaction to antibiotics, which was less obvious (lower fever, no burning red skin) but also frightening bc she was feeling advancing numbness and on the verge of losing consciousness.  This second ER visit was a completely different experience: she had to sit in the waiting room for a very long time, none of the staff showed any interest or concern and were actually rude, and when she was finally taken in to the ER it was to the ""B"" section.  In the ""B"" section you lie on a gurney for hours (even if you're a 90 year old woman with fractured ribs, who was on a gurney next to my daughter and had been there for 6 hours!!!!!) and a PA eventually comes by and listens, and then a couple of hours later a doctor comes by and listens to the PA.  In this case, the doctor was completely useless - he had no idea what to do about the symptoms. In fact, his major issue seemed to be that no one had given my daughter a hospital ID bracelet, and he told me to have a nurse take care of that.  If this were the only ER in town, I'd recommend getting out of town if you need to go to an ER.  Fortunately for my family, we don't have a lot of ER experience, so I can't recommend a better one.  From what I've read on yelp, all of the NYC ERs are terrible.  This one certainly is.I have a strong feeling that no one in hospital management cares about this situation.  Maybe everyone in senior management and on the board of directors should go in anonymously as an ER patient and see what the experience is like - that would probably lead to improvements!",9,,
188,M G.,"San Ramon, CA",25,17,0,3.0,12/29/2013,"Not nearly as good a hospital as their PR people make it seem.The famous people who are patients go there because they are treated like celebrities, average Joes receive service slightly better than the DMV.This is a major hospital in NYC in 2013 and yet only about 80% of the hospital is wheelchair friendly!!!Has lots potential because of some great nurses, but it needs lots and lots of work to improve.",,,

The anesthesiologist who gave me the epidural was also very good even though he was having some difficulty inserting it into my back...the hospital is so clean and all staff is respectful, kind and caring. Our baby had to spend 2 days in the NICU and the staff pediatricians were sensitive and compassionate and the nurses in the  NICU were helpful while teaching me to breastfeed. My husband and i were so satisfied with all the care we received i would recommend this  hospital wholeheartedly!!!",4,,

Updated review","I took my 15-year daughter to NYH ER Dept because she had right lower quadrant, nausea, fever to 102, and chills. As an M.D. myself, I brought her to the hospital for rule out appendicitis. I arrived at 10AM to pediatric triage area and was promptly given a bed by 15 minutes later. After pediatric ER nurse took her vital signs, drew blood work and started an IV for fluids, we waited until 12AM to have a sonogram that took over an hour to perform. Surgery team was called to consult, and they offered to operate based on clinical signs (without clear diagnosis). I said I would not consent unless a CT scan confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis. She got her CT scan at 5PM (I refused MRI) which showed normal appendix and my daughter was not discharged until 9PM...11 HOURS IN PEDIATRIC ER...for a test that takes no more than 30 seconds to perform. I know, because I have been an attending radiologist for 17 years. The pediatric ER residents and attending at NEW YORK HOSPITAL are incompetent, inefficient, incompassionate, and a bunch of idiots. They are at par level with QUEENS HOSPITAL ER doctor, which is a city hospital. I should have gone to LIJ Schneider's Children Hospital or North Shore Hospital in Long Island instead of hopping across the bridge to NYH. Epic fail on my part. DO NOT GO TO NYH UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND GET READY TO DEAL WITH INCOMPETENT MEDICAL STAFF!!!",7,2,1
192,Ben C.,"Tappan, NY",103,301,1529,4.0,11/26/2012,The place is very clean and has various sections that caters to different medical needs. There is paid parking but it is located below.  The people that worked there are knowledgeable when it comes to your diagnosis and are friendly.,3,1,2
193,Jessica T.,"Santa Monica, CA",84,7,0,1.0,11/15/2014,"The absolute worst care ever. The nursing staff and doctor were sloppy, incredibly rude, and frankly just nasty. We sat in the hall of the urgent care for over 3 hrs overhearing the nurses talk about Vegas trips, weekend plans...anything besides patient care. When we asked how much long or when our friend's test results would come we were met with cold, inconvenienced looks. Beyond the in incredible rudeness, the facilities were disgusting. Dirty rooms with blood stained sheets line the hallways. It was truly the worst hospital experience ever.",4,,
194,Julie B.,"Maplewood, NJ",17,57,14,4.0,12/5/2011,"I delivered my baby here recently.  Although my boy's birth did not go as I had hoped, I was glad I was in the qualified care of the doctors and nurses at NY Presbyterian.I originally tried for a natural birth.  While it seems the hospital does not encourage that route, the staff certainly  didn't pressure me into drugs along the way.  After a very long attempt at laboring, I ended up needing an emergency c-section.  It was not what I had wanted, but the staff was good at trying to fulfill my original plan until it was no longer possible.I found the nurses to be very accommodating and friendly.  After the delivery I spent 3 1/2 days in the post-partum unit.  I had a double room with a view of the East River that I luckily had to myself for the duration of my stay.  Food was ok, with 3 choices of entrees for lunch and dinners.  I was really impressed by the free classes that were available everyday for the new moms.  There was a lactation consultant on hand that did a breastfeeding class each day.  There was also a baby care class each night.I didn't get a Chanel bag as another reviewer posted, but I did leave with a bunch of supplies for taking care of myself and baby at home.A few days after my discharge, I received a follow-up call from a nurse who was able to answer some questions I had since leaving the hospital.",17,3,4
195,Robert R.,"New York, NY",342,6,55,1.0,7/22/2014,"I just have to say that the emergency room at the NY Presbyterian on E 68th street is the worst in the city. St. Vincent's wasn't this bad. My mother inlaw had a really bad accident involving the Citibikes and exposed rebar that she tripped over and fell on during lunch time yesterday - she went straight to the ER at Newyork-presbyterian Hospital. My mom inlaw and wife spent over 8 hours waiting around in the ER and we all didn't know when they would get home. The patients were are left unattended for hours when my wife was waiting with her mother. My wife said they brought in a guy that got beat up in the middle of the night and he was sitting there bleeding and crying. She was watching him for over 2 hours with doctors and nurses everywhere, yet no one has bothered to even look in his direction. Meanwhile, during the time her mother was waiting in the ER at 1pm, she only finished her battery of tests (Xray/blood, etc) by 6-7pm and then they were told that the doctors wanted to admit her mom for overnight observation and they waited for the admittance team (what?) to tell us where and when she would get a room. So, my wife and her mom waited all night thru this morning in the ER for a room that never materialized. Thank you NYP for an unamazing and quite stressful experience all day yesterday and through the night. Thank God my mother in law is tough as nails to go thru that horrible experience. Not recommended. Avoid at all costs if you have a life threatening issue. So shameful.",6,,
196,Matthew S.,"Brewster, NY",0,24,0,3.0,11/26/2015,"I was at this hospital in July of 2015 for hernia surgery.  The hospital staff impressed me greatly; they worked so hard to keep me comfortable and I am very, very grateful to them.  My anesthesiologist was a great guy with an excellent sense of humor, too! The surgeon, however (Dr. Zarnegar), had a poor bedside manner and although I know he's busy he shouldn't have raised his voice to me while literally hollering about what I could eat in one word sentences! Moreover, I don't know if Dr. Rasa Zarnegar actually did a good job in the operating room partly because he was so interested in NOT telling me what he would do during the procedure and I am now having symptoms again!  In addition, the operating room was really small and tight on space and the operating table was so unusually high that I needed help getting onto the table!  At the end of the day, so to speak, the hospital staff impressed me greatly with the exception of my surgeon who clearly needs to learn better communication skills to help his patients!",3,,

198,Amanda C.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,20,10,2.0,2/10/2012,"I was born in this hospital over 20 years ago and they save my mothers life during birth. So when I found out I was pregnant I knew where I wanted to go. I had my first sonogram at 13 weeks my baby was healthy and moving around like crazy. When I went for my follow up appointment 2 weeks later the doctor did a full exam and Checked the baby, only there was no heart beat so after being told to come back tomorrow for a sonogram to make sure the baby was ok I went home and came back the next day. I found out my baby was no longer alive, but when the doctor came in to inform me she first called me by another name and the. Just sent me off to another doctor that informed me that I have to wait 10 day for the baby to be removed because all of the doctors that can do the D and C procedure were in another state.",7,,
199,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",179,350,239,5.0,3/14/2010,"I am sad to see so many negative reviews on this place, since my visit in January to the ER was one of the best experiences in an ER, especially in NYC.I went on a Thursday morning around 11:30 a.m. I had gotten into a car accident an hour or two earlier and jerked my neck and hit my head pretty hard.I took a cab here since I knew I wouldn't want to pay for UES parking. I came in, was handed a form by a security guard, filled in basic info and was taken into the triage room within 5 minutes. They asked me questions about the accident, took my blood pressure and temp and put me in a neck brace since I said I had hurt my neck. I was taken right over to a room where I waited for someone to come. Initially, I think I was seen by an intern or someone doing their residency, but was then seen by the ER attending just to make sure everything was ok. He did my complete evaluation, and was very thorough and honest about my diagnosis. He said it was up to me for an X-Ray, since he didn't detect any damage to bones, and I opted not to since I wasn't sure if it was covered in my insurance. He gave me some pain meds and sent me on my way. The nurse who was discharging me was SO sweet - she made sure I sat down for a good 30 minutes in the waiting room and even brought me snacks since I said I hadn't eaten that morning. She made sure my insurance info was all taken care of and I could really tell she cared. I felt really good after leaving here since I was hesitant to go in the first place but I'm really glad I went. It gave me piece of mind that nothing was seriously wrong, just a slight concussion and whiplash. And I only had to spend about 2 hours total instead of the normal 24 in most ERs across NYC.",3,3,2
