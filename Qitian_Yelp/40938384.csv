The customers are friendly. The drinks are good....But the icing on the cake is their bartender KeeKee. EXCELLENT customer service skills!!!She has such a beautiful personality. She doesn't just sell drinks, she creates the whole fun bar atmosphere and that's how you create regular customers.  This will definitely be my go to spot for adult beverages. NYC is full of spots that make great drinks, but great drinks and a great bartender with great customer service skills....Now that's a great find! OH FYI Management could learn a thing or two about customer service. I tried to talk to the manager last night, just wanted to tell her how great the service was and she was cold, dismissive and not interested in anything I had to say as a paying customer.

Updated review","This place will always be my favorite Tuesday night spot. They continue to keep the jokes funny and the contests entertaining. Its still very grown and sexy. 27-45ish. Unfortunately I was sad to see that they replaced many of the bartenders (the 2015 bartenders were great). The new bartenders are just okay and a bit slow. Other than that I absolutely love and enjoy the food, drinks, and atmosphere. There's never a dull moment. Great for groups of friends and couples. The place is very Diverse but our people are still the majority so the culture is 100% preserved and everyone should try this place atleast once! My Previous review also still applies.TIPSErotic Poetry starts at 8No Coat CheckLots of seating everywhere, they will squeeze you in if they must. Cozy/Comfy",5,2,
11,Corinne L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,3/1/2018,"The only positive thing I can say about this place is that the music was fun and the bartender was pleasant, although pretty inattentive. The ""crispy"" wings were practically raw, the wine was poured from cheap magnums at $12 a glass, and the place was practically dead. This bar advertises itself as a wings spot, but go literally ANYWHERE else for wings. Would never go back.",,,

13,Chastity P.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,6,8,5.0,1/26/2017,"Went there last night to continue my birthday celebration. Very chill vibe for a Wednesday, cocktails were great. Happy Hour Specials from 4-9pm. The food was fabulous and so good! The amount of food they give you is a great portion just needed some dessert to top it off. I wish they had a DJ after a few delicious cocktails my crew wanted to jam a bit. The background music is on point ( a mix of jams) I asked if they could turn it up because it was too low they did. Staff is friendly the bartender was running the show she was the only bartender and she was being a waitress on top of that for the night. But she was doing it with a smile and was very sweet. She said Tuesday nights are best for poetry so I will be back to experience that. Can't wait to come back, totally worth it!",,,

16,Sade A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,12/11/2015,"If I could give this place a 0 star rating, I most definitely would. I went here last Thursday night and ordered a seltzer water (club soda a.k.a carbonated water) while waiting for a friend. When they arrived, they ordered two beers and I ordered apps for the table. I don't drink, so I ordered two more seltzer waters. When our bill came, the waitress had charged me for three waters at $5.00 each, for a total of $15.00. So my waters cost more than my friend's beers. I've ate and drank at a lot of bars and restaurants not just in NYC, but in every major metropolitan city in the US.Never, have I ever been charged for refills in a GLASS of water when ordering food and drinks at the table, only if it was bottled. The water I was given, was literally coming out of a tap behind the bar. When I called the waitress out about refilling my water without informing me that she was continually charging me for carbonated WATER, she just laughed.On top of being overpriced, the waitresses here were unprofessional, chatting in the corners, hanging over each other, on their phones, and overall inattentive. Perhaps that's why this place implements mandatory tips. I most certainly will never visit this establishment again.",4,,
17,Dan K.,"Manhattan, NY",6,25,2,1.0,9/28/2015,"I came here for comedy night and it was ok. I don't drink alcohol so I had ginger ale  all night (3). I was really shocked they'd charge $5 for a glass filled with ice and a bit of ginger ale. Even when I go to a club or lounge downtown, it's either $3 or $4 but 5 bucks in Harlem??? I'm a not cheap when it comes to hanging out but I'm against being overcharged for simple things. How come a cocktail cost $6, a beer $5 and a glass of ice and ginger ale be $5. Anyway, won't happen to me again.",7,3,

20,Michboo M.,"East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",42,51,73,4.0,8/14/2014,Great place for happy hour. Have specials during the week till 9pm that pretty damn good.  It's. Neighborhood lounge with character. Once you walk in you feel like your in the heart of Harlem. The decor is 5/10. Large couches with vintage soft couches with plush leather chairs all add to the simple decor. The people are original and the music is hip hop and throw back eighties.I really enjoyed the drinks they are strong. I was a Martini girl all evening. Given the variety in the menu options you could get drunk and then order burgers and wings to absorb the alcohol. I would come back with a groups of girls not so good for couples. The atmosphere is chill with a sexy edge. Check it out once you start drinking your keep going and the smiles won't stop.,1,1,1
21,Eboni D.,"Manhattan, NY",6,75,29,3.0,11/28/2015,"In short and sweet terms, its a good spot for an afternoon turn up.I've never been to comedy night and while I have considered erotic poetry for laughs (because I imagine it would be a mess), I've only gone for happy hour.How is previously mentioned happy hour? AMAZING. The drinks are always strong (I usually have two and then I'm done), the selection is vast, and there's a few discounted food items to help you with that liquor consumption! Also, I always have a nice chat with bartenders during my time there and I LOVE a personable bartender!Why three stars? It's not my kind of venue honestly. It's quite loud (always copious amounts of rap/hip hop), the crowd is older than what am I used to, its rather small, and the food is nothing to rave about. Sure after some drinks the food is fine, but there are better places to get a meal. Right in the area at that. But hey, if you need a new and super cheap happy hour location, this isn't a bad place to check out!",,,1

23,Monique J.,"Manhattan, NY",3,17,52,3.0,8/10/2015,"Came here on an amazon local deal on a Sunday evening which was $15 for $30(pretty good deal). The place is quite small and have couch seating or bar seating which is pretty standard for a lounge. When we got there it was DEAD! We were the only customers so I felt a tad bit awkward. Nevertheless, the bartender/ server came and took our order. We ordered two juicy sliders with seasoned fries for $7 which was a happy hour deal. They have very good happy hour deals when it comes to food which are all about $7 you cant beat that. In addition, we got a regular order of buffalo wing. My sliders were delicious and the wings were a tad bit overcooked but still edible. I then ordered a sour amaretto which I swore was juice but hey! I had a decent experience I would go back for the sliders and good music.",1,,1

25,Lisa A.,"Milwaukee, WI",254,635,1085,4.0,4/21/2013,"You know that moment when you're reading yelp reviews and people are commenting about a place not being their scene and feeling a little out of place because the crowd is mainly 35+, & you're like ""that's weird, because I didnt feel like that.""  Then you look down at your drivers license with that 1970s bday. Oh, right. Anyhow, we happened in here for happy hour. There is a giant sign about dress code on tje door and we weren't dressed up but it also was like 5 pm. Our bartender was just fine. For $5 they had a bunch of drinks and apps. I had a margarita and holy schmooly was that drink strong!  Lots of people starting coming in after 5. Small but just fine. Nice hip hop playlist running in the back. No one stared at me (not for too long anyhow,) when I started singing beez in the trap so I am rounding up from 3.5 to 4 stars.",8,18,9

I always find a spot to sit whether at the bar or on the couches.The bathroom is downstairs and decent. The decor is a little worn (leather on some of the sofas are cracked.) So if you're trying to impress a date I wouldn't recommend this spot, until they upgrade the look.However, if youre date is down to earth (like I am LOL) then go listen to some press and play music (not sure when or if they have a live DJ) and drink!Ive been on a weeknight only so this review covers that.",2,1,3

Updated review","Respectfully, I think you missed the point of my critique. I'm fine paying $18 for a cocktail. And I'm fine tipping generously if the drink is delivered quickly and with a positive attitude. It's NYC after all. What irks me is that the menu didn't list the prices, the waiter deceived me on the price, and I was forced to include a gratuity, which negates the very reason for tipping.",7,,
30,Nikki K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,35,18,1.0,7/16/2016,The drinks were very weak. And the service was subpar. They automatically added gratuity and refused to adjust the bill. New York State law states that the total should not include gratuity if the consumer asks to remove it.  The waitress Patricia lacked personality and didn't care about serving us. She was too consumed with her friends at the bar.,,1,

32,DeeDee M.,"Manhattan, NY",26,149,208,3.0,2/6/2016,"I was looking for a quaint spot to chill with a friend, talk, eat, drink -- stuff like that.  I searched and came up with this place.  I didn't know what to expect so gave it a go.  I had no problem with the place. I like the way they have it set up, with lounge sofas, 3 tvs airing sports and a bar.  We chose the best looking seats possible, but the picking was slim.  Leather ottomans.  The other chairs were fabric with stains, showing signs of wear and tear.  All they need in this place is to upgrade the furniture -- hit up a flea market, yard sale or IKEA, but from the appearances, they have their regulars, so it's not that important. (11/16/15)",,6,1
33,Yaz B.,"Long Island, NY",48,33,19,3.0,5/15/2016,"Stumbled into this place after having an unsatisfactory experience at another location.  It was a Saturday about 6pm and this place was full .. We did find seats at the bar & were happy to be told it was Happy hour until 8pm, I ordered the naked margarita, my friends ordered mango margarita & watermelon martini.  We were all satisfied with our drinks and the service was good.  The menu showed most entree prices about $10-$20 bucks and the food smelled and looked delish.  We didn't get to try it but will def be back to do so.",,,
34,Michele G.,"Cambria Heights, NY",8,20,0,1.0,6/23/2014,"****DO NOT GO HERE*****I was extremely disappointed in the service and management of Moca. My girls and I chose to go here instead of Chocolat. Terrible decision.The drinks were rushed and poorly made. But the big annoyance is the automatic gratuity that is added....to DRINKS! Who does that? The menu has food on one side and drinks on the other side. But the disclaimer is on the side w/ the food. In other words, if you were like me and only was looking to have a drink or two, you have to pay the automatic gratuity... I""m not cheap, so my tip would be the same as the automatic gratuity anyway. But I'm annoyed by how egregious the disclaimer on one side of the menu was. I also didn't even look at the menu initially because I ordered a classic martini. When I approached the manager about it, she seemed to not give a damn about my complaint or the fact that service was poor.So to hell w/ this place.

Just a small get together of friends nothing serious, three of us arrived sans the birthday girl, of course she gets to be fashionably late,around 9pm. There were bouncers at the door but they were very friendly so we had no issue getting in. We were greeted by a nicely dressed hostess, who told us we can sit wherever we'd like. There were lounge couches though were worn, were still comfy with tables and cute little seats on the opposing side.We didn't catch happy hour so drinks were average prices, 11ish, strong and tasty, the waitress was really patient and nice. The DJ was great, he played a lot of R&B, Hip Hop, and old school that kept my crew rocking until 3am. The crowd is a bit older think 30's so definitely not the place if you're looking to make-out with stranger, or make love in the club. I would come back, but for happy hour.",1,3,1
36,Juanita H.,"Bronx, NY",46,99,35,4.0,7/23/2014,I always go for the Monday comedy shows hosted by one of my favorite comedians Smokey Suarez. The show typically starts around 9-930 so be sure to arrive early seeing as to how it is a small lounge seats are very limited. Drinks are standard and the food they offer is great! I've only been on Mondays which is the best time to go especially if you need a good laugh.,5,1,
37,Natasha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,77,26,2.0,1/5/2013,"Moca is a bar lounge that tries to be a club as well as a restaurant... but the problem is you can't have all four titles. Food wise it's overpriced for pretty basic food that's not exceptionally great but it is good. I usually get the Turkey burger bc it's simple and it does the trick, it's good quality too, it has actual bits of veggies mixed in the meat which is nice but it could use more spices to give the meat itself more flavor. I have tried the Jerk Chicken and Quesadilla both weren't that great. Jerk Chicken was dry and not that flavorful or spicy and the $11 cheese quesadilla that I could have very well made at home in half the time was a joke. When dining in the lounge if you sit on the couch area all you can hear is the blaring loud bassy music. We asked the server if she could turn down the music a bit and so she did and 5 minutes later it was back up to club standards. I could understand if it was packed and there were a bunch of people trying to get down but no, the only other people were also sitting down a couple seats away eating and drinking as we were. If it's a lounge you think there music would be a little bit more lounge friendly not loud high tempo Jamaican music with lots of horns and a ton of bass. Obnoxious.If you're in the area and want a quick bite take it to go. If you want to come to a place to trying and hook up with ppl maybe go on Tuesdays bc apparently that's singles night.",1,1,1

The chairs are too hard. This place has untapped decorating potential.Bartender was more attentive to my boo than me. Negative because your toting ass would have gotten more drinks out of me. Anyhoo, he ended up ordering the rest of my drinks for me after the 1st round. I'd go back even if the decorum didn't change. It could be worse.

You think you get a deal until they add everything else on. Ordered two of the same drink and they came out different sizes and the server said there was nothing she could do. But why do we have to pay the same price? The manager was not helpful either. The music was good?

When we asked to speak to the manager they pointed to this woman in a suit who identified herself as the manager but did not provide a name.

It took a good 10-15 min for one of our drinks to come after we ordered, and about 20-25 min for my wine to come.

When we first got there we quickly grabbed out seats, only because the space isn't that big, and if we would've waited we prob would have eaten standing up. Soon as we were seated, I felt a cold draft hitting me on the back of my neck! It was very uncomfortable sitting there. If I wanted to be cold I would've just stayed outside. Next, I needed to use the restroom. I walked downstairs to the basement. That bathroom was HORRIBLE! The toilet wouldn't flush, there was already urine and tissue inside the toilet. It just looked real dirty. My final discomfort, were the drinks. I asked for a Sex on the Beach. The bartender does NOT know how to make drinks at all!! All I tasted was vodka and some weak juice. I asked my waitress for a bit more juice, which was a bad request because my vodka turned into just juice. Didn't drink it. I then asked for a strawberry Margarita. DISGUSTING! I ended up returning my drink ready to go. The only reason I gave them A STAR, was my food. I ordered the jerk chicken, rice and plantains. It was pretty good! Besides that, I will NEVER go back! Horrible place!",,,

The music is  Hot 97ish, but unfortunately there isn't much space to dance. Actually, there isn't much space to do anything, but...welcome to New York!

Updated review","I was recently referred to Moca Lounge by an acquaintance. After going on the website and seeing the different events, the beautiful images, the decor, the soul-themed menu, all steeped in black culture, I was immediately intrigued and wondered why I hadn't heard of your venue before. And best of all, BLACK-OWNED and operated. Although I live in Brooklyn, I was excited to be discovering a potential new haunt and chose to check out Classic/Erotic Poetry night first, which would make sense since I'm a poet too.Imagine my surprise when I was refused entry due my head being covered. That's it. Nothing earth-shattering, as there was no other issue with my attire. I'm sure, as the kind brother at the door stated, that other brothers have no problem simply uncovering and entering. But, without getting into my life story, I made a personal decision long ago to keep my head covered. So far this hasn't prevented me from entering a court of law or from daily performing my duties in a professional capacity. It also hasn't prevented me from attending other venues and events without hassle.It would have been nice to have been alerted about this policy before having made the trip from Brooklyn. However, nowhere on the website is there a stated dress code. I suppose I'm to conclude that any brother (or perhaps sister, though I'm thinking a traditional double standard is in effect) deeply into Rastafarianism or Islam or Judaism may as well forget about enjoying a relaxed evening among black brethren at your establishment.I'm curious to know if this policy extends to other occasions as well. If I were to show up for lunch, would I be refused a meal unless I uncovered? If I came at any other time, to any other event, would there still be an issue? It's amazing how other (white) reading series/lounges don't seem to have a problem with a black man's attire. Happy Ending was recently named the best bar/lounge in NYC and they have at least two ongoing reading series, as well as regular events and parties. I've been there many times. Head covered.Please don't misunderstand. This message isn't an attempt to curry favor, to get you to change your policy on my behalf. I'm not in the habit of drafting and sending letters of complaint. In fact, this isn't a message of complaint, but one of lament. After all, I'm only a potential patron, a long time supporter and believer in black owned and run businesses. So much so that I'd be willing to take a two-hour train ride to and fro on a weeknight for the sheer pleasure of spending money at and sharing your space. I'm only an artist who seeks out places such as yours to propel my art. And I'll continue to lobby and root for the success of any black-owned business, including Moca Lounge.So I suppose what I'm really lamenting with this writing is your charge to be the ""premiere lounge,"" that it may ultimately exclude the actual folk who could be the key in making it a real success. Your stance is indicative of Harlem's thorough sanitization. By alienating the very poets, the writers, the artists, the expressionists of the culture who seek out potential bastions such as yours in order to meditate or be inspired by like minds and energy simply because of so small a matter as a head covering, it causes me to wonder who exactly your intended clientele is supposed to be. Who is your tasteful and sensual atmosphere aimed towards? Because standing at the door, being told I wasn't allowed to participate, to enter a space where people of my history and language and culture are freely expressing themselves, being told I was not allowed to express MYself, it didn't feel like it was me. In fact, I was left with an ill feeling. Any excitement I had about Moca and its concept was drained there and even moreso during the long ride back to Brooklyn.Because this could be the best weekly poetry event I've ever attended. Or it could be the absolute worst. And this could be the best lounge I've ever been to, the best gathering of black folk, the place where I've easily been inspired the most, been the most creative, met the most gifted and beautiful black brethren. But I have no way of knowing. Or, at this point, of even caring.And that's the sad part.",,,
68,Angela B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,30,0,4.0,6/1/2012,"I ate here with a friend during happy hour. There were still a few bar stools and some booth seating by the time we arrived (around 5:00pm). The seating was pretty comfortable, although the tables could've been a little higher. The music was enjoyable, and the waitress was personable. We loved the mini turkey sliders with fries. The sliders were juicy, with a bit of melted cheese on top. The fries were an example of a great balance between soft and crispy. Good portions, too... especially for such affordable prices. The peach martini was delicious--not too sweet. Their dinner menu items looked tasty; I'm looking forward to eating at Moca again.",2,,
69,D D.,"Old Westbury, NY",1,33,3,1.0,1/22/2016,"We were so pumped to find this place after our other plans fell through. Cozy good music, great menu and prices. Service was okay. Then a group of belligerently drunk middle aged men came to our table, started making really inappropriate advances, and ATE THE FOOD FROM OUR PLATES. We tried several times to flag a waitress or management and we were ignored. Then after three or four times, we finally got a hold of our waitress and all we got was a half-hearted sorry and excuses about how they didn't have security. AT A BAR. No attempts to remedy the situation at all. It's a shame that customer service seems to be so pathetic here. Even on the reviews, the business owner is giving a canned response about returning to Moca for a better experience. Nope. I will not be returning. Your customer service is abominable.",,,
70,Mr H.,"Brooklyn, NY",330,62,74,3.0,2/25/2012,"Went to this spot this past weekend with a friend of mine because I didn't eat all day. This is definitely more of a lounge environment than a sit down restaurant. This wouldn't have been a problem had we been able to snag the comfortable couches against the wall. Unfortunately, we were only able to sit on the hard ass chairs opposite the couches.The tables were low so I had to stoop down and put my other hand underneath my fork so that I wouldn't spill my food whenever I lifted it to my mouth. I understand why this is done because, like I stated before, this is a lounge and not a restaurant. But...it does make it uncomfortable when you are eating an entree and not just finger food. Not an extinction level event but just slightly annoying. The food was good. I had Shrimp Scampi with Garlic Bread on the side. I didn't have a drink, just water. The menu was on the pricey side for a lounge but I would still recommend checking it out. Overall, I wasn't blown away by this place but I would recommend you checking it out. I'm not against returning there for their weekend brunch just to check it out and see how it is.",1,4,1
71,Stormi R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",3,21,6,3.0,6/21/2014,This dim lit cozy lounge is good for happy hour. Order some wings (honey bbq) and some drinks at the bar. The seating otherwise is too low and uncomfortable.,1,,

Intimate, chill environment to go to with friends. It is a little small so we were lucky to have found seating. The happy hour menu was nice. Pretty good sliders and fries, as well as pretty strong drinks.  Only thing that took it to 2 stars was the service. For a good amount of time, there was only one waitress and she was so occupied with the register that we were waiting for a while to even be acknowledged to order more drinks, get napkins, or even get our checks. We had to approach her which is partly not her fault since it started to pick up. Maybe more waitresses? Then to boot, there's gratuity already added. LOL. I got the impression since that was added already, her performance did not matter. Overall it's a cool spot to stop by and eat along with get a few drinks.",1,,

I've been a few times and had to stand on several occasions. Drinks here are good, but the cocktails are too sweet and not strong enough.  I've only eaten here once. I shared the sliders with a friend and the best thing on the plate was the fries.  After like 11 pm a bouncer is at the door which is understandable, but also uncomfortable.  Gratuity is automatically charged. I'm not sure if this  is a new thing or if I've been double tipping.

I had a Malibu with pineapple juice, my friend a Red Bull (she doesn't drink booze no more) and the total came to $14. I felt ripped off because I didn't expect a Red Bull to cost as much as a cocktail and my cocktail itself was very weak.",10,2,2

It was enough people there not to feel creepy and few enough where you could hold a conversation without screaming. It's been nice. 5 dollar drinks can not be beat and the bartender , D, while annoying - is very good at making a drink.Even if he want's to banter with you like a hood regular before hand. Can't speak for the after hours vibe, but I doubt I would come here anyway for after hours. No desert, and they always get the order wrong - keep that in mind. But the food, I can honestly say , is so good. French toast and almond crusted chicken stips? (that's the type of brunch I'm on)---stay away from the burgers though.  Ill be back for the 5 dollar happy hour.",3,,2
80,Christine L.,"Manhattan, NY",19,34,1,3.0,12/22/2010,"Ok.. I definitely have mix reviews about Moca.  The good... I've been there on Tuesday nights for the poetry and I have to admit the people have been very cool and down to earth.  Much more so than the neighboring Mojo lounge in my opinion.  I am more interested in listening to the comedy from the hosts (which is only a very small fraction of the night) than the poetry, which can be a little too ranchy for my taste.... but I have to admit it can be entertaining for some good laughs when you're boozed up from the drink specials!!The bad... I didn't dig the whole pat-me-down and check-my-bag thing when I came on a Saturday night.  Especially considering the place was so crowded with folks -- I can't lie... I purposely stood slightly near the door in case anything went down (you know us NYC folks... when we see pat downs we have to keep our guards up.. regardless).  The ugly... Ok, old dudes... licking their lips... rubbing their hands... thinking they're sexy... trying to kick it... is not cute!  I'll leave it at that. Overall.. Moca is a decent spot to go for drinks (I didn't think the appetitizers were that good) and entertainment on Tues nights.  On Fri/Sat night it's a cool spot to chill for a bit.. I can't see myself staying there all night.  Considering the space is small, crowded and the seating VERY limited.",6,9,1

The reason why I went was to attend one of erotic poetry readings. (please dont judge) But anyway...man those poets are raunchy!I'm not really sure how I feel about the drink minimum in some places, but here was a two drink minimum. I cant even remember what I had to drink, damn.But clearly this place is not for me due to the fact that everyone in there looked like they were 40 and over.So moral of the story is, this is a place for a bunch of people over 35 with nothing better to do on the weekends than listen to a bunch of sex deprived weirdos read about foreplay and make moaning noises into a loud ass microphone. So yeah...Oh yeah, FYI, the neighborhood can get alittle creepy after 2am, so be careful.",7,6,

83,Lerone A.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,16,4,2.0,3/21/2015,I was invited to Moca Bar & Lounge for a birthday get together.  I showed up with one other person and when I arrived no one else from the party was there yet.  We ordered 3 drinks and some catfish strips.  The catfish strips were pretty good but the drinks were horrible.  The margarita wasn't made properly and it tasted like it had the bottom of the bottom shelf tequila in it.  The Hennessy and orange juice tasted like it had store brand oj and one of their signature drinks tasted like it should not have even been concocted.  When I received my bill there was 15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.  I typically tip more than 15% but it bothered me that an establishment would automatically tack on gratuities to the bill for two people.  Overall the atmosphere was ok and the staff were friendly.  The music was good also.  The mandatory gratuity and overpriced horrible drinks will keep me from revisiting this establishment.,2,,

We should have known to leave after we asked for a round of 9 Fireball shots and the bartender gave us Wild Fire bottom shelf rail liquor instead and insisted that it was the same thing ""because everyone says it is"", that we should've left. But we still gave it a try. After spending over $200 on drinks, the person who paid the bill stepped out and was not allowed back in because of his attire. And to top it off the waitress/manager who served us, who received a $21 mandatory gratuity off of us didn't even vouch for it. Actually she argued with me and walked away to serve someone else! Rude and disgustingly disrespectful. This is a poorly run establishment who pretends to be much more exclusive then they are. Pretty much a dive bar with bad service, high prices, and music. It should be a place you can walk into and have an easy, fun time, but instead you're treated as if you owe them something. To add, I've heard from former employees that they don't pay their staff on time, either. The turn over rate is crazy. That's probably why they treat their customers with little respect. By the way, the same people own Chocolat across the street. I'm writing a review on that next.

Updated review",This was my go to spot until recently. My bf was charged $28 for a double Johnny Walker Black in a small glass with tons of crushed ice. We asked to speak to the manager; the waitress laughed and said they weren't there. Came off very unprofessional. The money wasn't the issue its just how it was handled. It's sad because we would go there at least once a month to patronize this small business in Harlem. At least the L lounge has opened across the street and they will now take our business. FYI....Aloft 's WXYZ bar that's newer with modern designs and fixtures charged us $12 for the same drink in the appropriate glass with bigger ice cubes.,4,1,

88,Maxine M.,"New York, NY",1,33,2,2.0,8/29/2012,"My advice is to come here when you are already tipsy and nothing can get you down. The drinks are expensive considering they are so small and weak. The menu offers your average fried finger food and burgers. Music is pretty good, but if you try to dance you will trip over the tiny ottomans on the floor. On weekends it gets full but in my experience the crowd mostly consists of groups of girlfriends and couples.  The few single men were either 50+ looking for a sweet young thang or younger guys who came super late and were so drunk they would flirt with the wall. So if you are looking for an eligible bachelor -you may want to try elsewhere.",4,6,

I wish the drinks were more tasty though I ordered a mango margarita and I didn't really scream MANGO FLAVOR. But it did taste like a margarita so it was good. I also tried a sour apple margarita and it was sweet and sour which I liked- but once again didn't scream APPLE. It wasn't crowded though so it had a good low-key vibe.

Are you kidding me. When I spoke to the manager they were very unprofessional. The excuse was Grey Goose is a seperate drink and we charge accordingly. I was done after that. I have never been charged that much for a maritni.......not even on a roof top lounge in midtown. I went across the street to Chocolat and had the same drink better vibe for $12. This place is a wanna be. Not some place I will frequent!,1,,

96,Tay D.,"Bronx, NY",22,19,1,3.0,7/13/2012,Been here twice. First time was ok. Second time was pretty kool! They were having a comedy show the amateurs were pretty funny.  $5 drinks good food! Crowd can b a little questionable at times but overall a kool spot to attend for one of their shows. I'll b back for comedy nite. Maybe even the poetry nite.,2,2,1
97,Rachel R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,32,5,1.0,1/18/2015,"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. This place does not deserve even one star, much less to even be in business. Desperate for food on a Sunday night, my visiting friends and I decided to give this place a shot. It took 20 minutes to get us water after we sat down, which we had to ask for. Food took twice as long- 40 minutes later they stopped by our table to tell us that they ran out of buns for my burger. Ran out of buns?! After 40 minutes?? At this point, half the table had their food and I was still missing mine. They used sliders buns for my full sized burger- which I'm pretty sure we're the cheapest driest buns (the kind you buy at Walmart for $0.98). My meat was also way overcooked (AKA- burnt). We had to ask for water refilled repeatedly. Did I mention that the place was empty? Our waitress spent the entire hour and half we were there gabbing with the bartender. I was ready to walk away without a tip when she brought us our bill already INCLUDING GRATUITY! 18%?! I asked her to remove the tip and she claimed the lounge had 18% standard tip. After arguing with her that the information she claimed was not posted anywhere, she refused to remove the tip. If it wasn't so late and I wasn't so tired, I would have refused but I was exhausted and still hungry cause my good was not edible. So we paid. Needless to say, fI will not be coming back and I don't recommend that anyone else ever go there.",,1,
98,M P.,"New York, NY",428,132,11,2.0,8/17/2010,I miss the brunch and free wifi at this spot otherwise the food and service are not the best things to mention when taking friends.

But what does suck is the dark lighting and the 90's coffee house design reminiscent of ""Friends'....coffee tables, sofas? Sitting on a dirty sofa in the dark or on a backless stool is not my preferred way of socializing. When I go out, It is always my intention to be comfortable and well taken care of by the staff as I spend lots and lots of cash. (ok, so I'm a party girl sue me)I realize that the bar works best for the ""I'm finally old enough to buy a drink"" crowd, and that's cool.

103,Tabrina Y.,"East New York, NY",2,13,22,3.0,7/19/2014,"Went on comedy night (Wednesday) $5 drink specials were pretty good and the drinks were not watered down. There were plenty of comics tearing down the house so why the show didn't start on time amazes me but it gave us time to finish up our food. I ordered the catfish tenders with sweet potato fries and my friend had the turkey burger sliders with fries. The food was actually pretty good. The only downside was the chairs/sofas which knocked what would've been a 4 star rating down to 3. First off all of the seating (not including bar area)  is very low, equivalent to foot stools or ottomans which have no backing so after a few minutes of crouching tiger hidden dragon while hovering over the table to eat you'll wanna move to the bar area quickly as we. Second the sofas were not an option because outside of looking dirty in the dim lighting .. The cushion were in NO position to support themselves let alone the weight of an actual person.. Eat at the BAR .. Your back will thank you.",2,,
104,David J.,"New York, NY",61,272,15,2.0,4/24/2010,"I walked early on a Saturday evening, early to meet a friend. I was clean, sober and dressed reasonably well, and I walked in and greeted the woman behind the bar. She just looked at the person next to her, and basically nobody acknowledged my presence. Finally I asked someone, ""can I just sit anywhere?"" which was a reasonable question, since there were NO CUSTOMERS in the place. They did allow me to sit, and someone even came over to take my drink order. My friend arrived, we each had one drink since it was Happy Hour, and then the time came to decide whether or not to order food. We each felt no particular reason to like Moca Bar, so we went elsewhere for dinner.",2,1,1

I don't drink, so I can't comment on the drink selection.At times, the staff can be a little...I can't find the word for it. I do remember coming here and a friend ordered the salad that has the green apples in it, and when the waitress brought the salad out, there were no green apples to be found on the plate. The waitress informed us that she didn't know the cooks has run out of green apples. Overall, I like the dim ambiance of this place. It was my first time going to a lounge. I've never been there on a busy weekend night, and based on some of the reviews, it don't sound like I would want to. It's a decent place to come and hang out with friends if you're ever in Harlem.",,,
106,Sara M.,"New York, NY",50,58,5,4.0,4/3/2010,"After a pretty bad experience with another restaurant in the area, I was afraid to try out the food. But hey, it turned out pretty good. The atmosphere was pretty nice: beautiful paintings of pretty females and homely sofas and couches. The music was nice but a bit TOO loud and I had to attach and infer the bits of  sentences that were at times barely audible that were spoken by my friend. The food: I ordered a Grilled Shrimp Caesar Wrap and although, I asked for cranberry, the waiter gave me pineapple (so I had thought at first my friend ordered it until I noticed it was clearly a mistaken order for me). I didn't mind actually, I preferred it to my initial order. My friend ordered some margaritas for happy hour and what looked like chicken fingers and fries. Both of us enjoyed the food and I think the waiter mixed up,once again, my friend order's (plain margarita instead of what he wanted). Pros: Great food Nice atmosphere/homely/comfortable Cons: Loud MusicWaiter mixing up drink orders o.O",2,,
107,Jasmine M.,"PECK SLIP, NY",5,11,0,1.0,8/1/2012,"Went there tonight for the first time and will never, ever return. The drinks were made pretty well, but the people that work there are the rudest bunch I've seen in a long time. It's my cousin's birthday today, so we went there to celebrate. Strike #1: My cousin asked the lady serving her table for a pen and told her she wanted to place an order. The waitress walked away and never came back. When I went up to ask her for a pen maybe 15 minutes later, she walked away from me while I was in mid-sentence to go get the pen. Strike #2: The bartender (I think her name was Tia, or sounds a lot like that) would ask you what you wanted, didn't smile or anything, slam your drink down in front of you. One guy asked her to make him a mango long island iced tea. She's like, ""what's in it?"" He tells her that he doesn't know... however you make a long island, but with mango. I guess he meant mango juice, because she goes, ""Well the mango is a liqueur as well, so how do you expect me to make it? With coke or what,"" as she rolls her eyes. He was nice, but his response basically was, ""you're the bartender, figure it out."" Super rude of her.Strike #3: Same bartender, a girl walks up to the bar and asks for an apple martini at the same time as her uncle who was sitting there before she arrived. The bartender makes the drink for him, but not for the girl. She waits, and waits and waits, till finally (after too long in my opinion) She asks the bartender for the drink. The bartender caught an attitude! ""Well why didn't you order it?"" ""I did, at the same time my uncle did and you said you'd be back in a minute,"" which was the truth. Basically, the two go back and forth, the girl was being nice, so the attitude was so not warranted. I tried to smooth things out by saying, ""Okay, so you misunderstood her. Instead of arguing with her about what she didn't order, and you're wrong by the way because I heard her, why not just make the drink?"" The girl thanked me, the bartender told me to mind my business as she turns her back to make the drink.I left. lol I hope my cousin had a great night with the rest of her friends, but I will never ever set foot in that place EVER again.",,1,

111,Jamie C.,"New York, NY",92,331,7,3.0,7/23/2009,"I had heard about Moca through some friends and decided to check it out. I got there around 11:30 and it was only sparely populated, about 10 people scattered about and a group there for a birthday party. The lighting was sultry candelight, but not too dim because of the large window. I was loving the vibe of this place. It was grown and sexy, just the way I like it. The space is a little small for a lounge, but still pretty comfy. Moving on...The crowd: It got pretty crowded starting around 12:30 that night. It was kind of like a club in that it got a little hard to move through. We had taken over some couches since we got there early and so we were pretty insulated from the crowd: It has an older clientele, women late 20s-30s men 30s-40s. which might be my only down point on Moca - I felt like I was youngest there by at least 5 years (which 5 years from now i def plan on making this my spot). The women were far more on point than the guys which is almost always the case, we girls were looking fly. The drinks: not that strong, kind of expensive. I had at least three drinks and I was still only slightly tipsy and I am super weak where alcohol is concerned. The Harlem Bellini was DELISH though!!! yum yum yum. About $8-12/drink (not bad manhattan wise- but still its harlem). The food: I'll probably pass - the so-called jerk chicken wings were dry and had no heat to them. The regular buffalo wings looked good though, I was totally tempted to yoink one from our neighbor's plate. The service was really nice and attentive. despite the large crowd, she still managed to wade through people with our orders and to check in on us. The music: good mix of current and old school r&b/hip hop jams. In general, the music fit in with grown and sexy vibe. People were dancing and getting down which was def a plus. Overall, I had a good time. Not a place that I would seek out on a night when i'm craving some serious bumping and grinding, more of a spot to check out on a night when your feeling fun, but grown and want to chill, but also dance. That probably makes no sense, but I'm sure someone understands. Anyway, it's A-ok with me.",5,,1

With a couple of talented poets and a whole bunch of poseurs with dirty minds but not the aptitude to craft compelling poems.  But I digress, the drinks are moderately prices and are moderately strong.  Never had the food, but they have a full range of typical lounge/bar food. i.e. Wraps, Wings, Fries, Fish, etc.. Do NOT go here on a weekend night unless you have reserved a table because you will be standing. Like I said, it's a very tiny place.

We finished our tiny drinks in about 3 sips, but the waitress never asked us if we wanted more and it was impossible to get her attention because she was busy talking with her friends at the bar. We were very thirsty throughout our burnt meal. The fries were tasty, especially with some honey mustard dipping sauce. Otherwise, booo!",1,,
141,Hugo O.,"New York, NY",83,91,16,5.0,2/5/2007,"No review on this place! Come on, man!  I am proud to have quality places like Moca in my own backyard. You can add this to the list of hot spots on 8th avenue along with Melba, Society Coffee, etc. It's my new Friday night hangout. It's swanky, chic, and laid back. Cool to the core like only Harlem can do. The decor is awesome, never overdoing it. The crowd is definitely upscale, smart, and sexy. Bring your club clothes on though. Btw, this is not a club...it's a lounge with a small dance area near the DJ room but that's more than enough for me. The drinks are perfectly mixed, never bland. Get the ""Multiple Orgasm""...you won't regret it.The staff is attentive and real friendly. Don't get put off by the pat down. This is just to weed out the riff-raffs. You gotta come to Moca!",7,1,4
142,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,4.0,11/29/2007,"This place rocks. It's colorful but not pretentiously chic, and just has a great sense of cool to it. The funny thing is they play hit pop rap and r&b songs that are kind of typical, but it's like they know that these songs while popular are actually done well and have a groove. It's like if you went to a great loungy house party where everyone is hip in a kind of Harlem way. It's classic and just understated sexy. Their drink menu is filled with debauchery, it's strong drink after strong drink, and with drinks called Rough Sex, Screaming Orgasm, Threesome, you just know that people here know how to do their business. Just sexellence.The place is pretty much limited to one room, but they make do; the bar is to your left with only a few seats but the couches are very comfortable and deep; they line up the right side and the back which is secluded only by feel and a step I think. And this dude had this blingin' shirt that said Outlaw in platinum on the back. I want that shirt.",6,,3
143,Haden J.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,56,15,1.0,5/9/2010,"Bad service and disgusting drinks. one time a friend and I went there for happy hour. There were two people in the whole place, the bartender got an attitude because we didnt want to sit at the bar. we wanted to relax at the couch, apparently he didnt want to serve us or to walk all the 20 steps to us! So he got a horrible tip and we ended up eating around the corner at Mojos.",,,
144,Brian T.,"Kaneohe, HI",61,51,2,4.0,5/3/2009,"Moca, ALWAYS comes through. Last night, just like every other night that I visit, Moca had so much to offer. The energy in this place was intense. The DJ was on point and had the best hip hop / R&B and had the place hoppin. Everyone seemed to be extra friendly last night  as I made my way from one side of the dance floor to the other and suddenly realized that I made like 5 friends in just one sweep. I had a real nice time and I plan to be back in the very near future. I just don't plan on drinking so much next time.",1,,
145,Dee B.,"Washington, DC",104,558,222,4.0,5/25/2007,This is a nice spot.  Sophisticated and relaxed.  Grown and sexy. The drinks are good and I hear the appetizers are outstanding.  It's a bit smaller than you would expect but if you during the week you have plenty of room move around. I don't think there is another level...there is a seating area that you step up to that is reserved for large groups and I think the restrooms are downstairs.  Not sure...I have to go back and investigate.,1,2,4
146,Wendy W.,"Hempstead, NY",1,55,0,5.0,6/12/2009,Great prices on their hppy hour drinks. The food is delicious! Great service and comfortable environment!,,1,
147,Maat H.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,0,4.0,1/20/2013,"I went there a few times at the end of the year and each time I was experiencing something new. Fridays was nice after work. Sundays was pretty boring yet laid back. Not much going on to my surprise. Mondays was hilarious as it was comedy night. Tuesdays I have been twice and will make it my favorite night. The theme was Erotic Poetry night and let me just say it was unlike anything i have ever experienced. The poets were great and some of them were just plain nasty in a hilarious way. it was almost as funny as the comedians the night before. You can't believe what comes out of their mouths. people were rolling in their chairs with laughter. The host or producer starts the show off by ""warming"" the audience up and he is funny and out of control. Then the host, a sexy woman. gets the show started. She is funny as well. if you have tender ears or as the first host says, ""are a church member"", this might not be the night for you. It is always crowded and the drinks are great. $5 martini's all night long. as a man i loved the evening because it is always packed with beautiful women on Tuesdays. Its a more educated crowd since its poetry but very fun loving. I'm a banker and i've met doctors, lawyers, architects, MBA's and others there. Seems to make it a very cool and sexy night. All in all i give Moca a 4 star rating because of the entertainment nights. Otherwise it would be a 3 star because it is a good place to go hang with friends or meet people. Food is good. I will start back next week every Monday & Tuesday.",2,,
148,Tasha S.,"Bronx, NY",56,102,11,4.0,4/21/2009,"I like this spot for Happy Hour. I really do. Plus its not far from where I work. Its small but comfortable. The music is smooth. Not too much where you feel you need to dance but not too slow so you can break out a 2 step from time to time. It attracts locals for happy hour so it has mostly an African-American crowd from Harlem. They have $5 drinks specials during happy hour. Delicious and stiff martinis. Oh and the food is awesome. The catfish strips are recommended. Prices are reasonable. The only downside is there isn't much parking and its small so around 9pm it gets really snug. But if you can get there before 8pm and grab a couch for you and your friends, you'll be set for the night. No pressure for bottle service there neither,. Staff is very welcoming and polite.",,,
149,R R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,25,0,4.0,6/30/2009,"the food, is very very good, however i would not do a birthday get together there unless i talk to the  night manager b/c the day manager doesn't know shit for the night and when you get there its a whole different story, , the day manager told us no reservations, but that night when it was our birthday get together this night manager says were we are sitting ppl have reserved and we needed to move wtf, the dj could have played fresher tunes, but the music, moved at least, the fact that they give only three wine glasses and it was a party of 8 was pure bullshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, the drinks were good, but i would not do a party in there it's too small and they need at least more bathrooms down stairs, overall its cool for a small group frm work or you and your significant other but the get together experience was horriblep.s. the waitress did do her best to accommodate me and m guests so kudos to her",,,
150,Rachel G.,"New York, NY",0,126,0,4.0,7/23/2011,"This review is for food only, even though this place is really for drinks. I had brunch on a Saturday - totally empty, so fast service. The omelette was great, plus the potatoes were amazing. It's not the most comfortable place to eat a meal (it is a lounge, so the tables are low), but the brunch was good, with decent prices.",,,
151,David H.,"Philadelphia, PA",144,1,0,4.0,6/22/2009,"I was In Town from Philadelphia hanging out with a friend,she took me to moca,.I must say i fell in love with this place,good looking crowd,music slammin..Darn shame Philly don't have spots like Moca.Just kinda small,other than that,I loved it would go back again when I'm in Town..and Recommened it to friends here in Philly,when in NYC",,,
152,A C.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,8/19/2010,"I went to Moca this past Tuesday. Now the Catfish strips and the fries were delicious, which should warrant at least four stars, but the entertainment was horrid on Tuesday. Two men claiming to be comedians regaled us with low-class raunchy humor. The ridiculed for Fantasia for not having an education and then pronounced ""carte blanche"" ""cart blank."" We thought we were free of their puerile humor when to our dismay the ""erotic poetry"" night began. The poetry was not erotic, but crass and disgusting. Raunchy and erotic are two different things, but apparently this crew is unaware of the difference. If you go to Moca, please please pick a day other than Tuesday.",,,
153,Food C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,415,14,4.0,3/26/2012,only had wine here. there were no seats left at the bar and all the lounge seating area was taken. so we stood and had wine. the vibe is really cool here. love to see black people just hanging and chilling out and having discussions with friends and just having a good time. the food looked awesome here and smelled great. i will try it next time. its small but i did not feel crowded. just a really cool spot and i would definitely come back.,,,
154,Liz N.,"Yonkers, NY",1,135,0,4.0,2/7/2012,"the night started out a little shaky when i realized they didn't have any beers on tap, and literally the first three bottled beers that i asked for, they were all sold out.  i came here with a friend on super bowl night for a low key option (1 flat screen and you can actually hear what the person next to you is saying) and was very pleased with the friendly table service and probably the best wings i've had in a long time, ""Wicked Wings"".   So, if you can deal with a not so impressive beer selection, you will definitely have a great night eating tasty appetizers and enjoying the chill atmosphere.",,,
155,Mo W.,"Detroit, MI",7,41,0,2.0,5/15/2009,"the atmosphere is nice, but the service is eh. the drinks are kinda weak but the nice Harlem crowd.",,,
