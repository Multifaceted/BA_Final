Randomly came here for a bachelorette party, honestly just walking and passing on our way home for the night. Everyone was so nice and treated us to food and drinks as part of the celebration. They even played our silly song requests, like Backstreet Boys We were really loud and obnoxious, and not only did they not mind, they encouraged the fun! There's a ton of space so come with a big group of friends.",1,,1
1,Hank D.,"Holly Springs, NC",60,122,17,4.0,7/15/2018,"Went with a group of 7.  The place was busy, but not overly busy due to the World Cup final game on TV.  My chicken club sandwich was very good and the rest of the party had various salads.   There were a number of missteps by the wait staff and kitchen such  as wrong dressings, certain items not getting brought out, bad tasting draft beer, etc.    I was ready to give them a two star rating.   It wasn't bad enough to complain, but enough not to return.  Well, without any prompting, the server and manager both came out with four desserts for us to share and took off all the drinks and the onion rings which came out very late.   We were all very impressed with this effort on their part.  So i give them a four star rating without any reservation.The interior of the restaurant is very comfortable and has the feel of a country club lounge.",2,,
2,Derick D.,"Plantation, FL",205,213,1269,3.0,11/6/2018,"Stopped in for late night drinks. It was one of the only bars still open in our vicinity. Service was good. Ambiance was pleasant. Drink prices are high, but expected. Choice of music was solid. They had some good tunes playing. They have a limited food menu for the late night/early morning hours. The burger sliders were okay. Very small portion. It's served with only three tiny burgers. Service from the bartender was great.",2,,1

It's actually a beautiful bar w a great laid back vibe. Crowd is good. Everyone here seems to be nice people who/work live in the area (which is a nice area). Service is great bartender is an old school New York bartender. I did not drink. Food was good. Will be back.",1,,

They were great! Saucy, not breaded and not too saucy. We also had the 3 sliders. Can I say, the cutest, juiciest lil damnest burgers you ever saw!!! Super cute, tiny and yummy!!!Had blue moon and a cosmo-pretty darn good! Oh and our female server was super sweet, adorbs, attentive, and LOVED HER!!",3,2,2

8,Vladimir D.,"Cranbury, NJ",33,1,0,2.0,7/28/2018,"I've been coming here for a long time, 11 years to be exact. I have so many great memories here with coworkers and the bartenders Mike and Rory. But some months ago a new manager named Jesse came. I don't know where he came from but it is painfully clear he has no idea what it means to run a bar. He has extremely thin skin and has kept regulars from coming in without any reason. This place used to be packed and full of life but now its mostly empty and at times depressing. Most of the people who still come are here because of their connection to the bartenders (mostly Mike since Rory is no longer here). I love this place and I hate the route it's going. Jesse has brought this place down since his arrival. It's no longer a place where people want to go.",2,2,
9,Paul L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,5,0,4.0,8/12/2018,"For years this has been my favorite  ""watering hole"" after a show or opera in New York. The bartenders and staff are great as well as an awesome meeting place for my friends to get together. But, the menu changed and no longer is my favorite item for light, late night eating listed ie the hummus plate. I felt it was generally not as heavy as comfort food especially late at night. I hope the management will reconsider its menu.",1,,
10,Sylvia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,26,0,3.0,7/24/2018,Was a very happening local bar near Warwick Hotel...staff very inviting and social. Ordered some food and drink before heading out rooftop bar hopping. Bar dinner menu not too big but a decent selection. Had the buffalo chicken wrap with steak fries was a excellent portion size and had ordered Reisling and bar served a significant amoun in one order. Get a glass then a small carafe on the side like 2 glasses of wine for the price of one. They sorta messed up my order giving me buffalo wings instead of a wrap but bartenders made up for the mistake without me prompting them and served me another full round of wine no charge. Bar has funny paintings of celebrities all around. Nice place to drink with a few friends or pre-game before the late night action or stop by after dinner.,1,1,1
11,TaShane H.,"Rosenberg, TX",230,138,124,1.0,3/14/2018,"Sigh. Where do I begin? Service is terrible. Beer is warm. Food is meh. Bloody Mary's are awful. The waitstaff seems confused half of the time. We visited twice, both times it was rather empty, which should've been a sign. It was rather empty but the service was slow as if the place was packed. It's in a great location which gives it lots of potential but other don't maximize that potential and that's unfortunate.",2,1,1
12,Lauren T.,"Brooklyn, NY",183,53,7,5.0,11/25/2017,"This was a find for the city!! To be in this part of town food was really reasonable. The atmosphere is awesome, the back of the restaurant is really cozy with comfy chairs and a fire place. The food was awesome! I got a chicken sandwich with steak fries that did not disappoint. We also got hummus which was delicious with fresh veggies and warm pita bread. My mom got a Cobb salad that she said was pretty tasty. I would recommend this place the service was great and the food was reasonably which is awesome sauce!!",,,
13,Kristyna M.,"Jersey City, NJ",15,19,0,3.0,2/20/2018,Food is still delicious and my husband and I had a wonderful lunch for Valentine's Day but if you are not white be prepared to feel a slight chill at first. The hostess has a attitude to her disposition.  My husband is Spanish but could pass for white and had a better reception from her than I did when he arrived versus when I was alone. Not cool and I know now to arrive with him and not by myself or I will be contacting managementUnacceptable in the 21st Century!,3,,
14,Carolina F.,"Miami, FL",233,9,0,5.0,9/2/2018,"Came here after work with my friend and we loved it! The bartenders were all so nice, shout out to Hunter, and the Irish blonde lady. They were both a delight to chat with with. Definitely a casual place, not too crazy but has enough ambiance. There's two bars, one in the front and one in the back which we were surprised by, both were great. Also food is served until 3AM!!! Recommend the mini tacos!",,,
15,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,484,1951,4.0,6/25/2017,"I hosted an event here and never reviewed this place. If you attended the UYE, then you probably know (or can guess) why the memory escaped me for a while. Good times.There are booths and divided circular seating areas that makes this place super clutch and conducive to hosting larger groups of friends. This place would also be a good location for a swanky birthday party. The food and service are delicious and efficient, respectively.  They do not have a happy hour but both their drinks and food are fairly priced and generously portioned. The music was good and it surely was loud! Great party/after work vibe that keeps things moving. The bar area fills up quickly and not just for after work. I would strongly suggest making a reservation if you expect to have any definite seating options.I reserved a large portion of the center area, which happened to include a fireplace. It was the perfect place to hold court and have a good time.  Bathrooms (especially the one upstairs) can get a bit messy and that's a no-no for me.  However, if you don't mind the stairs you can head on down and take in the nice artwork and playbills on the walls while going to the larger bathroom area by the party rooms.  I would definitely recommend and plan to return.",16,9,14
16,Victor A.,"Cambridge, MA",2,8,1,5.0,4/18/2018,"Great food and great service! I ordered a steak sandwich, and my family a chicken club, chicken Caesar salad and a chicken tacos. We had a very attentive server ( blonde lady) and all  the staff was very friendly! Do not miss the place!",,,

The atmosphere on a Friday was lively enough and the noise range gave room for a decent level of convo. I am interested to see what their scene is like in the summer, and I'll probably need to better vet there drink menu. But this a decent watering hole for a quick pick me up after work. Oh and I can do without the smokers at the entrance......no one wants to stink of cigs when coming or leaving the establishment. Ownership should regulate that.",1,,

27,Josephine T.,"Moraga, CA",522,230,289,4.0,9/28/2016,"Came here to host a corporate happy hour following a conference at the nearby Hilton Hotel. Location was ideal as it was just down the street. Decor is pretty fun - portraits of various celebs in a unique style.Set up of the event was fairly straightforward - we chose our menu items, set up the time, date etc. There was a bit of confusion in the back and forth but ultimately it worked out fine. Day of event, we set up and the staff was very accommodating to our needs. They moved around furniture to make for more standing room as we were expecting a good amoutn of people. When we turned a HUGE crowd in the backroom, they kept pumping up the AC to keep our attendees cool and comfortable - which was nice because it was an especially hot and humid night in NY. They also have WiFi. They also have a charging station near the front of the venue.Food overall is decent, your usual bar food. The dessert trays I wasn't a huge fan of because it did taste like it was the frozen type that you thaw to serve. Overall, everyone really enjoyed the event and I'd be happy to hold another event here!",1,,1
28,Biggie F.,"Ashe County, NC",3,132,0,4.0,1/18/2018,"There are a lot of places like this in New York.  Many are quite good.  This is one of the gooder ones, and a good (or gooder) place to know if you are in this area and don't want to spend an arm and a leg, but do want to get some food with taste (and also don't want to go to one of the newer-style plastic vegetarian and/or oriental places that are springing up like newer-style plastic vegetarian and/or oriental places in NYC).Cozy, really nice people running the place.  Don't have to be a drinker to enjoy it, and probably would enjoy it if you were a drinker, too.",,,

30,Katie K.,"Manhattan, NY",67,12,6,5.0,4/10/2017,"This place gets rave reviews bc since taking my new job, I cringed knowing I would have to replace my local for a standard bar in midtown. This place has gone above and beyond.I'm hesitant to review bc it doesn't seem like most people know a back bar exists- couches, fireplace and the service it's the spot. Jemma, a very pretty girl with a warm presence took care of us my first time in and now we just ask what days she works and make it our afternoon office ;)This is a great spot for taking clients. Food is almost as good as the service. They have space to host plenty of corporate parties. I will warn you though- this is not a Saturday night spot- totally different. DJ/crowd is exactly what you hoped for it not to be...so stick to after office hours.",1,,1

34,Morgan M.,"College Station, TX",253,7,1,3.0,2/14/2018,I would give this place 5 stars because the guy at the door is awesome when you walk in.

35,Chloe C.,"Manhattan, NY",229,199,1033,4.0,3/14/2016,"This place ""doesn't do happy hour"" and still maintains really fair drink prices in midtown Manhattan?! I'm sold. I wish I had known about this place earlier, and they've got pretty delectable bar food, to boot. Mardory's UYE: whiskey flowing, a few old friends, a few new faces and some new names to go with them. I had a really interesting first time at this place. Mostly because it was teeming with people when I arrived at 6:02 p.m., but by the time 8 rolled around, I could have done cartwheels uninterrupted. We all had a great time, top shelf drinks ran about $8/9, which is really impressive. I tried the calamari, which was excellent, non-greasy, and served with some red pepper sauce, which made an awesome complement. Also tried the spinach-artichoke dip- it was decent. I was able to snag a few of Kathy's curly fries, and those were perfection.There are plenty of comfy booths in the back, and our girl Mardory was smart enough to reserve one for our party so that we could mingle without shuffling through a sea of people and being spilled on. There's a nice big bar in the front, and another in the back area. I guess there's also a downstairs, but I wasn't feeling too adventurous.I enjoyed this place a lot, and would come back for the fair prices and delicious bar snacks. Oh, and I'd hope for a different waitress because the one we had was only able to carry one drink at a time over to our table. I thought she had two hands and trays available to her...guess not",6,2,7

45,J P.,"Grapevine, TX",2,72,0,1.0,5/10/2017,"So I'm looking for dinner while in NYC on business.  Using Yelp, I find relatively good ratings for a place not far from where I am staying.  It's post-happy-hour so I give it a try.The first clue that this was going to be a poor experience was being confronted by the guy guarding the door, wanting to know why I wanted to go inside.  I said ""dinner"", so he let me in.  Is this typical of this place, because I've not seen that before in my many trips to NYC.  Or is this something happening elsewhere in town too?Inside, the place is active but not super crowded - there are several small tables open.  I ask the hostess for a table and she looks at me like ""are you kidding""?  She tries to get me to eat at the bar (something I personally do not find relaxing), then mumbles something about a few stools available along the window.  When I asked about a table, she just sort of ignores me.  I say ""thanks anyway"" and leave.Maybe this place has great food, but I'll never know.  My experience was they seem to have some sort of disdain for serving solo diners at tables, instead relegating them to the noise and din of the bar.  You know, business travelers often dine solo - it's not a crazy idea.I'll never know if the food in this place is worth it, because they obviously did not value me as a customer.",1,,

She ordered a drink that the bartender had never heard of. In New York that can be ""iffy"" but he actually showed a genuine interest  in it's origin. It's called a French Kiss and is a simple combination of equal parts sweet and dry Vermouth with a twist. Neat or on ice, your choice.I ordered a Manhattan and was asked ""Bourbon or Rye"", neat or on the rocks? As I said the bartender was really attentive. I wish I got his name.

The host / waiter seemed to be the only waitstaff working the tables, and he forgot about us waiting for a table by the bar twice, then after going up to him and asking him for a table a third time, he promised us the corner booth. Then turned around and gave it to another party who had just walked right in! We had to confront him about it in order to get it! While we were waiting at the bar for our table, there was only one bartender who was crazy overworked, and it took us 20 minutes to cash out so that we could even go over to the table we had already waited 25 minutes for. Getting served was also a battle for attention, and by the end of the whole experience, everyone in my party was fuming over all the hurdles of this place.

67,Jessica S.,"Philadelphia, PA",201,253,110,2.0,10/4/2015,"Came here for dinner with a friend as she works in the area and we wanted something casual. We went at 545 on a weekday and the place was mildly crowded at the bar but there was many tables available to sit at. However, when we told the hostess we wanted a table for 2, she looked at us like we were crazy and took a few minutes to ""find a table"" for us. Kind of weird but we ignored it as we were both hungry and ready to eat.I got a black bean burger with curly fries and my friend got a chicken wrap. We asked for sides of condiments, but when the food was brought out, those were left off our plates. The burger was meh, had a not so appetizing texture but did have avocado which was good. The fries were crispy and pretty good. As we were finishing up, we were chatting and continuing to catch up. There were other tables available and we hadn't been there even an hour yet. A person who I assume was a manager came up to our table and asked us if we needed anything else and that she was going to bring the bill. It was very obvious that they were rushing us out, because we weren't sitting there slamming drinks. Since we had just spent over 30 bucks on sub-par food and hadn't been there very long at all, I really felt that this was totally inappropriate and not a great way to get your name out there for customer service. I definitely won't be returning and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone either.",4,1,

This time, chose salad option instead of fries and fries came out. The wait staff is surly and they don't know their own menu. Me: no cheese on that please. Waitress: it doesn't come with chess. Me: we it say mozzarella on the menu so can you please make sure it doesn't have it. Last time, We had two vegetarians in our group. We both ordered the mushroom sandwich, which I've had before and is very good. We ordered one without cheese and one with. Waiter repeated the order back to us. Both came with cheese, so we sent one back. What came back was a reuben, which made us check the other sandwich: also a reuben. Luckily, my friend hadn't bitten into it. We tried to send both back, and the waited argued that even the mushroom sandwich has meat on it (it's not listed that way on the menu, and it doesn't come with meat). We had to argue with our waiter just to get what we ordered!! I'm not sure anyone on the staff cares about their jobs ...",,,

My coworkers and I come  here for lunch several times a month and every time we get assisted by the blonde (short) hostess, it's always such an unpleasant experience. My receipt say her name is Jayne N. For some odd reason, she's never welcoming and when she tends to our table she seems to have a very impatient attitude and almost judgemental towards out food selection. Every time I come here, my friends and I leave at least a 20 percent (or more) tip so I don't understand why she makes it such an uncomfortable experience when we go. I always almost wish she is off when we go. The food is good and the rest of the staff seems to be ok except her.  Someone please tell her to check her attitude at the door! My firm and I spend countless amounts of money at Faces and Names (we host our Corporate Challenge after party event there every year). I have no problem sharing my concerns and unfortunate experience to the department in charge of hosting these events here.

Our server was really great and explained all of our questions and made suggestions in an effieicnet and courteous manner... bravo - she was right about the burger most definitely delicious and cooked to a perfect medium rare as I ordered it...oftentimes the servers will ask how youd prefer your burger or steak cooked and its usually under or over done - this was not the case...it was impressive...a perfect medium rare...bravo again...as an added bonus to make the place more interesting the walls are graced by a one single painter's big ""impasto"" style portraits of rock stars and actors so it was also interesting to look around and see all the ""Faces"" on the walls...now the real rock star of the night other than our great server was the FRIES!!!yeah! and if your like me in search of the prefect cut and crispy-ness instead of small and soggy and kind of cold or luke warm which these were not and btw worth just the return trip just for the stellar fries...!! yeah the fries were a revelation....its hard to imagine that the plate I got was just a lucky collusion of all the elements that make up a perfect plate of fries...i hope not man !! I hope the next time I'am there the fries are likewise that rare, rare, blend of saltiness, crispiness and flash fried on the outside and moist and hot and delicate on the inside...I also had a salad with house dressing...once again portion size - dressing and the salad ingredients were just right...Theres some great music - you get the feeling that you could sit at the bar and talk to anyone and theyd be interesting and hip and or cool....All in all I'am glad to know this hidden gem of neighborhood eatery is around the corner and available for a great burger atmosphere and yes those perfect fries...not to mention the excellent !! service....all way way top drawer !!you cant beat this place...not a false note in the entire place...",2,,

I could have investigated the high price establishment with that screaming dude's name on the door. I pay for quality, not hype, these days.The bar seating could be bigger. I squeezed on to an empty stool between an amorous couple and a lonely iPod dude. Extra Dirty Stoli straight was the order. You'd be surprised how many bartenders get that wrong. Not the case here.

The guys on the kitchen was so nice with bringing us diff types of mayo and sauces to go with our food as we requested.  When we came again Sun brunch...the bartender was our waiter and he was super welcoming and attentive (Michael).

The bar space itself is good.  Horseshoe shaped, so you can catch some eye contact from a gal across the way. I say this cause Faces and Names is what I would call a pick up bar back in the day.  For those guys and gals who are single, or like to play on the side, a very good spot with a nice professional crowd.  I know they do a brisk Happy Hour, and you will find groups of co workers hanging out looking for fun.  The drinks were decent, if not very light. Not a drinking bar per se, a pick up spot to have few and see what's out there. Prices were pretty expensive as well.  $8 or so for a cocktail, so bring your wallet if you want to hang.  They do serve food, never had it, but from the looks of the reviews it must be good.I would say check out Faces and Names if you are looking to meet someone, or even just flirt.  Nice space, very good artwork by a local artist who does murals around the West Side bars.  Mostly rock guys like The Stones, Elvis and U2.  I priced his material, and he makes some cash. Prices started at 2-3 grand I believe.",3,2,2

It was a group of us that got together after we worked the day and we just poured into this section shaped like a U by a fire place. The food and drinks are really good. I had the grilled chicken club with guacamole and 2 French Martinis- done to perfection if I might add. The food prices are low, but the drinks are NYC expensive, they probably have HH, but we came a bit too late for that. This place has a real jazzy cozy feel to it; it's great to go to in the winter months! They have artwork of all the NY greats as far as actors, singers, comedians, so it was cool to pick out different celebrities on the wall.",5,1,3

140,Jenna G.,"Belleville, NJ",36,121,108,4.0,5/8/2015,"The agency I work for hosts an international conference at the nearby Hilton every year, so I always end up at Faces & Names for my lunch break. It is a cozy little place with interesting pictures of celebrities on the walls and dim lighting. The furniture is weird and uninviting though. You either have to sit on high chairs, which I dislike because I am short, or sit on extremely low chairs that make you feel like you're sitting on the floor. I have no idea how they think grown adults would ever find this furniture comfortable because it isn't practical at all. I like the food here, especially the California Chicken Club. I always get it on a wrap and it's really tasty. I also like the curly fries that come with it. I  tried the warm pretzel bites, which I thought were going to be little pretzel nuggets, but instead were cut up soft pretzels. They were still good and came with a tasty honey mustard dipping sauce. I also had the mini chicken tacos, which were very nicely displayed on the plate and looked so cute. They were delicious and a lot of them came in one order. I also tried the mozzarella bites, which were just OK. There are a lot of other appetizers to choose from, so we often ordered a bunch and shared them all. This is a good plan if you come here for happy hour and want a few things to munch on. The service was OK- the first time I came here it was packed at lunch time and it took forever for someone to take our order. Recently when I came here for lunch, there was hardly anyone in the place and we were served very quickly. The only complaint I have about the service is that this one waitress basically ignored my friend and I while we were sitting in the back. I wanted more soda during my meal, but I couldn't find the waitress and was disappointed. She waited until after we were done eating and drinking to check on us, which she should have done right after we got our food. Needless to say, she didn't get the best tip from us. Overall, I look forward to coming here and think it's a reasonably priced place with good food.",,,

The decor is classy but fun...we loved the paintings.  A very famous athlete turned broadcaster walked in and spent the rest of the evening at the bar.

It was only 10pm but the place really didn't have much going on by way of people. One thing that I did like was the fire place and the lounge seating next it.

(Or is that an accurate photo of the sexagenarian Rolling Stones?)You'll hear plenty of names dropped as well in after work banter about colleagues; complaints about managers, bosses and the like.You can get the drinks here at any bar. There are a few brews on tap and a healthy selection of spirits. No, by far the best feature and attraction of Faces and Names is the food.Sliders, those bite-sized morsels of meaty bliss, should be available here as single shots. Forget tequila, I could easily pop a slider shot and repeat until comatose from too much cow.But wait, there's more!Mini chicken tacos were also a winner, crisp on the outside and fresh on the inside. A delicious chipotle sauce gently graced the top of the chunks of chicken. Other available snackables on the to try list include mini cuban sandwiches.The bar staff was friendly and patient, especially when dealing with someone who was confused over Heineken vs. Heineken light. Faces and Names can be cramped and crowded during the after work rush. For those who prefer table service, a small dining area is available past the bar.

Cool Funky style place; We had a great time here and loved the southwestern salad and pork buns!!  Also, in my opinion the prices were reasonable.",1,,
169,Uday K.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,7,0,4.0,4/10/2015,"Good place to hangout after work. They have decent collection of scotch and other drinks. The food is good for a bar, the chicken mini tacos are yummy. It does not feel cramped or overly loud even when it is full.",,,
170,Amal S.,"New York, NY",57,282,16,3.0,4/18/2013,I go for the super cute bartender Jayne. She works days- go see her at lunch or during the day.  She recommended the black bean burger. I wasn't hungry that much-  OMG BEST THING I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME!!!!!!!! I inhaled it as if it were my last meal.I will be stopping by once a week after tennis to get this- go and try it- you won't regret it. I am not one for a burger that isn't beef- OMG OMG OMG- if you don't like it- I will finish it for you :),,,
171,Denice C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",96,101,18,4.0,11/29/2014,"Popped in here the other night after moving. We were finished. It was a Weds around 4 and it was pretty dead. It was dark and romantic lighting for our dirty and sweaty selves, but maybe all for the better. Service was fast. Small but good beer menu and good food. I ordered the special burger of the day and my BF ordered something that disappeared faster then I could figure out what it was. We also ordered the fried pickles and wings. Needless to say we were starving but there was hardly a crumb left on either of our plates. By the time we left the after work crowd had rolled in and both the front and back bars had filled up. Will come back forsure!",,,
172,Carola K.,"Andover, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,2/25/2016,"I love this bar (restaurant).  The food is really excellent, great service etc.  For me, who used to live in the neighborhood, I also love that it is largely unchanged, but perhaps even better now, for many years.  I love the atmosphere, and the ""faces"", artist Dan Springers paintings.  Just a consistently good place to go to.  Especially in this neighborhood.  If you're a tourist, at one of the nearby hotels, don't go to the lousy bar in your hotel, come here!",,,
173,Q O.,"Blue Bell, PA",2,75,33,4.0,7/7/2014,"We, the family of five, went there to watch the World Cup game between Netherlands and Costa Rica. The service was excellent. Our waitress was great. She was so accommodating to our kids. The food was excellent and the price was reasonable. The beer selection was good. They even took back the glass of wine my wife order because it didn't taste to her liking. We had chicken tacos and chicken parm sandwich. We will definitely visit again. A very family friendly place.",1,,

Updated review","The mini chicken tacos are soooo good! So cute in size and perfect for sharing.  The onion rings are in this crispy, beer batter (I think).  Fried to golden deliciousness.  The Little Rickys (mini cuban sliders) are savory. I love the sauce that it comes with.",1,,
175,Christopher S.,"Unionport, Bronx, NY",0,29,23,5.0,6/29/2014,"Found this place thanx to Yelp! The hubby and I were in the area to see a show at near by City Center and we needed a post show nosh. What a gem! The coolest lounge with kick-ass upscale bar food! We got the chicken tacos, mini Cubans and curly fries. Everything was super flavorful including the drinks and lets not forget the primo Black & White for dessert! Service was excellent and the DJ was playing great tracks. Will totally b back and maybe even celebrate a Bday here!",1,,
176,Jen K.,"West Linn, OR",507,1927,6600,3.0,11/13/2009,"I am a football freak so the highlight was watching a college game with a former NFL QB across the bar.  This lounge could be anywhere in the U.S., so while it was an enjoyable experience it isn't a destination kind of place while visiting NYC.  My large party took over part of the back bar and we mostly fit on one of the comfortable u-shaped booths.  We ordered one of almost everything off the appetizer menu and had a mix of beer, wine and cocktails.  The food and drinks were fine, but in no way memorable.  The interior is a bit dated (not trendy, not classically cool) and the bathrooms are downstairs which is a bit annoying. The place was crowded and our waitress seemed overwhelmed. At one point I ended up with a (mostly empty) drink knocked into my lap.  Compared to most of our other stops in town, this seemed reasonably priced, but the least ""New York"" of the bunch.",5,4,5
177,Jessica N.,"Woodside, NY",0,1,0,3.0,4/15/2015,"Came here after hearing great reviews from my friends and had a great time! The food was delicious, the staffs were friendly and attentive, and the bar was knowledgeable. However, one thing that hindered our enjoyment of the restaurant was the fact that a guy (who seems to be the manager/or owner?) was walking around chewing tobacco and spitting it into a cup. Its just a bit unsanitary for my taste, and very much ruined my otherwise great experience at Faces & Names. Other than that the place is great, relaxing ambiance, great for get together with friends and the food is lovely",,,
178,Mireille R.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,85,274,3.0,11/28/2010,"A great spot for drinks to hang out with friends. Not too crowded on a Saturday night; easy to converse. Great apps from spicy mini Cubanos to very flavorful and well seasoned Chicken Strips to the creamy seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake.We had reserved a section as there was a group of about a dozen of us. My only complaint would be hailing down the waitress was difficult at times.  Even though we were a large group, she rarely came to check on us.  We were constantly looking for her to order more drinks or food.",,,
179,Sharyn N.,"Waterbury, CT",1,1,0,5.0,7/19/2014,"Stopped in for a drink and some appetizers.  We sat at the bar and had a great time. Jane was our bartender and she was awesome!!! The drinks were perfectly made and delicious (I had the strawberry lemonade made with vodka). Thanks to Janes' s recommendation, we ordered the mini chicken tacos. They were really really good. Great bar, great atmosphere and great decor.",1,,
180,Janet G.,"Huntington, NY",0,6,1,5.0,4/5/2015,"Had my birthday party here on a Saturday night and this was a PERFECT pick. I was very anxious about choosing the perfect location, and the space turned out to be awesome. So accommodating, they set aside a separate section for my group, even decorated with balloons, and threw in a SURPRISE FREE BOTTLE of champagne on the house!!! The staff went out of their way to be so accommodating and sweet, I couldn't have been happier. They have great drink specials all night and food late night so everyone could order their own things and it was very affordable. The beginning of the night had plenty of chill indie music so my group could chat on the comfy couches and then a DJ came around 11pm--the lights were lowered and it got fun and dance-y; a few other birthday groups were there too with their own sections and seemed super happy. Even though it got busy it never felt too cramped. It's a nice atmosphere also even when it's not busy on a weekend night. Definitely go to Faces and Names!",,,
181,Monica J.,"New York, NY",1,18,0,4.0,6/10/2013,"This place is around the corner from where I work, so at least once a month my colleagues and I come for lunch. Yes, lunch. Their bar food is excellent and the service is quick. Thursdays and Fridays are obviously busier, even at lunchtime, but my friend and I don't usually have a problem getting a table.The atmosphere of the place is a little dark. It's not a problem for me, but there is definitely low lighting and sometimes candles of the table. One server is particularly enthusiastic, but not in an annoying way. Also, she's a particular favorite as she sometimes gives us free cookies. :-)I usually get the chicken quesadillas and onion rings (with ranch dressing please!) I've had the chicken tacos however, and they are also quite excellent. The prices for this place are reasonable, especially for midtown west. My usual meal of the quesadillas and onion rings are under $20, including the tip. Great place to eat if you're in the area and looking for bar food that won't break the bank.",,,
182,Kendra E.,"Starkville, MS",0,2,0,4.0,2/14/2016,"Great place! Went on a Saturday night and were able to sit at the bar without a wait- this may not be typical, but it was 5 degrees outside and people were not venturing out. Had the grilled chicken club  as a wrap and curly fries. It was delicious! The service was just what we like- they aren't pestering you all the time, but you never had to ask for anything. The décor is interesting and atmosphere is welcoming. A very safe choice if you want a menu of items you recognize, burgers, salads, wraps, etc. I was very happy with our choice.",,,
183,Jessica L.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/22/2014,"I never write reviews, so when I do, I feel really strongly about it. They hire douchebag servers/bartenders. Save your money and go elsewhere. You can find cheaper places in the area with better service (Barcelona Bar on 8th Ave. b/t 54th & 55th!) I work in hospitality and always used to recommend Faces to my customers because the food is okay. After the last few times though, I was repeatedly disappointed by the terrible quality of the service. I so wanted to love this place, but it's literally impossible.",1,,1
184,Whitni W.,"Inglewood, CA",67,107,24,3.0,3/26/2012,"Went there this past Saturday while on my first trip to NYC. It was located one block from my hotel, so that was a plus, especially because it was beginning to rain. We approached the entrance, which was pretty quiet. I asked the door man why it was so quiet at 11.30pm, when he opened the door which let out the sound of the music and crowd. Place was packed! We lucked up on seats at the bar, which a gentleman helped us to. A DJ was playing hip music (from his laptop) which was cool, a tv was playing NCAA basketball at the bar, bartender Brian was very chill and friendly.Food was ok overall, but the buffalo chicken salad was terrible. Shredded iceberg, celery slices, and chunks of buffalo chicken breasts with a tablespoon of blue cheese dressing. No thanks. We also had the calamari, and sliders. Drunk guy paying the bill? Awesome.I would go back to this place, arrive early, and 86 that salad.",1,,
185,Kate M.,"New York, NY",0,221,0,4.0,3/11/2015,"Great bar in the Midtown West area. A little divey but in a good way, with good happy hour deals and the ideal greasy cheap bar food. Would definitely come back!",,,
186,Linh N.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,540,1462,3.0,8/20/2012,"A really nice bar to grab a drink with friend, significant other, business partner or whoever it is. The atmosphere fits almost every kind of situation. I came with a group of friends for a birthday celebration and I was surprise how well they catered to us. There were also mellowed out fellows at the bar and intimate couples at the lounges toward the back of the bar.The bartenders are attentive and great at what they do. Drinks are strong and the bartender doesn't make you wait long as long as you take the initiative and get their attention.Bathrooms are down the stars pass the bar. Really clean and spacious. A great bar when you want a break from the loud and obnoxious ones that are taken over by college kids. This had a more mature and sedated vibe.",,,
187,Nick S.,"Washington, DC",5,16,161,4.0,10/27/2012,"Came here on 10/25/2012 before seeing Louis CK around the corner at the NY City Center. The bacon cheeseburger and curly fries were decent, as was the beer selection (I went with Lagunitas IPA), but the wings were fuckin' great (perfectly cooked). We sat next to a nice painting of Willem Dafoe. Louis CK ended up disappointing me, but oh well.",,,
188,Natasha B.,"Sydney, Australia",153,198,84,4.0,7/14/2012,"Great bar for the midtown area, drinks are pricey although very good, but that's expected in the area. Bar food selection is larger than most bars, and kitchen's open pretty late. Beer on tap always has a few microbrews (back in black was excellent).The biggest plus for Faces and Names is the atmosphere. You can get an intimate corner, or organize something with a group. Big open space, two bars, and a room in a back (always open) that would be great for a party.",,,
189,Dylan E.,"San Dimas, CA",5,58,6,5.0,11/2/2014,This place is absolutely awesome and the service was superb.  We made reservations for a large party of 15 of us and they were easily able to accommodate all of us. The drinks kept coming during Open Bar and we were barely without a drink. The wings were very delicious. The decor is very unique and is a very fun atmosphere. Good location in the city near some other high frequent places.,,,

We sat at the bar and drink orders were taken quickly. Couldn't have been a problem with my two associates order as they both had beer. My martini was mixed perfectly with a very nice pour as well.We all had Chicken Club sandwiches, which were delicious. The bread was perfect and the avocado added a nice touch.Nothing fancy but a great place to discuss business and have a bite.",1,,
191,Cindy M.,"Buckingham, PA",0,12,15,4.0,11/29/2014,"What a great place. Was there with a group of friends in a Saturday night a few weeks ago. Great Live DJ music, service was excellent, we snacked on appetizers all night and stayed till 3:30am. We had no idea of the time because the place stayed packed and the server made sure we were always filled with water or drinks. We had the burger sliders which were OK, not as good as reviews said, but the chicken tacos were AMAZING. dumplings were good too. This is a great place to catch up with friends after a play.",,,
192,Lesia C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",233,84,25,4.0,5/31/2014,Nice bar area. Very attentive bartenders. Drinks here are very good and the servers eager to please.

193,Steven M.,"Mokena, IL",1165,1210,14,3.0,6/2/2013,"If there was ever a place that reminded me of Billy Joel's the Piano Man, this would be it. No piano. But it has this depressing vibe to it and the bar tender goes around to all the single guys and listens to their stories with interest! The one to my left is a writer and he was telling him about this new play he was working on! (""Bill, I believe this is killing me"") Holy crap Batman! That is what this poor guy has to listen to and keep a smile on his face! The drinks were great as well as the service. I added  an extra tip because I for one, couldn't deal with being the discount therapist all night long!",3,7,4
194,Keith K.,"New York, NY",7,55,2,3.0,11/17/2014,"The food was good, the menu offered a variety, overall decently priced for manhattan, and the atmosphere had a buzz.  The bartender was the reason for 3 stars over 4. My girlfriend and I came for dinner and we were asked to place a credit card down before ordering our meal. In addition we ordered the craft beer sampler, and we were given different beers than the menu suggested. I would go back if in the area, but I would not go out of my way.",,,

199,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",556,2581,7,3.0,7/8/2011,"This uppity bar serves up a limited selection of booze, but that is tolerable, as it is located in a very tourist-friendly part of town. It is not like rich folk from all over the US come to Times Square to have a craft brew from some random Yankee.The bar gets really busy, and it is definitely a place to be seen, but for those looking for a wide variety to choose from, F&N is not your place. You would most likely want to drop by for the convenient location and NYC style trendiness.I do not know how the food fares here, but I figured that the bar scene at this joint was noteworthy in terms of location, vibe, and people. The individuals that choose this as their watering hole definitely have a sort of pretentiousness to them. For some, that is exactly what they want.",1,1,
