The yellow split pea soup was delicious. Had I known, I'd have bought a quart! I had a really yummy chicken cranberry walnut sandwich (chicken salad). And the soup and half-sandwich were 7 or so bucks. Will be back.",1,1,2

Felipe at the salad bar spend more time talking to co workers than making the salad. Then gave so much attitude when asked to please pay attention! The women at the front were no nicer! Please, thank you and may I help you would be good terms to be taught to the staffs. I was pleased with the food, I'll try again in 6 months !",,,
2,Jerry J.,"McAllen, TX",82,378,886,4.0,5/18/2018,Good value.  Decent food.  Had the pizza lunch special.  Two large slices and a can of coke all for $5.  So far it is the best lunch deal I have found in Manhattan.  It's a great place to fill the belly without emptying the wallet.,,,
3,Simon B.,"New York, NY",365,137,26,1.0,3/13/2018,"This was delivered to my apartment just like this 10 mins ago, and the ""cafe"" refuses to refund us. Reason: They are paid to deliver it. Did I pay $20 + tip just for the delivery? Didn't know the food here was free! If you are a restaurant that 1. Prepares food 2. Delivers food, there are customer expectations with both preparation and delivery. I wasn't expecting much from this place, a simple 8 slices of pizza, shaped as a pie, delivered to my door. Nothing crazy right? Not only did they not reconcile the problem, they won't even admit to a problem with the order! If they had just apologized and recognized they did something wrong, I don't think I'd be as upset. Of course I'm hungry and want my food but I understand if something goes wrong. Nothing is perfect but come on, at least fix it.",2,2,
4,Barbara S.,"Worcester, MA",2,216,0,4.0,9/6/2018,"Generally I love Gigi's.  I go there and order from there all the time. It is my staple; probably because I live in the apartment building above it.  It is just so convenient!  Today was different.  I went to their website and saw a discount coupon for an online order.  Great, or so I thought.  I placed my order and said I would do a pick up instead of delivery.   I immediately went down to the Cafe after I stopped at my local bodega for some groceries.  My order was a chopped salad.  You give them a list of ingredients and they make it up.  You pick your type of lettuce, protein, and as many vegetables as you want and then they chop it up.  It is wonderful!  I saw my salad half made sitting there.  People approached the bar to request their salads and mine got pushed aside.  I complained and another employee came to finish my salad.  He added everything and then put in the salad dressing.  I went up to him and told him it is suppose to be on the side. I wrote it on the special instructions. So he argued with me.  I was furious!  Now I have to wait more until he starts it all over again.  But no, he did not start all over again. He pored off the dressing and continued to finish my salad.  So, what is the moral? I don't know!  I paid for it, took it up to my apartment, ate it, enjoyed it and I'll worry about what to do next time.",1,,

There are also plenty of healthy snack options here too! The premade salads in front of the cash register are my favorite thing to grab - the buffalo chicken salad, the salmon salad and the Greek salads are my favorites!!!",4,,4
6,Pawel U.,"New York, NY",489,4,0,1.0,9/2/2018,Terrible staff. The most rude people I've ever encountered. The food is not worth the extreme pricing. They really need new management and employees.,,,
7,Marcus S.,"Manhattan, NY",256,6,0,1.0,4/16/2018,"I work in the area and frequented Gigi's a couple times a week for breakfast and lunch, specially their breakfast sandwiches and pizza. For the price in the neighborhood, friendly cooks, and counter staff - it was hard to beat. However, after two major problems in one year with orders, each veihimitly denied by managing staff, I will not be returning. I advise you avoid them too.About two months ago I tried one of their breakfast power bowls with quinoa, which contained a pebble that nearly cracked one of my teeth. When I shared my experience with the manager, he told me it was not possible to help me without seeing the pebble, which I had swallowed.On a second occasion, 4/16/2018 I ate one of their breakfast egg sandwiches (the only thing I've eaten today) and now am on my way to urgent care with a stomach and head ache. The manager showed me a message to him from higher management to throw out eggs that he said was done yesterday, but I remain unconvinced. When I tried to tell him more details about what I ate, he told me to go the hospital and showed me the door. I'm not accusing this cafe of poisoning me, because I neither kept my receipt nor have the money do anything about it. What was abundantly clear in these two instances with the company is that Gigis seems to conduct business at a higher level to dismiss the customer's concerns in any occasion where they be possibly at fault. Once once was I offered a refund, apology, or any whiff of responsibility taken for what they serve. On the contrary, both times the manager seemed defensive and avoided eye contact with me. So take my experience and do what you will. My issues we're all at the 72nd at Gigis cafe, but there are many other locations of the same name I will no longer eat at. I'll miss the staff, but will be glad to never see that manager again.",1,2,
8,Roberta P.,"Saint Charles, MO",2,68,3,1.0,9/3/2018,"I will never forgive them for royally screwing up a very simple catering order that I placed over a month in advance and confirmed weekly before the event. It was prepaid and prearranged from the catering menu they have WITH PHOTOS. Not only were they ONE HOUR LATE, they arrived with the WRONG items. They only had to bring the food 1 BLOCK AWAY and they couldn't even do that right. I just think of all of the other places in this neighborhood I could have ordered from that would have done a much better job. I used to be a daily regular, but will never step foot in that place ever again. I cannot forgive them for what they put me through. I only hope that when they have a special life event that someone rains on their parade.",,,
9,Amanda A.,"Manhattan, NY",119,27,4,3.0,4/29/2018,"When it comes to delivery, be wary! Or, go for it, if you'd like a surprise. The ""'vegetable lentil - 'or any other vegetarian soup if you don't have it, please'"" soup can be quite shocking if you haven't eaten chicken in the past 8 years and you think it's veggie soup until you have chicken in your mouth! And the pre-made salad was ancient. Soggier than socks after a half marathon in 90 degree weather... smelled the same, too. Seamless was kind enough to contact them directly for me and get me a refund - which I was surprised because of the other reviews. I wouldn't say don't go there, because I've had fine food there before but only when I went in and could see it for myself first. The delivery guy was nice, though! + go to Tasty Cafe across the street. I think it's the same company but so much better in general (delivery, cleanliness, food...everything).",,,

We have also ordered their soups which never disappoint and my current favorite menu item is their steak melt which has mushrooms and caramelized onions. So good! I plan on trying their whole menu We have only tried breakfast once and I have to say their bacon was not crispy as  we would have liked. Will give their breakfast another try.

22,Mark D.,"Miami, FL",42,315,872,2.0,2/5/2016,"This place barely ekes out a 2-star. We came in earlier in the week to get chicken soup to go for our flu-stricken daughter. Since she loved it, we thought we'd give dining in a try. I'm sorry I did...counter staff were inattentive, unintelligible, and clueless, taking customers out of order. Dining area was dirty and in disarray. There were some dubious characters loitering there nursing their coffees. Employees were also loitering or eating. I ordered  the beef lasagna (meh/lukewarm) corn (overly chewy and cold) and grilled squash (very tasty but COLD). I was too tired to confront the morons about it. Others in my party had beets (meh) roast potatoes (tasty) roasted chicken (good) and salmon (too fishy).  I'd say get something uncomplicated like chicken soup or a wrap TO GO. I definitely would NOT dine in. The price and ""some"" of the food items keep this place from one-stardom.",1,,

Veggies were fresh enough. Friends got a turkey pesto sandwich and philly cheese steak sandwich. #1 reason this place is good.. It has seating. And seats face out to street. So nice view, to sit, people watch, enjoy a classic, decent lunch.",,,
24,Leonie B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,5/10/2017,"Since moving to the UWS a year ago, I've been eating from GiGi's on Broadway at least 4 times a week. In that time, the quality food has been consistently high. What's more, the people who work there are beyond helpful. Nothing is ever too much trouble; they are genuinely happy to see you and remember what you have ordered previously. In addition, I often order delivery - and it always arrives within the Seemless estimates and hot, the food still remains presented well and the deliveryman is pleasant and courteous. I feel it's really important to emphasize that the happy vibe within Gigi Café is reflected in the quality of food. I have been to similar cafes whereby the atmosphere is drab. As a consequence they slop together your food compromising the quality. At Gigi's the taste and presentation is always appetizing it's obvious that the staff care. Their diligence and pride is reflected in the food and service. I watch the team interacts with each other; they are just as courteous to one another as they are to the customers. It really does make it a more inviting atmosphere for customers. At times, I eat in the back which is always clean and tidy too. I rarely write food and service reviews; however I am most impressed that a year has passed and the quality and service has been consistently high. As such, I feel it's important to express my gratitude with this review.",3,,2
25,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,3.0,11/16/2015,"For $8.99, you get a salad with one protein, three premium toppings and 6 add-ons. I really liked my salad but the ""organic"" arugula leaves were definitely wilted. The cafe is also really skimpy when it comes to portion sizes of the toppings, which I don't really understand because most of the ingredients are perishable so they have to toss everything out anyways (or not). The dining area is tidy and neat but even in mid November there were fruit flies flying around. Overall not a sanitary cafe.",2,1,2

27,Gosia L.,"New York, NY",159,94,143,5.0,1/13/2017,"Consistently fresh, tasty food. I always check in with the Belly loyalty program, and got 15% off my last order. I got a terrific salad made to my liking from the salad bar. This place can be pricey, but it is always great for lunch/ dinner and snack options. Note to patrons ordering meals to go- make sure to get your own utensils and napkins from the untensil stand. The cashiers do not pack forks, etc, when bagging your food. I learned this the hard way one time after I was ready to dive into my food in the park and had no utensils.",,,

29,Travis L.,"Seattle, WA",50,357,72,3.0,1/20/2016,"This location is pretty solid. The bagels and breakfast sandwiches are quite tasty and fairly priced. Honestly, there are very few places, imo, that have good bagels on the UWS. The bagels here are light, sticky, and warm, like a product of bread should; Also, they have a great assortment of schmears.For the most part they are pretty well stocked, however they do run out of bagels and other breakfast stuff rather quickly. I get the whole limited space and reduce waste argument but apply some basic operations/logistics to your business---please!",,,

34,Mary W.,"New York, NY",0,10,2,1.0,6/11/2017,"I have ordered from this location a few times and every time the food is good, but the customer service is rude and unprofessional. That's why I switched to online ordering - but even that has become problematic at this point. Thus, I will not be ordering delivery from here again. From the woman who answers the phones, to the weekend manager, to the delivery people - I have never seen anything like it. I had ordered delivery at work a few times and every time I clearly write a phone extension for the delivery person to tell security to call when they arrive. In the 16 plus years I've been working at the same establishment, security always announces visitors or deliveries. There is no option not to announce people.Unfortunately, in my experience, most of the time the delivery people of Gigi's refuse to have security call my extension. Then they wait and sit in the lobby. Or they have security call a generic number that they have on file. I'm not sure as to why since the two sentences of directions are right there on the slip - and I have the order confirmation emails.I have tried to speak with the weekend manager about this twice. The most recent being this afternoon. He refuses to listen, talks over me, refuses to give out his name and refuses to address the issue. He has told me twice now that I'm outright lying since his delivery people are telling him that security at my work establishment refuses to announce that they have arrived. (Yet he hasn't spoken with them while I've been on the phone with him.) ""It's your word against my employees',"" he stated. When I ask for the delivery person's name, he refused. When I ask to speak with the delivery person, he refused. When I asked if he could speak with the delivery person as he's on the phone with me to clear this up, he refused. He didn't offer any other suggestions.When I told him that I'd be cancelling my order for today since he wouldn't clear up the issue and was being unprofessional, he said, ""Okay, go ahead."" And then hung up on me.This isn't brain surgery. It's reading a delivery slip with a phone extension on it.",,,
35,Jon P.,"Binghamton, NY",7,21,2,4.0,12/3/2017,"Surprisingly good. You see very similar types of salad bar/restaurant cafes all over the city, but at Gigi's you can get a huge salad for only $10. I felt very full after eating half of it, and you can get so many ingredients thrown in for the same flat price. It looked reasonably clean in the food area, but I had to take a star off because of the filthy bathroom. They need to take care of that.",,,

37,Leah D.,"Newark, NJ",267,189,183,3.0,3/19/2015,"This is a place to go when you're in the area, you have only so many minutes to eat, and you want something decent. I wouldn't come here for pizza or any of that jazz. Stick to the basics. Below are safe bets:-Salad ($8.99): You tell them what you want and the guy behind the counter mixes it all the super fresh ingredients up for you. . Here's a tip: When the guy puts in his idea of a serving in your bowl, ask if you could have a little more of that topping. You will end up with a lot more salad for no additional cost. -Chicken Milpero Melt ($7.49): It's a melt with mexican-style grilled chicken, white cheddar cheese, roasted peppers and onions, avocado and chipotle spread. It's flavorful. Here's another tip: Ask for it extra hot. If you don't, you may end up with a luke warm sandwich. -Oatmeal: It's only served in the morning, but it's good. It's much better than that instant crap you have at home. I usually get the oatmeal in water with brown sugar and cinnamon. It makes my day. -Yogurt parfait: It's nothing special, but they can't really screw it up. -Omelette: Any way you order it, you'll get a standard omelette. Again, this one is hard to mess up. I would deeply appreciate if their sandwiches were made to order. Sandwiches sitting in a case all day aren't so appealing.",1,1,1
38,Daniel O.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,34,0,1.0,11/17/2017,"As an earlier reviewer stated : ""the customer service is rude and unprofessional."" The guys at the salad bar are usually very nice and accommodating, however when you get to the register that's usually another story. I've spent on an average about $20 a week there for over 15 years ( before  it was even Gigi ) -which isn't a fortune - i work in the neighborhood and shop at quite a few different shops/ cafes/ restaurants. A few weeks ago I went there to get two large coffees  to go at 10pm the cashier and the other woman behind the counter conferred and it was the decision of the behind the counter woman to inform me they ran out of coffee. Since the store is open till Midnight - how difficult would it have been to put on a pot of coffee ? What's the markup on each cup of coffee like 360 % or so ? Compound this with the fact that there's at least 6 places within a three block radius to get coffee from do you really want to be that cavalier about your customer service ?? I emailed the corporate office on the next day and didn't even get a response. Little secret to others here. The original Gigi's at 64 E 34th St makes a FORTUNE doing corporate catering in the area. I just found this out about three months ago. They don't care what you think about them or their other stores.Avoid any Gigi's. Screw them !! On the UWS go to Cafe 71 or The Utopia Diner or Hot and Crusty on W 71st st or Starbucks or like I said at least half a dozen other places. This store will never get one penny from me.",,,

45,Pia V.,"New York, NY",1890,890,1542,3.0,5/28/2012,"This was one of the first places I ate at when I started work in NYC.  They have a great selection of hot foods, i.e. salmon, pastas, burgers, pizza, soup, etc.  But what I love this place for are their grilled veggies and salads.  They offer a base price w/a few special items and unlimited toss-ins, the small is seriously large enough for me.  There aren't very many places like this in NYC.  In fact, a lot of the ones I went to before this place made me pay 50 cents per toss-in which was a total rip-off.  They don't skimp on how much they add to your salad, they fully mix everything in and will even chop it for you.The 2 stars are off because though this place is literally like 3 buildings away from my work they can take a seriously long amount of time to deliver our food.  I understand that there are other factors to that, but it is also the fact that there is always a 50/50 chance they are going to get the order wrong.In the end, it is a great cafe to grab lunch at even if you're in a rush ... but be prepared to wait and sometimes call-in to correct them on your order.",2,2,2

The eggs were runny and definitely undercooked, I was starving so I took my chances. The Leek & Broccoli soup was awful. I took one sip and threw it away.

Placed a double order tonight & what I got was obviously some cheap frozen inedible drek instead of they're regular chicken fingers. This was after another abysmal experience about 3 weeks ago, when Gigi waited 15-20 mins after I received my order conf to call me saying they ran out. Woman on the phone then refused to contact Yelp Eat24 to cancel the order. She said it was up to me to deal with Yelp Eat24. Opened online chat with Yelp Eat 24, and after a long wait, cust srvc agent finally joined chat, then repeatedly left me hanging for several minutes at a time. Eventually, agent, who obviously failed to completely read my msg, said only the restaurant could cancel the order. After another long delay, agent finally contacted Gigi & my order was finally canceled. Gigi just lost a regular customer, and I'm also not feeling enthusiastic about Yelp Eat24.",,,

I wanted to order and heard the two men talking in spanish in front of me. Since my native language is spanish and i feel more confident ordering food and asking questions in spanish I was happy I could. I asked for an empanada, the man looked at his co worker and laughed, started mimicking me and saying in spanish ""stupid gringa trying to speak spanish"". I asked again and he literally ignored me and shouted to the manager ""sorry i dont speak spanish can you talk to this woman"". The manager was soo embarrased and said a hundred times sorry, because she too spoke spanish and called the man to order, yet he laughed and did not care. He would not speak to me nor look at me. This attitud is racist, discriminating and rude. He thought i was american and would not understand his insults. Even if an American girl were to speak to him in spanish she should not be treated like that, yet i was not american and he clearly insulted me, made fun of me, discriminated me because of my looks and refused to answer in my language which he clearly spoke too.

Crowds and most of the time if you only have an hour you need it to be fast. On top of that if its supose to be healthy well... Good luck there. Gigi does ok. Not bad not great just ok.The decor is nice, brightly lit, displays clear and easy to see your options. The salads are tasty and fresh and you can get a great tasting custom salad ... But it will be pricey. It's great and be careful that they don't pour too much salad dressing (a problem they always have). Greens are good and moderately fast. The grill is slower. Not as great as the salad bar. Although the soups tend to be VERY good. They do a great kale soup there. Also tomato and lobster bisque is good. Breakfest is stronger at the grill then lunch. The sandwiches are fine as well. But the price is on the higher end.I recommend not eating there. The chars are uncomfortable and it's crowded and can get noisey. Get it to go :)",,,

Good communication if something was OOS, quick, accurate deliveries. However, the past 3 months, things have really taken a turn for the worse. Do they have new management or something? Orders are no longer accurate. I've been sent the wrong fruit, drinks and entrees. My salad orders are always missing something. Food has arrived burnt, inedible. It has even arrived sideways, with juices leaking out all over. The Sunday crew is especially terrible. As someone else mentioned, they decide to close early at times, and never deliver your food. My boyfriend and I were loyal customers and have spent A LOT of money at this place in the past year. But, things are getting pretty sloppy over at Gigi these days, and management seems unapologetic, so we're moving our business elsewhere. Rather than leave on a sour note, I would like to remember the good things about Gigi: Their unlimited toppings salad is the best deal in town! Ingredients are fresh, vegetables are crisp.

82,Andrew R.,"Astoria, NY",21,34,0,1.0,7/20/2012,"It was inevitable that it would come down to this!  It was as much about me as it was about them.  You see, I've always stuck with an obvious loser until the bitter end, and, I'm sure if you ask any psychiatrist worth his salt, he'll tell you all about people like me: I NEEDED TO EXPERIENCE the full brunt force of, and, TASTE THE EXTREME BITTERNESS of, bad self-destructive decision-making because: I NEEDED TO PUNISH MYSELF (re: that psychiatrist again).  But, it wasn't as if the warning signs weren't there...and, it didn't have to be this way...and, no, I'm not a better person for it.The pre-made salads were piled up in unfastened containers that were easily opened, and the chicken-cubes were so heavily processed that you couldn't be sure they were chicken.  The sliced and diced vegetables, such as various-colored peppers and cherry tomatoes, were crisp enough, and the lettuce fresh enough, but there was also present the unmistakable presence of palm-sweat, covered with a sort of warm, moist dirt-salt sheen.  It was as if the vegetables had traveled from the farm to the trucker to the unpacker to the slicer and packager...unwashed from beginning to end.But it was the hot food I purchased yesterday that really got me to the vaunted masochistic levels I mention above, triggering this review.  I saw brussells sprouts, and expected crispy and garlicky.  I saw salisbury steak, and expected firm and hot, and I saw broccoli, and expected crispy and fresh.  The new guy (replacing the young American guy, who'd previously done a good job of serving half-chicken and two vegetables) looked the same as the other two, except for extreme differences in height, which gave off an almost humorous 3 Stooges-like appearance as they stared at me intently.  But the humor disappeared when the new guy, charged with the ""honors,"" removed the plate of food from the oven; and, after having sat down at my table, all tasted cold and soggy.  I brought it back to them, and the new guy actually commented that I looked mad (as in ""angry"") to the other two, as he put all of it back into the oven; and it was handed back to me by this new guy, as he was saying something about its, NOW, being visibly steamy; and, that he knows better, NOW, to serve it with the steam showing.  Then, my mind fogged up, thoughts of my masochistic life passing in front of me, jarring me emotionally.  I made it back to my table a second time and the food was only partailly hot, and still soggy, but this time I needed to spit out a couple of bites due to a suspicious ""crunchiness,"" which I took as either ""bug"" or ""dirt"" additives.  On my way out, the new guy said something to the other two, to the effect, ""HE's the fool.""  MY total experience at Gigi was like: all the ""women-scorned"" in my life, having taken over this jerk's body, were now getting back at me again and again and again and again...",4,6,2

Updated review","I used to love GiGi's, and I decided that it was better than Cafe 71. But lately, I have been wrong. The past two experiences I have had at GiGi's were quite unsettling. First, it says ""unlimited"" for the vegetables on the salad bar. It doesn't say as many vegetables as you want. Unlimited could mean I could have all the carrots I want in my salad, right? Usually, the staff goes along with that notion, but I assume it tends to be because of the language barrier. The one time I had an American make my salad, he argued with me over that, and said it meant you can have as many of the vegetables as you want, but only one serving. I gave GiGi's one more chance after that....Yesterday I went, and stood in the line for the salad bar. A woman walked in front of me and got served first. I'm not an angry person, I generally shrug my shoulders, but that made me angry. What was I doing there if I wasn't about to order a salad? Then she proceeded to berate me like a child for mentioning that I'd been there first. If THAT wasn't enough, I had to repeat what I wanted in my salad at least three times because of the language barrier. I am usually very patient and I don't mind, but i was already in a bad mood. But the climax of this awful experience was that when I asked for dressing, I asked for ""two containers."" The server proceeded to dump a large spoonful on top. Doesn't two containers translate to on the side???? I told him that I wanted it on the side, and he argued with me that i didn't say that. Then, he poured out the part of the salad that was covered in dressing, and just added more lettuce. Then I tried to say that there were all sorts of other vegetables he threw out, but he wanted to fight again.Begrudgedly, I left and paid, but the past two experiences have really made me less of a fan. I don't know if I will go to GiGi's anywhere near as often because of what happened, but I now will tell you - The staff at Cafe 71 is SOOOOOOOO much nicer and sweet. Even if I pay more, I'd rather be treated kindly.",,,
102,Jennifer M.,"Washington, DC",16,30,4,5.0,2/17/2014,It's my neighborhood go to cafe! I've never been disappointed in any dish that they have prepared for me. All their dishes are full of flavor. Their baked chicken with brown rice and steamed vegetables is one of my favorites. The salad bar has a great variety of proteins and vegetables. I tend to come in here at least once a week or I order from them on seamless.com.,,,
103,Annie G.,"Archbald, PA",0,13,4,4.0,11/2/2013,One of the only places around that remembers me and how I take my coffee. The sandwiches are great and so is the salad bar and coffee. The only reason I'd give it 4 stars is that it can be a bit pricey. $12 for a salad and a soda. But what can you expect from a cafe in this area?,,1,

105,Allen K.,"Manhattan, NY",43,115,278,4.0,11/3/2013,I randomly stumbled upon this place after there was nowhere to sit at starbucks. Free wifi and lots of seating. It's a good place to work or read if you don't need power outlets. Recommend the cheesecake.,,,
106,Kaela T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,6,5.0,9/16/2014,I seriously go here just about everyday. Amazing variety. I think I've tried just about everything at some point and the absolute only thing I wouldn't recommend is the pink lemonade...waaay too sweet. But everything else is so yummy. I get the chicken Caesar bow tie pasta and chicken quesadillas the most often and they're always delicious. The counter ladies are also always smiling and super friendly!,,,

108,Edgar S.,"Bronx, NY",102,556,145,4.0,6/13/2011,I love this place. It's the type of place that gives you a hard time deciding on what the hell to eat. Everything on display looks so damn good. The place gives you lots to options to choose from.....salads to pizza to paninis to deserts. It's really clean. You can literally eat off the floor. note. I wouldn't recommend eating off the floor. Thanks.,,1,

110,Ruby B.,"Margate, United Kingdom",0,4,0,5.0,6/3/2012,"Nothing special, but also nothing wrong. Easy and cheap; it was our stop for when we didn't feel like eating out in the evenings. A reasonable amount of choice and good portion sizes for the price. About $19 for two people + drinks. Would recommend if anyone's looking for something simple. No faults in my opinion, although our hotel was a block or two away and we never ate inside the place so can't comment on that.",,,
111,Sophia S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,155,61,5.0,4/3/2013,"This is my favorite of the delis at this high traffic intersection of Broadway and Amsterdam. They have the full salad bar, 4 soup options, and a huge assortment of sandwiches like the rest of the delis. But this place has hot meal options. They have multiple protein options and then many different sides. They have many pizza options too. They also have a huge seating area in the back, much larger than the other delis here.",,,

114,Jessie L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",65,119,39,4.0,9/10/2012,"Friday night, looking for a quick bite to eat before watching a movie. Went into Gigi Cafe and there was so much to choose from!  Gigi Cafe has anything from salads to burgers to pasta to sandwiches and much much more!  I was in the mood for a burger so they cooked a big sirloin burger to order and put it on a multigrain bun with two slices of cheddar cheese and it was delicious! It came with lettuce, tomato and onion and a side of potato wedge style fries. YUMMM.  The burger was so big that I only ate half and then ate the other half after the movie and it was still delish!One downside to the place is that the cashier seems to have a bad attitude (she admitted it herself) and she got into an argument with one of the cooks and started acting kind of ignorant.  She was yelling loudly at her coworker while he tried to tell her to calm down and everyone in the cafe kind felt awkward.  She needs to learn how to keep it professional in front of customers even if her coworker did piss her off.",1,,

117,Nico L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,3.0,5/15/2014,"Pretty typical ""cafe"" spot.  I normally get a salad- i like how its a set price for the whole thing with options as to how much you can add on, however more than once I have asked for one dressing and the guy has picked up something not even close in name . They also have this chicken as a dinner to bring home- lne piece always seems to be super moist and the other super dry- its also really salty so if you know your body cant handle salt beware.",1,,
118,Jill B.,"New York, NY",79,45,9,5.0,11/30/2010,"I haw been going to this location for about two years now...it is the best salad bar place in the area by far!!!Very reasonably priced, fast service and above all the kind service and the great food.They offer a punch card ( I have had my share of free salads)Yesterday I went to the 34 street location because I was around the block and it was a big disappointment!Now I know that it is the team at the broadway branch that make Gigi cafe the great place it is.I will go back!,",,,
119,Chris P.,"Flushing, NY",28,118,15,3.0,7/29/2012,"Food is ok but unless it's a burger then it's already made and reheated. If you come in daily for lunch maybe consider bringing a sandwich.

122,Louise M.,"New York, NY",1,2,2,1.0,9/17/2012,"I was very disappointed with this location. The portion size for a large size was not big compared with the 34th street location. I ordered online and luckily I checked my salad before I left the cafe ... no avocado, one of the major ingredients I had requested. I explained the problem only to be told ..'we have no avocado today' I said I either wanted avocado or my money back as I wouldn't have ordered online had I known there was no avocado and this should have been brought to my attention before I paid! The manager then took the salad and added the tiniest amount of avocado (where this avocado magically appeared out of is anyone's guess considering they had told me they had none). I definitely will not be back ... I will stick to the 34th street location from now on!",,,

Fairway had no bagels, so went into this Gigi place to see if they had bagels. They did. So I asked to buy some, but was told that they would sell them only as sandwiches. Before waiting for a reply, the loudmouthed guy was already asking the couple behind me what they wanted. They ordered a plain bagel, toasted. And that was fine. By then of course the guy had already given away his last plain bagel. On a bad day it was no way to treat someone in the neighborhood, or indeed anyone by tricking them like that. I would stay away from this joint. They have no place on the Upper East Side, and if the boss was around he should fire this loudmouth.",,,
126,Emily A.,"South Portland, ME",46,232,7,2.0,9/20/2009,"I used to eat here frequently between classes, until my best friend and I both got food poisoning from eating the same dish (some sort of steak dish in this creamy broth, served over mashed potatoes).It was such an unpleasant experience I haven't been able to bring myself back there.

142,Liz L.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,36,0,4.0,4/17/2008,"So, places like these, the Deli/Cafe that sell everything and almost anything for a somewhat steep price, can be found simply by throwing a stick in the Upper West Side. Yet, I must admit that Gigi has impressed me over the others and has now become a first option for lunch over the corner bodega or the bland Kosher anything that is also a stones throw away in the UWS. I usually stick with the salad bar. The stuff is always fresh and full and I love the dressings. If you can keep your salad to lettuce and around 5 or less items you can get a delicious salad for $6 and it comes with a free bag of chips or a roll. This place also has seating in the front and back areas and is clean and the staff is always friendly. I especially like the girls at the register who say ""Is that all honey, ok, $12.50, ok, have a good day hun."" You just gotta love it.",1,,2

I would say the fact that they nuke the food loses about 1/4 of a star, but I have not noticed any difference in freshness. Everything heats up evenly. I have not had any of their desserts, but they look outstanding. The line moves great, which I love, as I have little patience. It also seems to attract less bum traffic than other ""cafe's"" in the area.Here is what I remember orderingGrilled Talapia Beef BourguignonFlank SteakMashed PotatoesBrown RiceMacaroni Everything was great but the steak.
