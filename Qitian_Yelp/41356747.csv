Updated review","Visited again today for lunch. Dillon was our server. That was the first time a waiter here introduced themselves. Nice. He was very friendly and helpful in selecting what to have to eat. He said the blackened chicken was ""life changing"". I wasn't ready for that, so I ordered a deconstructed Sante Fe grilled chicken wrap (no wrap) with the salsa and sour cream on the side. It was delivered to the table by the chef (who was sporting an inpressive wild boar tooth on a chain). This ""salad"" was one of the best tasting dishes that I have had in a long time. Chicken grilled perfectly, sauteed onions, peppers and crunchy corn over perfectly wilted greens.  I will certainly be back for this dish real soon! My colleague had a buffalo chicken sandwich and he was also impressed - perfecly cooked chicken and sauce proportions nestled in a roll that was so fresh that he commented on it several times. This might become the go-to lunch spot for the rest of the summer!",,,
1,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",342,242,298,5.0,5/21/2018,Awesome divey-ish bar. Came here late on a Saturday (~3AM). The place still had a decent crowd of all different kinds of people. Just gonna hit the highlights: - Friendly staff- Beer pong on the back- Playing FRIENDS on some of the TV's- $12 pitchers of bud light- Beer Pong area is clean- $8 tots / $10 mozz sticks delicious. Mozz sticks were kind of expensive at that price point though. Gotta come back again and check out what the happy hour is about.,,,
2,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",408,238,30,4.0,2/28/2018,"Finding a good sports bar is a high-priority item for any good football fan, and as soon as my friends moved into this part of Hell's Kitchen they found the one: Lincoln Park Grill.With TV screens everywhere you look, this is the place to be to watch your fantasy football dreams come true or burn down in flames. Believe me, I speak from experience.As for the food, the nachos supreme is decent as is the pizza. As for beer, it's a pretty standard selection both on draft and bottled, but that's okay. You're here for the football, not the beer selection. With some solid service no matter how your team is doing, Lincoln Park is a solid choice just like the band.",,,
3,Kelly D.,"New York, NY",241,294,741,5.0,12/13/2017,"I love me a good dive bar and this place is no exception! I was in the area a couple of weeks ago and stumbled upon this place...great surprise! It was lunchtime, and we both decided to go with the $10 burger & beer special. SO GOOD! Unfortunately we were in a bit of a time crunch, and didn't get to stay for long, but I definitely plan to come back. Very roomy place with a large bar. Our bartender was really friendly and hilarious. Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you're in the hood...unless you're one of those types that only drinks grey goose out of a crystal glass with evian ice cubes.",2,,3
4,Abigail N.,"Bronx, NY",40,59,50,4.0,6/10/2018,Loved the apps that I got with some friends who happened to mention this bar to me. Drink menu was lacking in my opinion and the nachos weren't all that memorable but I was definitely feeling the ambience. Not to mention the staff was great.,,,
5,David B.,"Milton, FL",7,16,0,3.0,9/22/2018,I totally understand I went to a bar/restaurant but I will say my food was good and I'm sure my wife's food was good it just had a distinct taste. The hostesses /waitress was very nice but I could see more focus was towards the bar side the gentleman that brought our food was very nice And helpful if I owned this establishment I would put the woman on the bar side to pull in patrons for the bar and let the gentleman run the restaurant side,,,
6,Raunaq P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",98,29,90,2.0,3/9/2017,"Pretty loud and seemed like a college bar. Maybe Thursdays are more for that. Food was okay. Plenty of bar tenders, that's great speaking you are well attended. Kinda dark in here but TV with various sports make it lit",,,

9,Jaclyn W.,"New York, NY",64,56,92,5.0,9/15/2017,"Hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen / midtown west. This place has great bar food (wings, nachos, waffle fries) and it's a great spot to watch football (they have the package and, if you get there around when the games start, they will tune a tv to the game you want). It's never very crowded so we can always get a table. Great bar!!",,,
10,Ashley T.,"Maybrook, NY",350,6,0,2.0,7/12/2018,"I usually don't like writing reviews because everyone has a bad day, but this was bad. I used to waitress so I actually felt bad for the waitress because it was her boss's fault they didn't staff correctly. There was a World Cup game so clearly it was bound to be busy yet She was the ONLY WAITRESS On, poor girl. We walked in and it took time to get a table as no one helped us staff wise. Finally a bus boy found us a spot and we had to ask for menus after waiting. The waitress finally got to us and we ordered right away because I knew I had to leave at a certain time. It no joke took 35 minutes to get two chicken sandwiches. We never got a refill on our drinks because poor girl was running around like crazy to keep up. After finally getting our food, I had to leave. I asked for a box and ate half my sandwich super quick because I was starving. When I looked down, I realized I didn't even get what I ordered, they forgot the cheese. Solid. Since I had already waited 35 minutes I couldn't send it back. I asked for the check, paid, and left with my food in a to go box which I had to eat cold later. During this time, no one checked on us. I did however find it funny, our check after we paid was picked up off the table rather quickly ( I hadn't even tipped or signed yet). You couldn't give good service because you were understaffed, but yet could grab the check and tip quickly. Food was good hence the 2 stars. Service, not so much. Don't see myself ever going back which is a shame because I used to go back in the day. Now I know not to!",,,

Sweet Thai Chili Wings & French Fries.My food was pretty good! I was pleasantly surprised by the addition of seasoning on my French fries which they don't usually have. I did take a way one star because the waitress wasn't attentive at all. It took extremely long for cups of water. It even took long for us to order and once we got our food it was a while before she came to check in on us.,1,,
13,Rinda P.,"Tulsa, OK",91,23,2,2.0,9/9/2017,"Decent spot. Nice, dark, comfy atmosphere yet took forever before my guest and I were even acknowledged. The food was okay, but nothing special. I ordered the nacho supreme off the appetizer menu and although huge in size, taste matters. My guest had the bacon chicken sandwich. Neither of us were pleased.",1,,

16,Coco L.,"Manhattan, NY",14,44,3,1.0,10/1/2017,"Just ordered nachos and a burger.  Both were very disappointing.  Nachos were soggy and tasteless with barely any salsa or guac.  Guac did NOT taste fresh.  Burger included warm, wilted lettuce and tomato slice that was 4 inches thick and included stem.  Also soggy and arrived haphazardly wrapped in tin foil.  No condiments provided.",,,

20,Daniel T.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,6,0,5.0,4/14/2018,"This is literally my favorite bar (and sports bar) to go to in all the city. The beers and pitchers of beer are very cheap. They have plenty of televisions up so anyone can find something they want to watch. And most of all the food, the food is absolutely awesome. Definitely my favorite bar to go to, to get food. Not only incredibly low priced but also absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the BBQ Pulled Pork, which is absolutely amazing (with waffle fries as a side) but then again you really can't go wrong with anything. A definite gem in Hell's Kitchen !",,,
21,Brighton R.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,5.0,2/23/2018,Great food and cheap drinks. Service can sometimes be aloof but the guys busing and running the food make up for it. I LOVE the veggie burger.

23,Daniel S.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",476,325,1387,4.0,8/12/2014,"We were searching for a casual sit down restaurant in the area, passed by Lincoln Park Grill, browsed the extensive menu displayed on the window of burgers and American food, and decided to give it a try.  It's not easy to find a cozy cash-friendly spacious bar in Hell's Kitchen.We were promply seated in a comfortable booth in the back of the restaurant, too far for the waitress to see. We thought orders were taken at the bar.  Soon after the hand dance we are serviced. +1 French DipThe french dip order contained meet mashed together inside a short french bun, toasty waffle fries, and a bombtastic liquid dip.  I used the dip for the waffle fries moreso the sandwich itself.  The waffle fries were the best I have tried in NY.  If I am searching for an afterhour meal in the area I will definitely come here again.",1,,
24,Simon H.,"Cambridge, MA",463,3,2,1.0,7/23/2016,"We walked in with 12 people and the waitress was rude to us for no reason. We sat down and she immediately gave us an attitude as she asked for our orders. She yelled at us across the table and gave us an unpleasant look for no reason. She was very impatient; we literally sat down 5 minutes ago. When I said I wanted to just drink water she rolled her eyes. Will never come here again and I do not recommend this place to anyone. All of us are respectful and we come from Boston, New Jersey and New York so we were surprised by the terrible service of this waitress. This gives New Yorkers a bad reputation. I actually had to use my Yelp account to write a review, that's how bad it was.Also, I've been in the food industry for 10+ years. I have never seen anyone be so disrespectful in this service industry. Bad day, stress, etc does not excuse this behavior. Edit: I spoke with Joe, the manager, about the poor treatment and he apologized profusely. He looked genuine in his response. Joe even offered to serve our table personally with free drinks. After our remaining friends paid for their drinks (we left the bar) the waitress backtracked and was friendly to them and wrote a heart on their check; of course she did, she knew what was going on after most of the table left. In the end we ended up going elsewhere because we felt uncomfortable after our experiences with her. We appreciate Joe, but that left a bad taste in my mouth.",3,,

Updated review","Update 2: since the management of this establishment decided NOT TO LOOK AT THE DATES and get super defensive, I figured I'd update this post again. I wrote the initial post PRIOR to talking to the establishment. After I talked to the establishment I was told ""everything is closed out on our end, call.thr bank."" While in the end, the pricing got fixed to the $20.24, that price was MORE than we should have paid. Again, we paid $100 cash, asked for $25 on one card, and the remaining split on two other cards. We were still OVERCHARGED we were shut not OVERCHARGED as much as we were initially. Management says that everything was corrected but that is a lie: we shouldn't have been charged $165! Our bill was for $141. Your incompetent waitress couldn't run the totals appropriately. It's fair (and not slander) to inform other potential customers to either pay cash or be wary of the credit card issues. So to summarize: mediocre food, mediocre and inattentive service, rude management (see reply below), and being overcharged. 1-star is an overstatement ORIGINAL POST:My friends and I just left this place about an hour ago. The food is pretty mediocre, but nothing terrible. The beer selection is decent. What really upsets me is the service. We had a group of 8, and our total was $140 (which included $21 gratuity). Five people gave $20 each in cash. The remaining three of us paid with cards. Now, one person asked be charged $25 because she had the most expensive meal. We get the receipts back and one is for $25 (okay, we asked for that), but then TWO of the cards were for $20 and change. So the total we paid was $165. When I asked the waitress about this she said it was the way the machine did the math. Then she said ""well, when I go to close out the total tonight it shouldn't charge you and it will balance out."" So, the service was petty par for the course. We came at around 2:00, so it wasn't particularly busy. She sat eating a meal and we had to call her over when we needed her (as opposed to her checking on the table). She made $46 for pretty mediocre service. It isn't that hard to run cards for the remainder of a bill. I would never go back to a place that essentially steals money from customers. Beware of this place and their shady waitress. Update: my bank is showing that I was charged $40.48! Twice the amount. I'll be contacting the bar. This is absurd.",4,1,

31,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25525,5.0,6/28/2013,"REVIEW #300 YAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!! YELP MILESTONES YA'LL!!!! :D :D :D*ahem*Oh Lincoln Park, how I love thee!!Conversations I've had in this bar include philosophy, existentialism, politics, celebrity gossip, Yankees, music, how most people suck and how French fries are amazing and class...as in going to class...this was my college bar folks! Nothing made me happier than heading here to meet up with fellow friends, classmates - even the 3 times I did Paint Ball excursions with clubs/student government that I was heavily involved in. I came here each time injured, weak, dehydrated and feeling defeated because my Paint Ball aim sucks and after an 8 hour trip all I want is an ice cold brew.That's where my favorite bartender, Jed, would step in like my savior with his dashing good looks and (European depiction) Jesus like hair/beard (not kidding here!) and ask me what he wanted - back then he just knew. Now, he probably doesn't remember and now I drink Vodka a lot more...One of my favorite things to ever happen to me here was having a super intellectual conversation with my amazing Sociology professor around 9:30pm on a night I had skipped out on attending my 6pm-9pm weekly class with him. He insisted that if I let him bring me up to speed with his lesson plan over a pitcher of Blue Moon that he wouldn't count my absence. I learned a lot that night about empathy, global wage discrepancies, anthropology theories and decided right there that Sociology would be my second major...Lincoln Park is where memories like this are stored for me {3.Lincoln Park was a lot smaller back then - circa early to mid 2000s - there were rumors that they might be closing because the rent was becoming too much (THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH!!! Lol...had to :D) and instead they overcame, took over the locally owned Auto Insurance shop that used to be next door, renovated the hell out of it - but without removing anything that took away it's natural charm, and came back bigger, better and stronger!Now for actual bar stuff - PBR, Bud and Bud Light are $3 all day, err' day. Happy hour starts at 5pm and wee burgers here are a GEM (all the food is quite good here actually). Their blackened chicken penne alfredo is a remarkable gastropub/Italian restaurant worthy dish that's absolutely perfect for 2 hungry people. Seriously. FOUR large chicken breast cutlets, juicy and perfectly seasoned, await you with this dish along with fantastic homemade buttery, creamy, cheesy alfredo sauce and perfectly cooked penne yumminess.The pizza here is pretty good - only $5 on their generous Happy Hour food menu - which unlike some bars, you can take advantage of anywhere in the bar, not JUST at the actual bar counter thing - YAY, plus dependable waiter service?! I know. Sounds too good to be true. Now I work nearby and don't come here enough - but I was here about 2 weeks ago for my annual college reunion and it was just like good ol' times! Awesome.",4,2,4
32,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,5.0,10/10/2013,"It was my buddy's 30th birthday last night. And in true tradition a number of his dearest pals decided to surprise him at his old college bar. Fordham. Yeah. Go Rams. I never went there. But most of my friends have. The bar kind of dips underground from the street. It's pretty big and spacious. Dining tables and booths in the back. I've heard stories about how people once found piss in a bucket or something in the bathrooms way back in the day when pbr was a dollar here. So that doesn't happen anymore. But pbr is still cheap. It's $3 all day/every day and not just during happy hour. And if I must, I must, but bud and bud lite are included in that deal as well as along with $10 pitchers of all of the above. Happy Hour specials are $4 wells/wines 5pm-7pm. Their whiskey isn't that bad. Vodka not great. Gin - Acceptable.If I haven't sold you yet on how amazing their midtown deal is then their happy hour food is ridiculously cheap as well. It's bar food but shockingly decent tasting bar food. Wings, Nachos and cheese pizza are all only $6. They also come in a pretty huge portion size and are great for a group. The nachos are loaded down with jalapenos, real cheese (not cheese wiz), ground beef/beans, and have sour cream/salsa on the side for those that are picky eaters. The cheese pizza is a very thin crisp crust with a really tantalizingly rich layer of cheese. Wings I only took a bite out of one that was garlic buffalo sauce. It's not spicy at all but the garlic adds an interesting element. Oh! And they also sell 'wee burgers' (their name for sliders) and they are excitingly only $1 a burger with a side of fries. And if you're already drunk, it shouldn't matter what any of this tastes like. I also hear that they do a $20 unlimited mimosa, screwdriver, and bloody marry brunch that none of us had any idea about until now. I will most definitely be back for that. Vanilla Bean French Toast with strawberry compote?! Smoked salmon scramble with a side of potatoes? Where in the hell am I? This is amazing. Super fantastic delicious.",1,,1
33,Rich R.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,18,0,5.0,11/27/2017,"I won't lie, but this review will be biased. Take it how you will but you've been warned.  I am a regular at this bar and by regular, I mean I practically live here when I'm not in class at John Jay College down the street.  This place is a hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen although it can get crowded very quickly depending on the day and what sporting event is on that day. Very laid back vibe and a great place to just relax.  Katy makes sure that the beer is always cold on tap, Tony makes sure the food is great and always hot. I recommend my favorites: Malibu chicken sandwich, French Dip and the Santa Fe wrap (add guac to it).  Also, did I mention, they have an option for tots!  As far as the wait staff, the girls here are just awesome.  You can't go wrong with Ellen, Jazzy, Sandra or Jaime in the back (don't know the others that well to comment on).  They always make sure the customer is happy and show nothing but the utmost professionalism.  I also want to respond to the people that said they had their bill automatically added a gratuity. Secondly, there is a law nationwide where you can send the check back and they can take the gratuity off and you can add what you want (if you were truly as informed as you thought).  It says on the menu, that if your party has 6 or more guests, it will be automatically added and I have been here when the Groupon people would leave zero tip because they thought it was part of it when it clearly says it isn't.  The only ""con"" I have ever found here, is the fact that Jud (the owner) no longer sells the t-shirts so that I could buy one (if you even consider that a negative?).  All in all, I highly recommend this place for anyone to come, have a drink and some food.  I know someone commented that this was a college bar, and I can honestly say it isn't.  This is pretty shenanigan free.  Hell, if you see me sitting in my normal booth in the back and tell me, I'll buy you a drink.",,,

The games are always on the TV, music is never too loud to hold a conversation, very accommodating of groups, and the customer service is the best! You have the option of hosting an event roped off, stay at the bar or sit in a booth or tables with friends. Either way, you seat yourself-first come,first served. AMAZING WAITERS:Ashley-she's adorable,short, and full of personality. Caroline is also a sweety pie-taller and very attentive.FOODThe multiple times that I have visted this establishment I've had the chicken fingers,sweet thai chili/BBQ wings, waffle fries, mozzarella sticks,turkey meatball sub, Fajitas (big enough for 2 meals & they give you condiments and extra tortillas to go home with). I've never been disappointed with the food-wings are crispy/saucy, meatballs were well seasoned, Fajitas was awesome but you need your own table to put it together lol. The Angry Orchard pitcher is a good price and you get 4 glasses out of it each for 2 ppl, Fireball shots are $8.KEY THINGS TO KNOWBathroom has 3 stalls, Happy hour is until 7pm, they ID in the late evening, they're located between 56th &57th but closer to 56th,they accept multiple forms of payments for a check, and they're an awesome go-to spot after work or on your way out.",1,,

42,Kristen P.,"New York, NY",2,16,10,4.0,8/1/2016,"This has been one of my favorite establishments for probably 5 years. It's a little dark, loud and exactly what a bar should be. I pop in for afternoon lunches and after work food and drinks and am always happy with the the service. There are about 6 or so flat screens for your sports viewing pleasure. Topped off with wings and pizza during happy hour and I'm sold.Prices are on point. I never leave feeling like I broke the bank for a drink. They have happy hour well drinks for around $4 but I always go for the top shelf stuff. My recommendation is to try the crock of chili for only 7 bucks.Every waiter or waitress I've had has been wonderful. I've never had a complaint. So, depending on the time of day you go and time of year, you get a different atmosphere each time. For rowdy loud experiences weekends are the best. For more laid back times after work on weekdays are what you should shoot for especially if on a date. Then you can actually hear the other person lol. Try it out!",,,
43,Klarissa L.,"New York, NY",64,165,952,4.0,11/11/2014,"Came here after the New York marathon to watch some football and celebrate our friend finishing.  Tables are first come first serve, you seat yourself.  So if you plan to come here after a big event or for Sunday games, it's good to send a few scouts to get a table.  There are a handful of booths, which are nice for groups.With Sunday afternoon football AND the marathon ending, this place was a mad house.  A full house with lots of people standing waiting for tables.  Even with the crowds, large food orders, etc. I was amazed with the service and servers.  Staff was VERY nice, patient, not rude/rushed at all when taking orders, even though it was clear they were swamped.  I was incredibly impressed.  Our waitress even apologized for taking so long to bring us the check at the end [it wasn't even THAT long considering she was running around so much].Pitchers of beer are decently priced and they have a pretty good selection to choose from.The Food overall was very good - good size portions.  We got the nachos with pulled pork.  Would have liked a little more meat, but there was a lot of other stuff, so can't really complain.  Our friends got wings and burgers.  Burgers were large, made people's hands looks small! And they come with fries which is always nice.TIP - this place does get noisy, if you need to take a phone call and don't want to stand outside in the cold, the bathroom is surprisingly quite!This is a cool spot, there was a definite smell when we first walked in, but it's a bar, you get used to it!  Love all the TV screens, great for watching games.  Good food, good prices.  Would definitely come back here AND recommend to others!",1,,

Updated review","We returned again a few times, most notably for a low-key midweek birthday (we saved our serious partying for the weekend!), and a post-volleyball food/drink recap.For the birthday dinner, although we ordered plenty of apps and entrees for our group, we brought in some outside cupcakes, which our server was fine with.  Even more, since we forgot to bring our own, the waitress was happy to dig up a candle and some matches for the birthday girl's dessert!For the volleyball dinner, we all ordered sandwiches.  I enjoyed my beef burrito, and swapped the side of fries for some healthy corn (pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/linc…).  My friend's shrimp po'boy (yelp.com/biz_photos/linc…) was loaded with fried shrimp and served with a tasty cajun sauce and some toppings on another plate.  My other two friends found their chicken fajita wraps to be ""OK"" saying that they were somewhat bland.Overall, in my book, Lincoln Park remains a solid go-to spot for both food and drink when I'm in the area, and the fact that they always offer a restaurant.com discount ($10 for $25 worth of stuff, even cheaper with a promo code) makes this bar and their prices even more attractive.",,,2
45,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1846,3.0,6/12/2014,"3.5 stars...Decent sports bar off the beaten path. It's just far enough away from everything that it doesn't get particular crowded no matter when you go. The place is quite large with two large rooms so no worries about coming here with a big group. They have a full menu, waitress service in the side room, and darts. Beer prices were surprisingly low (I believe Bud Lights were $3-4 normally). Waitress service was very inattentive but she bought us a round which made up for it in my opinion. The place had plenty of TVs with all the right games on and was clean. Solid bar all around.",3,,

We were a little worried walking up, with the crooked, distressed sign. Upon walking in, we were pleasantly surprised. The place was that homey ""where everybody knows your name"" kind of bar. The only thing I did not like was the USC Gamecock paraphernalia... Go Clemson! I didn't get a chance to try any food, but the drinks were sooooo CHEAP! Pretty much any beer (tap or cans/bottles) was $3!!! Whoa! The bartender was incredibly nice and courteous. it was like he knew you wanted another drink before you even wanted it.

The vibe here on game nights is electric and friendly. You'll see people wearing their favorite jerseys and cheering on their teams. They have various games playing on their many tv screens, so it's likely you'll be able to watch your team if they are playing. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes a sports bar/pub atmosphere with better food than most. It's conveniently located a short walk from Columbus square, and so is very accessible via train.

Who am I kidding? Classes aren't strenuous yet, it's only the second week. But, still, it seems to be a gathering place of sorts.This place is pretty dismal and depressing, but the drinks aren't too pricey and they actually have places where you can play flip cup.

Back in the days, when I used to be a student, we used to have meetings and celebrations here after exams.The place has many TV screens and tables, and service is great.For food wise:  if you have group of people -  chicken wings and pizzas, and for two people I'd recommend turkey triple decker or any turkey or buffalo chicken wrap.",1,,

My friend swears by the Ruben sandwich and likes the $3 PBRs.  The pizza I ordered here was burnt but I really see it having potential.  One day I didn't feel like drinking and ordered seltzer.

We ordered a bunch of the wings with buffalo, sweet thai chili, and teriyaki sauce. The sweet thai chili sauce was really good, but the wings small.

I didn't think glass because it didn't cut me but my friends thought glass. Anyway, told/showed the waitress very politely, didn't make a big deal about it because that's not me. They brought me a new one which was fine. My gripe is that if I run a restaurant/bar and that happened to a customer, I would be comping them the meal or sending them over drinks or something. This place did nothing other than bring me a new meal and us a full bill. Bad business IMO.",1,,

Brunch specials were all $12 and included a mimosa, screwdriver, or Bloody Mary. Also the option to pay an additional $20 for unlimited. Probably the cheapest place to get brunch in midtown. I had the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage and it was delicious. My friend had the Eggs Benedict and said it was a touch on the salty side, but great for the price. My screwdriver was made on the strong side, which was a welcome surprise for the cheap price. I highly recommend this place for groups, in addition to tables, they have large booths that easily sit 6 people and one even larger that could probably fit 12.

Well drinks were $3, and although a bit watered down, how can you argue against $3? Nachos were $5 for a HUGE plate. Super delicious and we all gobbled it up. They also offer these TEENY little sliders that were silver dollar sized, and $1 each - the CUTEST things ever. Cheese was $0.25 extra. Deliciously cooked, and came with a heaping pile of either waffle or shoestring fries. YUM! The food came out quickly too, which is always a plus.

I went through the reviews, and decided on garlic hot wings and a french dip with waffle fries. Also a hard cider. Hard cider was great, but that's easy. Waffle fries were good, but that's junk.French dip kinda sucked. The strips of meat were hard and I felt like an idiot because I didn't just get a burger. Then I saw someone's burger and it just didn't look that good....And my wings, though I read lots of great stuff about it -- they kinda sucked as well. I was really surprised. First of all, they were overdone, the meat wasn't too juicy at all. 2nd, the crisp on the outside was minimal. 3rd, the flavoring wasn't much. And 4th (4th!), the wings were too big. I'm serious... they were like calfs - and that's not a good thing. For wings, I believe the small ones are the most desirable. It's a good place to watch a game, though it gets Very loud in there.

Our waitress literally shivered and declined to take our empty plates away after we were done eating, replying ""I'll have the bus boy come over.""  Perhaps I should look into employment here, because the waitresses do not appear to do much. There are tons of tvs, it's loud, not a lot of light, and a lot of non-fordham students who come here in the summer time have excessive body hair. It is a utterly typical sports bar. It's not horrible, it's just not good, and it doesn't stand out from any other sports bar. Pitchers of Bud are $10. Wings are like $6. They do have cider on draft so thats appreciated.

100,John M.,"Boston, MA",157,87,2,3.0,10/20/2013,"Nice walking to a Florida St./South Carolina/Buffalo bar in Manhattan after a day of political networking and hobnobbing. At least that's what I thought after I wrapped my head around the thought that there was actually a such thing as a Florida St./South Carolina/Buffalo bar (I don't picture a crowd of people from Tallahassee in NYC). Anyway, I was here for a private event, where all those over 21 got two free drink tickets for either Bud Light, PBR, or ""well drinks"" (cocktails from well spirits, aka. the cheap stuff). Without checking my ID, I was given a red X on my hand, signifying that I wasn't 21 (I actually am). So after a bit of arguing with the bouncer and the bartender that I was actually 21 (and convicing them my state ID was legitimate), I got served. It was annoying, and had they been checking ID's this wouldn't have been a concern, but I got on with it. The whiskey sour I had was pretty good, not too boozy, and was refreshing. What I enjoyed though were their ""wee burgers"", which are dollar coin sized burgers for $1 each, and comes with waffle fries. Gotta admit, for $3, having $3 one-bite burgers and fries is a great compliment to a beer for a little snack, $5 makes it a decent lunch. It's a good bar, in a nice location, with not-too-expensive drinks, I'd give it a higher rating had it not been an issue over my age, but all in all, not a bad hangout.",,,

I had a buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. My friends had  a cheeseburger, calamari, mini cheeseburgers, among other things. They said the food was excellent as well. For an average of $10 per entree, you really can't go wrong. The portions were enough to fill us.The drinks here were also very cheap. $3 bud lights all day everyday.... can't be beat.

This was my first (and maybe last) visit but I was struck by the shear number of patrons quaffing pitchers of beer from their pint steins. Most of these pitchers weren't being shared. This phenomena is apparently explained by the all day/night happy hour pricing on several house draft beers @ $10 a pitcher. Overall, the venue is big, clean and somewhat sparten. Plenty of flat screens offer visual stimulation troughout the bar and dining areas. I checked out the menu and observed a few patrons noshing on their orders and decided to pass on the bar food offerings.

Yesterday, however, I went with friends and experienced a shock--it's now a lot more expensive. When we got our check we were surprised to find that we'd been charged $12 for our entrees plus $20 for bottomless drinks, or $32 per person. We asked the waitress if she'd made a mistake and she said, no, they changed their brunch 8 or 9 months ago (not true). We spoke with the manager who said that they had indeed changed their brunch 8 or 9 weeks ago but haven't updated their menus yet (their online menu still has the old prices too). She gave us a really hard time before adjusting our bill.

While behemoths like Per Se and Bar Boulud draw epicurean thrill-seekers from near and far, this hidden gem, nestled in an unsuspecting nook on 9th Avenue (now known as SoCo--South of Columbus), provides exceptional service at price points that won't break the bank. As the city's hippest restaurateurs tire of velvet ropes and meaningless opulence, this ""no frills"" Art Nouveau style speakeasy is decidedly on-trend. Newbies will want to make sure they do not enter through the ""decoy door"" guarded by a vintage ATM machine, but rather the main entrance on the south side, which opens onto the bar's grand staircase. Descend the stone steps into a dimly lit subterranean lounge reminiscent of your favorite late-20th Century neighborhood watering hole. Antique dart boards, sports paraphernalia, and other charming bric-a-brac strategically plucked from the city's most esoteric flea markets dot the walls and work to create a truly unique ""post-apocalyptic sports bar"" vibe. Although the decor may draw in stragglers from the street, seasoned patrons frequent LP for its exotic food and creative libations. In true speakeasy form, Lincoln Park's exclusive cocktail list is ""members only"" and only available via your waitress's word of mouth. Feel daring? Try LP's signature cocktail, the ""Park Pour""--a whiskey water whose understated complexity and deep earthy notes will have you howling in disbelief that the water is actually siphoned from the bathroom sink. Insider tip: the tables aren't reserved for bottle service only, which is both refreshing yet frustrating when the bar reaches maximum capacity on Friday and Saturday nights. When your whistle's duly whetted, work on your appetite by grabbing a pal for a rousing game of Big Buck Hunter: Safari.  For a mere half-dollar, this long-awaited sequel to the original whisks you away to an East-African Safari where you whimsically flout local poaching ordinances. Beware; you'll only be able play for a short while before the mouthwatering aromas wafting from the kitchen affect the steadiness of your rifle hand. Once you find yourself particularly peckish, retire to your booth or table to sample some small or large plates from LP's thought-provoking and extensive food menu. Recommended dishes include the ever-so-unctuous stuffed jalapeno poppers; seasoned chefs choose the ripest locally-produced jalapeno peppers from the city's famous rooftop gardens and stuff them with a blend of one or more cheeses before lightly coating them in artisan flour breading and frying them to perfection. With one gooey bite you'll be magically transported to your favorite Oaxacan fonda (Spanish for a small restaurant known for its traditional dishes and home-style cooking), and at an economical $8.00, the bold flavors aren't the only thing that'll have you shouting ""Ay Caramba!"" More finicky palates can skip the Latin heat and opt for the sweeter, but equally decadent, BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Succulent pork generously drenched in LP's signature BBQ sauce tops a brioche bun coated with so much butter that you might have to bring your sandwich gloves from the armoire. While LP's eclectic food offerings are as varied as its clientele, the restaurant remains ever-consistent in its Michelin-star service. Before you pay your tab, be sure to strike up a conversation with waitress Anna, one of the famous ""Lincoln Ladies"" who has been around since 2003. ""Honestly, I wouldn't work anywhere else,"" she said, as she attentively combed the flotsam from a tablespread with a sterling silver crumb catcher. ""Everything about Lincoln Park is amazing--the pay, the ambiance, the hours, the medical benefits, the generous and patient patrons--a day doesn't go by where I don't thank God for the decisions I've made."" -T.S.

157,Holly N.,"Troy, NY",382,574,672,2.0,12/12/2010,"OK, so my 2 stars are given with this side bar, I will return. I liked the space in which this bar is located. There is plenty of room to move around and anyone could have easily found a table or hung out at the bar if they wanted. However, the bar was no where near empty, so you didn't feel like you were the only schmuck watching Sunday afternoon football. So, ""Why 2 stars?"" you ask. Fair enough.I gave this place 2 stars because they have these seemingly phenomenal Sunday specials - $5 wings, nachos, & pizza. I knew nothing good in NYC is sold for a measly $5, but ahead I went with the ""pizza."" It was essentially a large cracker, covered in red sauce with melted cheese on top. It was disgusting and soggy and weird. Did I still eat it? Yes. Was I ashamed? Also, yes. According to my compadres, the nachos were soggy, too... like the chips had been rubbing up against some taco meat, but the taco meat was in short supply when the soggy chips arrived. As for the wings, they looked ok and I was told they were fine, but I don't really do wings so, eh. When I return - and I probably will - I'll go for the standard $8 pulled pork sandwich or a side order of waffle fries, which looked amazing and how can you screw those up? So, to summarize: decent space, but order off of the real menu because the ""specials"" aren't really special when you can barely stomach 'em.  However, there are tons of screens to watch the game, the bar is clean, and the service was acceptable.",1,,

They have tons of Televisions always playing sports, and will play the audio over the bar speakers for football or local playoff games. The bar has alot of dining seating and the cleanliness has always been good. The Steak sandwich, Nachos, or Quesidillas are very good, and their curly fries for $5 is not only a large portion, but very tasty.

My friend and i felt hungry so we abused the appetizer portion of the menu and pigged out. I absolutely loved the jalapeno poppers as well as the calamari but felt that the cheese fries could've been done better. It's nitpicky but the cheese was melted to the plate instead of being a nice blend of liquid and solid. The portion was substantial but once the cheese portions were gone, we were left with just under half a plate of regular non seasoned fries which subsequently went to waste. It's nitpicky like i said earlier but it was disappointing. Other than that, the drinks were good and quite affordable and the atmosphere was perfect for a sports fan like me who likes to grab a drink, catch a game or three and shoot the breeze with other fans.",,,

The drink prices are definitely a bit lower than average for the neighborhood. I've always found their food to be good. It's not a Michelin rated restaurant, but it has solid bar fare - decent prices for edible food in decent portions. I've found the crowd to be pretty mixed - some Fordham students, some older locals, some 20's professionals meeting up after various sporting events. It can get a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so (never had to shout to be heard by friends). Since expanding I've never seen it packed. Busy, yes, but never to the point where it was hard to move around. I've never had a poor experience with any of the bartenders or waitstaff - most of them have been working there for years which I take to be a good sign.I'd describe Lincoln Park as one step up from a dive bar.

The prices are inflated, as expected, for the low quality grub.The pros? Happy hour nachos, personal pizza, and wings are $5 which are a pretty good deal. And those nachos are definitely heaping.

The place wasn't even crowded so I don't know wth was wrong.  Besides the S L O W service, the place is alright.  Their use (or misuse) of space is odd.  Music is random but fun.  Plenty of televisions for sports.  They seem to have great happy hour specials all week and offer cheap domestics all day.  The menu prices were decent.  This seems to be an alright spot if you want a cheap beer but don't care much about the quality of the beer.  I suppose I would return to watch a game here but that's it.  I'd rather pay more for better quality and better service.",,1,

Those little burgers and full plate of waffle fries ran me $3.75 (would have been $3 if I hadn't asked for cheese but I figured if I was springing for an impromptu dinner/beer, then I could spare the extra $0.75!). You know you're doing something right when your one beer costs almost twice that of your meal.Other than that, the rest of the menu looked fairly predictable and...well, boring.

192,Patricia S.,"New York, NY",56,527,281,3.0,10/14/2009,"Good things:- homey atmosphere- cheap drinks- lots of tv's to watch whatever game I wantGreat things:- Waffles fries - why are potatoes in the shape of little waffles so good?? - Nachos- Jason the bartender (such a cute-y)  Lincoln Park (LP) is your local dive bar with plenty of regulars that don't live locally. It's our default place nearly every weekend. LP is under renovation currently, but me and my friends are anxiously anticipating its opening!",,,
193,Kristen D.,"Manhattan, NY",26,46,2,4.0,5/1/2012,"LOTS of TVs and certainly a menu that is affordable and can please anyone. They have a great pitcher special during the week, as well, provided that Bud or Bud Light is cool with you / your group. It's kind of a weird atmosphere and doesn't really have a basic theme, but the space is big and the bar can accommodate a large amount of people. I'd definitely bring large groups here, or come to watch a game.",,,
194,Amanda O.,"New York, NY",10,134,20,2.0,10/25/2013,"Started out so promising! We ordered the Vegetarian Nachos to start, which hit the spot and were super tasty. As an entree, I ordered the Chicken Malibu with waffle fries. The fries were awesome, but the sandwich...not so much. It looked good, but as we all know by now, looks can be very deceiving. The menu vaguely describes the chicken breast as being ""marinated,"" but doesn't specify in what. After taking a bite, I almost spit it out - it was RIDICULOUSLY salty! I couldn't put my finger on it at first, but I'm pretty sure the chicken was SOAKED in hoisin sauce (which is a really odd choice in terms of seasoning an unassuming chicken sandwich) and possibly additional salt. I tried taking a few more bites, but it was just seriously inedible because of how salty it was (I'm no hater of salt by any means, but this was over the top even for me). I was super disappointed. Clearly I ordered the wrong thing, but I think it would be helpful if they were at least up front on the menu about what the chicken is ""marinated"" in. It's sad because I definitely would've given this place 3 solid stars if the entree incident hadn't happened. Once again, thank the good sweet Lord for Scoutmob deals.",,,
195,Daniel K.,"Atlanta, GA",42,89,0,3.0,1/3/2014,"Service was really good--we thought the waitress was very attentive. The food on the otherhand was very bland. I had the blackened chicken alfredo, which left a lot to be desired.  Beer is relatively well priced, so that is a plus. Overall, I probably will just come here to drink and not for meals from now on.",,,
196,DJ P.,"New York, NY",0,45,2,4.0,8/20/2014,"Great neighborhood bar. Deceivingly large. Bartenders are friendly, beer is reasonably priced for the area, lots of TVs and manager is accommodating regarding getting specific games on. Food is always good bar food. Love the veggie wrap. I love sitting in the booths towards the back corner and it's not a bad date spot if you are having a chill night with some beers and nachos (really good). Decent place for Sunday football too.",,,
197,David L.,"Denver, CO",23,12,0,4.0,1/12/2014,"Great little sports bar! It's not a glitzy sports bar with projectors and giant screens and booming sound... but you've got screens all over the place (even if not huge) and the game sounds of the predominant game will be loud enough to hear throughout the bar. The food and drink prices are very reasonable for the area and you aren't pushed to keep ordering or get out the door.I've been 3 times now to watch football and found it to be welcoming for fans of all teams.The food I've had has all been average to above average and always a solid value for the price.  Overall, the burgers are solid but not remarkable; the wings are tasty but a little on the mild side; waffle fries are delicious; breakfast burrito w/ bacon was surprisingly good as were the potatoes that accompanied; and the bar staff says the blackened chicken is where it's at, though I haven't had it yet.4 star review because I am solidly a fan of this place.  I can't say it is a 5-star joint... I have been to better sports bars, restaurants, and pubs... but for your typical outing, it doesn't disappoint.",,,
