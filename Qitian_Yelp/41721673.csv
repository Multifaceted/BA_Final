0,Daniel P.,"Baldwin, NY",8,23,8,5.0,9/9/2018,One of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The chicken was massive I really enjoyed it. The waiter that took care of us was attentive cool dude.My son had the donut burger with fries he loved the burger but it was a little messy the fries were soggy but overall my son loved it.,,,
1,Marlene S.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",1,43,2,3.0,10/21/2018,"Came here in a Saturday night and it was pretty empty. We were seated right away. The table was very sticky. We ordered a grow lee of full moon, and the beer was overflowing the growler plus difficult to pour, our server did not ask to help. We started off with the avocado fries. They were okay, Harlem Public still has the best ones! I had shrimp tacos and truffle fries which were decent. My siblings all had different burgers which they've enjoyed. Over all okay nothing extraordinary here.",,,
2,Joe A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",45,108,0,1.0,10/8/2018,"You are out of a beer, ok, but out of two different beers I want then that sort of ticks me off. I get fed up choosing a third beer so I ask for diet Coke and it's flat. My friend asked for a mojito and gets vodka and lemonade. The food itself is over priced yet low quality. The chicken on the sliders tastes of poor quality.I had tried this place before and got chicken and waffles and it was not bad but on its best day this place is a 3 star experience. The other people I dined with didn't like their food either. Felt there was no reason to complain... What am I going to say you use low quality chicken and made wrong drinks? Not worth the argument.",2,1,
3,Lynn L.,"New York, NY",12,136,154,1.0,10/30/2018,"It smells like bleach and puke mixed together at the bar. The female bartender was rude AF with a nasty attitude. I won't be back, it's ok, only a few more weeks before this place inevitably closes and reinvents. I just hope they get new staff when it changes.",4,,
4,Priscila R.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",40,68,176,3.0,9/3/2018,"Came here with my boyfriend for lunch. I decided to try it out because it's rather new and honestly, it's located on a corner that has seen so many restaurant turnovers. I asked for medium well burger and it was dry. The tater tots were bomb, loved those. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive. I would like to give this place another try and get something different on the menu. There is nothing basic about the options on the menu.",1,1,
5,Kristen T.,"New York, NY",613,129,507,3.0,4/10/2018,"Cute open clean location with fun decor. Interesting menu including super hot suicide wings which require a liability waiver - i did not try - this time. Normally I love to challenge my tastebuds with extreme heat. I was there for a work meeting which this location works well for - lots of space and not too loud or congested. I opted for the Cobb salad which the server highly recommended. Although it was colorful and included fresh grilled corn off the Cobb and avocado, I did not like the chicken. It also seemed homemade but didn't taste right. I suspect it may have been from the dinner server the prior night.",2,,1
6,john m.,"New York, NY",8,50,2,1.0,11/1/2018,"Quality of the food has declined noticeably, and the service has never been good. I think--I'm not sure, but I think--they started to use those pre-ground, pre-formed burger patties. You know, the kind. Add to that a brunch bartender, who made up for her apathy with frequent, prolonged absences. These are problems caused by poor management and ownership. You'll understand why I give it one star. Or you would, but it looks like the place has failed and closed down.",1,,
7,Melissa V.,"New York, NY",693,138,516,4.0,5/2/2018,"If you're looking to die from a heart attack, Crazy Annie's has got your back! There were so many indulgent eats on the menu (doughnut hamburger!?) that it was actually kind of difficult to decide what to eat (we weren't that hungry and just wanted a snack). We ended up ordering two angry orchards, wings, and calamari to share. Wings were good but the calamari breeding was way too salty! The food was a bit pricey as well.I can see myself hanging out here during happy hour with some friends (it's so close to CUMC campus) but I probably wouldn't spend too much time/money here otherwise.",,,
8,Johanna R.,"Manhattan, NY",54,65,38,4.0,10/31/2018,"Im gonna have to give this place four stars I really am. One for service and three for the food. Ill explain I of course had the donut burger lol and the fried pickles and the cajun fries. So you know ill start with the cajun fries , they were spicy as fudge im not a fan of spicy food so im going to have to pass and it had a hint of sweetness to it so the cajun fries are a no for me. They were out of tater tots and the parmesan fries so Ill have to come back, and update my review. Now the burger meet was tasty and well seasoned and on the donut it was freaking amazing now the runny egg was what got me i had to dry it with tissue like i think they should cook the egg more since the donut will get soggy with the egg runny like that. Was it good ? Yes . I was on a first date with my hunny lol so ladies if you want to keep it classy order this to go  by the way he had the 1/2 rack of ribs it was ok the burger was better but he said he gives the ribs a 10. Also, the fried pickle it was okay very very unhealthy lol after i ate four i decided to just eat the pickle out the fried dough. But you should still try. Service was great I believe Brandon was our server I think  thats his name. Great service !",,,
9,Lex T.,"Queens, NY",120,177,284,3.0,4/8/2018,"I remember when this place used to be Heights Tavern and now it's Crazy Annies. Eat a burger & fries here a couple of months ago and most recently tried their brunch. The service was cool, waiters attentive. Typical brunch menu. I think the best dish we tried that day was the Stuffed French Toast. We tried both crepe dishes which we finished, but weren't too impressed. One was a fruity-tuty kinda crepe, the other like a Mexican breakfast crepe. Both were ok at best. I actually emptied out my third southern crepe and just ate the eggs and sausage on its own. The crepe was pretty blah... Ima come back to try out the Honey Bun Burger and the shakes everyone yelps about and maybe for some beers & stuff, but I'll pass on brunch again.",1,1,2
10,Sutarshia J.,"Manhattan, NY",45,6,3,1.0,8/15/2018,"This was probably the biggest disappointment I have faced thus far. I really wanted to like this place after passing it so many times.  I would say everythjng was going good till I was seated. The wait staff was good. Until there was a switch.  I found myself asking for the same item several time.  All i wanted was 1 extra syrup for my chicken and waffle dish. Mind you the waiter recommended it. When he said ""oh yea I forgot "" I should have known then. Did I mention the place was as empty as ever, how could a waiter be that forgetful. The same waiter then returned, but when he did.. he place his entire arm/hand over the over i was eating and placed the requested syrup inside of my plate. This is not unacceptable.  Who trained your staff . Smh. Then my original waiter never even checked in with me and how My meal was. I do not think i would ever try this spot again. Pooooor  customer service on an early afternoon.  I will add the waffles were  actually pretty goood till the mentioned incident took place.",,2,
11,The Anonymous D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,8/3/2018,"Crazy Annie's REFUSED to give me a refund after serving me RAW meat in a hamburger. Not rare, not undercooked. RAW.I ordered this food pretty excited because I had walked past this place so many times and really wanted to try it. I receive my order, and am aesthetically pleased, but once I bite in, thoroughly disappointed. First off, the burgers are HUGE. I know American's have big mouths, but I didn't realize that applied to food as well. If you're going to make burgers, make ones that can actually be bitten into. Next, the fries were soggy and just sad. Finally, because of the huge burger, I started to de-construct it, and that is when I came across the RAW meat. Very disappointing! If it weren't for the RAW meat, it would have received more than one star.Next time, maybe think about giving a refund where it's due.",1,,
12,Nyani T.,"New York, NY",1,55,53,3.0,3/5/2018,"I had late night meal here one night after realizing the wait time at another local restaurant was longer than I was willing to wait (I was HANGRY ). The hostess was extremely nice. The place was pretty empty and we were seated immediately.We sat for about 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink orders. As a HANGRY individual, I was not too happy about this.  However, our waitress Jean was great. She made great recommendations and was knowledgable about the menu.  The presentation of the meals looked promising but the food was just okay.   The waffle was good but the chicken that came with it was over breaded. When you peeled the layer of breading off, there was a thick and light piece of chicken skin that almost looked undercooked. Though I am sure they cooked it thoroughly, it just did not look appetizing at that point. I got the white meat turkey burger with sweet potatoes fries. This was pretty tasty but a little on the dry side (but then again it is the breast of the turkey so I guess this is to be expected). The tomato was bigger than the turkey patty itself. Luckily I like tomatoes.  The fries were kind of skimpy. By skimpy, I mean like when you get to the end of a bag of fries and those little tidbits are left...yes that kind of skimpy. Overall, I would give this place another shot when I want a quick bite or I am not expecting an extravagant and fancy meal (and also because they have funnel cake that I want to try). They play THE best music (at least the night that I went) and each booth has an outlet.   If you're looking for a quick after hours place to grab a bite, listen to some good music, and have decent service, this place is worth trying. Just do not expect a flavorful experience.",2,,
13,Erin H.,"Newark, NJ",461,96,192,2.0,2/19/2018,"Crazy Annie's seemed like the perfect choice. Really close to where we were, trendy, food for brunch. We needed to kill sometime and wanted to go somewhere else but ended up here. I was really disappointed. With the area we were in I expected people who were rooted in the community and cared for how they displayed themselves. We didn't get any water at all after ordering until I finally demanded a pitcher of water for our table. The waiter barely checked in on it at all. The food was disgusting to be honest. In the pictures it LOOKS edible but tasted like plastic. Sooooo disappointing!!! The service was not great at all and either was the food. I'd never go back there again. 2 starts because it LOOKs really cool and there is a lot of space! For a restaurant in the heights I was surprised my how roomy it was.",1,1,1

Beautiful decor. Amazing customer service. Amazing drinks (their rum and cokes are delicious) and Carlos, our host was the best! Looking forward to coming here again soon.",,,
17,Veronica T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,8,4.0,5/24/2018,"What's stopping me from giving Crazy Annie's 5 stars is the service and the unavailability of certain drinks. I came on a Monday and there seemed to only be 1-2 waitresses taking orders, both inside and outside. So it took longer than usual to get anything we ordered. I ordered the Annie's Siesta Sangria and it was SOOOOO GOOOOOOD! But, I was only able to have a glass because they ran out ???!!!! How? Anyway. The food was good too. We had the chicken and waffle sandwich, infamous donut burger and grilled chicken and avocado sandwich.",,,
18,Juan S.,"Jersey City, NJ",106,277,193,1.0,12/22/2017,"We've been sitting here for an hour after the waiter took orders. He came back and said he forgot to put in our orders. He had to ask again since he forgot them. He then handed us a sangria but we ordered the craft.What awful service. Food finally came. Pulled chicken and fries were dry and overcooked. We ate the, paid. Never coming back. Maybe when they change the name again. Till then, don't bother right now.",2,1,
19,Chelsea E.,"Buffalo, NY",1,28,59,2.0,2/18/2018,"The food sounds and looks delicious and it's reasonably priced. I got the Huevos Rancheros ($12) and Southern Crepes ($12)- split the dishes with a friend. We also got the avocado fries for $8 (there were only 6 pieces -pictured 1/2 avocado). The portion sizes of the entrees (not appetizer...) were good but we didn't have silverware for everyone at our table (had to take one from a different table) and we were finished with our appetizer without our drinks (waters), then had to ask for the water (a second time). We also asked for 3 separate checks and our bill wasn't separated. But the most disappointing part was that neither dish was well seasoned or authentic. Fairly bland and tasteless, friend agreed. I would not come back here.",,,

Even with poor uber eats service Crazy Annies staff is helpful and accommodating. Standouts:Wings! Any sauce is bomb! Avocado fries, do yourself a favor this Is Crazy Annie's STAR! Burgers!

Done right:CrispyLemon on the side2 sauces And a little Cajun kick to heat things up...Crunchy! Not greasy What more could a girl ask for? Besides a good Cabernet and a friendly bartenderBONUS: when I asked for a trial sip of the Pinot Noir I was treated right to a gracias and generous BIG sip.See you at the BAR! I'll be back for calamari and wine,,,
24,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,483,1949,3.0,3/29/2017,"Service was pretty good, although it took a while to get seated when we first arrived. No one was at the hostess station so we considered sitting at the bar before being approached.  Our waitress had a few tables on her shift but seemed pretty alert as to what was going on with our food.  They were pretty attentive and asked about 10-15 times as to how everything was.  Definitely cannot complain about service, especially in comparison to the location's predecessor. The drinks were good and they have a wide variety of draft beers, cocktails and bottles (make sure to ask for a glass unless you don't mind swinging back a bottle). If they serve wine, no one ordered it in the whole place so who knows. Food was decent. My company started with the smoked wings (if you want the super spicy smoked wings, you literally have to sign a waiver and prove that you are 21+) with the sauce on the side. Mac and cheese with brisket followed along with the street tacos as main entrees. This is not a place to impress a date or to have a culinary adventure. If you are on a diet or have restrictions, I would scour the menu as they do NOT take substitutions.  However, if you are catching up with friends or want to catch the game then this is the place for you.  They readily accepted a card without a chip so maybe they corrected the problem that another reviewer had. I can't say that this place went beyond my expectations but it certainly did not make a bad first impression.",15,10,13
25,Melody-Ann G.,"Morrisania, Bronx, NY",21,4,3,2.0,5/29/2018,"Love the food / love the drinks The hostess on Friday BY FAR THE MOST RUDE AND UNPLEASANT... please send her to some customer service training ..

26,Brenae L.,"Manhattan, NY",164,140,271,4.0,4/25/2017,"I brought my nephews to check out the milkshakes and I think they've found their new favorite place. The menu has a nice mix of traditional brunch classics, healthy eats and also just great for Instagram foods (donut burger, chicken & waffles, crazy milkshakes, oh my!). They offer live music on Sundays which was a nice and unexpected addition for brunch. The Crazy Eggs (fried deviled eggs), Breakfast on a Bun and mac & cheese were all delicious. Can't wait try it for dinner! Our waiter kept making excuses for things because they were ""new,"" which was frustrating but he encouraged us to leave feedback. They have feedback cards and it seemed like they were really open to suggestions for customers. There was a bit of confusion about their credit card policy and they've been inconsistent with enforcing it but nothing that would stop me from coming back!",1,,1
27,Carlos O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",93,350,749,5.0,4/15/2017,"My go to spot at the moment for some nice burgers and great beer selection. One of my friends told me about this place and I was pretty shaky about trying it since I already have my local go to spot.I gave it a try and I was really surprised on how well this place is managed. I never sat by the tables I always go after work and sit by the bar. I do enjoy the different selections of flat screen televisions they have. They all have a different sport on which is a thumbs up if your a sports fan you won't miss a thing. Who ever design this place did an amazing job. I also like the old fashion letters on the front makes it a unique place. One thing I haven't really been good at is remembering peoples name and for it only been the 3rd time me being their I know all the bartenders. The first one I met was Brady he's pretty cool fast paste and gets the job done fast. Then I met Carlos another great member of the bartending team he's Latino.I also met Katie that was nice enough to let me charge my phone.Also Bryant really cool guy makes every one feel good at the bar. I'm very happy for this place with a great team like this behind the bar who wouldn't want to stop by for a drink. As far as the beer selections I'm pretty impressed I have tasted most of them. the appetizers are one of my favorites when I'm drinking beers. I have enjoy the burgers and fries very tasty and finger licking, and I'm looking forward to try everything else on the menu. The music selection is great it varies with soft rock and alternative music is pretty cool, sometimes they will put hip hop all kinds of music.one of the main focus about this place that I really like is the bathroom. It's the best!! They have single bathrooms different doors and you select a door that's great for privacy. Not one time I been to the bathroom and I have to wait for some one to come Out.they have sort of a patio sitting in the front which is really nice. Lots of chairs and tables just in case you want to sit outside this place is awesome best place hands down I been to in a long time.",1,,2
28,Nina K.,"New York, NY",46,75,288,1.0,5/25/2018,"That burger that's on the donut... I knew it was a bad idea but I really wanted to try something different. I was sad that I did it. I was disappointed by everything about it including the flavor and the greasiness but also the fact that it seemed like it had been sitting around for a while. The fries that came with it were cold and unpleasant to eat and just generally the Burger on the donut everything was Bland and just greasy/almost mushy. Also, I'm not sure if this is the case throughout but the waiter I had was pretty condescending and is not very helpful in general. I won't be going back.",,,

30,Ann J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",93,1,0,1.0,8/11/2018,Place is horrible. Service sucked. Employees seemed to have a grand time in the back near coffee machine. Brought wrong order to table. And Gentlemen delivered it with head phones on. Seems to be a really relaxed environment way to relax. Food was extremely salty. Chicken and waffles wasn't good at all. Chicken was over cooked as if it was refried. Highly won't recommend this place to anyone. The Heights can and will do better.,1,,

First off the bar was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We were seated right away on a Saturday night, so that was nice. We ordered the cherry bourbon wings that were very disappointing. They had absolutely no flavor at all! It's very hard to ruin wings, but they did. We also had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. They had a wonderful sauce and I wanted to get another order, but I restrained myself from being greedy. Lol. We also had an adult root bear float with alcohol. It took me back to my childhood and gave me a buzz. Lol. We ordered the red wine sangria as well, which was just so so.

It was good, but it was not hollandaise.   Not sure what it was. I had it on the side thankfully.   Would like an amazing place in the neighborhood,  but doesn't seem like they will improve.

41,Julisa D.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",90,9,15,4.0,1/28/2018,Everything was awesome except the donut burger. I don't know if they were having an off day with the burger cause it was too salty. The meat was overly seasoned. The wings omg the wings! Best wings ever! They're so tender and juicy and flavorful. They brine their wings for two days and then smoke them and finally fry them. Holy fuck! I couldn't get enough of those. The Mac and cheese was the perfect ounce of cheesy. My girlfriend had the chicken and waffle sandwich and omg the chicken was also tender. It tasted cleaned and cooked to perfection. She said that the maple syrup choice could have been better. The shakes were awesome.

46,Davina F.,"New York, NY",386,199,79,3.0,5/12/2017,"I came here with a friend for happy hour, and the specials are reasonable.  4 - 7 PM gets you $5 drafts/bottles, $5 glasses of house wine, $6 sangrias, and I THINK there are a few $6 cocktails also.Our waiter was so nice, but placing our order took for.ev.er.  I'm pretty sure we were at our table for a little under 10 minutes before anyone came over to us.I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and it was SO DRY.  I really thought there'd be a more generous amount of BBQ sauce, but nope.  The fries were tasty, though.My friend ordered the mac and cheese with chicken and bacon in it.  Again, the chicken was crazy dry, but it wasn't as big of a deal due to the cheese giving it life.I'm still giving this place 3 stars because I would come back, but probably to try the chicken & waffles because it looked awesome at the table next to us.  Or, maybe one of those crazy milkshakes they've got.You're ""A-OK,"" Annie's.",8,1,1

48,Anthony T.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,2,1,5.0,7/23/2018,"This is now one of my favorite places to order wings.  If you're going for bold Flavor try the South Carolina Wings. The Frickles were perfectly battered with a great combination of the avocado aioli dipping sauce. Another plus was the drink choice and customer service. As a person who loves ginger beer, the mule was the perfect choice for a drink. My server, Kirstine , was very attentive, informative and her suggestions were very spot on. The pulled chicken tacos were very flavorful and juicy. I'm definitely coming back here!!!",,,
49,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",67,162,86,1.0,4/26/2017,"Bring back Heights Tavern, please!  Had really high hopes for Crazy Annie's because the complete re-do of the outer space and concept intrigued me.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not met for a couple of reasons.  My team and I came here on a Wednesday for a late lunch hour at 1 PM.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately.  What ensued next was really unfortunate and disappointing.  First off, our drink orders were completely forgotten.  We had two orders of Coca Cola, two orders of Diet Coke, and two orders of iced tea.  For a party of 11 - I understand the number of drink orders can be overwhelming, but I think that's why we have paper and pen, in addition to the 18% gratuity fee that was already added onto the end of our bill.  For our troubles, apparently, the drinks were supposed to be comped, but when we got our bill, they were still on.  Being that we had to rush back to work, we did not contest this matter either. For the food - I completely understand and can appreciate the concept of having everyone's orders served at the same time.  100% agree with it, but not if it is at the expense of being served cold food.  I shared a burger with my co-worker, cooked medium well, and the burger patty was basically cold.  They claim the burger consists of a mix of beef, short rib, and brisket, but it was not as juicy as it is advertised.  Such a disheartening situation, but by the time our waiter came back around to check on us, since my co-worker and I split the burger, we were already 1/2 done so we didn't ask for it to be re-heated.  Also, being that we had to rush back, it wasn't worth asking for another burger.  The onion ring is heavily battered and salty. One feedback that I would suggest to the managers, as well as chef Arim Isabel at Crazy Annie's would be that their food warmers are functional.  The fries were not hot or crispy and I prefer Heights Tavern fries over the ones I had today.  Sad to continuously be comparing, but hope these opinions will contribute to the improvement of their service and brand. The Cajun dry-rub wings were hot in temperature, but lackluster in flavor.  There wasn't enough spice or salt while the chili was a cubed-beef version of spaghetti, as it was served over a plate of noodles.  The salads looked fresh and I didn't notice any wilted leaves on any of my co-worker's plates, but paying $12-$14 for a salad would not be my top choice.  However, my coworkers who did get the salad reported it being delicious so maybe I'll try it next time. Water glasses were missing upon arrival and one of them that was already there on the table was dirty.  Beautiful bottles of water which I thought fit the ""Crazy"" Annie theme, but other than the unique bottles, nothing really stood out for me.  Perhaps a better experience at night - as they seem to have an impressive list of beers and cocktails!Edit: Gastritis last night for me & my other coworker had to call out sick. Downgrade to one star.",8,2,
50,Tiffany S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",256,1,0,2.0,10/2/2018,If your a person who can't stand so much bread this prob isn't a place to order from. I just placed an order from this restaurant and was really disappointed I paid $50 for basically bread. The burger had huge buns and the onion rings had wayyyyy more breading then onion. I had to take the top bun off my burger and the onion ring because it became to much. So it left me with a bottom bun and a patty with fatty bacon. My parents didn't like that the whole order was just bread as well.,,,
51,Catherine C.,"New York, NY",0,48,13,2.0,6/27/2018,"I went here with a friend for her birthday. It's not my kind of food, and I read the bad reviews, so I ate a healthy meal at home beforehand. My friends ordered 2 appetizers for the table, and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty the fried pickles and fried deviled eggs were. I ordered a side of mixed vegetables, asking the waiter what the veg were.  He said, ""They're mixed."" I asked what ""they"" are. He mentioned zucchini. I kept looking at him.  I might have even asked again. Let me emphasize that I was being pleasant.  Given that this was going to be my meal, and there are a lot of vegetables in the world, I just wanted to know what I'd be eating.  I think it was about 3 times that he shrugged and repeated, ""They're mixed."" He couldn't be bothered to find out, except that he knew there was zucchini.I'm going to keep this short because I could give you a blow by blow but I think you are beginning to get the idea. I ordered roasted potatoes to go with my mixed veg. A decent waiter would have found out even after i ordered that the mixed veg were 1/3 potatoes. After all, he puts in the order about a quarter inch away from the kitchen. And... wait for it... there was no zucchini in the veg.  I must say the veg were delicious.  Nicely seasoned. Ok... the restaurant was EMPTY, and I don't know what he was doing all night but it wasn't  waiting on our table. I sent back the potatoes and I'm annoyed to say I forgot to see whether he took them off the bill. I am doubting it. I had to go to the waiters' station 2 or 3 times after waiting for him to show up for EXTENDED periods of time. He wasn't at the wait station either and the waitress who was there didn't take the dessert order. The bartender, obviously trying to give decent service,  did take it. We were ordering dessert for my friend's birthday (one to share) and it seemed predictable that they charged us for it. It's a courtesy in most restaurants not to. I don't mind paying. I do mind being at a place that seems unconcerned about its clients.I would have given him a nickel for a tip except I wouldn't embarrass my friend on her birthday of course. We all figured out the bill, and though we were all appalled at the service, we'd enjoyed ourselves despite it, and I think no one wanted to have unpleasantness.Food much better than I expected. Won't be back anyway, as I make better food at home,  so it's the service that matters.",,,
52,Katerine S.,"Miami, FL",2,13,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"Horrible, what can i say i waited for almost an hour for burned fries and undercooked chicken. The server didn't even ask if we wanted something to drink.",,,
53,Nayary R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",100,4,11,5.0,3/17/2018,The food here was so good!! I ordered the glazed donut burger and loved it! It was so good! My friend ordered chicken and waffles. I stole some of her chicken because they gave her A LOT and I liked it. My friend got the funnel cake with vanilla ice cream and the ice cream was so good we had to double check if it was vanilla because it tasted different but very good. When it came to me I ordered a milkshake which was so yummy and filling. Only downside were the cookies that didn't taste as good because they were really hard to bite. Wished they were a bit softer. I did leave so full and happy. Overall the place is really big and I am planning to come back to the bar with friends and have a few drinks! Definitely Recommend!,,,

It was a Sunday and partially busy. Amanda the Manager was THE MOST AMAZING HUMAN! The servers and the hostess were so so kind and very accommodating. The food was great and the drinks were super strong. We have been back since and it's now our go to spot! We hope to do a Drag brunch here soon!!!!,,,

Updated review",All I can say is whoever created the menu must have been high!!!  Oh my GOD!!!!!  I wanted everything on the menu. But I settled for Run of the Mill Chicken Breast Sandwich with Tater Tots and Crazy Eggs. That sandwich. Wow. I misread the description of the sandwich and thought it was fried. I was pleasantly surprised with grilled chicken on a freaking pretzel bun. You must try it!!!  The Crazy Eggs were ok. I'm from the south and I believe that we created this delicacy. It was interesting. I liked the crunch but it didn't have any flavor  but I used the sriracha sauce that comes with the fries and it made it ok. I will be back in 2 weeks. The ambiance is nice. We sat outside and had a great time. Enjoy,1,1,1
61,Samantha R.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,17,3,3.0,1/23/2018,The only positive thing I can say for crazy Annie's is that they have great milkshakes and the avocado fries were delicious. Our server was also great. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits and hated it. Had no flavor and the shrimp tasted freezer burnt. I got the big O burger and it was mediocre. My onion rings were super doughy and unsatisfying. Will totally give this place another chance as it has lots of promise and I love the interior.,,,
62,Ryan C.,"New York, NY",67,5,0,1.0,7/10/2018,"Avoid this place. Service and food are terrible. Server walked by and gave us no service. No refills, no napkins, no plates, no ketchup. No service. Not to mention our simple order was messed up. The tacos appetizer was over seasoned and filled with water and oil. The first bite poured all this liquid right into my hand because we had no plates or napkins. My pulled pork sandwich fell apart and had very little flavor. The tater tots were hard and over-cooked but still cold! The chicken and waffle sandwich is a big mess of oil and breading. Never coming back. We'd be CRAZY to.",,,
63,Ashley H.,"Chicago, IL",200,3,1,5.0,8/18/2017,"Yummy dessert!!! So many options it was hard to pick but I shared the Waffle Sunday . It was HUGE and sooo sooo tasty! The waffle was so delicate and tasted great with the strawberries, bananas, caramel, whipped cream and the rest of the works!!! I'd definitely recommend trying the shakes too--they looked good as well. Didn't eat any food here but I can say there dessert is a MUST TRY!!",,,
64,m p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,1.0,6/23/2018,"Terrible. Overpriced. Inattentive and indifferent bartender and servers  seem more interested in chatting, checking Facebook or Instagram than ensuring customer satisfaction. I sat at the bar and ordered the chicken tacos. AWFUL. I had a beer and waited 15  minutes at the bar with an empty beer glass with the bartender never asked if I wanted a refill. I saw a couple sitting next to me with two empty glasses as well. Funny thing was that it wasn't even busy and the bartender was just walking around behind the bar doing nothing...except talking to a gaggle of servers that congregated on the side of the bar.I got so fed up that I just threw my credit card on the bar to get the hell out of there. 10 minutes later, she finally notices and has the nerve to ask me ""Is everything alright"". I was so disgusted I I just pushed m credit card to her. I usually am an over-tipper, but was so angry, so  I left her nothing (I still feel a little guilty about that as I usually tip even if the service is lousy, but the server is pleasant. She wasn't pleasant and I  couldn't see myself rewarding such obviously (and maybe intentionally) lousy service.Place needs to train staff on basic hospitality skills.Good music though.",,,

66,Chris K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,3.0,3/31/2018,"The food is very good but the service is quite poor. We are longtime Heights residents and have been here about ten times, starting when it first reopened (previously was Heights Tavern). The food has remained solid but the service has deteriorated steadily. We go periodically because our kids love the milkshakes, but we have stopped bringing adult friends. The last two times, we were one of less than three tables seated and it took over fifteen minutes to take our drink order and another twenty to bring the drinks. During the interlude I saw our waiter standing by the bar looking at Instagram. Another fun tidbit: the last few times we have been there, they have always brought one less piece of bread than the number at the table. This has been true for parties of four, five, and six. Are they just messing with us?If you go, try the fried Brussels sprouts, kale salad, anything with pulled pork (especially the Mac and Cheese), and the wings. Save room for a milkshake. But be ready to ask repeatedly where your food is, and expect some blank, indifferent stares in response.",1,,
67,T K.,"New York, NY",13,108,0,1.0,3/28/2018,"Food was ok but when checking the receipt with my cc statement, I noticed they added on an extra $ to the tip.  Might not seem like a lot but tips are voluntary, and if they do that to everyone it adds up.  Not cool at all.  I gave a 20% tip too, so there was no need to add more, especially as service wasn't over the top fab.  Won't go back for this reason alone.",,1,

69,Sonnet S.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",6,5,0,1.0,7/24/2018,"I've been at this restaurant several times. Each time  ive gotten different waiters but every one of them provided very poor service . I'm pretty simple. All I want is a waiter greeting us with the menu when I get to the table, and orders to be taken in a timely matter. As well as being checked up on at least once. If they cant do that, they shouldn't be working at a customer oriented environment. Food is pretty basic but overall this place can be better.",,,
70,Jasmine O.,"San Jose, CA",3,61,18,5.0,10/16/2017,Are you kidding me? My mom and I stopped by there today and we ordered two different burgers. We ordered the big O and the glazed doughnut burger. We decided to go halves on it so we can try each one. These were the most amazing burgers I have ever tasted! I wish they had something like this in California.I would have to say that my favorite one was the big O! It had onion rings plus melted cheese and the overall taste of it was just out of this world. The glazed donut one tasted good but I can live without it. Can't wait to come back to New York just for their burgers...,,,
71,Stacy C.,"New York, NY",27,8,8,3.0,3/4/2018,"Came here post the NYRR 5K! First issue Yelp listed this place as closed until 11am. Food was amazing but service is still questionable. The gentleman responsible for placing water on each table didn't really seem to mesh well with the establishment. He  was wearing acid washed jeans and his baseball hat tipped low.  Actually wasn't sure if he was just waiting to be seated at a table or here actually working. Our party of 3 was seated by the window which was a bit drafty and the waiter was gracious enough to allow us to move our table away from the draft. The food and drinks was AMAZING, Crab Cakes Benedict Delicious, Chicken and Waffle delectable but let's talk about the House Benedict.....A member of my party was 75% satisfied with his meal. Upon ordered he specifically said no onions and repeated ""I hate onions"" but guess what happened the food came????  There were onions on his plate. Famished from the 5K, he simply picked the onions off of his plate and proceeded to eat.Did I mention that the food was delicious. Back to ""water gentleman"", we asked him for napkins which I believe were are still waiting for those. We did however receive our napkins when a 4th member joined our table, as he was polite enough to pick some up from the bar along with his own drink. The ""supposedly"" universal sign of knife and fork together indicating that you are finished with your plate was either ignored or not so universal as only one plate was removed from our table. **I've figured it out Sweet Annie's sign to notify the wait staff that you are finished with you meal it turning over the extra lemon on top on the added open napkins QUICKLY gets your tables removed.",,,1
72,Kwes M.,"New York, NY",120,4,0,1.0,8/4/2018,"I walked passed this place and it looked interesting. I did some research and read there backstory which was very intriguing. Went in to have some drinks and watch the Game. Had a great time really good people and atmosphere. When I tried the food I figured it would be pretty good.  And Booooooyyyyy was I wrong.  Food was Bland, absolutely flavorless.  I got the wings with dry rub, Nooooooo flavor at all. Mac and cheese I had to add sooooooo much salt and even when I did it still tasted like plain noodles. They have some type of Mexican corn which I ABSOLUTELY LOVEEEE. And some how they managed to butcher it.  Such a simple recipe BUTCHEREDDDD AND SOUR, Yuck!!!. It's cool to be creative but make the food taste as good or better. I also ordered 16 wings cost that me 33 dollars. Really?!?!??  If they were good I would have let that slide but they SUCK'D.

The chicken was fine the fries were rubbery and cold.My wife had the French toast with fruit. The French toast was cold as if the plate came out of a refrigerator maybe because of the fruit on the plate. We asked them to heat the French toast.I ordered a vegetable omelet  that came with home fries. They made the omelet with sausage bits. I asked them to replace it with a vegetable omelet, they did. This time the home fries had some sausage bits.So they made a new omelet and took the home fries from the 1st omelet and placed it on the new omelets plate?At least 2 times  the waiter claimed that the manger would come speak to us. It never happened.The restaurant was barely busy except for the bar. The service was just bad.Very disappointing.I sent them an email on there website that same evening.

Trip one: I'd like the Pimento Cheese Burger! (Sorry, sold out)Damn. Well, then - started with the Fried Avocado fries. I enjoyed them. Not at all spicy so worry not your feeble taste buds. The Turkey Burger is exceptional. (And enormous) not at all like those mixed dark and white meat patties, the color of a cardboard box, and the tasting notes of a rubber shoe. Nay! This white-meat turkey burger was juicy, and paired perfectly with (order them) the Cajun French fries. Trip two! Finally snagged the pimento burger. It is good. Much better than the BBQ burger (tasted good, but there was a lot going on with the ingredients. Almost too much.) Beers? Just give me something hoppy without any pineapple or strawberry tasting notes. For me, that was the Sweetwater 420 IPA. Good stuff. Finally - the service was very good. Our waitress was very sweet and quite funny. Thank you Annie for being .8 of a mile away. As I type this I'm on my way to try one of your shakes! Chased of course with a beer.",1,,

Keep in mind its not busy at all. Suddenly a bus boy comes strolling down and he has his pants half way down his ass. Sorry but indont want to see a guys ass. We got up, and left.

85,Celeste R.,"New York, NY",29,30,13,2.0,5/5/2017,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Heights Tavern, so I was excited to see this restaurant pop up in the neighborhood. To be honest, I think they're trying too hard. My biggest complaint about Heights tavern was the food. They tried too hard at times to sell the southern cuisine without getting a chef who had spent longer than a layover below the Mason Dixon, and I think this restaurant  is no different. I ordered the Catfish lollipops and a strawberry shake. The Catfish lollipops were sent back because I ain't ever had flavorless Catfish. Like, yall couldn't throw so old bay or salt and pepper on them. The milkshake was too watery and there wasn't a trace of strawberry in it. The only reason it didn't get sent back is because I felt bad for our waitress. I probably wouldn't eat here again.",1,2,

Updated review","There are barely any vegetarian options. While one might think that fries, the crazy eggs, and jalapeño poppers are vegetarian they are not! First both the poppers and crazy eggs have bacon on them when they are not mentioned in the menu AND the items are all fried in the same oil as the bacon making anything fried off limits.",3,2,
88,Camela W.,"New York, NY",14,48,13,2.0,11/9/2017,"Went here a few weekends ago for brunch. I saw some good things from Yelp and heard about this place from a friend. They had a live band playing (which I personally find annoying because of the noise level) and it wasn't too crowded.We were seated right away and given menus. Unfortunately, this is where its starts to go downhill. Our waiter (can't remember his name) took our drink orders and food orders. The drinks didn't come until the food did which was kind of odd, but okay. Their mimosas were realllyyyy good. I will give them that. Our food came out lukewarm which tells me it was sitting somewhere for a while until the waiter remembered to pick it up. A crab eggs benedict shouldn't be *kinda* warm and neither should the doughnut burger. The food, taste-wise, was decent, but nothing spectacular. The waiter came back to check on us once and then disappeared. When we were done eating, I was debating on dessert since they looked pretty crazy, but unfortunately, we waited over 20 minutes until we saw the waiter again and flagged him down. So instead of dessert, we asked for the check. My boyfriend could see a bunch of the waiters at the bar talking, laughing and drinking. We also noticed a couple of other tables that looked like there were done and waiting on some attention as well. I'm pretty sure if we ordered dessert it would've arrived partially melted due to how distracted and disinterested the waitstaff appeared to be.Based on the lukewarm food and lack of attention, I honestly wouldn't go back here.",1,,

The avacado was more like mushed guacamole. I just wasn't impressed at all. And since nobody checked on how our food was i had no opportunity to send it back. I ate my cold home fries and tried to eat the egg but the gooeyness put me off.The presentation of the meals also could of been better since it seemed to be quite a quirky place from the outside. It just came out on a standard white plate which was kinda boring.I was also offered no condiments and there were none on the table.Might try it again but not anytime soon.",1,,

93,Tanya B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,25,3,2.0,3/19/2017,"BEWARE: this place is not much better than the shuttered Heights Tavern that the same owners ""revamped"" into this place. I ordered take out. Pros: The food portions are huge. The decor is good. Menu items are exciting on description. Cons: food is still mediocre and bland. Prices are still too high for the area. You are at first all hyped over how the dish is described - but then let down by the lack of good flavor. I had better South Carolina BBQ wings at Whole Foods. Their sauce was amazing. I've also had fantastic fried Brussel Sprouts at several other restaurants. Crazy Annie's were tasteless. So much potential with that dish. So sad. Lastly, they refused to take my debit card because my card doesn't have the new chip (not all banks have issued the new chip cards to customers). I had to go to an ATM and pull out the cash and then go back and pay for the order. This was both embarrassing and inconvenient. The hostess tried to be as nice as possible when she was handed me back the unswiped card and explained what the bartender (who handles take-out orders) told her. They could have accommodated me that one time - especially being that they just reopened after closing for (among other things) poor customer response and bad customer service. They need to also lower the prices. You need locals (not just the people who work in the area) to support you in order to stay open. Did you not learn anything from the demise of Heights Tavern? Bland food + high prices = imminent closure.",11,3,1

96,Michelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",233,13,19,2.0,7/24/2017,"My daughter and I were super excited to eat here. But the service was so horrible; it was our first and last visit. Presentation of drinks, food, ambience, all great. The taste, staff, energy were all bad. I have to say, the hostess was pleasant and seated us right away. Once seated, we watched other tables get service. Ppl arrived after us and we're now drinking, ordering, waiting for food. We patiently waited for our waiter. After quite some time, a woman in plain clothing came over to take our order, which became cumbersome because she was unable to answer specific questions about a few items. I asked her for a drink menu (figured that should be standard though) and ordered the sangria. The drink came right away. Food took very long but we were glad when it finally arrived. Although disappointed by the taste, we ate it because we were now starving. It wasn't until the food was gone that they finally brought out my daughter's juice! She's a rather patient 8 year old! We sat for 20 mins waiting for the check. I then had to ask a passing waiter for it. Another waiter then brought it out to us. Once again, waiting for someone to come and get my money!, I grew frustrated and went inside to the hostess and gave her the money. She apologized and went in the back. She came back out and said my change was coming. A server brought it out to me and I left $2 on the counter, which was too much of a tip! My daughter had chicken and waffles which she said they ruined by putting confectioner sugar all over the chicken. I don't recall what I had. Not a great experience overall and I'm not planning on returning. I gave them two stars because of the hostess and the cleanliness.",,,

Updated review","I am so happy to have this cute place two blocks from my apartment. Food is American with southern BBQ influence. I've tried the pulled pork sandwich, Mac and cheese and fried avocado sticks. Favorite thing was their Mac and Cheese. Service is friendly and attentive. I love how they have revamped the decor and it's a great fun vibe. The quinoa beet salad is on point!",1,,
100,Chris B.,"Manhattan, NY",604,27,14,5.0,4/8/2017,This place is great and I really recommend it. I work in the restaurant business and also live in the neighborhood and can't wait to return. Some of these reviews are incredibly poor representations of the heart and soul felt at Crazy Annie's. The portions are very generous and the prices are on point. To say it is too high for the neighborhood is ignorant and offensive. I live in this neighborhood and think the price is right on and if the few foolish people who make these comments choose to not go back to the establishment . . . Then they can go to one of the other non existent places no where near 164th We got the chicken sandwich with a pretzel bun. So good. Avocado fries were great. The street corn was a big portion and very creamy. LOOOOOOVED the chicken and waffles. The Cookie Monster milkshake was one of a kind. I went on an immediate diet after my visit. Check this place out and help welcome them to the neighborhood. I know I'm glad they have opened uptown.,1,1,

We arrive and the ""hostess "" looks at us and says ""what"". We are seated and our waiter comes over after 10 minutes . It was the middle of the week at 1:00pm and not crowded at all. Perhaps if the waiter could've pulled himself from his cell phone he would've noticed us earlier. We give him our order , even though he writes nothing down and says to us ""what was that I didn't get all of it"". We repeat our order and he leaves. The order was as follows 2sodas, 1 order of sliders, kale salad with chicken, order of shrimp toast and an order of avocado fries. 35 minutes goes by and we finally get our food which was mediocre at best.

109,Markus W.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,4,0,1.0,10/21/2017,I'm SHOCKED by the good reviews here. I never leave reviews but I had to warn people about this place. Went here for brunch and it was probably the worst brunch I've ever had in New York and I've lived here for 8 years. Ordered a burger and it was not fresh. Frozen pre cooked patty. My friend ordered a plain omelet. No meat. The omelet came out with an unrecognizable meat inside (looked like chorizo) After asking the waiter what was the meat inside she couldn't tell us. She then asked the chef and he didn't know what meat he added. Waiter was nice but the place is definitely understaffed. Unorganized. Just go somewhere else. Almost any place in Harlem is better than this place.,,,
110,D J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,8,0,3.0,10/2/2017,"Not bad. I had the seasoned corn, angus burger and Mac-n-cheese with pulled pork. The angus burger was delicious along with the fries and pickle.

I had the fried Brussels sprouts as an appetizer which were out of this world! My friend had the smoked South Carolina BBQ wings. Both appetizers has an amazing burst of flavors! For dinner I had the Shrimp burger which had caught my attention; it's an actual patty made of shrimp. I see where they get their name because the items on the menu are out of this world! The shrimp burger was very flavorful from the avocado to the old bay aioli and the sesame crusted bun! Wow! Talk about foodgasm! My friend had the Big O burger with sweet potato fries. The burger had 2 giant fried onion rings, bacon, L/T, cherry bourbon BBQ sauce and house beer cheese! It was so juicy and tender with amazing flavors! The street corn was ok a bit on the tangy side. Not the usual street corn I get from the Corn man that walks around Washington Heights. My kids enjoyed the chicken and waffles w/ fries and the cheeseburger w/fries! I will definitely recommend and will be coming back to this awesome spot in Washington Heights!",,,
113,Cydnee R.,"New York, NY",99,41,10,3.0,6/6/2017,"Former Heights Tavern location; not sure if the ownership has changed but I don't mind a change in concept. But as a Southern girl, I can attest there is a big difference between authenticity and just searching ""southern inspired dishes"" on Pinterest. Also, there is no atmosphere in this place. It's weird. My husband and I brought our three year old for dinner. Well-priced kids menu with a lot of options, which is great for a neighborhood with tons of families. I had the shrimp burger and a side of street corn - the shrimp burger was a weird, flavorless, glossy patty - not at all what I was expecting, and not something I would ever order again or recommend. It was fine, thanks to the avocado and aioli, but it could have been so much better. My husband also had the shrimp burger, sans bun - not because he was particularly craving it, but because he has celiac disease and nearly everything he wanted was either deep-fried (putting something in a deep fryer does not a southern dish make) or had gluten - including all their sauces. Gluten free eating is becoming more of a reality, and it's time for restaurants to get on board. We'll pay for good celiac-friendly food, even at a premium, so don't forget us, please. And yes, the weird glossy shrimp patty looked even weirder without bread. Service was fine - everyone was friendly, they are very kid friendly and asked us privately before offering our kidlet a lollipop on the way out, but they forgot our appetizer. Also, what's with the bartender sitting down with his back to customers, while watching tv? We are both former bartenders and currently own a bar in midtown. We would flay anyone of our bartenders doing such a thing.",3,,

The food was good but we were disappointed by the dessert. The funnel cake was fried wayyyyyy to hard, there wasn't much powdered sugar and it only came with two small scoops of ice cream. What's even more sad is you know you're not over reacting when a 3 year old tastes the funnel cake and didn't like it. By the way she's not a funnel cake first timer. We sent the funnel cake back and got the ice cream sandwich. The cookies were really hard, but we didn't want to complain again.

Ordered my food to go again, but the service wasn't nearly as good...actually it was really crappy( different male bartender). For starters, your hostess didn't know that you offer ribs at lunch. Second the bartender seemed more interested in chatting with his friend, sitting on the bar equipment and scrolling thru his phone, then he was at giving great customer service. I was a bit shocked at this behavior, especially since the manager didn't seem to care. The bartender never asked me if I would like a glass of water while I waited for my food( on a 85 degree day), even after he saw me take a bottles water from my bag and gulp it. I tried TWICE to get his attention so I could get my check ( as he passed by), but again he was too busy talking to his friend at the bar. Food is good, but proper customer service is important.

It came with no silverware, no dressing and most perplexingly, no kale, which i was okay with, but still would have appreciated a heads up on.

Updated review","I went there with my family including a baby during football playoffs. It was the second football game in the patrons at crazy Annie's bar were very drunk skirting at the TV and slamming theit chairs. I had to go over and speak to one gentleman about his behavior in front of children. The behavior was ignored by staff and a brawl broke  out. That flight rolled into the streets the police had to come. Crazy Annies staff did not seem to how to handle it. I work in law-enforcement and try to direct the staff but was met up with rudeness , People were hurt in this fight and he put the patrons in jeopardy. We still would charge full price or a bill. My biggest problem is that I sent a private email to management at the restaurant. I never even got a response or apology. I would not recommend it as a family place until they address these issue",,,

132,Greg B.,"Long Island City, NY",27,46,0,4.0,5/28/2017,Really like this place.  Hard to find healthy options but have not had a bad thing on the menu.  Pretty decent if not great beer selection.  Also the mixed drinks are pretty solid (the margarita they made on Cinco de Mayo was killer).  Definitely recommend this place for WaHi visitors/residents and I look forward to trying the brunch here,,,
133,David A.,"Dublin, OH",14,3,1,1.0,6/19/2017,Wow I blew away $30 to eat a Run of a mill chicken breast sandwich and a long ice tea. The bread was 3 times thicker than the breast that looked like a slice of a cold cut ! The chicken taste burned and dry ! Supposedly there was to be a garlic Aoli sauce never tasted it and i asked for Cajun fries they dumped a pound of cayenne powder on my  fries wtf ! My drink was OK but it was so small. I should have complained but decided to leave and never ever going back there. Will definitely never recommend this place to anybody,,,
134,Nicole M.,"North Hills, NY",30,11,1,5.0,5/29/2017,The food comes in huge portions and is really filling. My friend had the quinoa bowl and I had the donut burger. The donut burger is only on Saturday's and sundays for brunch and weekdays for dinner. The staff were really attentive and very communicative. It's a welcome new vibe to have in the neighborhood,,,
135,Fernando P.,"New York, NY",287,13,0,1.0,6/9/2017,"Sitting at this restaurant and having to wait for over 20 mins to get the servers attention as he attends to everyone but our table. I think this is amazing service. If you want to NOT be served, come to this amazing establishment!!! Coming from the food industry, this is just horrible. I'd give it 0 stars but I have to pick just one. Btw. It's not even busy at 6:37pm on a Friday.",,,
136,Tomas C.,"Walkersville, MD",0,6,0,3.0,6/29/2017,"I've visited this place three times and the first two times were great. Great food/ amazing service.Then today i'm overcome with disappointment. The bar smells to the point where you can smell it as soon as you come in. (No biggie. They could have been busy this week)Bianca takes my order at the bar and immediately asks if I'd like to start a tab. All good. But Immediately after taking my order she issues me the check. Why??and I'm happy I didn't pay right away.Then, as I sit there drinking my beer I start to wonder ""where's my food"" . It had been almost 30 min when I noticed my food has been sitting at a turbo tap station near the kitchen. I literally had to stop someone to ask if that's my food. My bartender never even bothered to check. ( The place was not that busy)After one taste I realized the brisket was too cold. Though I probably could have asked for something else, I decided enough was enough for the day. I kindly paid for the beer, scribbled a comment card and left.Maybe I caught them on a bad day but when you set high expectations then get let down when you're hungry. It sucks to say the least.Place gets a three stars because the other two occasions were that good.",,,

138,Djerica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,55,83,3.0,6/3/2017,"I came here with friends for lunch on a work day. We frequently came to heights tavern and the service was always questionable so I was happy to see that the service was much better. We were seated quickly, and our food came out very quickly.  The food itself is what I wasn't impressed with. We ordered avocado fries as an app and they were delicious. They only came with four small pieces of avocado though. My friend ordered the wings and Several of us ordered the shrimp burger. The shrimp burger from heights tavern was our favorite so We thought maybe they kept the same recipe. they did not. The burger was to oily, had no crunch to it and it just didn't wow me like before. It was still edible but I would definitely not order again. I really wish they tried to recreate that recipe because it was definitely one of the only bright stops on the heights lunch menu. The fries were okay too. All in all, I would say the food we tried was meh but they had an extensive menu and if I go back I would try something different.",,,
139,Brendan M.,"Lincoln City, OR",58,2,0,4.0,7/19/2017,"The food was fantastic; however, our waitress Andy was unkind and snotty to us. She brought our refills extremely late.

Shut Your Mouth And Try If Your A True Bacon Lover. He Stated I Think They Used A Whole Pack In Half Of Bacon On My Burger Yeah Babe This Place Is A Winner. My Daughter Ate Her Whole Cheese Burger And Mac & Cheese She Just Loved It Non Stop Eating. Which Means The Food Must Be Amazing Because She Don't Like Much Now Of Days. She's Goes Through Picky Eater Phase. The Crazy Milkshake Is Yummy My Daughter Enjoyed Herself With This Milkshake & It Only Cost $12 Taste Just As Good As Blacktap Which I Paid $30 For Before. The Drinks Are Hitting Too Which Means Crazy Annie's Is My New Spot For After Work. I Want To Try That Glazed Doughnut Burger Which Means I'll Be Back Here Before The Week Is Out I Can't Get Enough Of That Corn.",,,

Updated review","Still decent food for a decent price but they have gone down to one star based on their rest rooms. The rest rooms are DISGUSTING. Absolutely DISGUSTING! Three hadn't been flushed, one clearly had urine sprayed on the seat because a guy apparently can't aim, pubic hair on another seat, hair in the sink, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS!!!",,,
145,Anwar U.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,7,2,4.0,10/8/2017,"It is local, and the food is delicious. They have a separate take out section too. Meaning you can order your food on your way home and get it as soon as you get off the train. They have delicious cocktails too. It is the type of restaurant that does a good job of incorporating everyone's dietary differences but still gives you American type food.",,,
146,Danielle R.,"JAMAICA, NY",1,2,0,1.0,5/25/2017,"So I'll start with I didn't get my appetizer. Service was too slow to not get everything I asked for. I sent bck my ""shrimp burger "" and got wings as a replacement and reordered my appetizer, which was the street corn (it was edible but I've had MUCH better) Sent the wings back too.. sauce was tasteless, veggies soggy, and dressing watered down ..A LOT! but the fries were good (gotta find the bright side)   The worst part was through all of this a manager NEVER came over to speak with me, I guess they're used to customers sending back multiple items..Probably won't be back..nope lets change that...WONT BE BACK",,,

148,Lo I.,"Brooklyn, NY",294,2,0,1.0,4/12/2017,"CRAZY is a very accurate adjective to describe this establishment. My friend and I had to wait for our food to be delivered for OVER 2.5 HOURS. We've had to call multiple times and have received conflicting information regarding our order. Will not be returning. Will be advising everyone we know and don't know to avoid this place at all costs. They didn't offer to comp our meal in any way or compensate for the inconvenience. They also LIED about sending our food out for delivery and had to call us back to let us know that they were now all out of an item we had ordered. Worst service ever and we didn't even have to step in the place to experience it. Upon delivery they blamed a different delivery service we didn't use for the delay. Whether that was another lie or a poor excuse since we had been in contact with them, we will never know. Do. Not. Go. There.",,,
149,Wesley M.,"New York, NY",274,4,1,5.0,3/25/2017,Love the vibe here!! Food was excellent and the drinks knocked me on my ass. Absolutely no complaints. Also looking forward to the grab and go lunch bar!!,,,

153,Elena R.,"New York, NY",0,14,25,3.0,5/23/2017,"Food is amazing! Service needs to pick up the pace a bit! However while the service is on the slower side it is still great! Waiters are friendly and super attentive! I had their shrimp burger the first time I went and loved it! Second time I went for brunch with my baby and my Bf. Luckily it wasn't too busy so we were seated instantly!I had the crab cakes with eggs Benedict on a biscuit, it was ok!  It was Kinda cold and the eggs weren't runny!  Almost forgot to mention there were egg shells on the eggs which made me very unhappy! Manager did provide a discount without us asking! So that went well!!My BF had the chicken and waffles and THAT WAS SO SO GOOD! For dessert I tried one of their really cool milk shakes, it was called the Cookie Monster! It was really cute to take pics but lacked creaminess and flavor! To me it tasted like too much milk was added! Overall their food is pretty good!Oh and I also tried their donut burger on our first visit IT WAS THE BOMB!!! (my bf ordered it for himself so if course I got a bit)",1,,1
154,Diana A.,"New York, NY",6,30,2,5.0,5/28/2017,Best tasting burgers in the heights.  Great atmosphere and music. I've been there 5 times already and have always enjoyed the food and the service. Keep it up!,1,,
155,Caro H.,"New York, NY",9,32,0,2.0,3/24/2017,"The drinks are decent. I got their Paradise margarita and the Yonkers Lager. Unfortunately I thought the shrimp toast was extremely disappointing--there were no pieces or taste of shrimp at all! After complaining to the waitstaff, I was told that it's shrimp ""ceviche"" style, but I've had legit ceviche and there were chunks of seafood in it. I paid $10 for diced tomatoes, onions, arugula, and avocado on top of toast? That's not okay.",2,,

157,Zulay A.,"New York, NY",191,113,3,3.0,4/7/2017,"This space was formerly heights tavern which I had a terrible experience not once but twice. I'm under the impression this might still be owned by the same people of the tavern however my experience was a little more delightful now. The servers were friendly, food was ok, the chicken and waffles were really good, everything else lacked a bit of flavor.  I like the concept behind the deviled eggs but it needs a little bit more of a kick, the street tacos were better than I expected considering this is not a Mexican restaurant but the meat was bland. They have an extensive beer menu of beers I never heard of but then again im no beer connoisseur nor pretend to be, the waiter was kind enough to let me taste two of the ones that sounded more promising but I chose the basic route and ordered a modelo.  To be fair I'll try them again either during brunch or actually order the stuff they rave they're good at like the bbq and the wings.",,2,1
158,Tony S.,"Bronx, NY",0,23,0,2.0,3/27/2017,"Same thing as Heights Tavern but new decor and menu. The food was very high on sodium. I ordered a quinoa bowl and it was very salty.

After waiting for another 40 minutes our order finally came which was a salad and a sandwich, my salad was wilted and old. So wilted and old that there was brown liquid around the plate. Bad service and old salad .",,,
162,Hannah H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,2.0,7/9/2017,"Very disappointed this time. I used to love the Heights Tavern but this place Crazy Annie's has really gone down hill. I really want to like it because it's so close to my apartment and I always crave Sunday brunch and they have reasonably priced food. However this is the third time I'm coming here for brunch and each time has been a similar experience. First of all the food takes FOREVER to come. My food has also arrived cold each time. I ordered avocado and toast last time and it was stone cold the bread wasn't even toasted. This time I ordered the chicken and waffles. Both arrived cold. I sent it back and they bought up another one cold again. I think they bring up the food from downstairs to save the trip, they just wait for a bunch of food to be ready and by the time we receive it it's gotten cold. Aside from that the food isn't really that good. 70% of the chicken was just fried and the chicken itself was very fatty. I also hate when menu's write that waffles come with maple syrup and then they just use regular store bought syrup. I don't mind but at least say on the menu ""syrup"". Maple syrup is different and makes a huge difference in taste (in my opinion). I know what to expect when going to a diner but I expect more from a place that charges double the price. Some positive parts were the live band playing, that was a really nice touch. The waiters are also extremely friendly although very busy so I get the impression this place is understaffed. Overall I probably will end up coming back just because it's so close but I will probably avoid it for brunch. Maybe their dinner experience is better. I'll get something that's meant to be cold (maybe a salad next time lol)",,,
