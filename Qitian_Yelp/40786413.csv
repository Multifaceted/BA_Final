0,Monica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",339,1,0.0,5.0,9/1/2018,The best strip club I have been in. Girls are pretty and friendly. Drinks are not overpriced and waitresses are gorgeous. Also Manager was very helpful and great to us. Would definitely recommend to everyone.,,,
1,Glenn V.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3286,1382,2240,4.0,6/30/2017,"""Sleezy"" is a misused and overused term that many reviewers have branded Private Eyes with. Nothing in my experience suggested even the slightest undertone of Sleeze, it has no place other than an attempt too sling mud.High drink prices seem to fall shy on substance as the drinks are priced appropriately for where you are on both a micro and macro level. To believe that drinks in a gentlemans club should be cheap in midtown Manhattan is not only silly, its entirely unrealistic.During my visit, I had the pleasure to speak with the twenty year general manager (name withheld) about some light topics. The three sister clubs associated with Private Eyes speak volumes to the professionalism I experienced.There are always a few dancers that are of the money grab mentality but fortunately are easily identifiable, so I keep them a movin' on down the line.",17,9,11
2,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",287,17,11,2.0,12/24/2017,"I thought this place would be one of those high end classy clubs but nah. Only 1 out of every 5 dancers was actually hot. Drinks were so bad and overpriced, made me feel really sick afterwards. Some of the foreign girls there were very friendly and easy to talk to. Some were just straight up aggressive. Will not come back unless I'm hammered.",3,1,1
3,Chinito T.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/19/2018,Its a good place but dont bring your phone in there. I actually took out my phone to check the time and my notifications and a stripper thought i was recording her... she called security on me and they force me to show them my photos and private pictures invading my privacy in which it's illegal in the state of new york... the white security guy is an asshole and disrespectful... the black ones are super nice but not the old white guy so please stay away from him,5,2,1
4,Alda V.,"Staten Island, NY",3,29,9,5.0,12/14/2017,How about this club . The most beautiful things here was Jessica host manager very professional the way she handle the dining room girls they were good was fun with my freind we had good time,,,
5,Erick A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0,2.0,4/30/2018,I liked the place I enjoyed my time . Prices can be a little lower but it's pretty cool.,1,,
6,Sargeant T.,"Washington, DC",7,151,0,2.0,1/18/2017,"This place is terrible. They rip you off every chance they get. If you bring a credit card, it's $30 minimum drinks, 20% automatic tip. If you try to get cash, it's a $10 fee plus what your bank charges. If you try to take off your coat, they won't let you unless you check it for a fee. If a strippers sits next to you and chats for 20 seconds, you'll find out on your bill that you somehow bought her a drink without even knowing it. The only reason for two stars instead of one is Daniella the Russian bartender. To her, I say:Dance me to your beauty with a burning violinDance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely inLift me like an olive branch and be my homeward doveDance me to the end of loveDance me to the end of loveOh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are goneLet me feel you moving like they do in BabylonShow me slowly what I only know the limits ofDance me to the end of loveDance me to the end of loveDance me to the wedding now, dance me on and onDance me very tenderly and dance me very longWe're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us aboveDance me to the end of loveDance me to the end of loveDance me to the children who are asking to be bornDance me through the curtains that our kisses have outwornRaise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is tornDance me to the end of loveDance me to your beauty with a burning violinDance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely inTouch me with your naked hand or touch me with your gloveDance me to the end of loveDance me to the end of loveDance me to the end of love",2,12,
7,Peter Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/1/2017,Awful level of service. You might be asked to get out JUST because you aren't buying cocktails for girls. Paying for their overpriced cocktails doesn't seem enough for them!!!! All they want is YOUR MONEY.  Their general manager doesn't know how to run the successful business and make customers happy. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND this place for any kind of activity!!!,2,2,
8,Silvino P.,"Manhattan, NY",415,136,824,5.0,10/19/2015,Everyone that complains must not be from New York City with no money. Best strip club for your buck in Manhattan. Why come to a strip club and not expect to spend? There's always about 25 girls when I go(ask) and all the girls are in shape and real hot! This isn't your average southern or Jersey strip club..the girls are young and pretty and its Manhattan so you are expecting a higher class clientele here. Had fun every single time,3,2,4
9,Marina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,3,1.0,11/28/2016,Stay away from this place ! Management not professional and very rude ! Especially Brent Darren ! Avoid at all cost !,5,3,
10,Nadun J.,"Manhattan, NY",37,2,0,1.0,4/11/2016,"Long story short, save your time and money and just avoid this place period. The girls were terrible at doing what they do and the drinks are extremely overpriced.",2,1,
11,Davis J.,"Chicago, IL",540,426,259,3.0,9/23/2013,"Meh...I think this place would be better if they learned to love who they are instead of trying to be something they are not.NEWS FLASH: you are a sleazy/middle of the road strip club (which is okay). Sometimes a little sleaze is all you need.Nothing special, girls with daddy problems, overpriced drinks and crappy dances.Now don't get me wrong, I love a good strip club but after seeing whats going on here I am dissappointed. NOTE: If you show up to a club with 12+ guys during a bachelor party, it is common practice to NOT charge them covers. OBSERVATION: The girls were clearly in need of both cash and drugs.GIST: All in all, this place is tiny, awkward and will likely never be a 4 star club.",11,11,6
12,Shenel M.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,35,26,1.0,6/16/2013,"Ugh, where do i begin?It was going pretty okay at first. My best friend and I sat in front of the stage, which we were pretty excited about. The girls however, seemed quite lazy and out of it. I don't know if it was because they've been dancing all day or what, but there was no energy or enthusiasm what so ever. The waitress came and we each ordered a drink and paid separately on our credit cards. She came back with the receipt (drinks were very expensive, btw). I tipped her, but she insisted that I should tip more. That got my pretty upset, so I told her no, which she then preceded to argue with me. She did the same thing to my friend, but their argument was a little more heated.Anyway, we left after about 30min because the dancers were kind of boring except for the ONE stripper who actually knew how to work the pole. The next day, I get a text from my best friend saying this club charged $200 on her card. WTF!?!?!?We went back to the club the next day and they said it was just a pre-charge they put on the card when someone opens a tab to make sure that person has money. This was odd because when the waitress asked us, we specifically said we will not be opening a tab. And if she had opened a tab anyway, she should've told us a charge that large would be temporarily placed.  I think that should be something you would notify all customers.I WILL NOT BE ATTENDING THIS PLACE AGAIN.",15,3,
13,Heather P.,"New York, NY",5,29,4,2.0,7/7/2013,"Daisy is horrible and will scream at you as you are getting dances.  If you aren't getting dances from one of her friends, she does not want that girl to make money.Pros: girls are prettyCons: uncomfortable environment",4,2,3
14,Mike W.,"Annandale, VA",0,140,19,1.0,10/22/2014,"This place epitomizes the sleazy strip club stereotype.  The place is generally dingy, the girls look unhappy and can't dance to save their lives.  The seating is shitty and cramped with the horrible lap dances happening on bench seating along a wall. The waitresses and hostesses were pushy about tips and were scamming for drinks all night.  The whole scene was so bad that I went into the adjacent bar room to drink until my buddies were done. I love strip clubs but this place was just really really low rent.",7,2,
15,David J.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",30,2,0,1.0,3/27/2015,"Charged twice even though I paid cash, the first time, sleazy scum bag place I will never visit twice unless I have singles on me",1,1,
16,Annie R.,"Haymarket, VA",0,9,12,1.0,5/8/2014,"THE WORST EVER!! Do yourself a favor and just don't ok! Not even sure where to start, maybe the fact that they charged me and being a female I think is just wrong. I never pay to go in with my boyfriend and I'm not gonna start because I'm in NYC! Well we get in and what a dissapointment. I came close to asking if I was being punked. The 4-5 girls I did see were either to drunk to stand or just nothing at all to look at. There was one Asian girl I wanted to try and wait around and see if she was at least worth the cover charge but I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave! We had to buy a drink with our cover so ok 2 mixed drinks that tasted like shit and a water $47!!!!! Never never never again and I hope this review stops others from wasting their time and money. We chugged our crappy over priced drinks and made it down the street to Diamond club where we had the best time ever :) Private Eye owners you should be ashamed of yourselves and rethink your whole business ASAP.",6,3,3
17,Ary A.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,40,53,2.0,12/9/2012,"Happened to visit the establishment on a rainy night with not much in store to do. Frankly, would not go back. The drinks are overpriced.The atmosphere is pushy and a bit unpleasant.Strippers are old. No tricks in store. Cheesy pick up lines to get lap dances. We stayed for approximately 30 minutes and left.",3,,
18,Louis R.,"Jersey City, NJ",2299,2044,801,4.0,1/10/2012,"Nah, I'm not a fan of welfare.  I don't want my cabbage going to chickenheads with 12 kids, no husbands, no jobs, no motivation...ESPECIALLY if they have a nice rack, thick thighs, a scar-less face and a round bottom.Bitch, get ya ass on the stage and shake them thangs for mah wad of singles.  Wanna eat? Wanna feed ya rug rats? Wanna get high (you know that's the bait)? Then, climb on that dirty ass pole and slide on down.This spot has a wealth of international talent.  Its not one of the high-end joints with all the bells and whistles but its clean enough and I even saw some normal looking couples mingling with the ""employees"". The cover charge and drink prices are still steep but in order to stifle your cognitive senses and forget what your mom told you about these places, ya gotz ta get drunk.Yea, I'm a big fan of workfare.",6,25,7
19,Richard M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,39,0,1.0,1/30/2015,"Manhattans answer to fatass bouncers, scum bucket bartenders and pancake/flat titty cellulite thigh dancers.

Updated review","3 out of 7 or 8 girls were okay, most were friendly. The crazy thing is that they have charges left and right, literally milk you for your money, completely ruins the mood you don't even wanna spend on the girls. $20 cover charge, they require you to check in your jacket, backpack etc for $3 each, a beer is $11, drinks are $14, they require one drink per person, there's a minimum $30 charge on your credit card so don't close it out after your first round. And no ATM, although the one that is a block away supposedly only had a $3 withdrawal fee which isn't too bad.",1,1,
21,Max R.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",2,41,0,2.0,7/15/2013,Kind of in a trashy area. Some of the girls are nice. There's a cute Japanese girl working there. Haven't been in several years. One of those places you go to once ... then never go back to. I made the mistake of going here twice thinking it would get better. /sigh,2,2,
22,Archie R.,"Moss Beach, CA",895,695,12,1.0,11/17/2008,"Dear Stripper, I am writing this letter to let you know that you were very special to me growing up.  I mean, at age 18, you showed me what a real grown woman looks like.  Up until that time, my only experience was with girls my own age.  You introduced me to that beautiful ""stripper smell"" and over permed hair.  You showed me that even on Wednesday afternoons, crappy buffets and boobs really do go hand in hand.You showed me that women getting lap dances from women is 10000x better than actually getting my own lap dance.I'll admit, in my earlier years, I bought into what you were selling.But today, I am going to have to break up with you forever.  To be honest, this can't be a big surprise to you.  We've been on the rocks for the past 5 years.  It's not you, it's me.Well, it's both.Well, then again, it actually is you.Don't be sad though, you'll have plenty of company.  I mean, the dude sitting in the front row wearing purple sweatpants and a red velvet shirt will always be willing to part with $1.The overweight swinging couple will always get the 2-for-1 lap dance special.The 14 dudes with the bachelor party  will all pitch in $5 to send their buddy into the champagne room for an overpriced bottle of Korbel and your fascinating stories about one day opening a boutique clothing store.You will forget about me, especially when the DJ yells out, for the 150th time of the evening ""Ok guys let's welcome to the center stage CANDY CANDY CANDY!!  Don't forget $20 lap dances!!  CANDY CANDY!!  Marissa to the left stage please.""I suppose this could be considered as racist, or sexist, or even strippist, but I just don't like your kind anymore.  So, here's to your little white purse filled with fecal saturated $1 bills, your $25 dollar vodka tonics, and your custom branded matchbooks that have, on more than one occasion, gotten me into trouble.I am moving on to greener pastures.  I am sticking with the real thing.That is, until a group of actresses ask me to join them at Sapphire in Vegas again.Until then, keep on keepin' on.-ArchieP.S.Glitter.",13,61,22
23,Andy L.,"Forest Hills, NY",65,24,11,4.0,7/29/2007,"I noticed that no guys have written reviews of strip clubs (at least not the Yelpers I know so far; I've also only been Yelping for a month). That's weird. Any man who likes sex, and/or has looked at porn, and/or masturbates has been to a strip club at least once. And don't deny ever doing any of these things you stinking liars. Stop being such pansies and write about it! Inquiring minds want to know!! Namely myself, hahaha.Private Eyes is one of the smallest strip clubs I've ever been to. In fact, my friend and I completely missed the front door when we walked by. The entrance first leads to a ""regular"" bar area, where there is a stripper pole, but the dancer is dressed. Obviously, there were no patrons sitting in this area. Off we went to find some naked chicks! In front of a hallway, sat a ""doorman"" who charged $15 for us to enter; there is also a minimum two drink requirement. The hallway led to another room, about the same size as the first bar, but had a 2-pole stage with seats all around, a couple of tables, and leather couches all along the along the 4 walls.My buddy and I grabbed two seats next to the stage, and proceeded forking out singles, mainly to the dancers who actually talked to us. These were the same girls who were friendly enough to come sit with us later and have a real (if mostly fluffed up) conversation. And these were the same girls who we eventually got lap dances from. Hey, why would we get dances from someone who isn't friendly? Well, I did, from one dancer who was smoking hot. Too bad she had smoker's breath (yech), and she didn't even dance the whole song. Booooo.But I still give this place 4 stars because of the friendly women. They are relatively attractive, and there's a wide range of physiques, from thin/petite types, to super-buxom fake-o-rama mamas. Drinks are decently priced, and lap dances are $20 a go. If you're feeling like a high roller, you can pay $400 for a 1 hour private session in the ""Champagne Room"". One dancer told us that the privacy gets you very close attention, ""anything except sex"" in her words. Use your imagination to define ""anything"". I certainly did. =P",13,20,9
24,Jerry H.,"New York, NY",1,22,0,1.0,3/8/2012,WORST STRIP CLUB IN ALL OF MANHATTAN! And beware of the homosexual security guards whenever they I.D. you at the front door.,1,,1
25,James F.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,295,280,4.0,4/6/2009,"i could lie. put the blame on peer pressure, excessive drinking, or raw hedonism. i could say i do it for my buddies, but i don't enjoy it myself. there 's an element of truth in the above, but there is one, primary reason i go to strip clubs: FOR HUMANITY. from all over the country, all over the world, women, faced with cost of living in one of the world's most expensive cities, become exotic dancers. being naked, being judged, lusted after and loathed, in many cases hiding the truth from family and friends, all in pursuit of their american dream. not an easy life. as a caring human how can I not help? what would any good citizen do? WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?? as strip clubs go Private Eyes would probably be considered mid- level. you won't see porn stars, smoke machines, hot buffets or pro athletes here but you also won't see drug dealing or prostitution. c-shaped stage, multicolored lights, poles and mirrors everywhere, the decor screams generic movie set strip club. while the clientele is largely male, female patrons should feel safe here as i have seen women, either as part of a couple or in the company of a group of guys, in attendance. the main draw of a strip club is the women, and while taste is highly subjective, i'm a fan. if you prefer the pam anderson/vegas show girl type this probably isn't the place for you. silicon here seems to be the exception, not the rule. the women here are attractive and quite diverse, ethnically and in terms of body types. don't worry you won't see excessive cellulite, stretch marks or bullet wounds. it's just not a peroxide blond double d-cup wonderland. yes there's always that one overly aggressive girl that you tip in hopes that she will go away but most are quite cool and personable. whether it's the pleasant smile after giving $1 tip or the hug after $20 lap dance it actually feels good giving them your money. while not as expensive as most strip clubs, a night at Private Eyes won't be cheap. cover runs $15 with mandatory $3 coat check. this is not a place for heavy drinking as an amstel light will run you $11. then there's tips, and lap dances. i wouldn't go in with less than $100, and realistically expect to drop $150-$250. don't believe Chris Rock? want to see what's behind the curtain? a trip to the champagne room will set you back $500. (i have yet to partake, but send me $497 and i gladly go and update my review) while i enjoy playing the role of benefactor, until i get corporate sponsorship or the IRS recognizes my spending here as charitable donations i will be just an occasional visitor. neither deviant nor pervert, not healer, or samaritan, just an average guy doing what i can, to make the world a better place-- $1.00 at a time.",19,41,20
26,Nicholas R.,"Las Vegas, NV",226,184,91,3.0,7/18/2008,"Being from Las Vegas this club had a lot to try to compare to. Their ratings on the wall from 2002 stated they were a hells angel strip club, and after party spot for broadway. When you step in the door there's a 15.00 cover and a bar with no girls. the girls are hiding inside where they work hard to try to get tips. Remember folks 'no sex in the champagne room', with the 545.00/hr pricetag which did not include champagne.",5,2,
27,Jim S.,"Withams, VA",0,2,0,1.0,6/6/2013,"Drinks were really overpriced,  some of the girls looked nasty.    The worst part is the staff there seemingly used carbon copy credit card slip""magic"" to magically have incorrect dollar amounts be charged to your credit card by shifting the the .00 cents into the dollar column to increase the charge amount by 100 times.   They also fill in their own TIP amount without your approval -- watch out there also.   They never provide the point-of-sales terminal receipts for your signature or to see the charge legitably rather than faint handwriting.   They also make it a point not to write any description on the carbon copy receipt so you would be aware they are charging you $2000 for ?!? who knows what instead of for two beers.     With the ownership/mgt. it only goes down hill further after that -  won't say what happens there it only get's worse.   Guys watch out -- leave your credit card at home when you enter this place or you will regret it as it seems there may be a finely-honed scam.    BEWARE.",2,,
28,John K.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,20,0,2.0,2/5/2009,"I was in midtown w/ a friend in town on business and after dinner and more than a few drinks we decided that there isn't a better way to spend a Wednesday night than at the strip club. It isn't too over priced for a strip club, but the quality of women doesn't even come close to the amount it costs, even for the Wednesday night JV squad. Not terrible, but not great either.",2,,
29,Chris B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,7/29/2008,"I guess this was a slow night at private eyes.  There was a ton of girls and not so many guys.  I've been a few times here and some other clubs but is seems that with slim pickins for lap dances and less of a shot at getting a guy to forkout 4 bills for a champagne lounge experience, the hustle rating gets a bit higher.  Well a desparate stripper is an enthusiastic stripper so off we go to the champagne lounge !.   The room is very dimly lit, seem space enough for about 8 well spaced couples (pun intended).  as it happened we were alone except for the somewhat discrete but ever present monitor.  My lady friend says shes pretty cool though if you throw a few bucks in her direction !.    With entry and tips and drinks, $500 don't get what it used to.  Four stars though, the girls look good and are for the most part friendly, beers are $10 and a $15 cover.  Save the champagne lounge price and have 40 more beers instead !The bartender is sweet, tip her well.",,,
