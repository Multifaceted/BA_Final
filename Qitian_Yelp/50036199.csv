0,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",752,1658,15061,5.0,10/6/2018,"Nomo Soho was an excellent experience! Here's why:1) Location: It's in Soho, a trendy neighborhood, close to several major subway stops. It's two blocks from my favorite breakfast spot (Kam Hing Coffee Shop in Chinatown making fresh sponge cake every morning). If you're a runner, it's a short jog to a long running path along the Hudson River. 2) Space: It's beautiful. It's cool. Every space is beautifully designed from the grand entrance to the lobby to the rooms (think lots of blue for the room).3) Rooms: For NYC, they felt more spacious. The bathrooms are large with a well pressured shower and enough storage for all your things.4) Staff: Despite having a more pretentious brand, they come across friendly.5) Price: For as nice as it is, they could up their price more. It's reasonable and you can always find a deal online.I'd stay here again if it was just me and/or my wife and I in NYC. A baby may feel out of place.",3,,1
1,Gretchen J.,"Denver, CO",11,24,1,2.0,11/4/2018,Pros:  lovely bartender (Conor) and beautiful entry and outdoor area. Cons: extremely small rooms.  Decor is lackluster and poorly executed. Wouldn't stay here again.,,,
2,Tim N.,"Orange County, CA",11,57,42,1.0,10/6/2018,"Really....So disappointed with this hotel. $800/night per room and we get view of a parking lot?No thank you.Booked a package two rooms with breakfast. Showed up to checkin we are told only continental breakfast included no regular breakfast or brunch. Had to negotiate breakfast lmfao. And you know what was the kicker? When I said to the front desk manager the NoMo SoHo website did not specify that the breakfast was continental he sarcastically said ""ok we'll have thw digital team update it.""Keep in mind that the package I booked was about $300-400 more expensive than a regular king because it was supposed to come with a room upgrade and breakfast. They ended up offering me $28/pp breakfast and no room upgrade. Tell me how this is fair?Shame on you. I cancelled 2 remaining nights....and booked W Time Square ....my friend salso cancelled their room as well. I have never been so mistreated. W has better view n cheaper. Adios amigos. General manager needs to know whats going on.",1,1,
3,Samma L.,"West Islip, NY",299,51,20,4.0,9/27/2018,"Came here for a friends birthday and had a great time. The weather was perfect and the outdoor seating was much appreciated. The entry is really cool and we all took photos in it. I got a salad which was great, just a heaping amount of dressing. I got a rosé cider which was really sweet which I liked!My friends got the huge $50 drink that was on fire. I personally would never pay that much for alcohol but the special effects were cool to look at. We made a reservation and the place wasn't too crowded for a Friday night. Saw a lot of large groups overall. Service was really great!",1,,

The views alone sell me on this spot. The bar downstairs is so nice, hipster in the best of ways. I got a drink out of a gold topped pineapple, so I'm pretty happy. I'd highly recommend this beautiful hotel, especially if you're here for the gram!",1,1,2

The food was super delicious too... double whammy. The rooms are on the smaller side but that's nyc for you. They were all white and I loved the floor to ceiling glass windows in the room. I spent most of my time starring out the window at the sights. The dude bar was great and the cocktail with green yogurt was superb. Can't wait to come back to this place.,,,2

7,Kathy L.,"Chicago, IL",120,79,20,1.0,8/28/2018,So..... for my boyfriends birthday i decided to take him to NYC for a change of pace.  I normally stay at the Plaza or the four seasons but i wanted him to experience a different feel. Wrong choice for accomadations and i was so embarrassed!  There is nothing worse than looking forward to a wonderful time and where you are staying ruins it!  Thank god he loves me lol!We checked in and the man at the front desk had a major attitude and was extremley arrogant.  It didn't bother me it bored me.  We upgraded to a king suite and i was not impressed whatsoever!  The design is bizzare and the uttilization of space was not properly done.  As we all know square footage is extremley limited in NYC but why would you put bulky furniture in a small space?  There was no art work on the walls and you have to call for ice every time you need it.  Again it just makes no sense at all.  And they had a chair directly underneath the television that was mounted on the wall so you will hit your head when you get up.The ac went out in the front room so the temperature in our room was not acceptable our entire stay and when we alerted the staff they took there time getting up to the room with the mechanic.  At one point the front room was 87 degrees.  They were unable to fix the heating issue and they were sold out so they offered to refund us the difference for a regular room with turned out to be 100 dollars per night.  We had to keep the pocket door closed in the bedroom in order to have some kind of relief from the heat.  I went into to change and shut the door and was unable to get out and when i went to use the phone to call down to the desk they didn't answer.  When they finaly answered they told me they were extremely busy and would send someone up when they had a chance.  30 minutes later someone came in and let me out and told us that it happens on a regular bases.  And proceed to tell us how to fix it....... REALLY?   The front desk offers us brunch the day we checked out and gave us a late checkout for the last and final problem.  All i wanted was to leave and check in to another hotel and try to salvage his birthday.  we went to brunch and they announced out load in front of many people that it was being comped   How embarrassing!  We left and went to the Fredrick hotel that was amazing!!!!! To add insult to the injury.....come to find out they charged us for the brunch and never took the fees off that were promised and added hidden charges to my card that i was unaware of.  When i called to address the issues i was hung up on and i had to call them for three days before i had some one actually listen to me.  Andrew was somewhat understanding and was trying to fix things as much as he could.  The entry way is gorgeous...... my advice stop there and take a selfie and stay else where!,6,3,
8,Kenya G.,"Pacifica, CA",0,8,2,1.0,8/26/2018,This hotel has boutique vibes and is a great place to take pictures on the outside. Unfortunately I found a bug in my bed and was told that this was what happens because they have windows open and the location. For the price I paid there really was no excuse to have bugs there. In addition to that there was no follow up or accommodations. The walls our paper thin and you can see directly under some doors into the room especially the room I stayed in. So it felt very unsafe. The walls were so thin I could hear when my coworker left and said bye through the door. Other then all this there are some great genuine people who work here other then the front desk attendant and manager I talked too.,5,,
9,Dan K.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",152,275,22,3.0,8/11/2018,"Very Trendy hotel in Soho. Stayed here on a Friday with a great rate from Hotels Tonight. My take is that its nothing special, room was very small but within NYC standards. Bed was not super comfortable and the air conditioning blew right on top of your head which was a bad design. The staff does smile but not very welcoming mostly seen on cell phones and chatting it up amongst each other.Probably my biggest issue is they charge an access fee which is suppose  cover to coffee , the gym and internet.  Are you serious?. Every hotel I have stayed at in nyc over the past year includes all those items in the rate. This is probably not a hotel I  would return to when given a choice",2,,

Updated review","And the best Hotel Reward goes to ... Nomo Soho !!!!!!It was a love at first sight , From the first moment I arrived to the day I left .The entrance is so adorable , I felt like a princess in a magical garden stepping into my kingdom . The smell in the lobby was extraordinary ! I wanted to sit there and stay for the all day . The rooms are fabalous , stylish and designed tastefully . The view is one of a kind and the vibes were so good . Breakfast was yummie , i never tasted pancakes until I tried their Ricota pancakes - it's a must ! The staff are so nice too , very polite and always smile .The resturant - Nomo Soho kitchen is designed so good that I couldn't stop taking pictures lol .Anthony the manager was so nice ans helpful ! I didn't want to leave !!!! This hotel is one of the best hotels in NYC and this is my hotel to go if I want to spoil myself .Super Highly recommended !!!!!",7,3,4
11,Chris M.,"Denver, CO",246,58,42,5.0,8/23/2018,"I stayed at Nomo SoHo earlier this week for just one night. The location is great if you're looking for a downtown vibe versus stuffy uptown. The receptionists were courteous and the pineapple and cinnamon infused water was a great refresher!19 floors later I'm in love. The sapphire blue everywhere contrasted with the shiny white was stunning! The room was super clean and it smelled amazing just like the rest of the hotel. The layout is strategic and functional. The bathroom is very clean with great water pressure and a view from IN the bathroom!After going out all night, I came back to a complimentary bottle of bubbly chilling on the sink as well. I was squealing with joy at 3 am!!Next time I go to NYC, business or personal, I will do everything in my power to try and stay at Nomo SoHo again!",,,
12,Marcin G.,"Queens, NY",40,93,370,4.0,8/23/2018,"Awesome hotel, awesome stay! From the entrance to the Front Desk service, to the public areas and the guest rooms, this was an awesome and affordable stay in NYC. The hotel is very stylish, although I hate the sofas and other seating options in the lobby. There's a game room and a second floor ""chill"" area. The room was a great size for NYC standards, very stylish and super clean. Staff was super amazing and friendly, except for the overnight Front Desk. I asked for an iPhone charger (to borrow or purchase) and he offered to use his personal charger to charge my phone at the desk, for a price. I'm sure the management team isn't aware of this extra service being offered.",,,
13,Erik S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",41,1,0,1.0,8/25/2018,"READ ME! Please note if you want one ounce of privacy this is not the hotel for you. The walls are paper thin and you can literally hear your neighbor clearly while they are having multiple sex sessions loudly! I don't care what people do in their own rooms, but does it need to be in my ear? The hallway conversations are crystal clear as well! The doors on the rooms have a one inch gap on the bottom of the door which does not help at all. You are not even able to have a private phone conversation without it carrying into the hallway. All the rooms are designed this way as I was informed by management. I have spent well over 2k staying here for the week. I called to complain about the noise and they offered me breakfast! Really? Also the lack of choices on the room service menu. Sad. I travel for a living around the globe and have stayed at thousands of hotels and could not have been more uncomfortable and disgusted. I don't mind a small room, however make it as comfortable as possible. This is not a 4 Star accommodation and we booked so many rooms for this week at this hotel and we were all severely disappointed. Do yourself a favor, stay at another property.",6,2,2

16,Christine W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,41,3,2.0,3/11/2018,"Rooms are cute and thats is about itStaff- terrible. How is there no one at the front desk for over 5 minutes. Then when the male worker arrived from behind the wall he didn't even think to greet me. It went to the other side of the very long reception desk and says ""how may I help you"". The workers are simply too young and inexperience. Ruins the entire hotel.  Food- laughable. I paid $19.00 for a burger thru room service and there was no meat. When I called to complain the person who picked up the phone says""thank you for calling"". Then she sent the waiter back up to return his tip .. what? That was her solutions. Of course I didn't take it back as it wasn't his fault. wake up call:  I asked for a 4:30am wake up call. I was concerned my phone battery wouldn't last thru the night and this was my back up. No call. They just didn't do it. Fees:  it's a complete scam The first thing I did the next day when I arrived back at the office was asked to have this hotel removed from our hotel directory You should be ashamed",3,1,1
17,Sierra R.,"Alameda, CA",382,267,487,5.0,8/7/2017,"This is hands down the bougiest of bougie places I've ever stayed at....and truth be told: I loved every minute of it. Lol.I was in NY for a work trip and booked a room here as my colleague was also staying here. I'm not a native New Yorker so I happily booked where they were staying. Considering I am from the Bay Area, I'm a-okay with using public transit so I took the subway from Midtown to SoHo. I walked by the place a few times all kinds of frustrated because I kept passing it. Yo, it's the place with the gates, flowers/vines on the gates, a patio, and a LONG walkway to enter.The registration/check-in is on the second floor. There's pink neon lights to show the stairs or to the elevators. I opted for the latter since I was in heels and sweaty.Holy cow...so. much. powder. blue.I went up to my room and the hallways are blue. Like not navy. Not bright blue. A slight powder blue. Unique.Then I came to my room. I typically stay at Hiltons because I'm a Hilton Honors member. I was shocked to see cut glass sitting out, wine, AND a mini fridge that actually contained food and drinks. Knock me over with a feather. The blue also continued as the ceiling was blue. Your soap, shampoo, etc., the most hipster thing I've ever seen. They also offer complementary coffee in the mornings. As a coffee drinker, I likey a lot.I did appreciate that there were plenty of tv stations available when I needed to unwind. I also liked the steady wifi. Since I was there for work, that was important. It's also near several subway stations but I think most places in this part of NY are near transit.So yeah, I would stay there again",7,5,7
18,Jesse C.,"Staten Island, NY",36,46,15,3.0,3/27/2018,"Trendy, ambiance is ok, rooms are too tiny. The space isn't designed well like say the Dream or NoMad, therefore it does not get rated like them. The Crosby Suite is good, but not worth the price... other rooms are done better.The hotel staff is extremely acommodating and that made me feel better about my room situation. I feel like good service is forgotten in reviews and I will not forget Monique at the front desk -- helpful and she remembered me every time I was here. I also got great treatment at NoMo's kitchen and bar during my stay.Good bathroom amenities, the room could've used an alarm clock/speaker duo. The views are solid and the entrance of the hotel should have a greeter because of how many people are taking photos by the, well, picturesque opening. It really is a beautiful summer spot and NoMo kitchen is as beautiful in the summer as it is during a snowy winter or rainy day.Would stay here again... maybe the overpriced penthouse suite, but not really... ha... Not worth the price but it has to be magnificent from what it looked like. Front desk could use more of a WOW factor, a little too subtle and doesn't quite fit the vibe",2,,

I thought the hotel was absolutely gorgeous and full of that NY swag style. The entrance is stunning, and when you walk in, the air is diffused with a gardenia smell. (After a while, that does get a bit old, but it was nice at first.)The rooms are very nice, pretty much the smallest hotel room I've ever been in, but nice nonetheless. I must admit though, it was a little hard to sleep at night from all the ""street noise."" (Garbage trucks running at 2AM, lights, etc.) So that was a bit of a challenge for me. Overall, it was an amazing stay. However, this hotel is extremely pricey and I would've never stayed here in a million years if it wasn't on my companies dime. I absolutely loved it, though.",4,1,

Room is in serene blue-and-white color scheme, lots of mirrored surfaces. Bathroom is in marbles, stocked with Molton Brown toiletries.

27,Naomi M.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",319,25,52,5.0,9/20/2017,"At first I was really excited to stay here when I found it on Hoteltonight. It was a great deal and I'd had friends raving about the overall vibe and the restaurant onsite. But when I came on Yelp and saw such mixed reviews that changed to being a bit nervous.Luckily, I seem to be one that had nothing but a great experience. (Although I will say the lady in front of me at checkin would probably have a different opinion based on the tone of her conversation)We checked in and were greeted by a super friendly guy, contrary to some other Yelpers' experiences, who asked us about our trip, gave us some recommendations based on the things we wanted to do and really put me at ease about being there (I wondered if they were trying to improve their reviews because he really went above and beyond for us and was just so darn nice! But that could be my projection because I was paying attention to everything.)We got to our room and it was beautiful. Soft blue decor with white and silver accents made it feel really peaceful and clean, and while the space was small in comparison to other areas, it was really comfortable for being in NYC. Plus the location is super convenient, close to Canal St. Station and also great for walking too.We dropped our bags and ran out the door to explore for the afternoon and when we came back we had a bottle of champagne in our room (I'd been asked if we were celebrating a special occasion at checkin so while we were out they'd written us a letter wishing us congratulations, and left the bottle on the counter) I doubt that's a standard thing but a nice touch.Any time I had a question I'd either call down or ask the concierge and the staff were really helpful. We actually didn't end up eating at the restaurant on site but it was really beautiful and I did grab a tea and sit on the front garden patio. As someone else mentioned it is a bit boujee and definitely has a young vibe but I loved every second of it. And it's definitely Instragram friendly so be prepared for some great picture opportunities ;-)Overall, my experience was beyond great and I'd definitely recommend it.",2,,

The hotel is nottttt happening! The king rooms are so small that I couldn't lay my suitcase flat, and left with bruised shins from the bed frame. I'm not a ballerina but I'm not an oaf! The front desk staff is really struggling. This hotel group should be able to hire some folks who know how to communicate properly with guests. They were so rude to multiple members of our party, and while we were commiserating about the treatment, a couple strangers even CHIMED IN and agreed! Here's the dumb and dumber aspect of the situation -- Despite paying $$$ for a 3pm checkout, they woke me up (jet lag) by entering my room 3 times between 11-2. They did not let me get the sleep I needed. I was rushing to hide in the bathroom because I wasn't dressed, and specifically asked them to please refer to my reservation and leave me be. Eventually I called down, connected with the manager, and he was mind-numbingly condescending and rude. Good thing I wasn't in a mood, and I was just completely amused at the unprofessionalism and personally affected attitude. Finally our travel agent (large group) called and triple-confirmed our late check out, and finally the manager called at 2:30 to confirm ""you have a 3:00 checkout"" --- Yes.... I know....

30,Kent L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,0,1.0,9/22/2018,"Stayed here from September 15-22. In town for the week from San Francisco for my birthday. We have stayed in some of the nicest hotels around the world and this was not one of them. 23rd floor view was great but that's when the great part ends. Room was pretty small with no dresser. It had a pedestal bed with tiny drawers underneath the bed. AC blows directly onto the bed. Shower leaks water onto bathroom floor. Poorly designed room. Could have easily designed a much better space. Remove the broken drapes and put in Shade store blinds and pick up a foot of space along both sides of room. Bath products subpar. All had flowery fragrances. Now onto the main issue. After coming and going for week not one doorman opened the door, and 99% of the time didn't acknowledge us as we walked in. And there was almost always at least two if not three at the door. I guess they were too busy chatting with their fellow employees. Now onto the front desk. Same thing except instead of standing the front desk employees sit on the counter behind the front desk since they don't have a chair. If there were two one was on the counter and both on their cells or chatting with each other. Always far too busy to greet us or acknowledge us. Management, is this how you want the front of your hotel to be represented?? The front of the house carries the image of your brand. The total vibe is your staff could care less about the guests and are completely disinterested in doing a good job. Isn't a doorman's job to greet and open the door? The front desk agents to greet, ask how the guests are doing and can they be of any help? I mean this the most basic hotel training 101 as it gets. We've had 10 times better experiences at the most inexpensive simple hotels then at the NOMO. Maybe it should be the NOSHOW as in the staff was a NOSHOW to do their job everyday. Was not worth even close to what we paid. Really sad when the rest of our encounters with NY store & restaurant employees in SOHO, Tribeca, Chelsea, etc was so enjoyable and the place we decided to stay carried such a negative atmosphere. Won't be back or recommend the NOSHOW for sure.",2,,

We switched rooms three times... first room had a broken bathroom door, second room had no AC and the room temperature was 87 with a side of a bug on the ceiling, and lastly ALL the rooms are the size of a cubicle. Also, the hotel engineer told us to close ALL the blinds off in the room in order for it to cool back down from 87. The bathrooms are super old and molding as the days go by. The staff members were super rude. Oh and  don't expect anyone to bring you towels or other condiments after 11 o clock. They don't pick up the phone at that time and they stop delivering such things. The food at the nomo kitchen was mediocre, super over hyped. The waiters don't check on you at all, nor do they care. HIGHLY recommend staying at another hotel in SoHo! this one is by far the worst. Also my second night at the hotel I noticed I had bug bites on my leg... come to realize they're from the hotel...

Hell in the city it's only natural to pay a premium, but be up front about it. Want hot water with that shower? $25/day amenity fee. Oh, there are two of you staying in the room, well if you want another pair of slippers or a bathrobe that'll be another $25 amenity fee. And yeah, that ""free"" coffee and wi-fi we advertise on our own website, well actually when we see ""free"" we mean $25 amenity fee. The most frustrating part about it (other than that you CANNOT opt out), you literally don't find out about it until you are checking out. They covertly sneak the fee on at the very end of your stay.Other than that though, a very cool hotel. Great views, helpful staff and in the middle of everything you want in the city.

When I booked with Hotels.com, my invoice said I would pay $208.30 upon checkout. When it came time, my bill was for $235. When I challenged the figure, I was told to call management to dispute anything. After digging into the matter, I found I was charged a $25 amenities fee which covered use of the gym, a copy of the NY Times (if I asked for it), and coffee in the lobby. The only thing I used was the coffee- which I assumed was complementary. So basically, I paid $25 for two cups of coffee in the morning. What a rip off. That's a sleazy money grab in my book. We could have had breakfast at a diner for that money- with complementary coffee.",5,,

The Queen suite was a fair size (for NYC) and had unbelievable views through the floor to ceiling windows in both the bedroom and living room (21st floor).  Only small issue we had was we had three people and over our 4 night stay had to continue to ask for an extra set of towels.  Not too bad!  Would absolutely stay again-- Soho, TriBeCa, Little Italy, Financial District and Brooklyn Bridge friendly.  You're missing out if you stay in midtown-- downtown is far superior.  Even for a family.",,,

We thought they were mosquito bites but we came home and went to the doctors and they ended up being BED BUGS! Had to get hydrocortisone cream and medicine for the bites and we told hot wire and Hotwire had us speak to hotel management and the manager said If we remove our review he would refund us for the stay and apologized and after the reviews were gone he said I can do one night LOL! My doctors office charged me $150 ALONE for my visit and I threw away all the clothes that were in their bed storage and this manager tells me ONE night he would comp after the reviews got removed GO FIGURE.

Basically don't stay in the hotel.Agree with Anthony K, but for a different reason: I don't know what has happened to these people in the past, but basically they will try to place a hold on your card for over $1000 (regardless of the sum of the actual transaction) the next day, and if you have your bank block it they will call and visit your room every night throughout your stay to make sure you're still there. So much for paying for a good night's rest.No one from my company or its associates will ever stay here again.That being said, I got drunkenass in midtown and left my phone in my cab and the hotel/cabbie made sure it got back to me, so points for that.",1,,

45,Crystal C.,"New York, NY",240,84,32,4.0,7/28/2017,"We decided to do a staycation here for July 4th weekend. There were flash deals for Expedia Gold members so we got a really good deal for the stay (2 days, 1 night).The hotel is chic and hip. Definitely attracted the younger crowd. Lots of tourists as well but surprisingly more on the chill side for a holiday weekend. The restaurant downstairs attracted a lot of foot traffic during the day but quiets down during the evening. We booked a corner room with a queen sized bed and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed. The view is gorgeous. The Freedom Tower was within view and so was the Empire State Building! We generally prefer darker color schemes for hotel rooms but this bright blue and white scheme was surprisingly pleasant. The room felt airy, clean, and open. Yes, the room was small but so are most standard NYC hotel rooms so it was not a surprise. The second best thing about the room was definitely the bathroom. A beautiful marble shower with a strong shower head plus a large window to maximum the view of the gorgeous downtown skyline! Also, I loved the selection of shampoo + conditioner, the same boutique brand found at Hotel Chandler. It smelled divine! The sink was located in the bedroom area and not inside the actual bathroom which wasn't a huge issue but the countertop provided little to no space for makeup and other toiletries. The mini fridge below was also quite small and provided no extra space if you wanted to cool a drink. And even if the mini bar did have extra space, it would not be able to cool drinks because the temperature was so high!We also had no problems ordering ice from the main desk. Yes, it would be nicer if there were just ice machines on each floor so you can get the ice yourself, but they were quick to give us a large bucket of ice in under 5 minutes after making the phone call.The only downside to the room were the thin curtains. They weren't doubled up and provided little to no shade from the sun. We woke up quite early even though we went out the night prior and had trouble sleeping in. We called the front desk for a late checkout due to this issue. The first time we called, the lady was quite rude and transferred the call to the manager but just dropped the call. But the second time we called back, a kind man allowed our request and was very sympathetic about it. We didn't have trouble otherwise checking in our out besides the one rude lady on the phone the first time.This hotel is such a gem with its prime location (close to Chinatown and right in the heart of SOHO) and beautiful view. I would definitely consider coming back for another staycation.",,,
46,Zak K.,"Lititz, PA",1,14,6,1.0,9/14/2017,"Looks posh from a distance, but disappointing at almost every turn especially given the price.When I checked in, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be good. Three other people/groups were being served before me and all of them needed to move rooms for one reason or another. One couple got checked into a room with the AC unit dismantled and strewn about. One guy couldn't get into his room at all. The third didn't have the king bed he booked. After watching this, when it got to my turn, I had little faith that I would get a good room on the first try.I should probably say at this point that I spend 25-40% of my year traveling for work, and I have requested a room change twice in the past five years - It's pretty hard to disappoint me. I got up to my room, and it had not been cleaned or made up since the previous guest checked out, so back down to the front desk I went. The apology okay, but it seems like their system for getting people into a room just sucks.On to the second room. It smelled like urine. It had been a long day of travel, so I said to myself ""whatever"" and kept it. As I said, I'm pretty easy. But seriously, for the price and given the premium vibe they are trying to evoke, they should not be putting people into rooms that smell like R. Kelly's red room. Could I have gone to the front desk and wait in lone again? Sure, but by then I had resigned myself to accept this as the best they could do. The view was nice enough, but the roof across the street has a big graffiti requesting ""TITS ON THE GLASS"". I know, this is outside the control of the Hotel, but seems somehow fitting.At one point my room card stopped working, so, back down to the front desk. They made me a new card, but that still didn't work, so back down to the front desk. they sent me back up to wait for security to let me.Three days later; time to check out. I never have incidental charges. Never. For a three day stay, I had $81 in amenity fees. When I asked what they were for, I got a vague answer involving coffee/tea and wifi (which they call complimentary when they tell you how to get on) and patio maintenance. I said ""I get what a resort fee is, but why is it being charges as an incidental after the fact?"" Then the condescension: ""well, in New York, that's how hotels are doing it now."" I responded that I stay in lots of hotels, and I don't ever see fees like this charged after the fact.Two days later, I was back in NY. Stayed at a Hilton Garden in SoHo. No; it wasn't super-luxe, but I got into my room with one try, the room was clean, and the charges were handled in an up-front adult manner. All for $100 less per night.",9,6,

48,Dallas G.,"Dallas, TX",179,13,5,1.0,2/27/2018,"Probably one of the WORST hotels I've ever stayed at. The room was a bit dusty upon arrival and the bathtub was a bit grimy around the outer corners. When I had requested house keeping, they never came even though the clean sign was on the door. When I requested housekeeping the second day around 3:00 pm, I was promised that they would come by right away. Never came. I was beyond annoyed so I ended up booking at another hotel when I came back to my hotel around 8 still dirty.Don't even get me started on the restaurant.. my god. I have never met such rude hostesses. I had made a reservation for 3 people. It was a girls get-together dinner and they were even off put by this experience. When it was time to be seated, we were told that there were no tables available, even though we had a reservation. 1 hour later my girlfriends ended up making separate reservations at the same restaurant to make sure we could get seated because they didn't seem to care about mine whatsoever even though there were open tables available. After having to check in with them every 15 minutes we finally got the manager to get us a table. The waitress we had was an absolute angel and was very apologetic about everything. She should become a hostess or something because of her wonderful people skills. Because the tall snobby hostess and the guy with the fake Rolex definitely need to learn some!

The good: Rooms are somewhat small but it's nyc so this didn't drive down my rating. Ours on the 17th floor smelled like bleach when we arrived, which in my opinion is great because it was clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. View was great too and we didn't have issues with noise around us. Concierge guy when you enter was also very helpful and nice. Location is great.The bad: regarding the room, the main issue was with housekeeping. No wash cloths, small but very inconvenient. We had to call and have some delivered.My beef was the the people. Only the concierge and bartender had redeeming qualities. Even the bellman had attitude and dropping bags with him (our room wasn't ready, it happens) was a mess and took longer than necessary. Half of the people in the lobby were waiting for him and jostling for his attention. He's popular but for the wrong reason: absolute inefficiency. The concierge was the one apologizing and asking us to wait. The restaurant: even more uncoordinated. We were seated for 15 minutes after attitude from one of the hostesses for Sunday brunch and nobody attended us. I gave the bartender a heads up to tell the manager and he did apologize. My wife spoke with the manager and the server overheard and actually had the audacity to blame us for not getting his attention. Use the concierge to recommend a different place. Front desk was OK, I had little interaction with them. Source: laid back dude that gives people the benefit of the doubt. If this place replaces the people with robots you'd get better service.

After waiting on line they walk you to the registration table, give you a flash key that contains your name to put over your designated spot for the tasting.  Before you got to taste both of the regular JW Black and JW Double Black, they give you a brief history of Johnnie Walker, how he started as owning a tea shop and became one of the pioneers of Scotch. They used nifty tricks to taste the different ingredients of both selections, as in just put a couple of drops of water to bring out the wooden taste of the JW Double Black or drop a few drops in your palms to smell the vanilla.

66,Christopher F.,"Ardenwood, Fremont, CA",0,1,4,4.0,7/3/2018,"On a recent trip to New York my little family and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Nomo Soho. The location was just amazing tucked away on Crosby street only a hop skip and a jump away from canal and surrounding Manhattan. Traveling with an 18 month old child is tough in New York to say the least. My little one was not able to run around and was confined to her stroller for almost the entire day. They had a little faux grassy area next to the lobby which was perfect for my daughter to stretch her legs. Even on Thursday and Friday when they were doing champagne events the staff was so amazingly hospitable and let my daughter run run run and play in the grassy area. The hospitality of he front desk team was amazing. The ONLY reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is the bell/valet staff. They were for whatever reasons extremely cocky and arrogant we arranged a car to take us to the airport. There was a ""miscommunication"" and there was no car booked for us at all. So we asked for if they could help us get a cab. The basically said at this time of day your not gonna get a cab no one will take you. Just call Uber it will cost you 100.00 but there's nothing we can do for you. Aside from that thank you Nomo for being so amazing!",,,

72,Joe M.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",81,6,4,1.0,12/12/2017,"I've had the misfortune of staying at NoMo SoHo although I was lucky it was only for one night.  I find it funny this hotel is part of the Preferred Hotel group which market chic boutique hotels under their brand.  It's rather ironic the NoMo SoHo is advertised as ""stay with us and Stay Relevant at SoHo's premier five-star property"" when the hotel forgets who you are once you pay for your stay.I contacted the hotel ahead of time about parking & was informed a valet attendant is situated outside to help patrons of the hotel. I wanted to clarify which entrance since the hotel can be accessed at two different entrances. I circled NoMo SoHo twice & did not see any attendant at either location.  Being a tourist the last thing anyone wants to be hampered with are parking infractions especially in Manhattan. I parked the car on Lafayette which apparently was the back of the hotel & searched for the valet attendant. After a few minutes I came across a gentleman who informed me he was the valet attendant & helped me with the luggage. The front desk is located one floor up (confused? The main lobby which I was at was elevated since the landscaped the area is not perfectly flat.Once I checked in I went to the room & the hallway on my floor has seen better days: the corners of the walls were chipped & battered.  The damage was so pronounced since the walls were in a vibrant Mediterranean blue & the chips were bone white. The room I had was spacious for the SoHo district of Manhattan. The water pressure was strong in the shower but the drainage in the sink was poor.  There was no separation between the shower & the rest of the bathroom which was tricky.  After taking a shower the water overspray/splash would migrate onto the whole bathroom floor which made navigating around tricky. Had I not brought my flip-flops I know I would have slipped in the bathroom. The decor was beautiful but the hotel needs repairs.It's not all that bad. The location is fabulous; right in the heart of SoHo. It's a great location which is perfect walking distance from everything you can imagine. Little Italy, all the small boutiques, all the shops on Broadway in SoHo, you name it it can be visited even during the sweltering heat of the summer. The hotel houses a cozy bar/lounge which is an oasis in the concrete jungle.My stay here was short as I stated earlier & I thought I'd make use of the complimentary coffee in hotel lobby but when I arrived at the specified time I was left with another hotel guest puzzled as to why the hotel would say coffee would be available but have not even an attendant to notify hotel guests they're running late?Checkout was a breeze & the gentleman at the front desk called to have my car brought out, that's when the problem started.  I proceeded to the front of the hotel to wait for my car only to find the parking attendant curb my rims against the steel edge of the street curb! I pointed it out the attendant & he was so disinterested in the situation it was appalling; I moved the car off the curb but once I got into the car there was a distinct odor of cannabis! I don't smoke nor do my friends & we abhor the smell of smoke that's why I could tell someone smoked in my vehicle. I asked for his name repeated but he just walked away & said take it up with the hotel. I went back to reception & the gentleman reassured me the director would contact me once he gets in since it was only 7am. There was nothing I could really do - I was at the mercy of the hotel management so I took the Director, Andrew Brown's, business card & drove 7 hours home with two warped rims in the middle of a rain storm.The last correspondence I received from the Andrew was a month and a half after the incident. Andrew stated the parking garage was a separate entity and they would see what they can do to resolve the issue. To this day the incident has yet to be resolved. I have numerous times to reach out to the hotel to no avail. As I stated the slogan ""stay relevant"" does not pertain to guests who have already paid.  Caveat emptor",1,,
73,Mark T.,"Portland, OR",85,15,0,2.0,3/27/2017,"I travel for work a lot and typically stay at a location for 4-7 days, so I really get to know a hotel while I'm there.  My biggest complaint for Nomo is that the shared door in-between rooms was not soundproof at all.  To the point that whomever is in the room next to you might as well be staying in your room and vice versa.  You hear everything crystal clear.  Even the toilet flushing or the unzipping of a suitcase.  The rooms are pretty feminine. I don't say that as a negative, just an observation.  The sink is not in the bathroom but rather the room itself.  Anytime I used the phone to order room service it would hangup before I could finish my order.  I could not adjust my thermostat.  There were times during the day when I would come in to a very warm room and that is not my preferred temp.  The TV was incredible outdated, mounted crooked on the wall and small.  (I often plug my computer into a the TV to watch a movie before bed, could not do that here)  On the plus side the establishment is very clean and the bar/restaurant downstairs is very nice.  If you need to be in the Soho area the location is great.My work demands long hours, early mornings most times going into the night, so a hotel to me is just a place to sleep in-between working.  So being able to rest comfortably is most important.  This is not a hotel to rest at, so if thats your goal look elsewhere.",3,,1

Apparently the room was not cleaned well, it's really hard to miss the dusty case lying on the floor.Also, they accept dogs but when you ask for bowls, they offer to give you "" not very wide plastic containers"" because they don't have bowls. Nomo is the first dog accepting hotel I travelled to that didn't have dog bowls...  And yes the walls are ridiculously thin, I can hear everything in the next room.

View was nice, I was on the 14th floor.Toiletries were nice, towels were soft. Carpet was not that clean. Check in desk was on second floor. Lobby and entrance was pretty. Check out was a hassle -- they wouldn't give me a receipt for my supervisor, which was annoying.

It completely ruined our experience - every time we talked to someone who worked here we came away feeling shocked and disrespected. At one point we were exploring the building and trying to find a rooftop that had been tagged on instagram, and when we asked someone who appeared to be a manager or concierge of some sort he snapped and said ""we havent had a rooftop here for two years. If you were actually staying here you would know that"" and walked away without even giving us a chance to respond. Um, guy, we stayed here for four nights, and we paid bogus added amenity charges for all four of them despite there being zero amenities (wifi is advertised as free sooo). Even the bellboy was snappy. Also, we only received hand towels and facecloths on our first night, then never again, and had to call down to request bathrobes.Stay away, unless you're just there for a quick meal in the cute restaurant or a photo in the entryway.",5,,
79,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,982,6061,3.0,5/8/2016,"This my first visit to the hotel under its new name, formally the Mondrian Soho. I was here celebrating a Sweet 15 dinner in the Penthouse 2 suite. Nice walking into the hotel under the tree arches always liked this , hotel lobby has a Miami Art Deco feel to it & it smells lovely. Nice couches set up , the restaurant is located in the lobby. We waited in the bar/lounge area comfy seats.After making our way up & into the suite everything was set up so nice , this was done by the individuals not the hotel.Once seated we all proceeded to have a great evening with friends & family. They served both Red & White wines I started with Red since they offered it upon entering not bad, once seated they offered White during appetizers / dinner .. White was great. To start they went with an interesting veggie salad not bad. Next was Pizza , nice thin crust this was very good.The next few dishes were BBQ chicken drums , a Pesto grilled chicken , Sauté Fish & Steak. The Chicken drums were very good nice tasting sauce so was the Pesto Grilled Chicken. The Steak was delicious , nice & tender .. Didn't try the fish but those who did said it was good. For dessert they had Small ice cream bars vanilla , peanut butter & chocolate as I recall not bad.They also had Yogurt with blueberries very good. We also had some cake later on of our own. It happen to be a rainy day so the views were a bit foggy but still quite lovely.Everyone working the party was nice & attentive service was great & the food was very good.",7,1,5
80,Ashley G.,"Ottawa, Canada",83,391,262,3.0,9/24/2016,"I have a love hate relationship with this hotel. The rooms are small, and I found the way the hotel utilized the space in the room was not practical. I was not fond that the sink was not in the bathroom, but instead was right next to the door. The furniture was mirrored, and anytime I sat anything on the main dresser, it ended up behind it. I moved that sucker at least daily to retrieve items that fell behind it.The rooms are fairly quiet, but when there is hallway traffic, you can hear it. I could hear my neighbour clearly when they were playing music as well as speaking on her phone. We were on the 5th floor, and did not mind that we were facing a building. Although, we were pretty envious when our other party travelling with us got an upgrade to the the 23rd floor to a premier room when they just booked a classic.Great location if you want to stay in lower Manhattan, but travelling uptown is a b*tch. If you are a tourist, staying here for a long period and want to see all of New York, I would stay more central.At the end of the day, it was not my favourite hotel that I had stayed in, and I would not be back.",1,,
81,S. Victoria M.,"Chicago, IL",152,107,222,1.0,4/3/2016,"To sum it all up, what an absolutely poor experience.  Despite booking it solely due to a personal employee recommendation. We booked a reservation for 12, and were told we would be doing a ""family style"" meal at $75 per head. It was a work celebration. That being said, a traditional family style would've been nice!To start, we were provided kale Cesar salads...in bowls...without tongs, a scoop, or anything of the like. We had to use our own forks to get the kale salad out of the few bowls. I went to ask a server/bartender for some kind of serving utensil and they told me they would get our server, and didn't even listen to the request. Well, since we found out later on that we were seated in the bar area, it may have made more sense...if there were actually more than 10 people total at the bar (it was very slow for a Saturday). When we started our ""party"" there were only two other patrons in the bar area & when we ended there were exactly eight.  So busyness was not a reason for our experience. Next, on to our entree...ugh. It was some sort of pasta, served in three dishes 'family style' that wasn't enough to feed the entire party. Funny enough, some of us didn't even get the chance to have any. It was an extremely small portion for a family style dinner. That, and as well there was supposed to be a soft egg with each?!  It was liquidish, a lot more than soft. Ewwwwww. The chicken was fine, but there weren't even 12 servings for our party, so that's another fail. In addition, the team was so hungry, we asked for bread. 30 minutes later, we had to go to the bar to request the damn bread, and then, it turned up 10 minutes later. The service was beyond horrendous in addition to the meal, and they deserved a far less tip. However, us being who we are still provided a more than deserved tip. The venue is pretty, but that's it. If you want pretty pictures, come here. If you want your guests to actually have a good meal, and maybe service - AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST.",15,8,8
82,Zoë M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",69,31,13,5.0,1/9/2018,"Absolutely loved staying here. I'm not quite sure how people say there are hidden fees because the website clearly stated them. I booked my four night stay many months in advance and the price I was quoted then was still the price we paid when we left. Our room had a beautiful view and was clean. The bed was super comfortable but only had one comforter. Room service is extremely expensive and I refuse to pay $7 for a bag of pop chips. Housekeeping did an amazing job everyday and we were more than pleased when we came back from a long day out. Location is so good with the metro station being so close and various restaurants just around the corner. The only thing I truly had an issue with was our windows near the bed. 23 stories up you would think that they wouldn't open at all or maybe just crack open for a breeze. However, these windows all opened all the way giving someone easy access out of it. It truly scared me that someone could fall out the window or be pushed out and there's no net or safety seal. They literally just open up and allow one to fall 23 stories down. Overall we had a great stay that included a beautiful view. I would recommend this hotel and will consider staying here again in the future.",,,

84,Kerry C.,"Cusseta, GA",54,44,1,3.0,4/15/2018,"We stayed in the Penthouse Two. The room itself is absolutely beautiful and the view is amazing. However what this hotel has in aesthetics is not matched by its sub par customer service. We may have well been staying in a Motel 6. First of all, we arrived and the air conditioner was broken. We had to call multiple times. The service person who came was friendly and helpful, and even bought a fan, so I do want to mention that. However the air was never properly fixed. We just suffered until the weather got cooler. Secondly, the hotel did not have any pillows on the balcony chairs. It was so tacky and we had to request them. They said they only usually put them out for events. So if you rent the Penthouse, they expect you to sit on a hard metal chair frame or the fake grass floor? It was strange! Secondly, the toilet bowl was leaking. Finally, we requested ice to the room. We called a few times and then finally went to the front desk about an hour after our first request. He tells us he was waiting for something, so we asked if we can we just get it ourselves. He said yes and then called down to the restaurant. We go down to the restaurant and instead of having the ice ready for us, the host says ""Oh yes, go to the bartender."" We ask the bartender for the ice and he looks at us like we have three heads. We eventually get the ice and lo and behold a bucket is finally brought to our room. Service at brunch was similar, slow and unaccommodating. Overall, if you want five star customer service, this isn't the right place. I do want to add that the employees who bring your luggage up and do the valet were very helpful and friendly. Finally, if you want five star amenities, you won't get that here either. But, as I said earlier, the view in the Penthouse is phenomenal and the room itself is gorgeous. So aesthetically this hotel is a five but on customer service a one, which is why I have given three stars.",1,,
85,Mike W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,0,1.0,1/31/2018,"We were guests for 1 night. The hotel itself is very nice, the rooms are great with big windows that look out over manhattan.We knew about the $25 amenities fee going into this so that was not a surprise but it ended up being $27 which was strange. The wifi which is supposed to be one of the amenities did not work for us, could not connect our devices. When we called the front desk for help I could tell they were annoyed that I would call to ask for their help. There were also no robes in the closet.But the biggest issue was this...We sent our car with the valet parking attendant when we checked in. Their normal check out is at 12 noon but they gave us a late check out for 1pm. No one at the hotel including the valet attendant gave us any instruction that there were any specific timing rules for the valet. I called down to the front desk for the car and they had it downstairs about 12:50. We checked out and the front desk wasn't able to give me my valet total, I thought that was a bit strange, they only gave me a final bill with the amenities fee and said they would bill the valet to my card. I figured Valet would be anywhere from $25 - 35 for the night. Boy was I wrong. A few days later an additional charge for almost $160 showed up on my card from nomo soho. I called the hotel immediately. I tried asking the front desk person about the charge and they wouldn't even speak to me they just kept transferring me to the ""accounting department"" who were not available. This happened about 5 times. I left them a voice message and no one called me back. Later in the day I called back and finally a different front desk person was there and they pulled up my bill and told me I had been charged for 2 days of valet. Thanks They said since I got my car back after 12 noon they charged me for a 2nd day or valet. Valet parking was $67 per day...yes $67 per day....and they charged me for 2 days plus a $25 ""parking tax"" even though I was only there for 1 night! My car was there only 50 minutes past 12 noon and I was charged for a full additional 24 hours that I did not even receive! I asked them to refund the 2nd day since I was only Parked there for one night and they refused.Not one person at the hotel, the front desk or the valet attendant warned me that there were specific rules about when exactly my car needed to be out by in order to not be charged for another day. Even upon giving us a late check out and knowing our car was in the valet the front desk did not bring this information to my attention. I would have had my car out before 12 had I known! Who would want to pay for an additional day at $67!!! This information is also not listed on the valet ticket stub. It is literally no where to be found and they just expect you to know apparently and then be ok with being charged double if your car comes out past noon!I was hoping by calling them and speaking with someone that they would want to help me and fix the situation and save a customer. But after several attempts it was clear that they didn't care. Their billing practices are not ethical and are totally predatory.",6,,

87,Bells F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,20,0,3.0,1/19/2017,"I love staying at hotels. My fav hotels in NY have always been The Greenwich Hotel and NoMo. Well NoMo, no mo'! Where to start:1: Room service menu is insanely overpriced. Something like $18 for a bagel with $4.95 delivery fee and 18% gratuity. Seriously, a delivery fee to get on the elevator?  The restaurant pricing isn't better. Invited a colleague over for breakfast and it was embarrassing when we asked the waiter for clarification on pricing. How he held a straight face confirming the astronomical/heinous pricing is award worthy. It's NYC! There are so many amazing food options more attractively priced- which we sought happily! 2. Standard rooms are really small. Carpet looked dingy and the heater smelled bad.Noticed a bunch of dust in the vents.3. We checked out and saw a bill in front of our door with the net value of zero. No mention of a card being charged. Usually there is an ""x###"" card number to show it's been charged. Dude, I'm in finance. It read like there were 6 charges and 6 credits. A week later, I looked at my CC statement and found that they did charge me for the amount. I called billing and the woman explained it was an amenity fee recently instituted. It is $27/day on top of the standard room rate. It's suppose to cover wifi, free coffee and other stuff. NO ONE mentioned the fee to us at check in and of course they aren't advertising the free coffee. Felt duped. 4. Water bottle in room costs $10. You would think they would splurge for at least water. 5. I literally had to ask housekeeping everyday for an extra bottle of soap. There was one mini bottle provided for two adults! 6. I do have an issue with the doormen, they stand next to the door but don't actually open it. There were 3 gents standing around and we asked one for our bags and he said we have to wait for another guy. It was silly. Like, what is your role? You don't open doors. You don't grab bags. It's an illusion perhaps. All in all, I choose NoMo every time I'm in NY but I'm afraid I have to part with the Hotel. I think NoMo is for foreigners who read SoHo is trendy or something and are willing to compromise on quality for location. I'm no sucker.",6,2,
88,Nikki R.,"San Mateo, CA",54,327,18,3.0,5/6/2017,"Super cute & hip hotel in a good location. The room I was in was tiny, but I was expecting it since that's how things in NY are - or at least can be. Pretty pricey for the accommodations but it's all about location, location, location ...I guess.You can hear everything in the halls from your room, which makes paying $400 a night hard to swallow. I woke up to room service bring food to the room across from me. Kind of a bummer. The lady at the front desk has MAJOR attitude. I am not sure what her problem is but maybe her Dad owns the hotel, i'm not sure. I wonder what the deal with management is that they have someone like this at the front desk to check people in, I would think this part of the experience should set the right tone not a bitter one. I interacted with her a number of times, after thinking the first time maybe she was having a rough day, but nope, she's just rude and can't crack a smile to save her life. Pretty pathetic.The hotel bar/restaurant is super cute and gets busy at night. The guys behind the bar are friendly which is 180 degrees from what you'll get from the front desk lady...The skirt steak was delicious and prepared perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed sitting at the bar to enjoy a meal.I don't think I'd return to the hotel based on the value and treatment from the front desk, but overall, it's A-OK, as my 3 stars would signal.",,,
89,Jenn C.,"San Rafael, CA",187,2,0,1.0,4/12/2018,"TL;DR- avoid this place. Unhelpful staff/management, overpriced and faulty rooms that they will still charge you for. Checked into the room after booking online (and after waiting 15 min to check in because they had one person working) and entered to find the smallest room I've ever been in, and it was unbearably hot..the a/c was cranking out 90 degree air. I called maintenance and someone came to look at it. He told me it wasn't going to be able to be fixed that night, so I went down to reservation to ask for a different room. The night manager told me that they were ""overbooked"" (how do you even overbook a hotel?) and that they didn't have another room for me. His solution? For me to turn off the a/c unit when I get too hot and turn it back on when I get too cold, all while trying to sleep mind you. When paying upwards of $400 a night, I expect a decent room with proper a/c control. I told him to cancel my reservation (as I would find another hotel to stay at *ahem, Nomad*) and he explained that he would still have to charge me for my stay...I was in the room all of 45 minutes! A room that they placed me in that was unbearable to stay in. Unacceptable. After much dispute, they finally offered to refund me for the night (how generous). I still had over $2000 held on my bank account for close to a week. Just avoid this place and go to Nomad. You'll thank me later.",1,,

92,Alexandra D.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,1/1/2018,I went here for NYE and the only good thing i can say about this place is it was decorated really pretty. Their bar tenders care more about dancing and taking shots than serving people and coat check is a literal disaster. People were in line at coat check for 2+ hours and the staff was so disorganized... they literally just started passing jackets out and giving them to people who said it was theirs even if they didn't provide a ticket. Any time they got overwhelmed they would just close the door and that happened about every 5 minutes. It was such a disaster that fights broke out and people were getting hurt. They also said coat check and food was included and we got served no food and coat check wound up being $5. I'm definitely never going back and suggest no one else does.,3,,
93,Paris S.,"New York, NY",0,31,0,1.0,5/4/2018,"Had to stay here for a few days between leases--it did the job, but the experience was definitely not the best. The hotel's public spaces (i.e. the parts you see before actually staying here) make it seem like it's a really light, open, and high-end space. For the price, it's anything but. My room had a lot of stains, no bolt for the door, and holes in a few of my towels. The sink was in the middle of the room (very holiday inn style) and the service was worse than in any hotel, even airport-hotel I've ever stayed in. Ordering room service was a nightmare (one hour for a drink??) and often, calling the front desk resulted in being sent to *voicemail*. The room service itself was horrible (only 5 options for dinner, and only 2 of them were vegetarian) and the meal I ordered was served on scuffed/cracked plates. Things always had plastic wrap over them. All in all, a bad experience and way too expensive for what it's worth. Come to the restaurant for a cute picture or something but NEVER stay here.",,,

We had the pleasure to meet and be helped by Ehren the bartender. He went above and beyond with his ability to create a show while making drinks, making great recommendations and putting a smile on everyone's face. At one point the entire crowd at the bar stopped just to watch him in action. I will definitely make this a ""must stop"" on our next visit to New York. Individuals like Ehren are an asset to companies/business, I would love to have and individual like him in my office.

You're surrounded by beautiful people everywhere. It is walking distance to the east village, TriBeCa, Nolita, Chinatown, Lower east side, west village, Greenwich village and just about anywhere else south of 14 st. For those who are going to travel further uptown, there are many easily accessible trains. Our checkin was seamless. I don't know why people complain about the reception being on the second floor. There is always very nice hotel employees there more than willing to help. The room was really awesome. A great balance between modern elegance and classic Art Deco, very New York chic. The room was plenty big enough, very quiet, had a gorgeous bathroom, and a stunning view of the bridges. Room service was delicious, seriously do not mind the senseless complaints.

You nearly choke on the perfume they / deodorizer that they use throughout the property and there is no air circulation  every time I'm there I feel like I take shallow breaths because I'm in a tiny box with no air. Outrageously price and get this: every day you are charged a fee for ""coffee, gym and internet"" even if you use none of those amenities. They call it an upkeep fee. It's absurd -- it's just a ploy to market their prices as lower but charge you on the back end. I did not use their internet or go to the gym once or have the ""complimentary coffee"" once and had to pay the fee every day. Absurd.  Other than location do not recommend staying here",2,,

104,Andrea B.,"Los Angeles, CA",383,59,7,3.0,3/24/2017,"I use to love staying here but as of lately it's gone downhill. Day 1 Checked into my room to have it smelling of cleaning products which I'm ok with but the carpet was covered in dirt. They did not clean it prior to us coming in. I figured they would do it after I called house keeping, they came up and did vacum however there was still dirt along the base boards on the floor. Really gross. The bed also had a stain on the comforter and had that changed. Day 2 at 7:00am a fire alarm starting sounding off this went on for aprox 20 mins. I woke out of bed in a panic that the hotel was in a emergency and packed my bags quickly. When I opened the door their was no sign of anyone in the hallway but the alarms were still sounding when I went downstairs the front desk said that it was just a test. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, a test at 7am with no guest warning. Needless to say after day 1 and 2 I really wanted to leave but I only had one more night there so kept it together. The cleaning lady didn't replace our towels nor did she leave fresh ones from the ones hanging. They didn't resupply the soap as well. On check out they were kind enough to extend a late check out to 1pm but that was it for our troubles. Will be looking elsewhere next time i'm in town for work. No mo, no Mo for sure!",2,,

No coffee after 10am (it was 10:03 when we came down - the guy was so rude. He's like ""go to the restaurant. Our coffee service ends at 10). No seating us in the restaurant u less we were both present (I was washing my hands). No searing us in the restaurant despite tons of tables appearing to be available.... No to a rebooking at this hotel. They don't care anyway...Update: was looking for a bag for my shoes. Concierge suggested the restaurant. Guy at the host stand at the restaurant gave me a dirty look and mumbled something.. was on May way out when i passed a bellman, so I figured I'd ask.

First off, I want to thank the manager Andrew for taking such good care of us during our stay. When we originally checked in, which was earlier than check in time, our suite wasn't available. However instead of making us come back, Andrew was able to find us a suite and get us checked in. Not only that, he provided us with refreshments as well! Seriously top notch customer service and amazing guy! Someone needs to put him in corporate haha.Overall the stay was top notch. The room had great views of the Manhattan bridge and Brooklyn, and the size of the room was just right for my fiancée and I. Very quiet as well. I also enjoyed the modern feel to the hotel. I'm kinda into the contemporary/modern deco so it added a nice touch. For being in Soho, this hotel is priced fair and I definitely recommend it. We are definitely coming back!",1,1,1

Even though the space looks the same, it is a mere shell of what this beautiful restaurant used to be.* It was FREEZING inside (I'm never cold). Not only was it miserable, but the food was cold moments after it arrived at the table. Despite multiple requests and subsequent denials from us and many other guests, the large double-doors that were letting cold air from the hotel entrance into the restaurant remained open all night... Until 10 before we left. * The menu was limited and confusing.* The food was not only uninspired and mediocre, but the portions were tiny. * Our waiter was apathetic at best. The other staff was quite nice, but this guy has been there forever and we've seen his slack getting worse. Last night's apathy was nothing short of epic. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!",4,1,1

Once we got our keys and went up to our room It was dirty and still being cleaned.  Then we went downstairs to have a late lunch at the restaurant.  The host was rude and told us the restaurant was booked even though there were four empty tables in sight.  Great location, and nice design but the staff is rude who has no customer service training.  I read other reviews on here about the bad service before booking, and thought the pictures look nice how bad can it be?!  It's BAD.  With all the other cool luxury hotels in NYC to choose from, we  will take our money elsewhere next time.",3,,

If the wait staff can't even hear customers, how can you expect customers to talk to each other? To add insult to injury, the music was only playlist quality. Service: While the food was fine, we didn't start eating until 1 1/2 hours after we were seated.  Finally, management could use more training in communications.

A faux bookcase on the wall near a small bar hid a nearly invisible pivot door that revealed a secret room when opened. I thought this was really cool. Yeah, sometime simple cool things do it for me.Besides the pretty good Johnny Walker Double Black I had the pleasure of tasting, another impressive thing about Nomo Soho was its larger bar in the restaurant adjacent to the garden entrance.

The rooms are stylish but tiny, with no bathtubs in most rooms (like most boutique hotels), and the aforementioned room service couldn't care less about unaccommodated guests. The restaurant is expensive but tasty with a friendly staff (thanks, Phil!). Also, they've traded their Maltin+Goetz toiletries for a brand that offers a body wash reminiscent of bug spray in the summertime.

121,Jen C.,"Trumbull, CT",0,12,0,1.0,12/3/2017,Pretty upset because my husband and I loved this hotel we have stayed here over a dozen times mostly in their suite rooms but we settled for a small queen room because they had Nothing else available. We checked in and opened the out room door it was so hot we had to open the windows and hallway door for 20 minutes to cool it off the heat was blasting it was a sauna. We stood in the hallway till it cooled down. We woke up with stiff noses and puffy eyes not only from the heat but from getting no sleep due to the banging noise in the walls every 5 minutes literally. It was within the walls or underneath us sounded like pipes or something it never stopped the two nights we stayed there. On top of paying 700.00 for two nights for a small hot room with noise they put a bill under our door today on the morning of our check out for an additional $104.00 went to the front desk they told us it was for amenity fees which included Wi-Fi (this should be complimentary and it included coffee and tea. We never even got to have coffee or tea We spent $60 on breakfast and coffee on Saturday morning nothing with complementary and then this morning because we found out we were paying $25 for coffee NT we actually went downstairs to have a cup and both coffee canisters were completely empty so we got none at 9:00 AM this morning.

123,Dan S.,"Carmel, NY",42,100,107,5.0,12/20/2015,"Stayed 2 nights in mid December for a 'mom & dad' getaway. Let me tell you this hotel exudes sexiness and has a very sensual feel. If you enter on the Crosby Street side you walk through an ivy/botanical type arch where candles line your walk up. There is very sensual musak piped in that also greets you on this walk. The musak and candles greet you once you enter the lobby also. Once inside you feel like you are in a boutique type hotel/residence reminiscent of South Beach/Ibiza or any other exotic locale you've been to. They also have an intoxicating aroma piped in throughout to tickle your sense of smell. Definitely very very subtle but you get a whiff every so often. Definitely not overpowering or bothersome but it adds soooooo much to the exoticness of the experience. At night they have an amazingly intimate bar/restaurant, lounge off the lobby that is very very sensual and provocative. Daisy the concierge is a WEALTH of information... sit and chat with her, she knew of AMAZING speakeasies in the area that definitely did not disappoint!!!",1,,

I couldn't even speak to him without him putting me down. Calling me names, etc. it was so unprofessional and completely like nothing I have ever experienced. I stay at a lot of amazing hotels and this is just not worth the money. I booked it via hotels tonight which is maybe why they treated me so poorly. I have no idea. He said to me, and I quote, ""you paid nothing for a room here via hotels tonight. Rooms here cost so much so you should be lucky.""

The location is great, right in the heart of Soho and walking distance to some great shops and trendy restaurants. The restaurant in the hotel is delicious, and beautiful - but they did have a DJ playing while we were there so it was quite loud. The hotel itself is modern and trendy, with art and decor that we really enjoyed. The rooms were on the smaller side which is standard for New York City, but they had modern and clean amenities that made up for the size. The staff was very friendly and accommodating -- they even watched out for us when they thought another guest was bothering us.

That can work if you have very good design. Two people cannot pass each other in the space between the bed and the opposite wall. Even alone, you may injure your calves on the sharp corners of the wooden bedstand hidden by the comforter. The food menu is from the 70s in the San Fernando Valley. Seriously.

131,Myrem D.,"Mississauga, Canada",55,205,324,3.0,4/4/2016,"NYC is an hour flight from Toronto so it's the ideal weekend getaway with the perfect weekender bag in tow. I booked this hotel 2 Aprils in a row (last year and this year)based on the area and I got prices from a trusted travel agent. I completely detest Manhattan and If you do too and want the NYC feel without the claustrophobic tourist plague feel try staying in Soho. I like to stay in the neighborhoods I feel comfortable walking around where you have more local feel with more access to private owned stores and restaurants and you could actually use the bathroom if necessary (this is rare in Manhattan, even the bloody Starbucks. It is a disease to close washrooms to patrons that want to wash hands or refresh ; I sincerely hope you get well Manhattan) . Soho is one of my favorite neighborhoods to stay when in NYC so I was excited to stay here. Originally I wanted to stay at the Crosby Street Hotel but the travel agent suggested I try this hotel that's about 75% cheaper than the Crosby.  It's 20m (NYC Traffic is epic so assume delays) from LaGuardia airport which isn't bad and at first sight this hotel has a beautiful entrance. The rooms are very compact so if space is an issue then be sure to upgrade to the Deluxe Room or if a view is must then try the Premier Room. The classic is way too small. In my first trip I had the Deluxe and it wasn't bad but they gave me a room on the 5th floor which was facing another building and that was a tad awkward so I had to keep the blinds closed most of the time. When one side of the room is all window, you'd be a bit hesitant leaving the blinds open all day. But hey, if you're into it then this rooms good for you. The Premier is higher up and has a pair of chairs and a table to use if you have in-room breakfast. The bathroom is compact which is annoying if you are sharing with anyone but it is clean and everything seemed in working order. The closet was tiny but I'm never in NYC more than 3 days so no biggie for me. My biggest issue was the service desk. Upon checking in the girl was extremely condescending and i'm not even sure why. Later I noticed the other customers that stayed here (nobody smiled in the elevator or said 'hi' back - Life MUST be terribly miserable at a hotel in NYC. Geeze) or walking about. I can only assume there's a certain type that stays here and perhaps I wasn't looking the type so much (I guess dressing in anything less than the #imtrending or #outfitonfleek , #ootd) must be questionable enough to quadruple check my credit card and that I am indeed the person that paid for the room. I wanted to hug her and let her know there IS a way out of the second income girlfriend life. Alas, she didn't care for my un-groomed eyebrows furrowed in sadness and gave me the keys to my room. The rest of the trip was great, mostly because I don't care very much about the ignorance of fools and the hotel's double entrance was handy to walk to all my favored spots. As the weather was a bit chilly I wasn't able to enjoy the veranda and patio dining. In the evening and past 12am note that the bar/restaurant downstairs gets busy with the regular youth and old foolery/libations mix. The good news is that if you're an old bird like me then the noise wont bother you once you are in the room. Also, the blackout style curtain is a nice touch. The interior of the lobby is dark (helps to cover the wear and tear) and decorated with a style that confuses me. I'm not sure of the theme but it works somehow. The Wifi is a catch up game but it's sufficient for things like uber and checking in. That's about it.Because of the location I'd stay here again. I think the maintenance team could definitely stand to dust of a few large areas and the check in service can be a bit more prompt but otherwise it's a decent stay. xoxoM.",4,2,2

I asked both the man behind the counter & our waitress, neither seemed to care if I ever received food or not. Finally my waitress offered to order for me- eggs, bacon, sausage at which she appeared pissed off at the thought that she had to do something extra. Upon me finally telling the waitress that we were tired of waiting, she offered to comp our buffet and check on the status. When we declined that we no longer wanted the food, it arrived.

142,Sarah M.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,31,5,4.0,4/17/2016,"I came here for brunch with 7 others on a Sunday. The space is beautiful, the food was delicious and the music was great. Loved the fact there's turkey and beef bacon options and the pancakes were FANTASTIC. However, I would give this place 3.5 to 4 stars based on service. While the waitress was nice, it took the about 30 minutes to get our order taken and over an hour and a half to get our meals (keep in mind, 6 of us ordered eggs Benedict). We finished brunch at 4:30.....practically in time for dinner.",,,
143,Margaret N.,"Los Angeles, CA",191,450,462,3.0,8/14/2015,"Formerly the Mondrian SoHo. NoMo still kept the restaurant, decor and scent of the Mondrian, but there's some parts definitely missing :(. Also, Mr. H, the lounge inside the hotel is ""no mo"" too- the hotel doesn't have a liquor license to have drinks outside on the rooftop. Please bring back the Mondrian!",4,,
144,StyleTasteFun S.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,0,4.0,5/15/2016,"Upbeat hip respite in the bustling fashion mecca of Soho. Free on-street parking was plentiful-a rarity at most NYC hotels. As you walk in you feel like you've entered an enchanted forest welcomed by a very pleasant doorman ready to be of service. We immediately noticed a very diverse, youthful blend of guests. We'd requested as many amenities as possible for the room we booked on Hotels Tonight, and we were delighted that all of our requests were met: King-sized bed, amazing NYC viewS from 10-ft windows, away from the elevator. We did get an adjoins room, which you could hear everything next door, so I would make the request next time to avoid an adjoining room. The room itself was a decent size, cozy as many NYC hotel rooms are, but seemed larger with Mediterranean-like decors of crisp cool blue and white, blue-hued mirrors, and bathed in warm natural light. While we did not eat in the restaurant, there was a steady buzz of diners. Just blocks away from China Town and Little Italy, there was plenty of variety of places to eat, drink, and shop...the perfect NYC ""hideaway"".",,,
145,Shawn Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",0,5,0,5.0,2/16/2017,"I Love this place.  I travel a lot for work, and I stay in a lot of really nice hotels, The NOMO really hits the spot every time.  Their staff is incredibly accommodating.  The decor is chic, hip, calming, cool, and classic.  The Views are unparalleled, it seems to be the tallest building in the neighborhood, so you have excellent views of Midtown, Downtown, Brooklyn, and Jersey(not that you'd want to look at jersey).  Room Service and the restaurant in the Hotel were both delicious and quite filling.  This reminds me of a much better version of a kimton brand hotel.",,,

148,Z. Michelle O.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,38,1,3.0,12/6/2015,"My review is for the restaurant. Went there for Sunday brunch with a big group (14 people). This place is beautiful and big enough to accommodate groups that size... But honestly, the service was terrible. Took over 20 mins just to get our coffee served. Splitting checks is a nightmare. They somehow lost our reservation... Quite an ordeal just to have brunch. Food was good, but not amazing..So my overall experience was just ok.",,,
149,Carolina C.,"Bothell, WA",0,13,0,1.0,10/8/2016,"I'm not joking - we had mosquitos in our room for 3 nights in a row. We told the front desk several times and nothing was done about that. We were staying on the 3rd floor and maybe the mosquitos were from the garden. But still! C'omon people! I've stayed in hotels by the beach and the rooms didn't have mosquitos. Further, in South America, hotels with mosquitos give guests sort sort of light poison. Staff was very rude",1,,

Wifi was shite. Policy of limiting electronic devices was annoying. Having to reconnect constantly was very annoying. Concierge was terrific, very helpful. Perfume vented into elevator and other spaces was off-putting to say the least.",1,,
153,Arthur G.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,17,0,4.0,10/7/2015,"Very good experience. Great location in Soho. Friendly staff, awesome clean room. Very nice breakfast. I would only advise you to stay away from the concierge service (not Daisy, who was great). The rest of the them were very knowledgable but quite misleading regarding price ranges and availability of play tickets. Just make sure you research online before you buy ''the last available'' tickets for the hottest new play. You can probably find something much much better/cheaper on Stubhub or Vividseats.",,,

155,renee l.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,0,1.0,5/16/2016,Wow. What a horrible hotel. I've had better service at  a holiday inn. This place is a joke. After a paperwork mix up I was rudely told to stay in the lobby by the manager. She didn't check on anything for me I a timely manner. She actually threw her hands up in the air. It was a simple fax. She should have stood by waiting it. Everyone is sneezing and sick behind the desk. And swearing. It is just bad. Save yourself grief. Don't stay here.,1,,
156,Clarice G.,"Alexandria, VA",7,8,5,5.0,3/21/2016,"We had a reservation for 3 nights and 4 days. We arrived to a gorgeous entrance, where there is a greenery pathway (they definitely care about the ambiance). When we entered the hotel we noticed immediately a clean and delicious aroma that goes around the whole hotel. Checking in was a easy and quick. Now the rooms..... just gorgeous! To the decor, the wall to ceiling marbled bathroom and the views....There is a trendy and chic restaurant that is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We ordered for brunch pancakes and it was so good....I would recommend staying here, we will definitively come back! Thank you NOMO soho",,,
157,Marie R.,"Farmingdale, NY",1,19,6,5.0,3/14/2016,I loved this hotel! The atmosphere and style of the hotel was awesome. I got  a suite and one side of the room was all glass with this amazing view! Even the shower ;) I than stayed for brunch and although it was low key it was a good time and food was good!,,,
158,Tony G.,"Santa Monica, CA",1066,19,10,1.0,9/5/2015,"Bed Bugs. Soul Crushing Experience - So many memories at the Mondrian, now beaten with an ugly stick out of my mind. Kudos to HotelTonight. I  have never complained about a hotel in 20 years. This one horrendous. Except the lobby and restaurant, which was very cool. The room was dirty, hair was on the bathroom robes, the sheets were stained and smelled like urine, floors were not properly vacuumed. Plates and glasses were left outside the door for 18 hours. Beds were low quality, hard and seemingly not new, probably left from the past hotel. Not near enough electrical plugs. There was so much crammed into every part of the room, leaving no room to spread your things out. Do we really need 5 bottles of water spread throughout the room to try to sell me from not using NY tap? 4 huge water glasses for water that looked like fake Waterford that did not match the room. TV would not give access to any of the stations other than ones being hawked by Mario Lopez1. Bed Bugs. 3 people that stay got the same massive swelling in triple bites in neighboring rooms. Pictures of all the victims are being sent to hotel management.2. Rooms are closets not rooms, even the suites, which are anything but sweet. Hotel Tonight got them  to move me a regular room. The measurements for minimums of the room were in accurate. Oh yes, the room has a great view, yet the curtains do not fully black out the windows.3. Hot hallways to rooms. Felt like walking into a plane before the air went on.4. Front desk does not answer the phone. Front desk staff are not experienced. Front desk people are not even usually at the front desk, which is hard to find as its upstairs with no sign as to where to checkin. 6. SERIOUS: Monique the manager did not access our room record properly, jumped to conclusions and sent security to our room to remove us, further threatened to break down the door and or call the police. We had been here for 5 days and those days were not recorded properly from HotelTonght. We told them to add whatever charges for that night  to my credit card at the desk and resolve the morning. We were calling at 1:30 to report the bed bugs, yet she could not take the complaint without understanding our complete reservation process. Monique was horrifying. Achilles, the security guard was a gentleman, yet just doing what he told by his disrespectful boss t what to do, yet apologized for her on the way out. HotelTonight partially resolved for me as it did not hit their system correctly and we did not hear from witch Monique again. (**********The only positive action was Hotel Tonight credited much of the monies back to my credit card. We should have moved out first day.  Hotel Tonight rules. I use this only for my 100 nights on the road every year.****** ""7. Oversize furniture needed to be removed to walk throughout room. Most everything was proportioned wrong on so many design fronts. Awkward. Designed by someone to push as much stuff in a room attempted to overcome how small it is really is. There is no way a disabled person could get anywhere in this room, theire largest I am told. Lets check code on that one. 8. Upcharge for rooms is ludicrous. finally upgraded to room that was bearable. 9. Espresso was $9.00 + tax + tip. Restaurant manager advised more clients were unhappy with price and food quality, said she was looking elsewhere. 10. Rooms were so low priced throughout the city, we actually booked a room at the Gramercy for the same prices NOMO were charging for midsize room. The Gramercy while being an exemptional hotel, the room was still 75% larger in size. The Jade hotel, which is wonerful in the Village was selling rooms for less.

159,Kaleb W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,0,1.0,7/7/2015,Avoid this place! Staff was hard to find and not very friendly.  Room service is terrible can only be ordered from 11-11.  Outside area smells like armpit.,2,1,
160,Emily S.,"New York, NY",0,19,0,5.0,8/11/2015,Had a fabulous experience here staying one night for my birthday. Asked for a high floor and ended up in a penthouse room. Everything was luxurious and our private balcony was a rare experience in nyc. It made for a great night. Hotel staff was very attentive and kind. Room decor was luxe and tasteful and the room was very clean. Only thing missing was they didn't have robes but said they were getting them for the hotel soon. Not too pricy either for what we got. Would definitely come back!,,,
161,Kara S.,"Columbus, OH",3,7,1,3.0,10/19/2015,"Check in person was rude. Called room service 2x, no answer. Went down for breakfast, waited 10 minutes for seat in a half empty restaurant. At the bar, took 20 minutes to order a drink. Missed out on $$ logic, the faster you serve, the faster we drink, the faster we order another, the faster bartender makes $$. Hostess for restaurant is embarrassing. Attitude problem like she works at the hottest place in town. News flash, she doesn't. Not only that, made me want to spend my money elsewhere. Worst customer service and is a terrible choice as the customer's first point of contact to the restaurant/bar. Had to hail own cab, call uber, etc. only saving grace... View from room was amazing, beds are comfortable, room was nice. Food was great but had to work really hard to get to it. Sad to be wasted on this hotel. Alan the bellhop/doorman provided the best customer service in the hotel and is the only reason we would ever consider going back. We met him on the last day. Wish he would have been there for the first two. Might have changed our experience. He deserves tons of credit for holding up any semblance of customer service in the place.",,,
