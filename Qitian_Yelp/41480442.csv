0,Trinaka B.,"New York, NY",8,25,22,4.0,8/28/2018,Went here for a private birthday celebration/brunch. Food was delicious and service was great. Very crowded for Sunday brunch but beautiful atmosphere. Long Beach on Sunday afternoon. Will definitely be back.,,,
1,John B.,"New York, NY",773,371,653,1.0,9/29/2017,Nice bar but awful  service and worse  food.The lobster roll topped with calamari looks appealing  but the roll was stale. Every time you want service you  have to  get up and go find someone  .Finally  someone explain  it was not edible but chstged full  price anyway .Hey ho we aint in the city now . Beach life i guess.,2,,2
2,Joseph C.,"Mineola, NY",97,6,0,2.0,7/29/2018,"Which is at the Allegria  Hotel in Long Beach, was just there with friends and while the bartender was pleasant, he left the glasses as they ordered more drinks. It was far from busy but yet the glasses just sat there. I observed a gentleman come over to the bar asking about a cell phone the front desk said was left there and the bartender said to ask the bar manager who was sitting on her cell phone, they called Gemma  believe was her name several times and she finally got up...my point is you have a bar manager sitting watching the bar who is sitting on her cell phone , this is why the bar and restaurant wasn't crowded and yet empty glasses sat on the bar.",1,,
3,Yexuny C.,"New York, NY",70,38,9,1.0,6/17/2018,"The worst moment, the food is horrible, the service the worst, I went to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was my worst experience I could have lived, I do not recommend it, no star I give is the worst restaurant. Bad, bad, bad!!!! The food is frozen.",2,,
4,Rubie L.,"Island Park, NY",1,33,4,4.0,6/2/2018,"We were there last weekend for a birthday party but we're there for brunch. They use to have $70 seafood brunch but now it's $40 and honestly totally worth it. The food is great and mimosas are unlimited. Great service great food, to me worth $40. Try it you won't be disappointed",,,
5,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,1273,1201,2.0,2/5/2017,"This is a truly horrible horrible restaurant. My husband and I ate here while staying at the Allegria Hotel purely based on the fact that we were staying at the hotel and it was VERY cold outside so we didn't want to walk anywhere. We really should have braved the cold. Nothing was really grabbing us when we saw the menu, but we went with the pizza to share to start and my husband got the wings. I ordered the pasta with vegetables as it was the only vegetarian option for an entree and my husband got the caesar salad with grilled chicken. The pizza was clearly some frozen pizza that reminded me of what you get at a Chuckie Cheese. It was an insult to NY pizza. My husband described the wings as equal to when you get pretty bad wings in the city. My pasta was pretty flavorless and consisted of very sad looking wilted over steamed vegetables on pasta. It was barely seasoned and I think I ended up eating about 1/4 of it. My husband said his salad was fine but nothing special. Practically white romaine lettuce was used and it just looked....unappealing. We decided to forgo dessert since the food at dinner was so bad. Over all, we spent $75 on a very bad dinner.I highly recommend that this restaurant revamps literally everything about it. Get a new chef, develop a new menu, start fresh. What you have going right now is terrible.",3,,
6,Paul P.,"Baldwin, NY",0,5,0,1.0,5/6/2018,"I went for brunch dispite the poor dinner reviews. I was disappointed.  I'm not thrilled with a pot of coffee already on the table like Howard Johnson's used to do. I noticed when we were leaving the other tables had a crescent basket...we were shorted!..We really didn't need it anyway. Omelet veg was cold,eggs were hot. For a lot less$ go to one of the other Brunch venues and enjoy Eggs Benedict or French toast freshly made...not steamer table version..and then go to the boardwalk for a ocean view..",,,
7,Jaime O.,"New York, NY",6,36,16,2.0,9/4/2017,"Our server, Ryan W., was super nice and very professional and classy. Thank you Ryan. The reason I give this establishment a low review is because there were no vegetarian options on the menu except for salad and one delicious but very small minestrone soup.  New York is made up of 1/3 who either lean towards the healthier vegetarian options or are actually indeed vegetarians--especially millennials who have now outnumbered baby boomers. I have to throw in my marketing experience and say this has to be bad for business. Good luck. And btw, fix the stall doors in the lobby lady's bathroom; they don't even close.",,,
8,Kelly M.,"Northville, MI",0,7,1,1.0,7/2/2018,Went to happy hour that was advertised on their website. When we arrived l was told that was a mistake and happy hour was over at 5pm and that the manager was changing the website tonight. Even though they said it was their mistake- they did not honor it. Call first as their website is not correct. Will not come back.,,,
9,Mari V.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,11/17/2017,"The Atlantica is a one of a kind gem not only on Long Beach but I would say on Long Island and in NY.  I have been numerous times and each visit they managed to out do themselves more than before.  The views are spectucular...THE ATLANTIC OCEAN!!   The decor is gorgeous...especially at night!  The food is really delicious and excellently prepared.  The menu is well planned and thoughtful and changes with the seasons which is always something I look forward to.And then the icing on all this cake is the staff.  They are a ONE OF A KIND CLASS ACT.I bought my fiance here for lunch this past week for his birthday and without any other reason than because they are top notch...they made the entire lunch feel as if we were the only people in the room.  Our servers Lauren and Ren were attentive, funny, informative and overall very kind.  We also got the chance to meet Kimberly, the restaurant manager when she came over to say hi and wish my fiance a Happy Birthday.  If you have the chance to meet her, please do!  Trust me you won't regret it.  She is absolutely fantastic and BEYOND AMAZING at what she does.  She brings a level of professionalism to the Atlantic that you would expect at the highest quality dining establishments.  I could go on and on but rather than doing so, take my word and make a reservation for lunch, dinner or brunch.  You will be thrilled you did!",,1,
10,Dacia B.,"Queens, NY",289,215,1228,3.0,5/17/2016,Surprisingly the entire menu isn't overpriced although a small mango margarita was $14.... The view of the beach and the decor is simply beautiful. That's the main reason I came here and returned. I've had the hot wings and New York Strip Steak which were both delicious! My friend has the salmon(great)and a few salads(okay).The Staff is very nice but our 1st visit was better than the 2nd. During our 1st visit service was great because the two waiters only had 2 tables but on the 2nd visit service started out great but after having 4 other tables the 3 waiters couldn't handle it. I'm disappointment and my friend isn't sure if we should return.,3,1,1
11,Cecilia P.,"Miami, FL",94,85,222,2.0,7/19/2016,"I ate lunch here with a group of 12 after a wedding this last weekend and was not impressed. I ordered the burger mid rare to cure my hangover and because i had already read all of the other Yelp reviews say that the food was not very good so i tried to play it safe. I also wanted some mashed potatoes instead of the fries, the waiter told me that i could not do substitutions. I mentioned to him that it wasn't written on the menu anywhere and that they were the same price on the menu. He responded that it was an order given to him by the chef. We were the only guests at the restaurant and I cannot imagine why they could not do the mashed potatoes...they certainly weren't in the weeds. I asked to speak to a manager. Additionally, you would think that they would be trying to please as many guests as possible considering their negative standing and lack of clientele. But i guess that is how you lose guests in the first place.The manager never came but the server later told me that he would be able to give me the mashed potatoes like I asked.  The burger was horrible...overcooked, the bread stale, the meat quality poor...The lettuce looked old and wilted. I ate it because I was hungry and didn't want to cause any stress on the other wedding guests. I still have heartburn from it...Beautiful location but don't bother eating there. I would go there for drinks only.",,,
12,Lourdes M.,"Bellerose, NY",199,704,1729,4.0,3/10/2015,"If you are looking for a romantic restaurant with an oceanfront view, this place is for you. As per suggested by a friend, and with the help of a groupon voucher, we tried this place one weeknight for a dinner. We stayed on a public bench in front of the restaurant along the boardwalk overlooking the Atlantic ocean  while waiting for our reserved seating time. It was worth driving to the place. Very relaxing and comforting. When we walked in the restaurant, my husband and I were in awe with their decorations. We were seated right away as we said we had a reservation. Our voucher was honored and experienced the best service even for the discounted price. We were expecting a different treatment and I salute the wait staff for the good service rendered. Food and wine were good.My husband had braised chicken and I had pan-seared scallop. The chef did an exceptional job to our entree as well as of course to our appetizer, grilled octopus and tuna tartare. We enjoyed our sumptous dinner.After dinner, we helped ourselves looking around the rest of the hotel building, they had an oceanfront bar and lounge that I find so appealing. We tried to go to the rooftop area but was not avaiable during our visit time. I assumed it would have a beautiful sight as well to behold. It was a such a fancy night. Oh well, we deserved to have one once in a while. I will recommend.",1,,1

Updated review","We live right across the street and have been here for dinner around 5 times. Each time we visit the food and service are worse than the last. Not only is the food overpriced but it's of poor quality. I ordered a ribeye and was served something that resembled a london broil. When I challenged the waiter he brought it back to the chef who insisted that it was in fact a ribeye. I've eaten my fair share of steak in my life and this was, in no way shape or form, a ribeye steak. The $45 price tag was insulting given it was a $7 piece of meat.The last straw was the health department visited and wrote them up as they had 5 RED violations. This was the most in all of Long Beach and a disgrace to a business who continuously claims to provide ""luxury"". I've added a photo of the health departments violations, these are symptomatic of gross negligence and it's very obvious that management cares not for the health nor well being of their clientele.",4,,
14,Tameka M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,5.0,7/9/2017,"I made reservations for Father's Day 2017. Unfortunately due to traffic coming in from New Jersey I ended up arriving right before closing. I must say that they were very accommodating. The level of service was exceptional. There is a waiter there that does magic tricks for the kids. Yes!!! Magic tricks! I must admit he made our night amazing. He was courteous and professional. The food was also great but sometimes the customer service has an even greater impact. They were already closing when we arrived but they took us anyway. Thank You AtlanticaI hope I get the same waiter the next time I am there. He is good for business.P.S. (Be on time for your reservation. Do not expect the same outcome.) However I couldn't pass up the opportunity to thank them for making the exception, considering that it was late on a Sunday. I am sure they all wanted to go home. 5 Stars for decor, location, customer service and food.",,,
15,D B.,"OZONE PARK, NY",1,6,0,2.0,2/28/2017,"Keep an eye out on the bartenders... They think you're too ""tipsy"" to remember paying them and will ""forget"" to return your change. The best part was the waitress/bartender told me straight out that she forgot to break the $100 bill and just left it under the register. Apparently this is something that is done quite often- maybe to increase their pocket money. When I confronted her she told me, ""oh I forgot"", rang up the bill, threw out the receipt, and gave me my change. Talk about shady!!!",4,2,
16,Elliott L.,"Oceanside, NY",88,81,14,1.0,9/10/2016,"Have always wanted to try this place, given its close proximity and seemingly great views along the boardwalk and the ocean. After seeing a Groupon for $55 towards $100 of food and drinks (which with a Groupon promo was only $44) we decided to give it a shot. Sadly a huge disappointment. Decor is nice but warn. Dirty walls by our table, another guest next to us complained about a dirty seat. Candle on table not lit. First experience is the bread, brought over in a fancy basket by the bus boy along with some oil and vinegar. Problem is the break tonight is a half a roll that gets used in sandwiches, which we along with many other tables left for dead. Horrible rolls that tasted like they're from a plastic bag. Appetizers: Soup of the day was good and the shrimp cocktail was fine (just overboiled so they were too hard). Problem was they served the appetizers and salads simultaneously and nobody saw a problem with that, except that the 4 plates couldn't even fit on the table. After asking, they took the salads back and held them until we finished our starters. Arugula salad was good but the Greek salad was two large chunks of iceberg lettuce and less than a spoon of dressing. Waited 5+ minutes before getting some dressing for the salad. Entrees went downhill. Burger was ok. Just a basic burger. The lobster roll I had (which used the same horrible bread from earlier) was inedible. Four bites....three of them had lobster shells mixed in them. Spit a few out onto the plate to show the waitress. Manager came to apologize quickly and left. Ordered desserts to use up the Groupon dollars. Desserts not worth it. $14 for a 3 inch square brownie, 4 marshmallows, graham cracker dust, whipped cream from a can and a scoop of chocolate ice cream with ice chunks inside of it. Coffee was flavorless and warm. Cappuccino had no foam. It was nice the manager would later comp the desserts.Overall a disappointing experience. Would not return. Quality of the food is poor and not enough attention to detail. Managers and executive chefs need to be making sure everything is right before it goes out, not apologizing and doing constant damage control after. Sorry but this 1 star rating was earned.",1,,
17,Denise A.,"Melville, NY",49,95,81,1.0,5/24/2015,"I checked in when we sat for our table about 20 minutes ago and yea, what a waste. I lost the battle after voicing that the majority of the reviews were awful.  But it was worse once we sat especially more so when an elderly Caucasian couple with children were seated moments after we were. The ""server"" going around with coffee and juice so graciously served them twice and only came around after we had asked.  And the coffee was cold! Buffets are almost always a no-no and this breakfast buffet is no exception.  The bacon and sausages were fine, the eggs were soaking and the potatoes are nothing to even remark about.  The fact that another customer thought I had worked there and tried to grab my plate after she saw me handing one to my fiancée - as if!$25/pp to serve ourselves wasn't a total loss since now we know better - this place is full of idiots - guests and staff.  The only thing wrong with this review is the one star I was forced to give it.",4,2,
18,Rich E.,"Long Beach, NY",0,3,0,4.0,6/25/2017,I try and come here at least once a month. myself and my girlfriend really like the place. The food is always good and the staff are excellent and always attentive.Nice place to bring a date.,,,
19,Susan D.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,106,108,3.0,9/5/2016,"This is, as far as I know, the only actual restaurant right on the Long Beach boardwalk, so there isn't much competition. Yet, the owners of Atlantica, which is inside the hotel Allegria, have really given a great deal of thought to the decor and ambiance. The restaurant is attached to a truly lovely bar and lounge, and all have very comfortable seating with fantastic views of the ocean. The night I was there with my family, the service was attentive but slow. But we were in chill mode, so I didn't really mind. The food is largely seafood orientated and averagely good. It is a good value for the price, competently made and generally tasty. I was pleased to see a vegetarian pasta and plenty of salads for the veggie members of my family. If you want a decent meal on the boardwalk (sunset is lovely), with comfortable seating and great views, this is the place to go.",,,
20,Lauren C.,"Rochester, NY",0,1,0,4.0,11/6/2017,"Nice staff and beautiful restaurant. My favorite part is the view, but the food is good. My parents have been there many times that live in Long Beach. I think people are being so snobby that give this hotel bad reviews. Long Beach is a laid back place and this hotel is so worth it for the gorgeous setting and sleep and listening to the waves. The lounge and bar is gorgeous",,,
21,Anita R.,"Hackensack, NJ",5,26,52,2.0,9/7/2015,"The restaurant is located right in the boardwalk and has a great view of the beach. The ambiance is nice as well. However the food is not only pricey but wasn't all that great. The Manhattan lobster chowder was awful. Over cooked and chewy. Salmon was not bad. If you are vegetarian.. Forget it!Nothing to eat here for lunch. Most of the menu is mainly seafood. Personally, I wouldn't come back here again.",,,
22,Vanessa C.,"Queens, NY",30,15,33,4.0,10/1/2016,This is a beautiful restaurant that sits right on the Long Beach  boardwalk. The food's OK but their mixologist are fantastic. Some of the best drinks I've ever had have been here.,,,
23,Jill N.,"Syosset, NY",41,8,36,4.0,8/31/2016,"Our dinner here was a happy surprise. The main reason to be in the Allegria is for the gorgeous view of Long Beach. We decided to dine here so we could celebrate an amazing summer and listen to a concert on the beach while dining.  Our dinner was very enjoyable. My swordfish was well prepared and delicious. The only item that was priced very high was the dessert - $14. We had a lovely and attentive waitress and the other staff were helpful and professional. For example, when our dinners were brought to the table the server already knew which dish went where. Everything was yummy - highly recommend eating outside by the bar on a summer night. The inside is very attractive",,,
24,The Ultimate Reviewer '.,"Northern, VA",0,7,2,5.0,10/10/2016,"Great service! I've seen the other reviews saying terrible service, but that definitely wasn't the case for us. Ren, our waiter, went above and beyond to take care of us and he did a phenomenal job. Although I wanted something not quite on the menu, he was able to make it happen for us. He was the perfect amount of attentive and took strides to ensure we enjoyed our food. Even the food and bread runners were courteous and friendly. The atmosphere is so refreshing and our view of the ocean was fantastic. I'm so impressed with just how relaxing the whole experience was! Our food was very good also! We didn't order anything too crazy, but what we did get was delicious. *A special recognition to the French onion soup!* We attended for lunch but I would love to go back and try for dinner!",,,
25,Jana P.,"Brooklyn, NY",327,233,205,1.0,10/12/2015,"I SWEAR I'D GIVE THIS PLACE NEGATIVE STARS IF I COULD! First, let me inform you all that I've been here over 5 times but last night will make it my last! NO EXCEPTIONS. The ""director"" Marela (or whatever the heck her name was) was the rudest person I've ever met in my life. Yes, I am going to be as dramatic as possible without possibly getting sued. Let me get dirty with this one...Ok granted...my friend had a 4:00pm reservation for brunch because she is moving to California on Wednesday (going away fiesta). This same friend decided last minute to move the reservation up to 3:00pm so of course the guests were late. My friend failed to tell the host that we will just make it for dinner (although we were at the bar the whole time), so ok maybe that was her fault. It's dinner time now and we are a table of 15. The restaurant is literally...LITERALLY...19% full and that's including our party. The service was terrible. We sat down at 6:15pm and didn't get our main course until 8:00pm. I decided to speak to Marela about this service and the fact that our waitress took forever to bring our drinks, to bring our appetizers, AND to bring everything else in life even the water. If the restaurant was jammed pack I would totally understand this but as I said before 19% ppl ...19%!! You know what this lady's response was? Let me do this verbatim...""You know your friend didn't even tell us that she was no longer doing the brunch. We blocked this table out specifically for her and she did a no show. Now you want to show up for dinner unexpectedly with 15 ppl and expect the service to be fast and you want to complain but you didn't even let us know you won't attend for brunch."" I'm standing there like ""woosah Jana woosah"" because the attitude from her went 0 to 100 real quick and it was uncalled for. Yes Marela you're right, my friend was wrong for not contacting the restaurant to inform you that we will not make it for brunch, but we are here for dinner with more ppl than we reserved for the brunch so your money is still being made (Point 1), your goal as a director is to always satisfy your patrons and try your best to meet their needs not play tit for tat because you're still bitter over the brunch situation (Point 2), and you should never become unprofessional when a customer is politely and respectfully expressing the way they feel about the service they are receiving ESPECIALLY when their name is Jana Parker and they can become ghetto like Shanaynay in 3 f$#%in seconds (Point 3). If that's even a point. Oh and it gets better...So after I decided to discuss this with her, I guess she wanted to screw with us more and decided to send the security to our table to tell us we were too loud. Half of the party was in the bathroom at this time and the other half (including myself) was at the table quiet as shit. It was an irritating experience and I was just so surprised at how everything was handled. The food was mediocre as always. The only thing this place is really REALLY good for is the brunch on Sundays. I'll give it that. I've had the same type of sucky service the other times that I visited outside of the brunch on Sundays. I always feel as though they're slow, but this was the last straw. After building up a $2,000 bill and being treated like assholes because we're young and are hungry ppl. that have issues waiting 2 hours for our food, I realized that I have to let go of this place.Bye bye bye *N'sync voice*Oh, and I forgot to mention...remember I said we were at the bar the whole time right? It was NOT busy during brunch to the point where that ""blocked out section"" would have made the restaurant lose ANY MONEY AT ALL. BYE FELICIA!",6,7,4
26,Samantha M.,"Valley Stream, NY",69,19,5,1.0,7/24/2016,"Maybe the prettiest restaurant I've been to in NY, but unfortunately THE WORST service. We waited 20 minutes for a table (4) during breakfast time.... Only to walk into a dining room where more than half the tables were unoccupied. Fine....We sit and wait and wait and wait, then finally a sweaty nervous bus boy asked to bring us drinks.Moments later the snotty waitress with a bad attitude comes over to rush us through our order. (Sorry, do you have somewhere to be that you are rushing to recite my order as quickly as possible)Then the coffee comes and the bus boy asks if he can use the disposable cups we got from the lobby to fill the coffee. (Shortage on dish soap maybe?)Then we wait and wait and wait, no one ever comes to proactively fill drinks or check on us or give an update on breakfast. Finally, scrambled eggs, yogurt and pancakes are here... And well it was scrambled eggs, yogurt and pancakes. So $70 later I feel full but annoyed that I spent our hard working money on such a terrible experiencePeople don't go to places like this because of the scrambled eggs, but for the experience and this was a terrible experience So sad, I love spending money on wonderful experiences for my kids and I.

We went there during the Labor Day surf expo a few years ago and had horrible greasy scallops. 20% gratuity added to a party of two? We were perfectly polite until the waiter stole my husband's iPhone during the meal. We had to skip my friend Laurie's BBQ and fill out a police report. Management was hostile.

When finally the  drinks came we ordered off the bar menu and the regular menu. The couple of items on the regular menu came pretty soon. An over spiced Tuna tartar and a pretty good lobster roll. Then we waited and waited for the other apps. (Empanadas, pigs in blankets, pot stickers, and mini burgers) Finally after complaining twice to the bartender he went to the kitchen to find out what was going wrong. He came back with excuses but no food. Finally 2 HOURS later HALF our apps came out but after three hours we never got the pot stickers or the dogs.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the view of the beach and Boardwalk is spectacular, I felt like I was in a five star Manhattan restaurant. Unfortunately there were too many negatives- the waiter was friendly, professional and gave as good service as he could, but the place was clearly understaffed. We were waiting an eternity for our food and were completely underwhelmed when it arrived. I had the roast chicken restaurant week special, which quite frankly was mediocre, as were all the other dishes. Everything took so long and we ended up being there for almost 3 hours!We'll probably be back, but only for drinks, not to eat.",4,,
34,Jack T.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",3,31,66,1.0,7/10/2016,"I was vey dissapointed with this place only because the food wasn't very good for the price they charge. Come on now, $30.00 for a pork chop is outrageous.  Do you know how cheap pork is. It looked great but was over cooked, I ordered it medium rare. My wife and our friends ordered the salmon, medium rare, which was overdone and inedible.  We told the manager Kerry and she said that the chef cooks it to his temperature liking.Well if he wants it overdone than he should pay for it.  She said she would take the desserts of the bill. I asked why not the 3 orders of dried out salmon? She finallly adjusted the bill but should have compted the desserts to show remorse. Even the desserts came out at different times. Bad, Bad , Bad! The bill  was till close to four hundred dollars! Six people. We also spent another $150.00 for drinks waiting for our table. I heard that this restaurant is in trouble and maybe they don't care if it closes, but if I'm wrong that get your *#*# together before that happens. A restaurant is only as good as the chef and his kitchen but maybe its time for the chef to change his attitude and humble himself. I heard McDonald's is hiring. Time to start over. Good luck",1,1,1
35,Lauren F.,"Williston Park, NY",0,35,16,2.0,6/11/2017,"Let me start with the good: gorgeous, eloquent restaurant with ocean views.Now, the service. Arrived early for my dinner reservation on Saturday night, but was seated right away as there was no wait (red flag at a restaurant with ocean views going for it?). After being seated, my date and I were not greeted by a server for about 15 minutes. When the server finally came to the table, he asked if we would like to order ""a drink from the bar."" We awkwardly told him that yes we would like to order drinks and we also knew what we wanted as an appetizer and main course with all that spare time sitting there. He took everything down and left. It was another 15 minutes until he returned with our drinks (yes I wrote the time down in my phone). So we were sitting at this table for a half hour before even getting our DRINK. A restaurant this fancy and expensive should have more experienced and polished wait staff, in my opinion. The food was decent. I had two drinks - a frozen adult lemonade which was good, but the red sangria had no fruit in it, tasted nasty and was $14 for a small cup of apparently bottled sangria. It was basically red wine with ice in it. This restaurant has soooo much potential but it's just not running right for some reason.",,,
36,MarieAnne B.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,8,0,2.0,7/24/2016,"Food prices are average. Food is inconsistent - some things acceptable - some terrible.  Service is awful. You will wait and wait and wait. The burgher may arrive without the cheese, without the ketchup. It likely won't be cooked as you requested on bread other than what is described. Stale bread on the tables. And so it goes.Oysters and mussels were good.Salmon was good.Pork chop was like shoe leather.Fried zucchini was barely acceptable.Nothing was great. Overall disappointing.",1,,
37,Brigitte G.,"Glen Head, NY",12,36,51,2.0,10/5/2015,"Service leaves much to be desired. Tried to have a simple caesar salad with no dressing, yet asked for it on the side. Pretty simple. Right? Salad came dressed and when asked for another one with out, the questions began. How did I want it? Wait what? With nothing on the lettuce at all? Did I want any dressing? Oh you must be dieting... Oh you sir, must be retrained on basic service. I can ask for whatever I'd like for my $16 Caesar salad. Ok?Food is mediocre at best. What a shame for a pretty restaurant (1 start) and a nice location (2nd star).",,,
38,Thomas W.,"Long Island, NY",224,62,5,4.0,9/30/2015,The food was great and the atmosphere is even better being on the boardwalk and all. The only con is I think it is way overpriced.  Don't get me wrong I love the food.Also the bar is a great place to have a drink with a few buddies after work.,,,
39,Geo V.,"Island Park, NY",68,169,441,2.0,2/22/2016,"It gets a two star because of the atmosphere and location. Located in the Allegria Hotel on the boardwalk in Long Beach. Four of us went for Sunday brunch. It was a generous thank you for helping some friends. (I didn't pay.) The bill was over $300, quite a bit of money for the service and quality of food. We had at least four different waiters and they could use proper training and food handling. Some were friendly and others just rude. Our coffee got cold before they brought milk to the table twice. The cup was dirty and needed to be changed ( no biggie it happens). I ordered  mimosas with breakfast, they were $10 each and tasted mostly OJ. It was a four course price fix. First course was gravlax on toast with herb cream cheese, the lox tasted way too fishy and smelled. Second course I ordered diced fruit, it was served in a soup bowl and was chopped to death, tiny bits of melons swimming in juices served in a soup bowl, it looked like fruit soup,  Terrible!! But it got worse, the lobster frittata was extremely dry and over cooked I felt like I was choking on it. The company and view  was great so I didn't mind the extremely lax waiter service, even though they constantly came to the table to see if everything was ok. It took quite awhile for them to answer our requests. The  final course I got the gelato. It came out like soup. So disappointed  in the quality of food and  service for the price. Skip the restaurant, but don't miss the boardwalk!! There are plenty of other options on the Avenue or in the West End and less pricey.  Oh yeah and they added the tip in the bill which was not cool, but ended up with less then our standard tip.",2,1,1
40,Serena D.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",48,9,0,2.0,3/7/2015,"just ok. Great location - overlooking the beach. The hotel and decor are impressive, but food leaves so much to be desired. My husband and I went for dinner and it wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Granted, I am vegetarian and asked for an altered dish so maybe that threw them off.  I got pasta with veggies that reminded me of a bad option for the kid's menu. My husband got the rack of lamb and didn't even finish it. With all that hoopla surrounding the hotel and restaurant, they should get a proper chef to cook decent food. That being said, the wait staff was nice.",2,1,

42,Derek H.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,66,0,1.0,5/18/2015,"First, the positives. The view from the dining room is beautiful, right on the Long Beach boardwalk with a lovely vista of the beach. The restaurant dining room is also beautifully designed, and the food is occasionally the equal of the view. Not today, however. Now, the negatives and there are many. The restaurant is miserably managed. The hostess greeted us and told us we'd have to wait a few minutes while our table of four could be set up. We waited about ten minutes and we were escorted to an interior table in a virtually empty restaurant. I asked to be seated by the window so we could view the ocean,and  the hostess said we'd have to wait another 15 minutes for the table to be set. We're talking four glasses and foot sets of silverware! We decided to just sit down at the interior table. We waited about fifteen minutes and we still have not yet seen a waiter. The manager did come by and we told him we were upset that we couldn't sit Blythe window and he replied, ""of course you can."" He moved us and finally a waiter arrived to bring us water. We ordered our meals and then waited a full half hour before we saw the waiter again. No bread service was served, and my medium rare burger at $18 arrived well done. The short ribs sandwich was dry and the salmon was overlooked. We would have complained but our waiter wasn't to be found. I flagged down the manager to bring some coffee and we got just one cup before the waiter dropped a rather hefty bill and proceeded to disappear again.  I wish there were another restaurant to dine at in Long Beach but alas, the restaurant industry died here after Hurricane Sandy. Skip Atlantica and go to Four Guys instead for burgers!",,1,

The next course was a choice, we both had the steak both ordered medium rare, one showed up medium the other one a rare.

Went for brunch and I went out of my comfort zone by getting an omelet with peppers and goat cheese. I like all of those flavors separately but weren't my favorite together. Also, my boyfriend got the French toast which tasted really good, and we ordered a side of bacon (over priced at $7 for three strips) to share. As we were walking out we told ourselves we'd be back for a sunset dinner. Unfortunately, that was the only meal we ate together that day and we both got sick that night. I don't think we'll be making the trip back.",,,
48,Renee W.,"Rockville Centre, NY",21,118,10,4.0,4/7/2014,"Great Brunch!! After stopping by Atlantica /Allegria Hotel for drinks a few times after walking the boardwalk, we decided to stop dreaming about the Brunch Buffet we were always ogling, and go experience it.  Suffice it to say, we will be back!First tip: Make a reservation in advance, and request the dining room. While there are some highboy tables in the bar/lounge area, it gets quite crowded with people standing around & almost bumping into your table. (This might be a good thing if you're a 20-something looking for a casual daytime date experience - great for people watching).  If you're looking to relax a bit, get the dining room.  We called up the morning-of and were told that we could be seated at 2:30.  When we arrived, our table was ready immediately and located along the windows so we had a perfect ocean view.Second tip: Don't eat anything before coming here! Cold seafood platters feature Alaskan King Crab Legs (not salty at all, just sweet & perfect), lobster tails and claws, huge shrimp cocktail.  You could stay here all day and be happy, but there's more... Egg omelet station, Belgian Waffle station, assorted pastries (very fresh!), assorted salads like curry mango, black bean & corn, ceviche, caesar, cubed cheeses, fresh salumi meats, dried fruits & nuts and brie (CON: We arrived at 2:30, left at 5, and the hot brie was empty when we arrived & never replenished. But that was the only Con). Let's continue on the food: Sushi bar, asian dumplings, 3 hot chafing dishes that probably changes: Chicken Cordon Bleu, Branzino w/couscous, Shell steak w/fingerling potatoes.  Creamed spinach and sauteed veggies.  Prime Rib and Leg of Lamb at the carving station. A pasta station featuring THE BEST mushroom ravioli with champagne sauce i've ever had (how odd to be impressed by ravioli - but we kept raving about it!). Everything was cooked perfectly, and replenished frequently (except the brie, as noted).  Dessert table was long & varied: nutella crepes, homemade cakes, little pastries, ice cream bar, and bread pudding made out of croissants (my husband was still talking about this last one this morning when he woke up!).Drinks: plentiful and strong. They kept them coming (none of this usual b.s. of ""gee if we serve them the unlimited drinks slowly we'll save money).  Our server was excellent and as soon as we hit a low point in the glass the next one arrived. Also - they go beyond the standard Mimosa, offering mimosas with guava, pear, etc. and the hubby was thrilled with the Spicy Bloodymary he requested.Service: On Top Of It!! Can't say enough good things - these folks have been through training and it shows.  Plates are cleared immediately, when you come back to your chair with the next plate of food your new silverware & folded napkin await you. You don't wait for anything - while you have your Main Server, everyone is there to take care of you and it's service with a smile.  Price: $57 + tax & tip. This ended up coming to an even $150 for 2 people since we really enjoyed the hours-long excellent service and food.  We can't wait to go back, taking friends with us.  Bottom Line:  GO!!  and bring your walking shoes with you so you can walk the boardwalk afterwards and try to lessen the guilt you'll feel at enjoying this feast!",5,,
49,Pat C.,"Hempstead, NY",8,68,19,2.0,5/5/2012,"Consider this a placemark. I will be dining here with guests tonight and then will update my review. Based on some of the other reviews, I don't really know what to expect, but I am hopeful! Oh well, we shall see.  :)Edit: And now the update.First the good. The lobster risotto appetizer is out of this world! Also, our waiter John was very good.As to the rest, I hadn't even entered the bulding and I was down $10. Yes, they charge for valet parking. The place was extremely noisy with loud music coming from the lounge area. Add that to all tile, glass and chrome and you have one very noisy place. The duck entree was sub par. It included a duck drumstick (no thigh portion) that was overcooked and dry and a rare sliced breast. The skin was crispy though and the sweet potato puree and sauce was good. We opted to take our deserts to go and instead have a cordial. They were rather small (see picture). Prices are very high! Bottles of wine are at least 4 times retail.Summary: This is one of those places that you see pictures of in the NY Post of trendy hot spots in Manhattan where all the celebs go. Except no celebs and no Manhattan. So, why 2 stars instead of one? It has a nice ocean view and some of the food was ok. Frankly, I think that lobster risotto lifted the rating higher than it really should be.",3,1,1

The Waitress and other worker were soo attentive to us. I let them know what the occasion was before arriving and when we got there they had Champagne waiting for everyone when they arrived.

The buffet does include cold seafood like lobster, clams, and even oysters. It also includes alcoholic beverages like wine and screwdrivers. The salad bar section did not seem as fresh as some of the other sections, so that was disappointing something so simple was not good. The food was good but not great, but the value is there if you like seafood and alcohol. I would go back again for the buffet and would like to see how the menu is on other nights. The fact that there is a lounge/bar with a DJ outside the restaurant and out is literally right on the boardwalk only makes the place more attractive.

Never having been at the restaurant before, I asked if it was easy access from the parking lot. For someone who is handicapped this restaurant is not easy to get to. One must enter the hotel walk to the elevators then take the elevator to the second floor which involves another walk down the hallway. Our reservation was for 2:30 but because this was an involved excursion we arrived 10 minutes late. The manager told me he could not serve us because of the 10 minutes. After the long walk, we had to get up out of our seats and walk back to the car. I have never encountered such rudeness and clear contempt for the handicapped. If you are handicapped and are going to this restaurant I advise leaving 20 minutes just to get to your table. I will never give this restaurant another chance and the manager should be fired.",,,

I was so excited to take my friends from out of town to the brunch this weekend, but sadly, when I arrived I was told they don't have the brunch anymore! We were starving and the menu was terrible...I was very disappointed, BUT the assistant manager (I think) convinced us to stay and try it. We sat for a while and couldn't order from the limited menu. The assistant manager came to check on us several times and was genuinely trying to make our meal excellent so she gave us the option to order from the all day menu.

Although it's a little pricey, the food was very good, and the portions were sufficient. Service was terrible. Despite the restaurant only being half full, our waitress was largely absent. I ordered a glass of wine during appetizers, and halfway through my entree I still did not have it. When I asked a busboy if he could find out where it is, he seemed perplexed at the very thought of going to get our waitress, and completely disregarded my request. I also don't find it appropriate to interrupt my conversation to ask if I would like any more ""regular water""...just fill my glass if it's empty. I think Atlantica is trying way too hard to be something it's simply not. It's Long Beach, not Miami. They need to focus on hiring competent, friendly staff and improving their dishes (and prices).",3,,

Updated review","Came here for my birthday and well as I said last time I really couldnt have asked for anything more from this chic place in long beach Nassau county, ny.  Where can you find an upscale Miami beach vibe place in ny? The service was great. I was served by Andrew who was great. He had alot of personality and we bonded immediately. The food was served perfectly on time, I really didn't have to wait much.I would highly recommend the grilled jumbo shrimp salad. I have never seen shrimp so large in my life but boy was it delicious. I had told andrew that my main reason for coming back was for the the soufflé. He kindly informed me that the day that I had it was just for the holiday. I was disappointed but continued my meal nonetheless. After my third round of drinks Andrew had come to my table with MY SOUFFLE! The chef had ESPECIALLY made it for me! Can we say great service? Can We say someone who doesn't know you going above and beyond? Yes!! Very impressed and exceptionally  happy the souffle was as orgasmic as I had remembered.

80,Nel A.,"Manhattan, NY",53,393,17,3.0,4/16/2012,"Food was pretty good for all you can eat. The price is pretty steal tho. Guess you are paying for location in addition your food. The service staff was very attentive and friendly. My favorite was the sushi station. The decor is not so comfy. I think they could do with some warn colora inside. It feel a little too bright. The boardwalk and beach provides enough light and sun. The restaurant could be 'warmer':)Overall we had a good time.45$ for all you can eat brunch. With 1 cocktail and unlimited coffee and tea. Too much food!!! Good quality. Everything you want for brunch! Great view off the boardwalk. Bagels, lox, creme cheese, made to order omelets, made to order sushi, oysters, fruits, smoked salmon, lots of pasta salads, nuts, beef, pork, French toast, crepes, bacon and eggs in all different ways.",,,
81,Glen G.,"Manhattan, NY",13,38,0,1.0,8/12/2014,Rude staff. Told us there was a 45-60 minute wait when most tables were empty!!! We could not even wait at the bar as it was closed for a wedding. Extremely loud music. After 30 minutes I asked for the manager to inquire about why we were waiting when tables were empty. He responded with the wait would be at least 20 more minutes!!!! He also stated that we couldn't be seated until our friend removed his fedora. What?!?! Did I mention rude? Left and went to Sutton Place and had a great dinner.,,,
82,Cee K.,"Long Beach, NY",0,38,0,2.0,5/11/2012,"I would give 2 1/2 stars if I could. The food is uneven here. During restaurant week I had a lovely seafood dinner with equally nice sides. The romaine salad, more like a caesar was one of the best I had. Two weeks later it was a different experience. The fish was bland, the cubes of butternut squash overcooked. I appreciate that the kitchen is trying to serve organic vegetables but if I wanted steamed vegetables I would go to a macrobiotic restaurant. The vegetables are too bland.The location is wonderful but I think the kitchen needs some panache. And the dessert platter they put out for large groups tastes like it came right out of the walk in. Every body loves goodies at the end of a meal but I would rather have a little taste of something wonderful as opposed to a platter of mediocre.I will give them kudos for their bread, homemade is always good. I want to like this place more but I like to pay for consistency.",,,

Amazing decor and food!First, when making the reservation (in person) Andrew mentioned he was serving the night we were coming, I asked what he recommended, he immediately said the duck, without hesitation.  Come Saturday, Andrew was indeed our server, he also recommended the potato leek soup, I had it, my date had the lobster bisque, both delicious!  Main course was the duck (lol) and scallops for my date, again both excellent.The staff was friendly, and service was superb, our Pellegrino was always refilled, and Andrew was attentive and personable throughout.  Great place and I will go back!",,,
84,Michael G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,19,0,2.0,1/18/2014,"Context: I live in Manhattan and eat out frequently. I am not fazed by paying $40 for a main course, etc. There is a short list of pros: reasonably accommodating, if distracting hostess. Excellent Russian busboy/waiter/water filler - very friendly and accommodating through imperfect English. As for the rest, a very poor wines by the glass list. Basically all low-tier below average wines at a markup of 400-800%. The wines by the bottle have some good options, but are also exorbitantly over-priced, even by Manhattan hotel standards. Most importantly, the food is just mediocre, both for seafood and turf. Unimaginative and not especially well executed. My check came to around $150 and I could have prepared it for $40 and would have been satisfied paying a restaurant $80-100. In short, not returning.",,,
85,Jim S.,"Mineola, NY",0,4,0,2.0,9/2/2015,"Dissapointing.  Great location and nice lively vibe gets crushed by a mediocre kitchen. Tonight we were served stale bread, measly pre-frozen shrimp, a fatty steak. The pasta was better but still overcooked. Stick to the bar and some appys. They all look the part and the service was pretty good. But in the end, if the food disappoints at every turn, why bother. To their credit, we were provided a discount when we explained our experience.",,,
86,Christina V.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,2.0,7/12/2011,"I've eaten at the Atlantica at The Allegria Hotel, twice. I heard a lot about this place and looked it up online and became a fan immediately. I thought the chic design and location would be perfect for a weekend getaway or lunch on the beach. I guess my expectations were too high.My first experience was in the winter time, when they were less busy, less crowded. I just had to check it out. Service was ""ok"", food was pretty good.My most recent experience was last week, July 5,2011. I arrived at the hotel and paid for lounge chairs with the cabana boys (who were pretty helpful, although they could have brought to my attention that it was possible to order lunch on the beach, cash only). It seemed like I had to ask a lot of questions before getting any answers. I'm not trying to sound snobbish, I've worked in the hospitality industry for many years and have given pretty good service in my time... When people are looking for a day of relaxation, they don't want to work too hard to get comfortable (especially if they've never been to the hotel before). Just give them what they want and you'll reap the benefits (make a new friend, get a good tip, etc.) So we decided to have lunch in the restaurant. The hosts were unsure of where to seat us. We did mention that we may be 5 people, but only 3 were present. There was one table available by the window set up as a 4-top, most of the restaurant was empty (that was the table we wanted). The hosts then made a phone call to ask a manager if we could fit 5 people at the 4-top (they couldn't decide on their own). If I were hosting, I would say ""We have a 4-top available by the window, we can seat you there, but we will have to move you if the rest of your party arrives."" Doesn't that make sense?? They should know that people want to sit near the window for a boardwalk view, if it's available. They weren't busy, but they were short-staffed. So, we sat down for lunch with Melody (fun, enthusiastic, hardworking waitress) who seemed to know the restaurant ropes. It appeared to me that her team was lacking in knowledge, speed, etc., she seemed to be on the ball. We ordered our cocktails and some shellfish to start. Low and behold the shellfish came out before our cocktails! That's a NO NO! And the shellfish (oysters, clams, shrimp) came out without a cocktail fork or demitasse spoon for the vinegar. I had to ask the bus boy for them.We then ordered the rest of our meal. I was pleased with the food and after two martinis, I didn't care about the service. All in all, it wasn't a great experience, but I'll give them some time. They have only been open for a year or so. Maybe my review will help them hire more experienced staff, like myself.",1,,

88,Che W.,"Elmont, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/7/2015,The worst service ever. The food was sub par. The wine list was larger than the menu. In my opinion i would of had a better time eatting at applebees. So Me and my fiance planned a 2 day getaway and stayed at the hotel for my birthday. We made the reservations at the atlantica 2 weeks in advance and even requested a table that had a view of the boardwalk and ocean. When we went to dinner the hostess gave us a table facing a wall... legit a wall. We had absolutely no view and we're forced to eat facing a wall. Before we sat we even questioned the hostess on why we were getting such horrid seating and her reply was that the other tables were reserved for larger parties which never arrived. But as we were eating 20 mins into our appetizer a party of 2 was seated behind us with an absolutely beautiful view of the ocean... basically what I dreamed of...seated directly behind us at a 4top table with only the 2 of them eating. Honestly this ruined my birthday getaway and I will never be eating at this establishment again.,,,
89,Glenn H.,"Massapequa, NY",5,46,0,1.0,7/1/2013,"Beautiful décor, overlooking the ocean, well you can't eat atmosphere.  The Hostess led us to a small table with A COLUMN INFRONT OF THE OCEAN VIEW, and rolled her eyes when we asked to move. Now mind you ,there was only ONE other table occupied in the whole restaurant ! You have to wait for someone to bring you your ""allotted"" one roll ( and please don't ask for a second ). Appetizer salads will fit in the palm of your hand, and $30 for  4 pan seared scallops , made this a very uneventful, disappointing meal.",,1,1
90,Tom M.,"East Northport, NY",0,6,0,1.0,4/22/2014,"Where do I begin???I had purchased a TRAVELZOO voucher and used it earlier this year at the ATLANTICA RESTAURANT located in the ALLEGRIA HOTEL.  First I was charged for the entire bill before the $100 voucher was deducted, i never noticed this until after I arriveed back home. I phoned the restaurant numerous times over the next two weeks only to be shuffled from the manager to the accounting department and now I discovered that the restaurant has made an unauthorized charge to my credit card, so besides not receiving my credit fot the TRAVELZOO voucher they have banged my card for more money. DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY ON PURCHASING A TRAVELZOO VOUCHER OR DINING AT THE ATLANTICA, BOTH HAVE NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. PS.

91,Seahee P.,"Manhattan, NY",184,54,41,3.0,2/21/2011,"I went here for the President's day wknd. I stayed at the Allegria hotel and dined at Atlantica for dinner. Since the restaurant is located right by the beach I expected a beach view. But after the sunset there is absolutely no light out. So all you see is black darkness. Inside decoration was nice, yet considering their food price it should've been nicer. The jellyfish-like lamps are only located in the middle of the restaurant. I thought it would've been better if they are decorated all throughout the restaurant. For food, I ordered chef's special platter of fresh seafood (oysters, clams, chilled lobster, shrimp....), which tasted excellent. They were very fresh and tasteful. I was very satisfied. (Although the shrimps were a bit over cooked, and wished lobster was served with melted butter sauce.) My friend ordered prefix course with lobster bisque, flounder, and three flavored ice-cream. I loved the appetizer and the main course but there was nothing special about their homemade ice-cream. Service wise, as other Yelpers rated, service is slow. However, our waitress was very attentive and helpful.Overall, their seafood was very satisfying, yet don't expect too much before going. If you are in the area it's worth of trying but don't travel all the way here for just the food.",1,,
92,Donald H.,"Jamaica, NY",81,3,0,1.0,7/24/2015,"So this morning 7/24/15 my wife and I who reside in Long Beach decided to bike the boardwalk and have breakfast at the Allegria.  We sat down ordered 2 ice coffees and about 10:40 ordered our breakfast.   EASY RIGHT?  WRONG.  The food came out about 25 minutes later (restaurant was like empty) and it was cold.  The service was horrible.  We walked out not wanting to wait any longer for breakfast in an establishment that has no clue what they are doing.  The Maitre D would not let us leave unless we paid for our coffees.  First of all suck it up and eat the two damn coffees.  She was nasty but I wound up paying and left.  Such an easy breakfast became a nightmare.  Like I said I reside in Long Beach and your service and attitude sucks.  You would think that  maybe you  should be nice to your customers because I am a local and would have loved to try dinner there.  Now that not happening.  Funny thing is i heard so many bad things about the service at the Allegria.   Admit you were wrong, don't charge me a penny for the coffees, and maybe say sorry ""I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT'.  I am going back tomorrow morning to express my displeasure to a manager.  Be warned folks NOT the place to eat.",,,
93,Kimmie S.,"New York, NY",86,177,0,2.0,6/6/2010,"I would give it a 1.5 stars if I could but since I can't I'll stick with 2. Jacob Y stayed with us and although we were thinking of going to Jing Fong after a huge party from the night before, we weren't going to make the drive. Our neighbor the night before had mentioned that they were going to Atlantica and we saw them afterwards and he had a good experience. Now, we live a couple of streets from this hotel and I remember watching it being built thinking about how amazing it would be to have a place so close by to get brunch and have drinks. I also remember when they opened hearing reviews that weren't so amazing about the food. As someone who has reached out to their PR to cover their hotel and never hearing a response, I was super skeptical.The hotel definitely have a South Beach vibe which is great as I travel there a lot and stay at the Loews. After letting the door guy know that we weren't guests and were just coming for brunch (which was listed on the outside that they were having it) we finally got in and it is a gorgeous space. It's one where you want to come and hang out when you don't feel like hitting the bars. The wine room and everything is really fab.After we were seated our waiter must have been tired but told us that there was no brunch which sucked as we were in the brunch hour and the sign said that they had it. Looking at the menu, I felt it was a bit all over the place but I wanted to give it a shot. My Bloody Mary had way too much lemon in it and only after stirring did I get the horseraddish. My meal was a shrimp in pita with a chipotle sauce but everything was fried and a little goes a long way. Jacob had a duck confit that he was less enthused over and my boyfriend another foodie had a crabcake that wasn't anything to write about.It's a shame as I would come back for drinks and to order dessert in one of their bar areas but it would have been nice to have a hotel bar that was fun. It would also be nice to have a place that encouraged guests of the hotel as well as the locals who would love to support it. I hope that they continue to tweak their concepts and come up with a truly fun beach menu with South Beach flavor which doesn't mean fried.",5,,

95,Joe C.,"Merrick, NY",35,8,8,1.0,7/18/2012,"I dont write many reviews, I'm not a very picky person at all.  I laugh when people write about service, because I feel like sometimes they are the ones being too demanding.   Well, I stand corrected.   Let me tell you about my experience at Atlantica at the Allegria Hotel.First let me describe the place: nothing special.   It looks like a Miami Beach hotel lobby, and thats not a compliment.  Its ""ok"".  But, I chose Atlantica for one reason only - I was taking my girlfriend out for a birthday dinner and her only request was ""a place with a view"".   A friend recommended this place so I gave it a shot.   Lets talk about the view ... breathtaking? Nah not really - I believe there are more impressive views at other restaurants in Long Island.   This restaurant is at boardwalk level - if they built it just two or three stories up - it would have been a dramatically more impressive view.   Its nothing to write home about.We went on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm -  I'd guess there was maybe ten tables filled (so it was a pretty empty restaurant).  We were promptly seated, the hostess gave us dinner menus, the busboy filled our waters, and there we were.    I asked the busboy for a drink menu, and he said the waitress will be with us (not sure why he couldnt just oblige and grab the menu for us).  Anyhow, 15 minutes passed and no waitress - none even stopped by to say 'be right with you'.   They were around, and there were several working that night - but we were paid no mind.   The table next to us was experiencing similar.   What we really wanted was to order drinks to loosen up a bit to better accept the bad service.   But again, no waitress in sight.  We plotted out how we would order appetizer, request a drink menu, quickly make a choice while we ordered dinner ... it was a finely tuned plan to reduce our waiting time.  (We were in no rush, just frustrated).  20 minutes and still no waiter.   So I said ""I'm gonna go get a drink menu"".  So I got up from my seat and found a waitress and asked for one - she said ""I'll be right with you"", I told her I just want the menu so we have time to look it over.  She said ""cocktails or wine""? I said both... she handed me the wine list, but she looked all over the wait station for the cocktail list and didnt find it, and probably did put the 30 seconds of effort into looking for it - and said she'd go find one.   5 minutes later and she never showed (Mind you, we're 25 minutes in and she hasnt come to the table yet).  I got up again to find a cocktail menu, I found someone who looked like a manager of some sorts, she said ""your waitress can give you it"" - I said, ""We've been here 25 minutes and she hasnt come to the table"".  She also looked and couldnt find one - I pointed at where we were seated and let her know to bring the menu when she finds it.    At that point our frustration levels were topping out.  My girlfriend and I talked about whether or not to leave.  I said, ""eh, we've waited this long - lets just get drinks and relax"".   The managery-looking woman brought us a cocktail menu (in a leather folded binder).   I gave a one last ""do you want to stay or leave?"" option to my girlfriend.  She said ""Ok, if the cocktail menu sucks - lets just leave"".  I hand her the menu, she opened up the leather binder.... and its empty.   It was comically pathetic at that point.  We got up, I went and found the woman who gave it to me and I handed it back and said ""This is what you just gave me"", and we walked out.I never walked out of a restaurant before, I'd have said before that I'm not that type.  But this was a new level of idiocy I've never experienced before.  As we walked out the door, our waitress was walking in - looked right at me and didnt say a word.   Not even a question of concern for why we're walking out.  Now maybe she didnt recognize me, but let me remind you, there was maybe 10 tables seated in the restaurant when we left.A ditzy waitress - ok, it happens.  A busy restaurant - fine, that happens.  But a nearly empty restaurant on a weeknight where none of the several waitresses, hostess, supervisors and general manager realize that a couple has been seated for half an hour without even a greeting.  And no one appropriately responded to specifically being pointed out that we've received no service after 25 minutes... I'm not surprised that this virtually brand new hotel has already undergone bankruptcy. P.S. you wont find a menu online with prices, so I'll clue you in -  the menu is overpriced, limited, and frankly looked pretty bland and uninspired anyhow.  By the way, after we left - we headed over to a restaurant in Freeport on the water, not the ocean, but a nice view.  I said to my girlfriend ""Can you believe, we've been here for 20 minutes - our order has been taken, we've been served drinks and we're already eating our appetizer""... a stark contrast to our experience at Allegria.  The worst restaurant service I've experienced.",2,1,1
96,Joe Z.,"Wantagh, NY",1,89,0,2.0,2/15/2012,"I took my chick to the Atlantica for Valentines Day. They had a ""five course"" price fixed menu for $75 per person. Location is awesome, right on the boardwalk, overlooking the ocean. Sadly, we were seated in the dinning room by the big windows but directly in front of a post. Couldn't see the ocean if we wanted to. The first course, pumpkin tortellini, was incredible. It was by the far the best dish of the night and one of the best tortellini dishes that I have ever had. Unfortunately, it was down hill from there. Next up was a vegetable dish with goat cheese. I forget the exact name but it was OK. Nothing special. The third course was some ""salad"" dish. Again, I forget the name but I know it was terrible. It came out with two, TWO, pieces of romaine lettuce rolled up with artichoke hearts on top of it along with dressing. It looked interesting but the taste was lacking. Not to mention it was simply TWO pieces of lettuce. It was comical to call this the ""third course.""The fourth and main course was a filet mignon. I got mine prepared at medium rare and my chick got hers at medium. I dont pretend to be a food connoisseur but I have had filet mignon many times before and my initial impression was that the ""filet mignon"" didn't even look right. Most restaurants serve it as small thick portion. Our steaks came out looking more like a piece of london broil - wide and flat. Maybe they ran out and tried to pass off another cut as a filet - who knows. My steak was not tender at all. It was very chewy with an inexplicable smokey taste. The steak also came out with no seasoning and when we asked for some table salt, the waiter sprinkled large chunks of sea salt on the top of our steaks (just put some salt and pepper on the damn table!). My steak's temperature - medium rare - was pretty good although I thought it was slightly undercooked (which I don't think I ever have said in a restaurant). However, it was quite obvious that the waiter screwed up the orders and gave my medium rare to my chick and I got her medium. Inexcusable. I mean your only job in life is to give me the food I ordered, not the food someone else ordered and you screwed it up. I love medium rare steak but this was more like black and blue. It was, even for me, barely consumable because it was so rare. The fifth course was desert. My chick got sorbet which I tasted and found horrific. I got cinnamon ice cream on an apple. Apparently it takes about 15-20 minutes to prepare this desert. It was good but not worth the wait. I would say at this point, my experience was ok. Probably worth a three star rating and maybe four if I forgot about a few issues and focused on that incredible pumpkin tortellini. But I gave a two star rating (and wanted to give it a one but I felt that may be too harsh) because of how the night ended. When the waiter gave me the bill (before my chick was finished eating her dessert and after I waited for 15 minutes for them to serve the dessert - very tacky and borderline rude) I realized there was an automatic 20% gratuity. I didn't have a party of 8 (only 2) and the gratuity was still added! I didn't know about this but it seems that this is standard operating procedure for this place. I can't even begin to tell you what an incredible turnoff this was. First, 15% is a traditional tip. So this place feels that their wait staff, which was slow and screwed up delivering the food correctly - the only friggin task they have been hired to do - is entitled to a 5% premium over the traditional tipping rate. Unbelievable. Second, while this is not legal advice and should not be relied on, it appears that required tips are fugazi. NY courts have held a tip to be DISCRETIONARY!!!! The courts have also held that a tip is not legally enforceable, even if the restaurant declares it mandatory!Some places have attempted to claim that they can apply a mandatory ""service charge,"" something they argue is not a gratuity if they tell you in advance. I was never told in advance. Thankfully, recently enacted NYS Department of Labor regulations account for such BS claims:There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any charge in addition to charges for food,beverage...including but not limited to any charge for ""service"" or ""food service"" is a charge purported to be a gratuity."" 12 N.Y.C.R.R. Sec 146-2.18(b) Meaning any extra charge, especially for a party of two, will most likely be considered a gratuity -- a discretionary payment which they are unable of legally requiring you to pay. So tip what you want. It was Valentine's Day and I didn't feel like making a scene but if I ever go back, I will not be FORCED to tip anything. And the final insult - the part of the check I sign had a prompt for a tip even though I was already forced to tip 20%!!! What a bunch of clowns! I probably won't recommend this place unless it just for drinks.",6,,2
97,Sandy P.,"Glastonbury, CT",128,286,101,4.0,8/19/2012,"We are so disappointed that this place has been getting bad reviews. We visited the Atlantica Hotel last weekend to view the venue for our upcoming wedding scheduled for October next year. The restaurant was delish!Atmosphere: AThe dining room is very clean with modern decor and clean lines. I agree that the view would be much better if they had this on the second or third floor. If you sit at the window tables, you have a direct view of the boardwalk and the people walking by have a direct view of you as well. However, this didn't bother us at all.Service: A+The waitress and assistant waiter was attentive, friendly, and accurate! Our drinks were refilled promptly and the assistant had our plates and table cleaned just as we were taking our last bites. The waitress also made some great recommendations for our first time there. A big bonus - the chef, Todd Jacobs, came out to introduce himself and to talk about his favorite dishes on the menu. He gave us a great overview of the philosophy of his cooking and how he uses quality, fresh, organic ingredients. I think this was a nice touch, especially since we are planning our wedding and may use him as our chef for our special day.Food: A+We started out with coconut shrimp. This was the best shrimp I have ever tasted. It was plump, fresh, and the most perfect crisp bite to it. The accompanying sauce was equally delicious. The chef also sent out a moroccan spiced hangar steak appetizer for us to try. The steak was so tender, which is unusual for hangar steak. The spices were so unique and tasty! The earthy taste was something that I will crave until we get to come back here. For lunch I had the scallops over a bed of fresh greens with a delicious citrus vinaigrette. The scallops were OUT OF THIS WORLD! They tasted like tender, sweet, sugary, pillows. I've never tasted scallops so tender, fresh, and cooked to perfection! Great job, Todd! The bed of greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes were equally as fresh, crisp, and tender. The home made dressing was just the right amount of acidity. My fiancee had a panko crusted chicken cutlet sandwich topped with bacon, gruyere cheese, Russian dressing on a buttermilk roll. OMG ... It melted in your mouth! Just plain delicious. We are both craving this until we get to come back for a weekend visit as well. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake, which was recommended by our waitress. The cake was just so so. It was kind of dry in some spots and we'd definitely try something else the next time we are there.Quality: AI know that a lot of people were complaining about their prices. Our lunch was about 60 bucks plus tip. We didn't think this was too bad for the amount of food that we had. Plus, it was so delicious, that we didn't mind paying for it!We will definitely be back and we are planning to check out the hotel next month for a long weekend before we finalize this venue for our wedding.",1,,1

My husband and I went here for an anniversary dinner. We eat out a lot and are originally from Manhattan. We had a great waiter named John ( very patient. He had two awful tables next to us that were so rude and in a rush. ) he offered cocktails which we enjoyed. Midway through cocktails appetizers came and the Tuna Tartar was impeccably fresh. We switched to wine for the second course which was comfort food- chicken soup. Nothing amazing but VERY tasty and it was what we wanted-homemade chicken soup. Dinner. LI duck and salmon dishes. Beautiful. Restaurant manager Carlos checked in with us during dinner as well as our waiter, John. We enjoyed our experience.

99,Eve C.,"Oceanside, NY",96,74,9,1.0,4/5/2011,"I called ahead to see what time they were open til and the hostess strongly recommended having a reservation.  When I arrived with my bf, the restaurant wasn't even half full but we did have the option of sitting by the window which was nice.  Maybe it was just our experience, but make sure you have a long time for dinner because ours took forever! We were served by two different waiters which was odd because one didn't know that the other had taken our orders.  It seemed like they were unexperienced or maybe a bit unprofessional.  Neither of them bothered to even introduce themselves or go over any specials.  First impression was the rolls that were served warm but obviously old and stale.  Since my bf and I always eat the bread before meals we were very disappointed, especially for such a pricey place (can't afford fresh bread?!). We decided on the Rigatoni Bolognese for our first course and the dishes that came out could hardly be called Bolognese.  The dish overall was tasteless, there was barely any sauce or meat to be found.  I got the braised short ribs with greens and polenta and my bf got the penne with roasted chicken with vegetables.  The chicken with penne was decent, the chicken was dry and the pasta a bit overcooked.  My dish came out with the wrong sides which the waiter noticed after it was set on the table in front of me.  He offered to change it for me and asked if I wanted to take the whole dish back or just have the polenta brought out separate and I opted to keep my dish and have the polenta brought out since I wanted to start eating. (He dug the potatoes out of my dish and left it on a small plate at the table...WTF?) I kept waiting and waiting for the polenta which never came out.  We both ate about half of our dishes and got the rest to take home.  By now I figured the polenta was never going to come out and I asked the waiter to put it in my take home portion.  Surprise! Surprise!  They put the original potatoes into the container.  I wish I had realized this before I gave them 20%+ tip.  Safe to say I will never go back there again!",,,

Part of the rest week menu so no harm.I did look at the rest of the menu and it did seem pretty pricey.  Dont know if id go back for that...but maybe.  The place was half full which was suprising on  friday night at 8pm, but I guess that as it gets colder fewer people ar egoing to a beach side restauranrt even if it is in a hotel.I have to say the clientele was older than I thought it would be.. for a trendy type place, there was a lot of grey hair lol.  Not that im in my 20s but I like places that have a vibe...  maybe it was the cost of the place..expensive for a younger crowd.My one complaint was that they automatically ad a 20% gratuity to the bill.  That sort of pisses me off.. like now I have to pay 20% even if my service was bad?  It wasnt but im just saying.  I do not think that is right.id probably go back, maybe for like a moms day brunch or drinks/lunch in the summer",,,
101,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,467,120,2.0,6/1/2010,"This past weekend, I stayed with a couple of friends of mine out in Long Beach, NY for the Memorial Day Weekend.  The weather was awesome, the cookout was delicious, and having amazing company always tops such holiday weekends.So as a denoument to the festivities, we decided to stop by Atlantica for brunch on Memorial Day, as it was a new place that none of us have been to on the Boardwalk.  To begin with, this hotel has very tight security at the entrance from the Boardwalk, as we noticed that they were quite inquisitive when you enter.  Regardless, we got in, and the instant perception is how modern chic the furnishings are.  Once we perused about to check the place out, we had to wait a few minutes for a table at the restaurant.Once seated, we ordered bloddy marys to kick off the meal.  The verdict...tasty indeed, with a healthy portion of horseraddish.  It was missing a bit of pepperness and spiciness to it, but not bad.That is where to good stops and the experience went a bit downhill.  For a holiday weekend, we were a bit astounded at the fact that there was no brunch on Memorial Day.  Regardless, we proceeded to order from the regular menu.  One of us ordered the crab cake, one of us got the shrimp po boy, and I got the BBQ duck confit.  The consensus overall...it was average if that.  The crab cake was fried hard, the po boy was overly fried and my BBQ duck confit was over fried, over sauced with BBQ sauce and sitting on top of a bed of spinach soaking in grease.  Part of the duck was fried so much it was hard to even eat.  And for the prices for these dishes...definitely a bit of disappointment.As my friend Kimmie S. put it...definitely a place to have drinks and mealwise, we may pass next time.  Good thing they have a very posh atmosphere to at least hang out at!",1,,
102,Jennifer S.,"Mineola, NY",54,3,0,1.0,2/18/2014,We are giving 1 star to this restaurant due to its horrible management.  They do not even deserve the 1 star. My husband and I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try out this restaurant with a Living Social voucher.  If we liked it we would be very good customers since we often are visiting in laws across the street who enjoy babysitting our children.  The hotel made it very difficult to use this voucher throughout its 3 month period.  We tried to use for the Saturday after Valentines Day and were told that the whole weekend was a Valentine's pre-fix so they wouldn't accept it.  I spoke to a surly manager who said he could not extend the promotion past the expiration date because he wouldn't be able to get his $.  This is actually a  lie.  I found out from Living Social they have to honor what you actually paid for 5 years.  They do not have to honor the promotion but he made it seem like we couldn't use our original $50.  And really if the paid value doesn't expire for 5 years then he can get the $ and really doesn't want to honor the promo.  We tried to go the Monday after Valentines Day and were told that even though it wasn't a pre-fix we could not use our voucher on that day because it was considered a holiday.  The voucher does not say it cannot be used on the weekend or holidays.  When I asked to speak to a manager they never called me back.  The Atlantica AND the Allegria has lost our business permanently.  I would rather spend our $ at a business that runs itself as a business.,2,,

For the price, it was not worth it.  There is much better quality food in town. Atlantica has a beautiful atmosphere though. I wish they would improve their food. The bar is expensive too, but the drinks are alright. Unfortunately this place would not last if not for the great location. I give it a third star for being beachfront.",,,

108,The N.,"New York, NY",4,10,2,1.0,8/15/2011,"I dined at Atlantica with my wife on Aug 12, celebrating our anniversary.  I was extremely disappointed with the service and the quality of food.  Service slow and inattentive.  The food was overly salted.  The one saving grace was that they did have a decent wine list.  My feedback on the ambiance is not that positive either, as I found the restaurant to be loud, due to the high ceilings.  That being said, I could have lived with that if the other two very important area were enjoyable.  I would not recommend this restaurant.  Subsequent to our visit, we've heard the same from friends who have dined there.",1,1,1
109,Gale K.,"East Rockaway, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/23/2013,"I would give it zero starts if that were possible.We've visited this restaurant three times, and only because we had vouchers; otherwise, the prices are outrageous!Visit #1:  We had made a reservation for breakfast because they had a nice view,  outdoor access to the boardwalk, and I had purchased a $40.00 voucher for $ 20.00. After checking in with the hostess,  we were escorted to a canter table. We asked for one at a window - most of which were empty, but told they were all reserved.  That was pure bull!.  We were there for nearly two hours, and they were still empty.After a good 15 minutes, a server came over, poured us some water and directed us to the buffet.  We each had an omelet and were offered a choice of a mimosa or a bloody Mary.  Neither of us drinks, so we declined.  We had coffee, which was lukewarm, and not offered a refill.Now comes the killer part!  The bill came to $115.88:  two BRUNCHES @ $45 + tax + a mandatory 20% service charge!  It turns out, we were assumed to have come for the brunch, while there was a perfectly decent BREAKFAST menu available, but never offered to us.  I would have had a tantrum, but my husband is not one for making a scene, so we paid and left.  That was the most expensive meal of two omelets and tepid coffee in the history of restaurant business!Visit # 2:  It was a sunny day and no street parking to be found anywhere.  I am disabled and cannot walk very far, so we handed the. car over to a valet.  The meal was just OK, but the service was abysmal.  We waited 20 minutes for someone to notice us and bring menus, another 20 minutes for her to return to take our orders, 35 minutes for the two burgers ($20 each) to arrive.  I  tried for 10 minutes to flag down the busboy to refill my water glass until I finally gave up and went over and the stand to fetch the water for myself.Returning to the car, we discover there was a $10 + tip charge for the valet.  This hotel / restaurant is located well away from public transport, so everyone who visits comes by car.  Charging for parking is huge gall, but that's not all.  Our car was delivered with a 10"" ink puddle on the driver's seat.  The upholstery is white leather, so there's no way the valet hadn't noticed it.  We went back inside to the manager and it took another 20 minutes to clean it up.   Nonetheless, we were charged for the valet service!Visit #3:  I don't know what demon possessed me to choose this place again.We were having a triple birthday party, and I figured everyone would enjoy the view, I guess.  I made a reservation for nine a full week in advance, explained that this was a celebration, and requested a window seating.  When we arrived the place was empty save for one couple in the corner and yet, we were set up along the rear wall and they wouldn't move us.  So much for the nice view!  For once, the service was friendly, but mo wonder - the place was empty except for us.The ""regular"" menu in no way resembled what they had posted on line.  I checked on line before making the reservation to make sure there was something there for everyone, but we were handed something quite different.The burger I ordered ($20!) was listed as WAGU beef, but it was just plain old chopped meat.  As opposed to medium rare, it arrived cold and just about totally raw, accompanied by McDonald's style fries, cold as well.  My granddaughter received prefab style onion rings available frozen at any supermarket.  This is supposed to an elegant restaurant run by an acclaimed chef ???!!!  But this was supposed to be a party, so I chose not to embarrass my guests by sending things back,  But I did send back one thing.  I called over the Maitre'D as discretely as possible and whispered to him that the water in my glass smelled moldy.  He looked a bit panicked after smelling it, and sent around our waitress to collect all the glasses and bring out new ones and new water, which, incidentally had no ice, the first round or the second.And here's the real DOOZEY!  The place seats at least a hundred people plus there is a bar and a huge lounge attached where there a a big party going on,BUT THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO BATHROOM ON THAT LEVEL !   You have to walk out of the room and walk downstairs, where you'll find (with much effort) two tiny bathrooms in the corner. The men's  room was taped off with an ""Out of Order"" sign, which meant there was none.  The ladies' room had two maids, each equipped with a mop, chattering at ear-splitting volume in Spanish.  After that, one had to return upstairs to the restaurant.  I had commented on that during our previous visits there as well.  And to add insult to injury, this place claims to be ""Handicapped Accessible.  Just the location of the bathrooms alone blows that claim right out of the water.Unfortunately, I have another voucher for a meal there, and if I can't get it refunded, I'll just throw it away.",3,1,1
110,La S.,"Great Neck, NY",294,630,101,3.0,2/20/2012,"The food was fantastic.  I have allergies and they really did a great job accommodating me, for instance, they made a different sauce for me on one of my dishes because I couldn't eat the other one.     Their recommended wines were not great, but I asked them to make me a special drink and it was pretty awesome. The service was horrible. First off, I reserved under open table and put in a birthday request for my friend's 30th.  I then told the restaurant to make sure they knew about the birthday.  They did absolutely nothing for my friend and I was very sad.  Then, the waitress knew nothing about the wine menu and some of the regular menu. We hated everything she recommended. She took the drink orders of three out of five of my table then came back ten minutes to take the other two.  Our waitress got her act together during dinner and dessert, but I felt like the inconsistency was not worth the price we paid.  The deserts were also not great.  Also, they had a special menu that they never informed us about; it would've been nice to know that a more affordable option was available.  This place has the potential to be awesome, if they just trained their staff properly and hired people who actually know what good food and alcohol taste like.",,,

Updated review",My husband and I have gone to the Sunday brunch several times and love it. The food is amazing and the variety has something  for everyone. The staff  are   accommodating and on top of everything. The view is so beautiful and reminds me what I love about Long Island. I have written a review before after a visit and did not see it! I sincerely hope this one gets posted or may feel that YELP does not post accurately. Go there and enjoy,,,
112,M K.,"Baldwin, NY",0,5,0,1.0,5/19/2015,"Went tonight for dinner which started out very well. Waitress was friendly at first but not very attentive. Ordered a salad and our entrees which were OK, not great. We asked for a dessert menu and ordered a dessert to share. before we could finish our order for cappucino, the waitress was already walking away from the table. Someone brought cappucinos which were only half full. We asked for our waitress and it took a while before she came back. We showed her the cups and she asked if we wanted more milk! We wanted more cappucino. we finished our drinks and our dessert was nowher to be found after almost a half hour wait. Dessert was literally ""dropped at the table"" and wasn't what we had ordered. We again asked for our waitress and it took an eternity for her to come. Warm brownie was not warm, vanilla ice cream was chocolate and there was no whipped cream as stated. At that point we just wanted to get out of there and they took the dessert back and brought our check. Really wante to like this place for the location, but staff was rude and inefficient. manger couln't care less.",,1,

114,Amanda D.,"Rockville Centre, NY",24,7,0,3.0,9/2/2013,"I feel bad giving this review because the chef is really excellent. This is not a commentary on the food which I think is tasty, well thought out, sustainable (big plus). The Atlantica is located in the dazzling Allegria hotel, it's beautifully decorated inside and you have a view of the ocean as you eat which is very lovely. I feel like the management just can't get it right though. I've tried it a few times and have even had events there I just can't get on board with how things are run. I know it's difficult to run a restaurant there must be MANY things going on inside but there is no formula for getting things settled at the atlantica. One guy for the bread, one guy for the utensils, one person taking orders, one person greeting and seating instead of everyone running around guessing, disorganized, etc. It just wasn't working. We sat there for 40 minutes before our table was even attended to by a server who forgot my boyfriend's wine for 30 minutes after, sent our food to the wrong place there was stuff falling on the floor and everyone seemed very flustered. The waitress was a sweetheart, super apologetic but obviously being overworked. All the tables were shaking their heads, unhappy :/ The manager in the meantime was walking around talking and socializing with the people at the tables which is nice but when you see that the food is taking FOREVER to come out drop what you're doing and help your staff! It will make all the difference. Whats upsetting is that once you get the food people looked so pissed off from the management (including my company every time I've come there) that they couldn't even enjoy the masterpiece that the chef created for them. A few simple tweaks and this place could really be top notch. I know they've switched management a bunch of times but they need to try again. Especially with the price of the food, I would be happy to pay but expect good service to come along with it.",,1,

117,Roger G.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,86,2,4.0,12/23/2010,"Had heard some mixed reviews back and forth between the food (strong) and the service (weak). Our experience matched up with this pretty well. We went in on a winter night right before Christmas, so we weren't surprised to see a pretty empty dining room. We were then surprised it took 5 minutes for someone to ask about drinks / offer menus. This pace of service persisted throughout.On the flip side, the food was great. You can choose from a prix fixe or from the a la carte menu, and you can also pull items from the prix fixe to order a la carte. The pumpkin soup was excellent - creamy, savory and just the right amount of spice. As for entrees, the duck breast was perfectly cooked and well-paired with the veggies and the glaze. The penne/chicken dish was also solid, if boring.Since the scenery was fun, the slow service was easier to overlook, and the staff was definitely pleasant. Atmosphere-wise, this restaurant is the closest thing Long Beach has to NYC by a long way. I'll definitely go back.",1,,
118,Elizabeth W.,"Long Beach, NY",0,5,8,5.0,12/8/2013,"We had brunch at the Atlantica restaurant in the Allegria Hotel and it was wonderful. The restaurant overlooks the ocean which added to the modern, clean simplicity of the ambiance. The selection of food was abundant. I started with the split lobster and grabbed two or three claws along with king crab legs and perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Then I moved on to the wonderful tenderloin of beef and homemade mushroom ravioli. The skirt steak with onions and peppers was tender and flavorful. I skipped the waffle and omelet station because I was stuffed but the sushi rolls were some of the best I've had! There were numerous cold salads and bagels with all the fixins and muffins, pastrys and danish. I did save room for desert and sampled all of the delicious cakes and French macarons that melted in my mouth.  The waitstaff were impeccable; always making sure we had plenty of bellinis..pear, peach, mango, grapefruit! Manny and Melanie were the absolute best, always smiling and making sure we were happy! Arthur made certain that our event went as planned  We never had to ask for anything! I highly recommend the Atlantica restaurant!",,,

I ordered the chicken that was advertised on the menu as coming with artichokes, mushrooms and potatoes. Well it came out with none of that, just a plain piece of chicken with Brussels sprouts and squash. What? That's not what I ordered! It took the waitress FORTY FIVE MINUTES to get the potatoes, by then the chicken was cold and my husband was done eating so I ate none of it. Guess what was still on the bill?!?! As the bill came, she brought me the glass of wine I had ordered AN HOUR before and said it was on the house.
