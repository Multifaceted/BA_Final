If you're looking to play pool, come with cash. It is two dollars a game, but there is a huge markup if you swipe with your card.The CC minimum for the bar is $20 (3 regular beer of your choice @ $7 each, or 5 house beers at $4 each)",2,1,4
1,Myles C.,"Brooklyn, NY",436,198,30,4.0,7/4/2018,"$20 credit card minimum!! A little hard to hit if you're just pounding through their $3 house beer. They've got darts, skee ball, pin ball, some arcade games, and a bathroom that doesn't lock. For a dive, this place is pretty spot-on, just wish I lived closer.",2,1,1
2,John S.,"Queens, NY",159,49,2,4.0,6/1/2018,"A dive bar guy I am not, but Ace sure does make me question my opinion. Darts, buck hunter, skiable, boardgames, pool tables, and a friendly speedy staff pouring drinks make it a really good place to hang out.Reason I went 4 out of 5: weeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllll its not the cleanest place I've ever been",,,
3,Lateefah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,138,171,4.0,10/21/2018,"Ace bar is a diver, college bar. I would say you come to this bar if your looking for something simple, your with a group and you want to play darts, pool and any number of other bar games. Depending on the time of night and the day of the week, it can be a bar that tries to be a club, which can be a bit much. I have been here twice now and both times I have had an alright time. The crowd fluctuates throughout the night so sometimes there are plenty of tables and space and other times its a little crazy. The bar is stocked with beer and liquor for well drinks. I love that they have skee ball and pinball machines!",,,
4,Jay M.,"New York, NY",25,142,1,5.0,11/4/2018,Gets crowded. It's loud. The crowd can be super bro-ey. But the bartenders are really nice and it's super cheap. Count me in!,,,
5,Daniela Z.,"New York, NY",6,21,24,5.0,9/16/2018,"Heard about Ace Bar after watching Master Of None - it's one of Aziz's go-to places.  They've got darts (free), skeeball ($1) and pool tables ($1) plus a 3-8pm happy hour each day.  This is a perfect place for a group to go to because there's stuff to do while you drink $3 beer, the bathrooms are clean and the music is good :).",,,
6,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,3.0,1/6/2018,"Ace is very loud and collegey. Maybe I decided to go here for my 28th birthday to reminisce about the good old days, but it was a slap in the face to realize I'm officially out of this age group! I'd reserved a booth through email with Carlos for my group of 15. It was very easy and efficient, and they even held it for me when I was late by thirty minutes. I liked the energy here, but it was too loud for my friends. We couldn't have much conversation without straining our voices, so we left soon after. But with its casual atmosphere and its availability of billiards, skee ball, darts, and more, it's a great place for any college kid! Sadly, I may just not belong in this vibe any longer, and I can't imagine anyone above 26 would either.",5,3,3
7,Dana M.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,153,93,4.0,12/17/2017,"I hauled myself here in a group of 7 from the central area in EV. It was worth it, I can confirm. The drinks were refreshingly a bit cheaper than surrounding bars. This place has plenty of room to move around. The ambiance at 1am was medium volume and low lights. There are a few How I Met Your Mother style rounded and cushioned booths. If you come with a group you'll be lucky to snag one! Perfect for people watching. I'm giving 4 stars because the floor was so sticky that I had to put effort in to lift my foot off of the ground. The women's bathrooms were extremely dirty and needed some TLC. Otherwise I like the atmosphere here. The games are a cool addition. A friend got a bag of chips from the bar- This place sells little bags for those whose get munchies at midnight. A cute little perk. I'll be back here. This is a cool spot for a group. It's not a date spot. A pretty good location. We went to the Sing Sing Karaoke bar after coming here which is conveniently right around the corner.  Thanks for the memories Ace.",3,,2
8,Charlotte W.,"Albany, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/15/2018,"My boyfriend and I reserved a table in the back part of the bar for his 26th birthday. They were very nice and helpful on the phone, however, when we arrived they moved us to the front booth because apparently someone with a slightly larger party wanted  the back table. That is not how reservations work. Don't guarantee we can have a certain table, if you are just going to give it to someone else. We specifically asked for the back table because my boyfriend loves playing pool and wanted to be able to play and talk with his friends. While expressing our frustrations with the bartender who directed us to our new table, he basically gave us the attitude of ""tough shit, get over it"". Really disappointed with their reservation strategy and we would have appreciated a heads up that we could no longer have our requested table, because we would have definitely gone somewhere else.",1,,
9,Madison G.,"Naples, FL",0,3,0,1.0,10/23/2018,Workers are incredibly rude. Boring not a big crowd and serves underage girls so the bouncer can flirt with them. Won't be coming back.,1,,
10,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,3.0,1/6/2018,"I'll give this place a solid 3.5. It's overall clean, the bartenders were nice, and there's fun arcade games to keep occupied. Skeeball, arcade video games, pool, and darts. The crowd on a Friday night is...young. The crowd was mostly 20s and seemed like young professionals. It was an eclectic group of people that could be described across the spectrum-nerdy, ""cool"" kids, etc.",,,
11,Alex L.,"Charlotte, NC",346,109,35,4.0,10/31/2017,"Came here on a whim, looking for a cheap place to play some pool with my friend.  Ended up staying here for a couple of hours playing pool, darts, and slamming some $3 Ace pilsners.  I really dig the chill, fun atmosphere here.  I'll definitely try to make it back here sometime.Also, I found out after the fact that this place was featured in Master of None, while watching the episode.  So that's pretty neat too, I guess!",1,,1
12,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2313,302,983,4.0,3/11/2018,"This was my second time at this bar and overall it's pretty good. Went this past Saturday night with a group of 5 other people and although it was a little packed we had fun. The place is very spacious and they have a good amount of seating all around and hooks to hang your stuff if you'd like. The back section has a few TVs and cool games including arcades, darts, and 2 pool tables. The guys had to wait a while for one of the pool tables but that was understandable given the volume of people. The bar was packed but it didn't take long for us to get drinks. The bartender was nice and the drinks are fairly priced I only paid $14 for a Jack and Coke and a beer - I'm not sure if they were having some type of special. They have a waitress going around taking people's orders if you're feeling lazy. Just be mindful to bring cash for the games and drinks because they don't take cards if the balance is less than $40.",3,,
13,Timothy W.,"New York, NY",55,3,4,1.0,2/9/2018,great atmosphere with alot of culture. My friends and I went here on Friday and had a great time but there were bed bugs! disgusting! the manager acknowledge it but cared more about the money but the patrons. sick! please stay away! this is disgusting!,3,1,
14,Jane W.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/21/2018,"Stopped by the other weekend for a beer and some games. Could not ask for anything more. Decent priced drinks and a great selection too.

15,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,5.0,1/3/2018,I loved this bar. Come here for happy hour and you can expect a fun young vibe inside. The happy hour prices are insanely cheap ($3-$4 beers and will drinks). In the back they have skeeball and pool tables which you dont find too often given the space of new york bars. Definitely want to come back here again with a group of friends for happy hour.,,,
16,Will H.,"Lafayette, CA",268,58,17,2.0,2/1/2018,"A standard pub. It's located on a quiet street on the edge of Alphabet City and doesn't feel like it's part of the scene. Decor is typical dive, with the addition of pin ball and a subtle Star Trek theme...Beer selection is kind of poor (there is an in house Ace beer, made for them by Budweiser, not quite sure how I feel about that), but the come up is that the drinks are cheap. It's just a place to hang out and have your way with a few glasses or more.",,,
17,Billy W.,"Manhattan, NY",146,28,18,2.0,6/16/2018,"I like this bar bc they have a cheap $3 Ace Draft deal all day. It's def worth coming here for that. However, after tonight I got such rude service I don't want to return. I put $4 in the pool table and the bouncer came over to me to tell me that they are closing the bar. That's fine. So I asked for my $4 back since I didn't play and they said it wasn't their problem. So I went to the bartender to tell them that I put $4 into their pool tables and would like $4 back since I never got to play the game I put money into. She refused for the longest time, and then eventually she agreed to give me my money back after making snide comments like ""you're not the only one at this bar diva, so here's your money back so you can spend it on another bar"".  Suffice to say, the bartender was very unprofessional and cold hearted.",,,
18,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,3.0,3/12/2017,"This is a huge bar... it has a bunch of bar games (think arcade, darts etc), a pretty big bar up front, a bunch of tables, huge booths, and a security guard that never stops shuffling around and bumping into you. The drinks are crazy cheap (think $3/beer), they were pretty busy at 3pm on a Saturday, and a huge range of people from 20something post brunch girls with a birthday crown to townies and locals from around alphabet city. Definitely a dive bar but good for talking, hanging out or for pregaming with a big group!",2,1,
19,Shane P.,"Manhattan, NY",209,195,1421,5.0,11/5/2017,"as I've gotten older i've become much more apprehensive about the ny bar scene. this isn't to say i'm a couch potato (though I do have my, ""didn't leave the apartment except for sustenance"" days), i've just grown increasingly disenchanted with the crowded, over-priced, can't hear your friends speak, nothing-to-do-except-stand-around-and-drink situations, and thus, I find myself out and about much more in the daytime than at night. enter ace bar - pool tables, skee (?) ball, dart boards, an electronic, perfectly-volumed jukebox, reasonably priced beers. now this is shane's kinda place. was here on saturday night and it was more of the same night as my other ace bar experiences, i.e., the clock struck 2 and i didn't even realize it as I had been having such a good time. my friend brought it up out of nowhere and I'm glad he did - hope to return next time we're out east.",,,
20,Abby Y.,"Corona, NY",30,119,64,3.0,10/22/2017,"Happy hour until 8pm, friendly and courteous bartender. Dark and divey bar with a couple pool tables and other fun bar activities. There's a few booths to accommodate large groups. There's two televisions with sports on but not really a sports bar imo. There is no kitchen but you can ask the bartender for the portfolio they have filled with menus of nearby eateries that deliver.",,,
21,Rhea B.,"Brooklyn, NY",113,16,1,5.0,7/17/2017,"Ace bar has everything you are looking for in a fun East Village bar. Super spacious with lots of different areas to sit and tons of games to keep the party going. They have recently added some new craft beers, drinks and liquor all while keeping the prices super affordable (especially compared to a lot of other E.V. watering holes). I love that you can bring in food from anywhere or get delivery ordered. It also helps that my favorite ramen place in NYC, Minca, is right across the street. I've gotten to know the staff and the folks that run the bar over the years and they are really awesome people. I'm sorry to read of a couple of negative experiences other patrons have had. This bar can get extremely busy and the staff has a lot to deal with. But as far as any accusations of discrimination of any kind, I have to defend my neighborhood bar here. Ace has always made myself and my friends of all different backgrounds and orientation feel welcome and safe, and has alway had a very diverse staff also of all different backgrounds, races and sexual orientation. With locally owned, neighborhood bars dropping like flies in NYC, it's nice to have Ace in my backyard. Oh AND they have trivia and other fun events going on a lot.",3,1,1

Updated review","Came in to the establishment with my friends for a relaxing friday. Came in expecting to play darts and the group there did not want to leave. Asked the bouncers/bartenders for assistance but in turn they said first come first serve and it's fine for them to stay. Do not expect to have a decent time for what is offered. Very biased with local community. Do not expect to enjoy the darts/pool/ski ball for an entertaining atmosphere.Completely understand the first come first serve rules and respect it. My concerns was once someone is there, they can choose to stay there the whole night if they please. Even after patiently waiting and asking if i can get on next, I was rejected the opportunity. I hope i get the same treatment next time. Thanks!",1,1,1
23,Melissa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",27,61,0,5.0,8/7/2017,"I LOVE Ace Bar.  This is exactly what an East Village bar should be and is supposed to be.  The drinks are plentiful with generous pours.  The bartenders are always super cool and uber friendly and genuinely so, not some fake friendly just to get tipped.  They have some new beer varieties, I've noticed...in the ""craft"" category, which is great.There are loands of games to play to keep you busy and having fun.  Once a friend had a birthday party and they took a reservation so we could all fit and get taken care of.Overall, a cool semi-divy bar that I highly recommend.",1,1,1
24,Laura C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",753,755,1634,3.0,11/30/2016,"A dive bar and a sports bar got drunk one night and 9 months later had Ace Bar. It's definitely an eclectic mix. Quite spacious, even the area with the games didn't get too stuffy during my time there. Drinks were also inexpensive, but just be warned that the selection is pretty bottom rung.It was super loud in there, which isn't the worst of things that could happen but we were a fairly large group of people who hadn't seen each other in awhile so it would have been nice if we had gone somewhere that we could have heard each other.",7,4,4
25,Tess Y.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",186,61,94,3.0,8/9/2017,It's a pretty chill bar. The AC is blasting and it's like you walked into the Arctic. It blows right down the center of the bar and it's almost impossible to dodge without sitting at the bar or the booths. Standing gets you a ticket to the North Pole. The drinks are standard. Any drink you would get at any bar. There's a skeeball machine in the back. Along with two pool tables and darts area. It's okay but not something I would rave about.,1,,
26,Jackie W.,"New York, NY",125,8,3,1.0,2/9/2018,"I will say we came here to have fun to play darts and some f'd up customers there said we can play dart as much as we can. The manager came to see the situation and understood how rude these a*hole were however let them do whatever they want and disrespect us and other people waiting their turn. Don't come here if the bar don't stand up for the rest of their customers. Hey sometimes life's not fair, just don't here if when they choose to pick customers over other customers. I will say though some of the workers understand how we were feeling but did nothing about it. Don't come here if you want to be treated fairly.",,1,
27,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,634,5.0,9/22/2016,"The love I have for Ace Bar goes back 5 years and it's still going strong. Though, it may be ""divey"" it makes up for with a whole lot of character. All is welcome to Ace Bar. Wether I look super shitty after a long day of work, when I'm on a date, hanging out with a group of friends, I know I can always find solace at Ace Bar. There's 2 pool tables (and they do pretty good upkeep on it), skee ball, buck hunter, pinball, dartboards, and a jukebox (All they're missing is a beer pong table)! You will always have something to do and there's always a place to find a seat because my lazy ass can't stand for standing around, which, they have plenty of room for too! The staff are super nice and friendly! And they have a great happy hour and events. The drinks are super cheap too! Literally, what's not to love about Ace Bar? If I ever leave New York Ace Bar will always have my heart!",7,4,5
28,Sascha F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/7/2018,"Phenomenal service. Best vodka cranberry I've ever had. Lighting makes everyone look good, skeeball is amazing",,,
29,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,8/28/2016,"Even though I've yet to play skee ball here (and man, have I tried), I'm still giving Ace four stars. I've never had a bad time here, they usually have a decent selection of beers on tap (and cheap ones at that), they can accommodate large groups of people without it feeling claustrophobic and of course, there are games! I've popped into Ace Bar a number of times over the past few years. It's a fantastic place to go with a good-sized group of friends when you're looking for a bar in the East Village that's casual but not overly divey, with ample room to move about. While I'd still categorize Ace as a dive, it's not your typical dive. It's got actual character. Aside from the games, there's an awesome, old-school lunch box shrine that spans the whole left wall when you walk in. So many cartoons, so many throwbacks. Everything's about appreciating your inner child these days, so come here and take a few hours to pretend you're actually not an adult with no actual adult responsibilities. That seems healthy, no?Speaking of trying to forget that you have responsibilities, they've got some solid beer options at Ace. Nothing particularly notable, but it's better than what you'd find at your average dive. Think beers that are just one step up from Bud Light/Budweiser/Coors--Sixpoint, Yuengling, Stella, etc. And they're still cheap! That said, the biggest con here is the $20 credit card minimum, which others have already mentioned here. And not that I'd ever complain about cheap drinks, but the fact that the drinks here *are* less expensive than those at many of the neighboring bars means it's not necessarily easy to hit that minimum. I never have (not at Ace, at least). I realize that cash-only establishments are things that exist in the world, but come on. A $10 minimum probably wouldn't bother me much but $20 seems a bit excessive.  Game-wise, there's pinball (2 machines), one of those old-school hunting games complete with two plastic guns, pool, skee ball, darts (it's still beyond me why darts and bars became a thing and the idea was clearly conceived of by an inebriated person), and maybe something else I'm forgetting. The only issue, of course, is that these things are all very in-demand. So be prepared to wait. It could be worse, though. Try going to Fat Cat on a weekend night in the hopes of playing pool and see how long you'll have to wait there. Just comes with the territory! I should note that weekends are by far the peak time here (though that goes for any bar, pretty much) so you'll have far better luck scoring your game of choice on a weeknight. Tends to get packed and stay packed on weekends. If you're looking to play games at a bar but want to have the option of, well, opting out, Ace is the place for you (dammit, as soon as that phrase popped into my head, the stupid hardware jingle popped in right after...and now it's probably in your heads too...sorry 'bout that). Ace is more of a bar that happens to have games than a legitimate arcade (it's nothing like Barcade).",6,1,2
30,Nina L.,"New York, NY",541,717,153,4.0,9/8/2016,"I'm happy to report in a city of always declining square footage in both reside tail and retail real estate.... ""There's so much space for activities!!!""I came with to Ace with a group of friend's for someone's birthday on a Sunday afternoon. You may be thinking who goes to a (semi-)dive bar on a Sunday afternoon? Not many people...and it was damn brilliant. We got to enjoy the best that Ace Bar has to offer in way of entertainment and friendly bartenders. Drink prices were affordable (seltzer was free) and the games were the perfect conversation piece to break up the otherwise monotonous bar hang. As an added to bonus they allow outside food without questions, something a majority of bars this size without open kitchens should. I'm super glad our clan stumbled upon Ace Bar and I very luck look forward to returning for casual drinks and ski ball.",2,,

The woman calling out the numbers was hilarious. I got some tequila on the house and left with a t-shirt. She announced trivia for the next night so i came back with some friends.

33,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,1/11/2016,"I like Ace Bar. It's a pretty nicely-executed dive, complete with vintage lunchboxes lining the walls, as well pinball machines, skee ball, Big Buck Hunter and billiards. Not only that, the place actually is pretty spacious, although on weekend nights, it can get a little uncomfortable with the amount of people in there. I can't really fault a bar for being popular, but personally, I would just try to come here during the week, when the crowd is a little more manageable. The clientele is a bit on the frattier side, so take that as you will, but I've never had a problem.I've come here for a lot of different birthday parties or casual get-togethers and I've always had fun. The beer selection is decent, and they tend to make the well drinks pretty strong, provided you're watching them make the drink. The music is pretty on point, with a pretty eclectic mix of songs on the jukebox. I could easily spend hours on the arcade games and just being super competitive with my friends. Again, perhaps the knock is that now that the word's been out for a while, the place gets crazy packed on weekends, making it hard to get to the bar. Your best bet is to come on a weeknight, so as to avoid the massive crowds. Not only that, the happy hour specials are pretty good too, and you can get beers for about $4. The beer selection is pretty decent, and I like how they typically have Yuengling on draft, being a PA boy and all.The bartenders, as mentioned, are pretty attentive, although it seems like the place is pretty understaffed on weekends. Non-happy hour prices are only okay, perhaps a bit more on the expensive side for a dive bar. Not to mention I'm not a fan of the $20 CC minimum, which is actually pretty atrocious. That being said, I've always had a good time here regardless, so just make sure you buy enough drinks for your friends. I'll be back on weeknights. I suggest the same for you.",34,17,33

Whenever any of my friends were looking for a bar, I'd always be the first to recommend this place. I've celebrated several birthdays here with friends, made plenty of reservations, and spent a guilty amount of money here, I consider myself a regular. On top of that, this happens to be the place where I met my now husband. We decided to come here on our 1 year anniversary, to go back where we started. I don't know what was up but the bartender was extremely rude to him and apparently rolled her eyes when he asked for a glass of water after ordering drinks for our entire group of friends. After two rounds of drinks, we went out for some fresh air. The bouncer (a bouncer I've never seen any of the times I've been there) yelled something to us from a distance. I didn't hear him, which caused me to ask him to repeat himself. I went up to him to address whatever problem he had with us, and he cut me off and immediately said ""it doesnt even matter you guys are out of here"". After a few inappropriate things were said to me, it led to a screaming match. The manager on call that night came out and said that he knows me, and I'm a regular who doesn't ever cause any problems, but has to go along with whatever the bouncer was saying. This was by far one of my favorite bars, but thanks to this, I don't think I'll ever be back. I appreciated this place and I would hope the staff and the bouncers here would appreciate their customers just as much.If management wants any further information on this, I'll be happy to provide it.

At 5:30 PM on a Friday it was so crowded it was actually difficult to navigate! I couldn't believe it. The drink specials were definitely a hit here, with $3 bud lights being our party's preferred favorite. With a $20 minimum, you can imagine that we had to consume many bud lights, which made this place all the more fun! I loved the fact that there were so many games, especially because I beat my boyfriend badly in Skeeball :) Also, there were TVs we could watch college football, so he got over the loss quickly.

We aren't belligerent or close to being irrational. I called the the office and he basically brushed me off and said it's not my problem. I would not recommend this place to anyone if you are coming here without having a beer because obviously having a good time is illegal according to Ace.",3,2,
46,Kat B.,"New Orleans, LA",22,21,2,3.0,10/8/2016,"Great beer selection. Tolerable music. Annoyingly crowded, like you will have to move multiple times a minute if you are standing up. $20 card minimum sucks, but bring cash. BUT THE MEN'S BATHROOM. There is no partition between the toilet and the urinal. There is no lock, anywhere. This means that if you have to shit, a stranger will walk in, look at you shitting, and then urinate while you stare at them, still shitting. The stranger will leave. A new stranger will walk inside while you are still shitting, pee while you shit, and leave while you continue to shit. Or maybe you have to pee while someone is in there, shitting, staring at you, with nowhere to even avert their eyes because the bathroom is so small. I wasn't confronted in the same homophobically violent way as the reviewer below, but it's worth noting that that happened, and I hope whoever assaulted him got fired for being both homophobic and physically violent with a customer.

50,Patrick C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,6,1,1.0,6/25/2016,"If I could give this bar 0 stars, I would. Last night, I was dehumanized for going to this bar. It started out when I was waiting in line to go to the men's bathroom. When I was next to use the bathroom, I opened the door and accidentally hit someone with the door: the owner of the bar.What happened next is disheartening. The owner flipped out, forced his arms around me and dragged me out of his bar. Then he screamed ""FAGGOT"" as he tossed me out of the front door. It should be noted that I am not gay and I am not white. The owner was a Caucasian man who clearly wanted to use force at his convenience. If he was a cop, this would have looked like one of those police brutality videos where the cop was clearly a meathead ready to power trip at the first opportunity.Anyways, he called me a faggot and tossed me out. I opened a door to use the restroom to deserve this. I couldn't help but feel like if I was a Caucasian-American, he would have treated me like a human-being, but after all this is America where racism and aggression thrives. Ace bar was simply a microcosm of the sadly prejudice and violent country we live in. After this incident ensued, the customers that witnessed what had happened were enraged and lined up to revolt to the managers. The onlooking white people--pretty much the only race of ppl that go here--were disgusted by what had happened before their eyes. Even the black doorman/bouncer seemed ashamed and couldn't make eye contact with me. What the owner did was dehumanizing and sad for all humans. All in all I am above this and will move on with my life, but I pity the man who uses force. I would like to say thanks to all the witnesses that defended me and apologized on behalf of Caucasian people. You guys are heroes.@Yelp, don't remove this one. People need to know.",10,2,
51,Peter D.,"Staten Island, NY",201,54,4,4.0,8/21/2016,"Went to Ace Bar for a friends birthday. I must start by saying I do not like bars, so when my friends are going to bars I usually approach them with a ""meh"" because I find them crowded, small, hot, and loud. With all of this in mind, I had a blast at Ace Bar and would definitely return.For the first few hours our party (10-15 people) were the only ones in the bar, so that was awesome! The whole back area has a decent amount of seating with two pool tables, two skee ball machines and two dart boards. Sometimes bars can be boring because after sitting there for a few hours,  you get antsy. This did not occur as there was something fun to do and everyone was having a great time due to the ample space, and fun atmosphere. I am not much of a drinker, but my friends seemed pretty happy with their alcoholic beverages. There is no food, but they allow you to bring in food from the outside which is great. The bartender and bouncer were so attentive and friendly. It got more crowded as the day progressed, but it did not feel like a typical bar when you can't move or hear your friend standing next to you. A few things I would say they can improve on, and I only say this to help them because I really had a great time are at times it did get a little warm, even when it was empty. When the air was turned on, there was one table across the bar where the vent was blasting cool air out of and it felt great. I also think the mens bathroom is a little odd. There is no lock on the door so I guess its for more than one person to use at a time, but there is one urinal and one toilet, but there is no divider, no stall, nothing. I do not understand why there is not a lock on the door if this is the case, because I do not see how two people are supposed to use the bathroom at the same time, a little odd to me, It was a great time and I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to have a good time beyond the ""I am at a bar to get trashed man"" or ""Stand around and not move crowd"".",1,1,1

There's plenty of places to go in the village, but there are only a few I'd make a point of going to. It's in a more residential part of the village, so it's quieter and not as suffocating as the rest of it. Cool, low-key vibe inside, decent beer selection and the prices are cheap. They also have skee-ball and darts, so if you're not sold already, that should do it. Haven't had the food yet, so this isn't a true bar review, but the service was exceptional. Fast, polite bartenders that definitely earned their tips. I was actually shocked at how fast they got to me. I'm a dude, I'm not used to being served quickly at bars. This is what girls get? It's awesome! Bathrooms were also pretty clean, considering. Totally recommend this place. 5/5",1,,

I've been there on a Sunday late afternoon with 5 people in total at the bar and I've been there on Friday evenings with 80+ people and every time it's enjoyable.The decor and vibe is definitely what makes it memorable. Darts, a pool table, skee ball and what they describe as ""nostalgic decor"" allows Ace Bar to be a place I can rely on to have fun and hang out with friends.The drinks in Manhattan bars including those around Alphabet City tend to be a bit pricey, but Ace Bar manages to have several drink options that make going out affordable and leaving you NOT cringing when you see your credit card statement. Snag some PBR or Miller High Life for a mere $3 or a well drink for $6 and you will not be disappointed!",1,,

Ace bar is in an area where it's a bit of a walk from the nearest train station to get to, so just a heads up. They have a bunch of arcade and board games you can play in the front or the back of the bar. There are booths in the front which are perfect for groups. My only real qualm about this place is that there is no food! After sitting at the bar, asking for the bar menu, and flipping through a book of random restaurant menus, I realized what was going on. My friend then proceeded to tell me that you have to order food from one of these places and they deliver it to you at the bar. While some may think this is cool, I consider it an inconvenience and unnecessarily complicated lol. I've never been to an establishment like this. But nonetheless, I think ace bar is okay.

A few small/medium size TV's overlook the bar counter up front, while the back area has one similarly sized TV in the upper corner of the wall above the Skee ball machines. For big games, a very large projector screen is dropped down in the back area.

I went to play darts with a male friend and the ""security/bar back"" took our beers and told us they couldn't be on the ground. I respectfully asked him where I should put them and he said on the shelf near the wall or behind me, both out of my sight. I told him that I was there on my own, as a female and asked him if there was a safer place to put my drink. He said that I should know the guy I'm with and that that male should watch out for my drink. I asked him ""what if we just met?"" And he told me that I shouldn't go there without knowing someone. SO if you are a FEMALE and are not with a MALE friend to ""watch out for you"", the bar is not for you.

Of course it's not quite the same as the bar from 1999 that was supposed to look like 1981, but fans of the movie will have fun looking around and figuring out who was where. The cash registers that were in the movie are still behind the bar and in use. Otherwise this is a pretty standard neighbourhood dive bar. We pulled up to the bar on some stools and were surrounded by people coming up to the bar constantly all night. The crowd was YOUNG. Surprisingly young for a semi-dingy place like this. It was crowded all night and kept getting more crowded as the night went on. The music didn't really match the type of place it is - somebody was playing A LOT of Smashing Pumpkins on the jukebox. Bartenders were super quick and to-the-point. The bus boy (man) was constantly wiping the bar down even though nobody was spilling anything - a good sign, I suppose. PBR for $3 and well drinks for $6 was a nice break from the higher priced drinks I experienced elsewhere in Manhattan.  3* for the bar, +1* for being in 200 Cigarettes.",,,

82,Mannix R.,"Union City, NJ",132,51,173,4.0,1/26/2015,"""I Love This Bar"" is not only the title of one of my favorite country songs, it also describes my feelings about the Ace Bar quite adequately. It's an arcade bar, of sorts. Perfect for large groups with a wide variety of entertainment. Pool, darts pinball machines and skeeball. Yes! You read that correctly! I said SKEEBALL! I almost flipped out when I saw that but I digress. Plenty of seating at the bar and tables. They even have booths where a group of friends can cram into and slam back some pints. Moreover, the place is pretty spacious so, even when packed to capacity, you're not bumping into everyone. Add to that, excellent service. I was remembered almost immediately by the bartender (Sandra) from my previous visit. Mind you, my prior visit was in the summertime. The bouncer checking IDs tells me that they may, on occasion, get young people in there bordering on the legal drinking age but the same can be said about almost any bar in NYC. Their only real downside is that damned jukebox. It's one of those touch screen ones but it isn't connected to the internet. Totally understandable to me as any bar owner(s) have the right to the type of music played in their bars. However, if that be the case and I cannot download songs I want to hear, at the very least update the songs a bit more frequently. All of those jukeboxes store information on songs people that have put money in wanted to hear. I mean, there's only SO many times one can hear Kid Rock on the jukebox without wanting to slam one's head into the bar! Just saying. Aside from that, I loved it there. I might even throw my next B-Day party there in the fall.",,1,

I found it takes a bit longer to to get a drink.  I have been to other packed bars that get a system that is faster and better... I like to play darts, it is fun.  And skeeball.  Just fun games all around, which keep you occupied on a busy night from the 10 minutes you could potentially wait for a beer... well, thats an exaggeration, but it can be a long wait because this place is popular.  Popular is good.  20 somethings all hangin and drinking and playing games, which is fun and unique and certainly something I look forward to.  Supah look forward to.",,,
87,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",367,86,3,4.0,3/12/2014,"I love Ace Bar.  I would call it a high-end dive bar, and here's why:1. It feels less claustrophobic than your standard musty long-dark-and-narrow dive bar.  By Manhattan standards, Ace Bar is actually quite large.2. Ace Bar seems a bit cleaner than many other dive bars.  I've been to plenty of places in the City where every single surface is sticky and caked in 30+ years of filth.  You know, the type of places where you should be sure that you're up-to-date on your vaccinations before using their bathroom.  Ace Bar still has the low-key, jeans-and-a-t-shirt watering hole vibe - but without the dive-bar-caliber filth.3. Ace Bar has more bar game variety than your average dive.  Pool and darts are great, but it is the rare duo of Skeeball machines in the back room that give this establishment an edge on their competition.  Also, I think bar games are awesome because they tend to spark interactions between random people/groups at the bar who would otherwise just keep to themselves. I've been here a couple of times before when random characters have wandered into Ace Bar off the street, trying to peddle bootleg DVDs or roses and whatever other weird crap they have on them - but that doesn't bother me.  I just see it as part of the Alphabet City charm!",2,2,1

90,Natalie W.,"New York, NY",0,18,1,3.0,4/10/2016,"A review for anyone who's looking to go to an arcade bar in NYC (since Ace Bar consistently makes the top 10 lists): if you're looking for a place to mostly play games, especially with a group, this is not the spot. If you're looking for a place to mostly drink while perhaps playing a game (skeeball!), then this will work for you. I came here with 5 friends on a Saturday night, we got there at 10 pm, and the place was absolutely packed. Despite the line outside the door, we got in within 5 minutes. The crowd runs toward the young end of the 20s, and it absolutely feels like a college/frat bar. The music is loud and you're not going to be able to have a conversation. I like dive bars in general, and I would come back here if I was looking to get some cheap drinks and a rowdyish atmosphere, but the games are an incidental, not a focus.",,,

It's also fun to get one of the tables in back with a big group of people. One of the times we went was for a bar crawl birthday, and we ended up getting 10 boxes of pizza delivered to us at the bar.

Come prepared with dollar bills or quarters. Not to strip. They have ski ball and a various assortment of pinball machines and pool, etc. I think my friend advertised on his facebook event that there would be $3 drinks here. Which made me scratch my head because I don't remember this bar being that cheap and of course it wasn't. Later hours and not happy hour a well is $6. Ah, whatever. The bartender snapped at me once for trying to order from the service door. Which I didn't see. . . . but then they took their time at actually taking my drink order when I moved. I'm not not a fan of this place but it also is kind of a dive and too juvenile for me at this point and age. But friends' birthdays. You've gotta go. Anyway, he did get to reserve an entire table which is kind of cool. But there is just something about this bar, maybe the people that it draws in that I find obnoxious and wanting to punch in the face.",1,1,1

This place is really big too, so you keep going back, wondering when you'll find the back room. It's a little forgettable, but thanks to foursquare I was able to recall where I was.

On those nights it's too crowded, too loud, and too obnoxious clientele. Bar games - pool, darts, pinball, skeeball, etc - are fun, until it's crowded and you've nowhere to go. You always feel like you're in someone's way here, and that someone is probably a jerk.Plenty of other places to go, not sure why people are crowding to get in here. Vintage lunchboxes maybe?",,1,

(Though the musclebound barback pushing me out of the way every ten minutes didn't help the vibe.)The crowd, however: that's a different story. Sitting from my booth, I could see nothing but a sea of stocky bodies in ironed button-downs, untucked atop khaki shorts. Now, if that sounds good to you, you've found your place. But if you're more like me, you're thinking, ""Wait, when did this dive bar turn into the consolation party for Ryan Lochte look-alike rejects?"" Now, I'm sure these are all worthwhile people, racked with hopes and dreams and fears like the rest of us, but when a big dude tells little ol' me to get out of the way of his pool shot, and then misses the shot, like, eight times, that just ruins my evening. (And don't get me started on the girls who can't even hit the cue ball and then collapse into a fit of giggles because ""OMG it's cute when girls can't do things!"")All in all, my review boils down to three things: there was tennis playing on the television, Smashmouth playing on the jukebox, and no good people-watching.",,1,1

It's much larger than most, which makes it less claustrophobic even when crowded, and there are very large, comfy booths to sit in with groups, as well as additional seating around the edges of the game room. The game room is the real draw (though the bar selections are totally adequate and the happy hour is great -- and lasts until 8pm!) because they've got 2 pool tables, 2 skee ball games, and 2 dart boards. Darts are free, by the way (you just pay a $10 deposit). The juke box is almost as awesome as its reputation suggests - I got to play Ex Hex, They Might be Giants, and Bruce Springsteen. My only complaint is that their two bathrooms are labeled XX and XY, and the XY bathroom doesn't even lock. Can't we get all gender bathrooms here already??",,,

Happy Hour was til 8pm where we enjoyed drafts between $4-5 each. We started with pinball but immediately got addicted to Deer Hunter HD. Games are $1 each testing your buck shooting skills. Don't have singles handy? They take cards (which can be a dangerous thing). LolBar was pretty empty except for people in the back of the bar playing at the pool tables. They also have an interesting collection of vintage lunch boxes decorating the wall including James Bond, Star Trek, Looney Tunes, and Bonanza.

We lost most of our group so it was just me and my friend. We played some skee ball and buck huenter which was fun for a bit. It was a little difficult to get a drink.

The bartenders are cool and don't take shit from anyone.And of course, one can't mention Ace Bar without mentioning the greatness in their game selection: darts, skee ball, pool, etc. Darts and pool are standard, but the skee ball really puts the place over the top.

I haven't played skeeball in a while so I took this opportunity to play for hours (great ice breaker with girls). Really enjoyed the atmosphere of this divey, New York bar. Great alt. rock music, $3 beer specials, and a full crowd of fun, young people. I would definitely recommend starting your night here and moving elsewhere, as it was pretty dead after 2AM but it is a great spot to visit.  Pool tables were annoying when the bar was packed and people were trying to walk by, booths were full but looked like a great spot to sit, drink, and people watch. Definitely would recommend making a stop at Ace.",,,

I've had 2 of my birthdays here and never had a problem reserving a table and having a drunken fun time.Only downside is the insane amount of people that come on the weekends.If you expect to get a drink in less than 20 minutes, its probably not gonna happen. I've also seen lots of fights break out due to the fact that the pool tables are so close together that people are always pushing and shoving each other. Literally every time I've been here there's been a fight. Can't fully blame the bar for that though.",,,

The guy who picks up your empty glasses had some anger issues the entire night and it is completely inappropriate to take that out on customers. There is a right way and a wrong way to treat paying customers.All in all, there are many other bars in the neighborhood who will happily take your money and serve your beer with a smile. The games are a nice novelty but after the giant crowd sets in, you can't even get close to them. A game of Skee-Ball is hardly worth watching your friends get disrespected.",1,,

I SHOULD be able to spend hours on end here without a problem.Sadly, I don't love Ace as much as it rightfully deserves, because the bar is filled with people like That Guy.*That Guy does things like this:1. Approaches the bar. Gets the bartender's attention, THEN deliberates for a over a minute.2. Asks what kind of beer they have in bottles. [Bartender silently points to prominent Bottled Beer sign.]3. Asks if they have Stella. [Bartender says ""Yeah, but on tap.""]4. Says, ""Oh. I'll just take a Long Island iced tea.""Last time, That Guy wanted to play me in pool. When it was his game, he handed me a dollar and waited expectantly. After a minute, he finally asked, ""Oh, so I provide the quarters?""That Guy will also pass up the gems on Ace's eclectic jukebox (you don't often see Husker Du, Fats Domino, Kings of Leon, and Ghostface's Supreme Clientele together), and insist on playing music that nobody wants to hear blasting when you're trying to kick back and play a little pool. In the right hands, such a jukebox can be a thing of beauty. I can appreciate the varied selection; but Ace, PLEASE put a few mainstream classics on there so That Guy won't ruin my night.*You know, the one who seems like he's out in public for the first time since he graduated at the bottom of his class in home school.

It maintains the feel of a dive bar, but unlike some other gritty watering holes, you never have the fear that you may get stabbed. Such a desired balance is hard to come by!The beers aren't too exxy, between $4 - $6 each, and we found the staff to be super friendly. The manager was a legend and shouted us a couple of beers! Thanks dude! We went again on a Friday night and it was packed with good peoples, so it looks like it's the kind of place you can either have a few quiet frosty ones or turn it up a notch and get loose. The only complaint I have is with the '24' pinball. That shit is hard!

What sucked though was that one of the skee ball machines was sort of broken (it was the one on the left... didn't keep score properly)... not sure if it's since been fixed. Seems like a waste of a dollar to me.I came back recently around midnight on a weekday, and the place was pretty much deserted. It was much bigger than I remembered it being the first time... almost cavernous... we just had a few drinks, played a round of skee ball (defaulted to the machine that we knew was working, so I can't say whether or not the other was fixed), and called it a night.Personally I prefer saving my dollar bills for buying alcohol and sticking in strippers' g-strings (especially when there are other skee ball bars that offer free games on certain nights of the week, *cough* Full Circle Bar *cough*), but I'd probably swing by if I felt like having a drink and wasting a few bucks.

People complain that at 1 dollar, skeeball is just too expensive to even play, but I ask you: why play skeeball at all when you can play...wait for it...BUCK HUNTER!Yes, Buck Hunter, no bar is complete without one. Chicks dig guys with plastic toy guns. It's addicting as hell.I went Saturday night. At 9pm, place was still on the quiet side. An hour later, it was packed which makes getting a drink hard sometimes, but luckily they do have waitresses walking around taking drink orders. It's just that, with the crowd, it also takes the waitresses awhile to get back to you. But it's all good. Use the extra few minutes to sober up a bit. Fun place and will definitely be back again.",,,1

The beer selection is fine & pretty reasonably priced, the crowd isn't too obnoxious & you can pick up free condoms in the doorway.Not a bad spot, but nothing special.",,,

It was also, until recently, the home of Brewski Ball, which is a Skeeball league, but it has moved to Brooklyn to its new home of Full Circle Bar. I played in that skeeball league for a season, had a good time, it was a good crowd, and the bar was okay, cheap drinks, but not much more than that. I liked how easy the place was, everyone was pretty friendly, the bartenders were only so-so, you had to go out of your way to get their attention whenever you needed a refill, which was a pain in the butt, especially because I was almost always there on Sunday nights (to roll with the league) and the bar usually had one person sitting at it. Seemed a bit ridiculous. I think the idea behind this place is if it's your normal haunt, you know everyone and get the best service at the bar. If you are not a weekly regular, you might not know everyone so well, and will find the service lacking. Saturday nights are way overcrowded so don't bother. You can't get a seat, get to the bar, or get more than 5 feet into the space without feeling claustrophobic. Decent week night place for a drink or two, don't know that there is much reason to go now without the skeeball league there.",2,1,1

195,Taylor C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/17/2015,"Honestly, this used to be one of my go-to spots in the East Village. It's super fun on a Friday/Saturday night, and the drinks are reasonably priced considering the location. However, the last time I was there I was overcharged by $25 on my credit card tab for 4 drinks that neither my friend nor I ordered on my tab. When I tried to get the bartenders attention, they said I should just call the next day to straighten everything out. When I called the next day, I spoke to the manager who was perfectly nice and willing to help, but it was clear that I wasn't going to get my overcharged money refunded. Needless to say I won't be going back anytime soon, which is a bummer because it is a really fun bar. However, not worth being charged two times the amount ordered.",,,

197,Adam K.,"Hoboken, NJ",149,236,30,4.0,2/15/2012,"Awesome bar.  Good vibe, pool, skeeball (which will win you free drinks with a high-enough score), and a wall full of vintage lunch boxes.  This is one of my favorite 'hang out' spots when I'm tired of the lounge/high maintenance scene in NYC.",1,1,1
198,Josh W.,"New York, NY",151,397,54,3.0,11/14/2010,"Pretty standard bar with lots of bar games to keep you entertained.  The place is loud and is crowded most of the time, so its great if you come here with a large crowd to chill.Darts, pool tables, ski ball, pinball machines, etc there's just a lot to do.  It's a nice change of pace from other bars in the area. One of my friends really likes this place so I seem to end up here more than I expect.  It's a good place to go to, but just not one of my favorites.",,,
199,ashley S.,"New York, NY",119,149,4,3.0,3/7/2010,"Wasn't planning on going out last night, but went to dinner with my roommate and a pitcher of margarita later - we were out. We ended up here after hitting up a couple of other places, it was a cute little dive-y bar. Can't comment on the beer selection or the prices since after dinner, I didn't need much more to drink. : xThey had little booths with tables so after my roommate saw me falling asleep standing we parked ourself at a table and stayed there until we left. I'd go back it's kind of out of the way unless you're looking for it so it wasn't packed, which might have also been a function of it being like 3am. yea it was another long night...",1,,1
