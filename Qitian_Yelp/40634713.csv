1,Laura C.,"Hoboken, NJ",96,112,10,1.0,11/6/2018,I visited NYU when I was applying to social work school.  The admissions counselor I talked to was extremely nice and informative.But their social work program doesn't seem that good compared to other schools.  I can't say I walked out of there super impressed.  Plus it's in a really old building- it almost reminded me of a New England prep school I went to as a child.  Sorry but that's not an experience I wanna relive.  Plus their administrative staff was so rude and not really that helpful. I won't be going here.  Not a good fit to say the least.But they have a good reputation and are located in a beautiful neighborhood.  I guess if you're willing to pay the really high tuition costs and you wanna be in an environment with creepy old buildings and a rude administrative staff then go for it.,,,

9,Michelle M.,Hong Kong,1485,1256,5885,3.0,4/3/2016,"There's no denying that I had some great experiences while at NYU, and that I owe part of my successes after graduation to them.I attended NYU for undergrad, when tuition was ""only"" $40,000/year* and John Sexton was president.I loved NYU because their location in Manhattan was awesome- deep in the heart of Greenwich Village. My freshman year, I lived in Rubin which meant I was able to have a 5th Avenue address for 8 months or so. :)I enjoyed my program as well. I pursued a degree in Sociology, with a double minor in Italian and Political Science. I had some great professors along the way. For one semester, I even studied abroad at NYU's beautiful campus in Florence, Italy. By the time I went there, I think it was in University hands for at least a decade, but don't quote me on that.Most of all, the people in my class were amazing and moved on to be very successful. I still keep in touch with a lot of the friends that I made there. Hell, my husband and I even met there (technically we first met on our first class ever during our freshman year, but we really only got to know each other during our senior year.)I also have to give credit to NYU for helping me get a job right after graduation. I was lucky because I entered the workforce right before the 2008 financial crisis. But I'm pretty sure having ""NYU"" on my resume helped me get callbacks. Same with when I moved to Singapore.Despite all the great memories, I'm a bit torn on what the University looks like today. You might've seen some press about their controversial expansion- ""NYU 2031"" as they call it- where they expand outside the core Washington Square location and build up to 2 million square feet of housing, classrooms, and offices in the Village. It sounds nice and all, but in the end, it changes the neighbourhood (usually for the worse) and unfortunately, it's always the students** who end up paying for this costly construction. And NYU is very notorious for giving out really shitty financial aid packages.Additionally, NYU is expanding globally, with fancy campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. To me, this screams ""NYU = corporate"" and I'm of the view that such global expansion dilutes the brand. Lastly, I'm not too happy with the alumni association here in Singapore. There are many alumni based here, and considering NYU's greed, it would behoove them to tap into this market for donations, considering the amount of wealth that these alumni have. However, the association doesn't hold consistent meet-ups (admittedly it's getting better in 2016, though in 2015 it was bad) and despite me reaching out, voicing my concerns, and offering my expertise to help, I've only been told that ""they'll relay my feedback to the 'committee'"" and nothing comes of it.I'm surprised that as an alumna, they don't see my skills as relevant and would rather keep doing things their way. I feel like they don't support me, and if they're not willing to support their own, well, I won't be interested in supporting them in return.It doesn't look like the NYU 2031 expansion plans will be going away, so I can only hope that future generations who decide on NYU will still get the education that they need, will be able to (miraculously?) pay off their student loans, and that the University doesn't ruin its reputation in my lifetime.--*You can bet your ass my parents are laughing at the return on their investment, considering 2015 tuition was quoted at $66,640 a year.**Don't get me started on how NYU apparently has more ""sugar babies"" than any other college in the US!",23,14,13

Updated review","With everything I said about scary tuition fees still remains true, I start to appreciate the education a little more now. I graduated from NYU (Tisch) 2 years ago, and clearly my education has set me apart from many who have studied similar courses. Having required general studies for Art majors is the best thing that can ever happen to undergraduates at Tisch. But hey, almost all of my grateful peers are struggling to pay their loans now. The tuition is way too damn high!",6,,

Often I went to class with her as a small child and slept in the back of class....child care remains at a premium in the city.She graduated Cum Laude and loves to tell people about her experience at her beloved NYU.On full scholarship she studied at night and became a New York City public school teacher by day and CUNY adjunct professor at night.Perhaps things have changed, but I felt quite welcome on campus and the three years spent here are some of the happiest and most memorable Mom speaks of.

18,Z B.,"Jackson Heights, NY",55,119,3,3.0,1/21/2016,"NYU is not exactly a school, although it is that and has many motivated and excellent faculty members and students; but NYU is, to a larger extent, a franchise. It occupies a strange space between a school with standards, curricula etc and an international investment tool.I just returned from their Abu Dhabi outpost where I presented at a conference. My field is not political or controversial, and that's a good thing too since AD is a very polite society where people fall into their respective social strata (Emirati natives at top, Africans at bottom), collect their cash and ask no questions. NYU seems eminently suited to this but they are still willing to push the envelope (showing Matewan- a labor rights flick- to students is almost as risqué in those parts as wearing a ""Mohammed sucks"" shirt). In the long run, the school will have to decide where it's heart lies, but right now they are maintaining an interesting balancing act.",14,,

They can discontinue it and give you nothing - no certificate, no refund, and a complete waste of time taking useless classes from people who shouldn't be teaching.

20,James L.,"Pasadena, CA",355,169,465,5.0,3/18/2014,"I'm biased as a former student in the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.  Some of my best memories were here.  I loved my undergraduate experience, but while at NYU, I couldn't help but wonder (many times) how much more I would have loved being here in New York City as a wide-eyed 18 year old.I arrived as a graduate student at NYU a week before 9/11 happened.  A lot of people took the semester off, which NYU generously facilitated, even with the students who took the gifted $500 because their housing was close to ground zero and they couldn't get back to their rooms for clothes, study supplies, books, etc.The school doesn't have a centralized campus like Columbia.  Washington Square Park is probably as close as it gets to that.  It's simply a cluster of buildings (maybe a square or two (like in front of the library) with the purple flag with the picture of the torch adorning the entrance to let people know that it's an NYU building.  I liked that it was this way, because I considered New York City to be NYU's campus.  It truly, truly is and coming to NYU means you're coming to New York.  There is a student bubble but, unlike most colleges and universities, it's fairly easy to escape the bubble.  I never once felt that whole Towns Vs Gowns thing.The school is large.  It's prestigious.  The CON is being overwhelmed which is a small, small price to pay for having Hilary Clinton come to speak during Women's History Month or studying in the library and getting interrupted because everyone is running to the main foyer to see Nelson Mandella walk in to speak or VS Naipaul doing a reading the week after he wins the Nobel Prize for literature or Al Gore speaking on global warming.  You get the point.  The school does favor left leanings and there are a good number of students and faculty who are far, far to the left, so if you're to the right or far to the right, this may not be a comfortable place, unless you're all about being around other people who think differently from you, promote tolerance, celebrate diversity and lean/look forward to new, free modes of thought.This is a school that doesn't hand-hold so if you know what you want and you're self-driven and take personal responsibility for your own education, you'll be in good company here.Random story: Jacques Derrida was a professor there while I was a student.  When I saw him in front of the library talking to a student, I had my celebrity-freak-out moment and just stared at him.  It happened in slow-mo.  He looked up at me and I thought he was going to say something, something brilliant, something that would change my life forever.  He then looked at the student he was talking to and said, ""Let's go over there and talk.""   Still, I was happy with that moment.  I forced Derrida to cross the street and continue his conversation.  Okay, I'm done being a geek.  By the way, did I tell you about the time I forced Derrida to cross the street? So cool, so cool . . . .",15,18,13

22,Tracy W.,"New York, NY",1,22,0,4.0,7/17/2013,"After skimming though all the NYU h8, I felt compelled to write a review of my alma mater. Sure NYU costs a lot, and sure and it may not be the most mothering of colleges out there, but for those who are assertive and forthright, NYU can provide you with damn good education whether it be in philosophy of law, linguistic semantics, or the enigmas of hipsterdom (or all three at once). When I was there (class of 2010) I always picked the best rated professors and they always happened to be the most intellectually challenging classes as well (ahem, Prof. Rajsingh -- he's so awesome I'm mentioning him in an effing Yelp review.) Your NYU education is what YOU make of it.Writing the Essay (or Writing Workshop...whatever it's called these days) might be kinda shady to some, but it really did improve my ability to think and write in a format other than the five paragraph essay that most high school students are taught. Writing isn't that formulaic and NYU knows that. Yes, I am in debt, but my debt will be paid off eventually. If if weren't for NYU, I wouldn't have made my super artsy friends who blew my mind with what they were doing in their super artsy classes (like create a sculpture that holds water AND shows movement?! wft?!?). I grew up and toughened up faster than my friends who went to more traditional colleges because I lived in NYC and because I had to fight my way through 4 years of that infamous NYU bureaucracy -- what separates the true violets (or bobcats now?) from the less formidable, weakling flowers (like pansies).

23,K V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/18/2015,"For those looking to attend NYU's School of Continuing Education to obtain a Certificate in Digital Cinematography, don't waste your time or money.  It's really a money trap.  I attended the four week intensive the summer of 2014 and was very disappointed that I invested $4,000 + four weeks of not working into an education that that seemed more like a scam than any school serious about educating its students.  I wasn't the only one, the entire class felt the same way.  By-the-way, this criticism is at the school and not the professors who taught the class.  I felt they tried their best with what they were given by school, which wasn't a lot.  Here's why:-- NYU School of Continuing Education is not the famous film school at Tisch School of the Arts, its a separate school altogether.  I knew this going in but many of the students did not, especially the foreign students who made up 3/4 of the class.  That said, the school administrators have very little knowledge of how to run a cinematography program and didn't care to research.  For instance, they advertise in their class description that the program will teach students ""Digital Cinematography"" but the students learn on DSLR cameras.  Big difference.        Also, the classroom/studio is an office space, like what you'd find at an accounting firm.  One side of the room had a full row of windows, so when we projected films or class assignments, the room was never dark.  There was no way to darken the room.  How does a cinematography class not support proper projection....  This is whole purpose of the craft.    There isn't enough workspace for all 20-25 students who attended the class.  Because there were so many students and so little space, we broke into groups to work on an assignment, so groups had to find empty office space rooms to work in.  While in the empty rooms, we'd be hounded and then kicked-out by the building manager, who was strict that all student must work in one room in the building, even when there just wasn't enough space.  It was a problem and very disruptive.  Why didn't NYU School of Continuing Ed figure solve this problem before the class started and why didn't they find a solution during the four weeks?  The ineptitude of the administrators was so out of place.     The foreign students had it the worst.  The original dates we registered for changed by one whole week only a few days before the class was to begin.  This really screwed up many of the foreign students financial situations because they had to stay an extra week that they didn't plan for, which meant extending living arrangements (which is very expensive in NYC), changing flights, paying change fees, ect.  It was brutal on some people.  And all the effort for a super sub par education.The whole situation was poor dealings.  The only one who truly benefits is NYU School of Continuing Education as they wreck in the cash. BETTER OPTIONSAfter taking the intensive at NYU School of Continuing Education, I obviously needed more.  So, I enrolled in The School of Visuals Arts continuing education courses for Cinematography.  This school is lesser known than NYU, but I found my education to be so much more thorough.   These courses were excellent.  They have two working studios, digital cameras, movie lights, full grip, a casting department and everything you need to practice cinematography.  I would also look into Maine Media Lab for a much better alternative to NYU's terrible program.",17,2,4

26,Nancy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,13,4,4.0,7/22/2014,"I can finally post this review after completing my undergraduate studies at NYU this May.In short, the NYU college experience is what one makes of it. There are amazing internship opportunities, volunteer programs, intelligent professors who are the top of their fields, and a vibrant social scene, but only if you choose to seek them. That said, bringing your A-game everyday is hard, and if you ever feel like you're about to become extinct in the concrete jungle, look for help from people who will gladly come forward to provide it--friends, family, faculty, and the Wellness Center. Yes, the school costs too damn much, and you should not attend if you do not receive any financial aid, are the sole provider for your family, or have loan sharks dogging your every step. I was a scholarship student, so take my analysis with a grain of salt. At the end of the day, I felt like I tried my best to make returns on the investment. Random tips/thoughts:1. Use your NYU print grant of $50/semester. If you don't need it, ask around. Chances are some poor fellow who is absolutely swamped with readings really needs to print 250 pages about the history of the mobile phone or 2. Work as an RA (or summer RA) to save money on housing, interact with great faculty members who live in residence halls and the residence life staff, practice leadership skills, and serve the community.3. Continuing on that note, work-study jobs are a good way to make money as a student because they pay at or above minimum wage while allowing for time to do homework on the job. They also work well as a first job on a resume, as the experience gained from working in an office environment imparts valuable transferable skills for future jobs. 3. Free food is readily available--prowl the floors of Kimmel after 7pm or Stern during common hour, or hang around the dining halls to solicit students with extra meal swipes. 4. Take advantage of Ticket Central to score great deals for Broadway musicals, plays, concerts, as well as discounted movie theater tickets.5. Friend requesting Joan Torch is worth it. 6. You are NOTHING without your NYU ID.7. Going to Chinatown for dim sum adventures? Save $2.50 and take the NYU bus. Same applies for parts of Brooklyn, the West Village, and Murray Hill.8. If you live in housing, take a stroll around the laundry room and check if there is a free washer or dryer available. Machine problem or human error, who knows? The only thing that is certain is your laundry coming out extra soft, warm, and snuggly because it was free! 9. Apply for the Wasserman Internship Grant.10. Never lose sight of why you came here :)",61,30,27

Honestly, it was worth every penny because I had a dual degree and the TSSLD (certification to practice as a speech pathologist in NYC for 5 years while getting your masters). Most programs DO NOT offer this option. NYU makes sure you do it. Counseling in my program was fair to good. Core curriculum classes in communication disorders were a mix of undergrad and grads taking prereqs. Expectations were high and the professors pushed you. Prepared you to apply for a masters in either Audiology or Speech-Language Pathology. I remember sitting in class one day and being shocked at how much I knew about something I had never really thought about before coming to college. It all just came together.As for the extra coursework (ie. Map classes.. if they are still called that) I really enjoyed most of it. Russian history, French Film (taught by a French teacher who showed us mostly Orson Welles movies), Intro to Printmaking, etc. were all good experiences. The stupid writing course that was required was pretty awful, but I think I had the worst TA ever and he must be gone by now. If he doesn't have his phD yet, or whatever he was getting, I'm sure he's in trouble. I attended the movie portion of my boyfriend's Hitchcock class in Canter.. it was awesome and the professor was actually very cool. Plus he totally owned his stuttering, which any future SLP is very happy to see.NYU has access to the entire city and they let you know it. Kimmel Center was built while I was there and I enjoyed it to the fullest. Program Board was an awesome place to make friends and set up great events for music, film, lectures, etc. The people I met in that club are some of my closest friends to this day. So if you are struggling try that, seriously! Bobst Library was amazing and I still had friends borrowing books for me there after I graduated. I think they let you visit only 3 times as an Alumni.. but yeah, that doesn't suffice if you are going to borrow all of your books for grad school there. I hardly bought any books in college because Bobst always had them and I'd just check them out. This is a good place to go if you don't care about a college campus and like to laugh about school spirit. Violets? Come on! Thank you for putting all of the sororities and frats hidden away on several floors of one of your massive buildings.. I never had to see them! Washington Sq. Park is yours but you share it with the rest of NYC- and that's probably what makes this place great. Be sure to jump in the fountain at graduation.

I was just surprised by her attitude, I just had a few questions about the program, how to apply and about the benefits.  She was frustrated by all the questions and I just said thank you and hung up and decided not to enroll in NYU.

Updated review","NYU is rated 1 star because it does not foster what I believe to be a collegiate environment.  Don't get me wrong you will learn a lot at NYU, depending upon your program.  If you are looking for a university with a strong sense of community, encouragement and support; NYU is NOT the place for you.  I am currently working on a Masters and I feel as if NYU is a joke.  I learned more in undergrad and have a great sense of where I fit into my undergrad and a strong sense of community and spirit.  The same cannot be said for NYU.NYU is a great place if you are a sociopathic bookworm, meaning you lack social skills and work and research is all that matters to you in life.  If you are this kind of person by all means come to NYU, If not please don't waste your time because you will be in a hurry to graduate such as I.  May 2012 CANNOT WAIT.",4,3,1

No football team, low emphasis on Greek life, and a lively city, not strictly college, setting.Because of NYU, I've gotten some of the most interesting and unique internships. Cupcakes aside, that is. Because of NYU, I got to study abroad in Italy, which changed my outlook on life and is probably why I'm even on Yelp now. Because of NYU, I got to live in prime locations such as Union Square, 5th avenue, and across from Trader Joe's.

43,Khristopher B.,"Jacksonville, FL",140,93,95,5.0,7/23/2014,"Coming from a graduate who studied in the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, I must say that a lot of what makes NYU great is that it's in New York City. The opportunities for students studying any field to go out into New York City and practice their craft is only matched by schools like the University of Chicago and the University of California at Los Angeles. Make no mistake about it, it's expensive as fuck to attend New York University. And most people attending are taking out hefty loans and not getting many scholarships. However, there's a name recognition and quality that NYU inheritedly has that I don't know you can put a price on. In other words, saying that you've studied and graduated from NYU just opens doors that I would argue could have never been opened otherwise. I loved my time there, hanging out at the crowded Starbucks across from Washington Square Park, spending countless hours writing in the Bobst Library, finishing a semester and then going to Swift for drinks afterward. One bit of advice for NYU though: they've got to do something better with the Coles Sports Center.",7,1,2

IF YOU ONLY GET Bs AND Cs AND Ds, AND NOT GET ANY FINANCIAL HELP FROM SCHOOL, WAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT?!there i said it, it annoys me so much when people complain about the tuition crap. get a job, get two, get three. i had two part time jobs at almost all the time. stop buying starbucks every day, and eating out every night. if you are planning to depend on your parents to feed you through all four years, then no NYU is DEFINITELY not for you. sorry i was being mean, but the point is, NYU isn't unmanagable n that its gonna bankrupt your family. i came from a pretty low income family, by the time i was graduating, i was gettin almsot half tuition scholarships, cause i studied hard and got really good grades. my friends and i all have work and internship and whatnot. the rest, i took out student loans with my dad' co-signing. so this way, i will pay my own way out of school instead of burdening my parents. i recently just graduated(one semester early, i studied abroad twice too!key is to take 18credit classes and pass proficiency tests when you are admitted like language and math for non-math majors, and AP credits help too(i didn have any thou)), and i have student loans of about $45k. which is not bad at all. well, just had to get that rant out of the way first. ----------------------------------------------------------why is there a review for our school? this is kinda weird, because if you are trying to go to college and you are reading on yelp for opinions... then... im not sure if u are smart enough to go to college to begin with. everyone's reviews here are biased. Although we all complain about nyu's high tuition and how cheap they are, most of us are still pretty damn proud of the school. I think to enjoy NYU, there are a few common traits among all of us who do attend here. 1. we are all somewhat pretty independent, i mean, being able to decide to come to an unfamiliar huge school in a gigantic city, we've all got some balls. and those who realize they arent all that independent, are usually weeded out after the first semester/year and transferred elsewhere, usually back into a gated school of some sort in the middle of nowhere. 2. through NYU, we learn to better manage our time and prioritize our lives. because if you didn't, you'd probably wouldn't be able to graduate and fail all the classes. no one is going to hold your hand, so if you have no self control and are extremely lazy and indecisive, there are so much stuff going on in school, classes, friends, and the city, you might lose youself, and your grades. 3. because everyone is competitive, you become somewhat competitive too, cause lets face it, when we see other people doing well, we all secretly want that too. and that is the reason why everyone always have some sort of part time job or internship or working on something. cause at nyu, if you are not into doing anything, nyu probably change that mentality. 4. we all consider ourselves sort of ""self-made"". nyu doesn't do that legacy crap ivys do. it doesn matter if your past 3 generations have been coming here.5. like it or not, we are the number 1 dream school. while all the nyu students are hatin on our own school, you gotta admit, when people ask where you go, and you say nyu, they are usually pretty damn impressed. 6. finally, not only did we survive, but we thrived in new york. thats better than 80% of students in this country who once again, go to schools in the middle of nowhere, with bean and corn crops and whatnot. once again, this apply to most of us.",47,25,22

I need to stress  this review applies to the SCPS - Schack Institute , which is primarily graduate and aimed at working professionals, therefore the majority classes are conducted at night.Upon speeding through the revolving doors of a fairly luxurious building on 42nd Street and landing in a outstandingly lavish lobby , I find myself dropping the ideas of jagerbombs and bodyshots  as fast as those banks of elevators where spewing out suited and booted corporate soldiers.The lecturers are all part-time as they maintain their full time profession in the industry, an element of the teaching which is literally priceless. Anyone can teach a theory , but to support it through a personal event makes it stick and actually quite interesting. The price tag is hefty, but is it worth it? The answer is , it depends on your financial situation. If you are planning to pay with borrowed money , then no , if you have money to spare then definitely. May I remind you as an international student the majority of low interest loans are not available to myself so I could not comment on their efficiency, but again in my eyes undergrad is a necessity, graduate follows once you know your definite direction and hopefully may have secured some financing from your employer. I am not very familiar with the stereotypical NYU student and hopefully don't fit the profile,yet again I did buy something from Urban Outfitters?! Nonetheless I have to admit upon answering the question ""Which school?"" ,I do get a fairly suspicious stare, as though the inquisitive party is trying to determine if I am alright as I seem or pretty much a right wanker.Finally, as most of the classes are night there is little interaction between students and everyone is focused in getting the class over in time for dinner or, preferably a ice cold bevy nearby, check BXL Cafe!Love it or hate it, I don't look good in purple but my parents' mantelpiece is missing a frame...",8,8,4

NYU charges Ivy League prices yet don't give an Ivy League education.  The students are given very little guidance and shuffled into classes based on some arcane formula that not many can ferret out.  Probably has something to do with money.  For example: Every undergrad student (except those in Gallatin) have to take a class called ""Writing Workshop"".  That's something like 30 - 35K kids a year taking this class.  Writing Workshop is its own department.  The head of that dept (when I was there) is Pat C.

Some were boring.  **This is true at EVERY university.  As for its relation to the city, just think of the University's goal: to provide an upstanding private educational Institution that thrives in one of the biggest cities in the world.  Their presence in the city is quite strong, and to be honest, as a student there, I felt nothing but proud to be a part of that.I will admit, you have to have a certain personality to come to NYU, but isn't that true for New York City as well?  Shy bookworms get good grades, but they don't take advantage of the city's endless opportunities.  Party girls usually spend their four years going out, and usually end up in Event Promotions doing exactly what they did in college.  It takes a balanced individual with a clear set of goals to make it (and make it happily) at NYU, because the environment offers many distractions that other Universities are not subject to.If you didn't like your time at NYU, you probably had a dream of coming to New York and didn't really know what to do with yourself once you got here.  I have a lot of friends who were intimidated by the city and rarely went outside their dorm, unless they had class.  If you feel the University didn't ""help"" you enough....what exactly can an administration with more than 30,000 students and faculty do to make you feel as if you got you allotted amount of personal attention?  You are in New York City.  Make it work.

I will say the following:I recommend NYU for people who are more interested in making career related connections than having a regular college experience. NYU kind of has a campus, but you don't have that sense of community that you must have at a college with a real campus (and football team!).NYU does have wonderful study abroad programs. I was a part of their ""Freshman Year in Florence"" program for international students. You can basically do a semester anywhere in the world, and I highly recommend doing so because it is a priceless experience. NYU obviously has its downfalls, but any university does. Having dorms far away from class sucks, but at least you learn to manage your time, get used to commuting. I had some ridiculously unchallenging classes but I also had some life changing ones. I liked most of the professors in my programs - in CAS. They are also great contacts since most actually work in the field they teach at NYU and you can get great internships as a result. NYU is very supportive of their students in any kind of club they wish to start; this especially since NYU is not really a community based university. They also hold events of every nature, and offer discount tickets to every broadway show or sporting event.I am sure I am forgetting ten thousand things I would want to say about my experience here, but in all, it was the right fit for me, and I guess thats what this is about, finding the right institution to fit your wants and needs.",19,6,4

Moving from SoCal to NYC was probably the boldest thing I've ever done in my life.NYU is not your traditional school, but I really think if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. It's a school that does not coddle you, which makes you choose how to create your own experience. I was put into upperclassman housing as a freshman- not ideal, but my random suite mate is one of my best friends now. I joined a sorority so that I could become involved with charity and events in the NYC community and be able to do more traditional college activities, like have house/apt keg parties. I was pretty active in school organizations. I studied abroad in London and traveled all over Europe with my friends.On the academic end, many of my Professors were/are some of the most influential people in this country. Yes, there are some Professors who aren't great, but that's the case with any school. I graduated a semester early with a double major, and then went on to go to a different law school a few blocks away. The entire time I was at NYU I had internships- in government, PR, marketing and business development- which helped me figure out my strengths and what I wanted to do when I graduated. I doubt most schools give this kind of access to experience as NYU. Not everyone can handle NYU, and that's ok. But to me, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to live in the heart of NYC with no real responsibilities in the world and only experience to gain. It can be hard to go to a school without sports, lots of red tape or to leave with a lot of loans (as a disclaimer, I don't have any, and that seems to be one of the biggest issues for people and something to seriously consider).

I saw myself going here in high school and I have no regrets, only that I did not learn more general studies (the arts school specifically really focuses on craft rather than general education, which at the time I was like cool but now I was like that's not a good foundation).I can imagine that a lot of yelpers are post-college. Believe me, NYU's SCPS (school of continuing and professional studies) is something you want to check out if you are casual or hardcore about getting your head into a class or 20. An incredible range and easy system of signing up, it really caters to the work force in New York. The SCPS teachers aren't necessarily the most organized or enthusiastic bunch, but the best is to focus on the angle that they are working professionals who have experience. That's the important thing to hone in on.Here's a good example of what's stupid about NYU: The graduate film program got a hot, 10 mil donation, boat parties, celebs, the works. What does undergrad get besides snide comments about how we aren't experienced enough (true in life, but you can't show ageism like that, its totally not cool) and how we're just, well, undergrad. We take the same courseload and work just as hard. To dean campbell, personally you shot me down and I think your admin needs an overhaul.There's plenty more to say, but that's how I feel right now. 1:29PM EST, 4/17/07.",17,3,8

It's places like this that long ago abandoned their historical roots and traded them in for a disney land speedpass. The administrative staff is to blame, not the student they create.

This is the worst school I have ever attended and I'm convinced that it is run directly by the Devil (I'm not religious). I transferred there from a junior college in CA. When I first showed up to check into my dorm there was not even a dorm manager or whatever the hell they are to check me in. It went downhill from there. When I had gotten my NYU ID, I didn't yet have the required dorm sticker because they hadn't been handed out yet. The security guard at the front desk gave me HELL each time I had to enter the dorm. The first time, they asked where I was coming from. I said ""uhh, California?"" not understanding the question. He thought I was coming from a different dorm. It took a long time to sort it out. Then one day when I tried to enter, loaded down with cleaning supplies for my substandard room, I flashed my ID and the guard SCREAMED at me to come back. He then berated me for not having a sticker. I think they thought I should have an old one, still thinking I was coming from a different dorm or that I should have had one from the previous semester. How could I have a sticker when they had not been handed out yet??? The next time that I tried to re-enter it came up again and when he finally recognized me he said ""oh, it's YOU"". This same guard had an altercation with an Asian American student one day and actually said to her ""Do you speak english??"" She did not have an accent, and had already been speaking to him, so he was simply being rude and racist. I saw her take this issue to the manager. In my whole time there I never saw a security guard who did not treat the students like dirt. The administration of the school goes beyond The Worst. My ""advisor"" was a decrepit old man who failed to inform me that I needed a certain class to graduate, thus screwing up my last semester and making me get special conditions to substitute a class. All the professors I had in my time there with the exception of maybe two, were unextraordinary. I found every person who works for this institution to be Vile. The school is money-hungry scum. They are disorganized and seem to have the students at the lowest priority. After graduating I was so disillusioned with the place that I didn't even bother to Walk. For the amount of money that they are gouging from people, the facilities are CRAP.  It seems grossly out of balance. Here's the worst part: I was actually stupid enough to go back after I graduated and take one of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies courses. Obviously I had learned nothing from my time there (that's what I get for giving it a second chance), because it was equally disastrous. I cannot say enough BAD things about this school. I am horrified that I will be in debt forever because of this institution. It is EVIL. EVIL incarnate. I had so many other bad experiences that they don't even fit here. Plus, I've probably blocked them from my memory, I'm that disgusted. I truly believe that the suicides that took place there (the highly publicized four in one semester were during my last semster... I believe two have followed since I graduated) are a testiment to the school's ineptitude. I actually just looked them up and discovered that someone did a documentary film about them: nyusuicides.com I cannot believe how unjustified this school's reputation is. I get sick to my stomach when I think that I wasted my college experience there. I hope that this review dissuades someone from making the same mistake. DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR MONEY. They are not worth the price. But don't get me wrong, the money isn't the worst part. It's the way they treat their students. Oh yeah, and don't forget that the place is filled with pretentious jerks. Mostly the staff but inevitably also the students.

They let you in, but you said yes and took out the loans, take a little responsibility already. Truth be told, you aren't paying for facilities (some of which are very nice, if disgraceful to the beautiful village architecture), you're paying all that extra money to be in NYC! Not for you to be there you selfish twit, but to cover the university's above average expenses. Yes, NYU is a business, but their expenses, leases, renovations, etc. cost much more than a school in the bumblef*ck midwest or the deep south, logistics are more complicated and cost is just plain higher (look at the indexes, compare NYC to say... Charleston)Also, the bureaucracy is hard to navigate, they're a large school, that's how it goes, I'd like to compare it to other schools of the same size and see how it does (U of Illinois for example), but if you're not an idiot, you can usually get what you need in a few phone calls and appointments. It's called taking care of things for yourself and being stubborn, which I'd argue is a good life lesson to those who expected everything to fall on their lap. NYU is a good fit for independent individuals who are passionate about what they are studying, not douches who thinAs far as the kids go, I was in CAS, but met many people from different programs over the years. There are a lot of people at NYU, and most of them are just not cool (read, extremely strange, often freaky), but after a little bit of sifting, you'll realize that the good crop at NYU is far better than the bros, preps, or frat boys you'll find if you pursue the 'college experience'. I had amazing profs and not so amazing profs, but that's all a matter of research, if you love what you study and actually spend time seeking out good classes and professors, you will learn a lot. Like anything else, you get out what you put in. You shouldn't let the constituency of the school bother you, you're in NY, you're not limited to hanging out with college kids if you hate them so much. Stop being bitter, if you didn't enjoy your time at NYU, it's your own damn fault, or maybe it's only fun if you have mad loot, I don't know, but the price you agreed to pay from the very beginning should definitely not be your main reason for trashing the school.

I can see why this might frustrate some people, but then I could say the same thing about the McDonald's and stupid fast food places that are taking over the area, no? Should NYU really avoid procuring new buildings in order to better the education or situation of the students just to please city dwellers inthe area?And then for those of you who feel that NYU doesn't care about the student body and such, how much attention and attention did you expect from a school with like 50,000 students? Honestly, I feel that the perhaps lack of personal attention from the university helps me become more independent. I don't think I would like it if they helped me through every little thing I had an issue with, or checked up on me to make sure everything was okay. I'm a big girl now and I feel that I can handle most issues on my own. When I feel that I do need help, I can always find the appropriate NYU staff who are perfectly willing to assist me with whatever it is that I need.My experience thus far at NYU has been everything I expected and more. I applied only to urban schools, and after living in the city finally feel like I found where I belong. No, the city is not for everyone, and neither is the school. But they are both certainly for me. NYU has provided challenging classes for me and has helped me create various networks throughout both the school and the city. This school has greatly expanded my horizons in multiple ways. I'm not entirely sure why people don't feel that there is a community here. True, a smaller school may have more of a community feel, but how much community do you really want with this many undergraduates? The first couple months of school I do remember thinking there was a lack of community, and because of that I specifically went and looked for events and activities that promote it. And guess what? If you really want to feel that you are part of a community, all you have to do is try. No, it may not happen on its own, there are no football games that everyone can get excited over, but if you look around there are more than enough opportunities.NYU has already shaped me into a confident, independent, happy person and I'm not even halfway done here. There are so many opportunities for whatever it is that I am looking for, which has certainly helped me become more well-rounded. I am so thankful to have gotten into this great institution, and although I am paying a ridiculous amount of money to go here, I feel that it's worth every penny. Yes, I could have gone to a state school that I could afford, get a decent education and gone on with my life, but nothing could compare to the experience that I am getting here, I am only sad that it is passing so quickly.

Creativity and curiosity were frowned upon at all costs. The only acceptable response to anything was to sneer at it and then put it down. You wouldn't dare admit to liking something.  This attitude was not limited to the film program.  At NYU, every major hated every other major, and the students made no efforts to conceal their contempt for each other.  And, for a ""school"" (a term I apply loosely because there was very little in the way of education happening at NYU) located in the Village with a huge theater arts program, there was a surprising amount of homophobia among the student body. Thinking back on it, I realize that there was something seriously wrong, like a sickness, at NYU.  So many people that I know made lifelong friendships at their colleges, but I am not in touch with anyone from NYU.  Not that it was possible to form real friendships there.  It was a very destructive place, filled with anger and hatred, and I left after two years feeling defeated.  Isn't college supposed to be a time of self-discovery, of broadening your horizons and coming into your own as a person?  NYU preached conformity at all costs; I felt as if I were back in middle school.  As for the administration, I believe its only goal is to acquire real estate.  I remember touring the campus and the guide said, ""We like to think of New York as our campus.""  I suspect that the administration's goal is to buy up as much of Manhattan as possible and make it, literally, NYU's campus.  The only good thing I can say about NYU is that it is in NYC.

They treat you like dirt at the bookstore, holding up a $100 bill you gave them as if you are a crook, they treat you like dirt in the financial aid office, they treat you like dirt at graduation, snapping at you for not handing your gown back to them in the proper manner, the career services is no help, and then when you return home with your tail between your legs, jobless nad in deep for the rest of your life with Sallie Mae, you are inundated with phone calls and letters asking for money. The dumbest decision I made was going here. If only Ihad the internet back then, I could have researched everything. I'll be paying for this the rest of my life and nobody will pay me ever. I'm bankrupt, miserable and suicidal, all thanks to NYU and Sallie Mae.",6,4,

And showed up to class sometimes. Somehow I made it through. I never got kicked out, and I never even got in trouble! I smoked pot in the dorms (shhh, don't tell) and drank in the courtyards (our secret). I was in a sorority (yes, they exist), and managed to extort money out of NYU's pocket to fund our wild parties. And I never got fucked over by the system either, I've asked for countless transcripts and they've sent them out right away. I've even talked to some Registrar representatives over the phone, amazing, I know! And when I started my teaching job, the School of Education was quite helpful! All in all, quite a good experience, before and after. Though the sports teams could use an overhaul (who wants to practice softbal at 10pm?). Minus one start for the ungodly price and for not having a student center 3/4 of my years. Oh yeah! And they have a Vegan Night at my old dorm. And the lady at the dining hall there remembered me from 9 years ago! If that's not dedication, what is?",4,4,2
