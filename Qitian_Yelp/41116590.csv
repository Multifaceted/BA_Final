0,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1075,1948,46,5.0,5/22/2016,"I cannot believe that I live in the area and never found out about this gem of a place until last night when a good friend brought me in here. Sunita is the best part of this place. She owns and runs this bar smoothly whether there are 4 clients or with the whole house filled up. She is quite skilled at entertaining and pours an excellent passion fruit jalapeno martini. You must try this drink when you stop through!The space is amazing. When I walked in at 7:30pm, immediately I liked the vibe. It was classy, with lots of red and lit beautifully. Classy, sexy and grown up. Just the way I like bars. She also carries El Dorado rum, which isn't the easiest to find in the city. And El Dorado rum is from Guyana,  which is a place so close and dear to my heart. After having a few martinis, I tried the 12-year old, which was slightly sweet and very smooth. And very easy to sip on. The 15-year old one was a bit more grown-up just as excellent. By the time my friend and I left Sunita's place at midnight, the place was swarming people having a good time and the best of all, Sunita was all smiles and the perfect hostess. I am so happy my friend tipped me off to this place. I have found a new watering hole and also a friend in the neighborhood who can make a mean cocktail!",12,3,6
1,Alexander A.,"New York, NY",23,58,140,4.0,5/17/2018,"Overall - Great bar with a casual intimate settingWhat I got - Jalapeño Martini and old fashioned Taste - very good, the martini was nicely balanced and made with quality spirits. It had a nice spice to it without being overpowering. I'm rather picky about my old fashions so I asked Sunita (owner and bartender) if she made a good one. She humbly replied ""yes"", so I got one and it was really good. Value - average-good, although I didn't pick up the tab this evening the drinks were reasonably priced especially for NYC and certainly above average quality.Service - Excellent, the owner is also the bartender and she is very nice. She was nice enough to let us order some pizzas and bring them into her bar. Atmosphere - quiet, relaxed, great place for a date, casualFacility - ~20 people more if they are standing. There are couches and some tables set out in an intimate setting to facilitate conversations.Would I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - Maybe",,,

3,Stacy Y.,"New York, NY",2,33,12,4.0,1/13/2018,Very intimate setting and a great place for conversations or catching up with friends. Drink selection is a little limited but the ones that do exist are pretty good. My favorite is the elderflower!,,,
4,Merica K.,"Jersey City, NJ",230,119,203,5.0,5/5/2017,This place is absolutely fabulous! The bartender and owner is amazing! She is the sweetest person and made me and my boyfriend delicious fresh drinks! I can't wait to come back here again. I had the confidently creative  cocktail. It is prosecco with passion fruit nectar! DELICIOUS! My boyfriend had a Brooklyn lager.,1,1,2
5,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,2/8/2016,"This is not a great cocktail bar. HOWEVER - and this is a big however - it is an adequate cocktail bar with a fantastic, laid-back vibe. It is an adequate cocktail bar where you can actually find a table take a breath while decompressing from attempting to squeeze yourself into the Back Room or some other packed LES establishment. So it is just okay. But considering we got a text from Attaboy on this same night at 3:30 AM - THAT IS ""AM"" PEOPLE - the combination of chill/relaxing/warm/friendly on the LES is something I need to commend. I'm very into cocktails/mixology. Look at my cocktail list. You'll see what I mean. I'm giving Sunita Bar three stars because these cocktails are A-OK. Yes, Jalapeno martini is great. Far better than anything else offered here. Read every review of this place and that's clearly everyone's highlight. But even this drink, when comparing it to others I've had in the city, is no better than three stars. I'm just trying to bring the expectations for *drinks only* down a bit. Again, I will repeat, the jalapeno martini is thoroughly enjoyable. It's well-balanced. It's spicy. It's sweet. It's colorful! It's the signature here, clearly. We argued over who won the rights to drinking more of it. I think we did a decent job of sharing. But that's besides the point. Nothing else is worth getting, so let the jalapeno martinis flow free.You come here for that martini (or if Nurse Bettie and/or the Back Room are/is too packed), you stay for the vibe. Sunita Bar is fortunate to be sandwiched in between two very popular LES bars. Honestly, I'm not convinced it would stay in business if it was located elsewhere. That said, if plotted into a different neighborhood (UWS, perhaps), it would probably be thought of us one of the best cocktail spots in the neighborhood. Clearly the point of this review is: it's alllllllllll relative. So about that vibe. You've got a wonderfully sweet bartender, the ACTUAL Sunita of Sunita bar, which is just lovely. Having that personal touch is so rare in the city and I have to give her tons of credit in that regard. The place itself is pretty small, yet it doesn't ever seem to be crowded. There were a few small groups here when we came, but it took no effort to plop ourselves down at a table. Back to that point about everything being relative: compared literally everything else around it, Sunita Bar is calm, quite, intimate and relaxing. I'm aware that I'm being redundant. Just felt the need to hammer that point home. While we left here promptly after finishing our single round of drinks to find some more - okay, okay, call it pretentious - elegant cocktails, this was still an enjoyable experience.",7,4,5
6,Nitin G.,"Austin, TX",0,8,0,5.0,5/1/2018,"One of my all time favorite cocktail bars in nyc. Relaxed, intimate atmosphere. Great place for a first or second or fifth date. Sunita is an institution - you don't want to miss out on this place.",,,
7,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",223,218,634,5.0,1/13/2016,"Sandwiched between Nurse Bettie and The Back Room, this spot was a great find. It's cozy, intimate but casual, not too dimly lit to the point where you have to hold up a candle to see your friend's face. I'm not a fan of jalapeno-infused vodka (tried it before and didn't like it), but the passion fruit jalapeno martini was surprisingly delicious and I would definitely return just to get another one. The ambience is very chill, with some lounge chairs and small sofas in addition to high chairs lining the bar. It was nowhere close to crowded at 9pm on a Saturday night, which made it the perfect substitute for two other bars in the area that we had to give up on because they were packed to the brims. The only thing was that there are no prices listed on the cocktail menu, which runs a relatively short selection of about 5-6 drinks. Still, it's the perfect (not just good) spot for dates. Not as loud as Nurse Bettie either.",3,1,3
8,Madhu R.,"Washington, DC",95,640,27,5.0,10/8/2015,"I never say this, but this bar is PERFECT!  The owner/bartender/welcoming host Sunita is so friendly and a great conversationalist.  She has a fascinating personal history.This 12 year old bar is a refreshing throwback to early 2000's New York, when this city used to be a little more interesting; when there were more family owned establishments and fewer Chase banks and Duane Reade's.Located on a quiet block in a busy area, this is the best hidden date spot around, or a great place to catch up with friends on the comfy couches or patio tables.  At this bar, you can actually hear the other person talk! The drinks are stellar and Sunita is an expert mixologist. Best jalepeno martini I've ever had. Not too spicy, not too sweet, and had lots of flavor. Best kept secret in the city!",4,,2
9,Allyson C.,"Manhattan, NY",388,8,0,1.0,2/11/2017,"Super slow service, two different people had to get the bartender's attention before she same over to me which took about 20 minutes.  Then the bartender promptly told me she didn't have my card at all even though I had an opened tab. The bartender then proceeded to interrogate me about the conversation I had with my  credit card company demanding I pay for the drinks when she was the one who lost my card. I will never go back again.",,,

14,Jaime M.,"Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY",8,30,17,5.0,9/24/2015,"Up close and personal drinking spot.  Great place to kick off the night and launch off your LES adventures! Note: it is small so if you have a large crowd go early, this will allow you to lock the place down all to your own!",3,,2
15,Frank S.,"Monroe, CT",4,67,33,4.0,1/31/2016,"Great place for specialty cocktails, low key small comfortable space. I was here in January but it looks like they can open the front doors and bring the outside in. I'm definitely headed backs when it warms up.",1,,1

18,Ciara H.,"New York, NY",4,9,3,4.0,7/19/2016,"I love Sunita's! I love the vibe here, always laid back. Also Sunita is such a doll. I love the idea of her being the sole employee and owner. Lots of regulars always chatting to her, which is a good sign. Any time I've come here we've had a great time- no pretentiousness or overcrowding. Always a good time!",3,1,3
19,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,9/19/2013,"Chill small cocktail spot on the LES. If looking for a laid back spot to pre-game a bit before a night out, or for a nightcap to end the evening, then Sunita Bar is a great choice to enjoy a few cocktails made by Sunita herself.She has a list of house specials to choose from, and if you are like me and enjoy bourbon then The Jake is a good choice of libation. Well made and strong. There is also an Elderberry drink that rocks pretty good. Prices are a bit on the high side but as expected for a place like this. Sunita holds court behind the bar and mixes the cocktails at a leisurely pace which matches the vibe here. Chill. Relaxed. Ahhhhh....Small bar area, a few couches and tables inside, and a few tables/chairs on the front sidewalk. Intimate and cozy. Kind of sexy but unassuming. Perfect low-key under the radar spot to take a date and get your game on.",7,4,6
20,Kristen H.,"Great Neck, NY",13,12,169,5.0,8/28/2015,"Sunita is more than accommodating. She is an extremely talented mixologist, and has a sixth sense for flavors that mix well.

21,Shruti A.,"Jersey City, NJ",119,19,33,5.0,7/5/2016,My girls friends and I head here at lease once a year for cocktails. The place is managed by Sunita herself who makes the delicious concoctions.

22,Tony H.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,108,18,5.0,2/24/2015,"My girlfriend and I came here after seeing a show.  They have two couches against the wall, a couple of small tables, and a bar.  It's quite small, but feels cozy, not compact.  And the whole time we were there (11pm-2am, Valentine's Saturday night) it never got overly packed.  Sunita, the owner and bartender, played a great mix of old school love songs.  The ambience was perfect for intimate conversation.I tried an elder flower and gin drink that was complex but pretty good.  It was refreshing yet a little heavy.  The sweetness of the elder flower complimented the bitterness of the gin nicely.  I would not have thought to put those two together.  I also tried my girlfriend's prosecco and passion fruit drink which was entirely too sweet for me.  Therefore, I was reluctant to order the passion fruit and jalapeno martini.  However, this was one of the most amazing drinks I've ever had.  (I later found out a close friend made this her signature drink at her wedding, and rightly so.)  Sunita infuses the vodka with jalapeno herself, and it definitely has a kick.  That kick is tamed by the passion fruit, and it is truly a drink you have to try to appreciate.The only downside is it seems to only be the owner who works there, so if she steps out to the back, to the bathroom, or wherever, you'll just have to wait until she comes back in order to get your drink.  She could stand to hire at least one other person.My girlfriend and I got pretty drunk here as we kept wanting to try the different concoctions while enjoying the romantic and intimate atmosphere.  I hate to recommend this place simply because this is a gem I want to keep to myself.  But if you are looking for the perfect spot to end a night on the town with a special someone, you should definitely check out Sunita Bar.",4,1,4
23,Andre W.,"Chicago, IL",440,1717,367,5.0,4/29/2013,"I had the notion to find a chill spot on the lower east side to grab a few drinks before dinner and thanks to the Yelp app, I found Sunita. Once I jumped out of the cab, I smelled someone grilling and sure enough it was in front of this place so I followed my nose...lolWe walked inside this small, quaint place and saw everyone having a good time drinking and conversing. We got the last 2 available seats @ the bar. The setting is very intimate as the lights are pretty dim and the music is mellow /hip hop. The walls are exposed brick and the vibe is real chill. The guys who run the place is really cool and accommodating. One of the guys walked up and said ""go outside and grab you a plate"" and they also told us they are gonna be bbqing out front most of the summer so to stop by anytime. I got a pear martini x 2 which were very delicious and refreshing. They have a nice drink list and can make anything. Once they found out it was my friend's bday, they got us a cake tasting shot which was surprisingly good as I usually do not like ""sweet"" shotsThis is definitely a spot I will visit again & again",4,2,5

I actually had trouble looking for this place during night time where everything is dark and you can't really see its small signage and storefront number. Once I settled in, this place is cute and fine. The seating is a bit cramp, so indoor seating seem to be prime real estate.Come here for the cocktails, stay for the company.",2,,1
25,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,8/29/2013,"A really lovely respite from the mad 20something scene on Rivington and Stanton. I have no idea how they managed to keep this cute little cocktail nook uncrowded on Friday night, but thanks!A southeast Asian lady, who I can only assume is the eponymous owner of the bar, smiles and mixes drinks for her guests. Not super fast, but then it's not that kind of place. There are a few chairs outside, and enough seats inside to accommodate dates and small girlfriend get-togethers. Ladies, you will love this place.The drinks were not bad at all. A bit pricey, but no shocker there. What a nice little lounge. Hope it sticks around for a while.",2,2,3
26,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,1.0,10/11/2013,"The reason why people go to bars on Friday nights is so they can forget about the passive aggressive, patronizing crap they have to deal with at work and have a nice time. Not with Sunita. She brings the passive aggression to you. I sat down on the couches when it cleared up, and boy, was she speedy at putting away the little coffee table that accompanied the couch. I wasn't sure what was going on initially, but some minutes passed, and we weren't handed a menu.Fine - a nearby menu was grabbed. We waited some more. Sunita totally ignored us. I have no idea what was going on, but if we weren't supposed to sit there, I think it would have been decent for us to be told what's going on. It's also not like I brought a rowdy crowd and/or was poorly attired. It's incredibly unbecoming of a owner to be so petty.",2,2,
27,Kruthika S.,"Troy, MI",200,32,16,5.0,2/15/2015,"Such a great little place. It's small, cozy and unassuming. The music is at a good volume. I was there on Valentine's Day so she had her special playlist going. She played MJ, Otis Redding, Ray Charles and other great love songs. My boyfriend the Elder Flower and the Jalapeño Martini. The jalapeño martini is as good as everyone says. She told us she tries to judge how much spice you would want so it's not unbearably spicy. It's such a well made drink. I had a drink with prosecco and passion fruit which was also really good. You can't go wrong with that combo. I really recommend this place for a cute place to end your night and have some great (albeit tipsy) conversation.",3,1,3
28,A R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,0,5.0,4/15/2016,"I can't for the life of me understand the appeal of bars that blast music so you end up screaming at the people you came to the bar to have conversation with.  Unless there's a dance floor, what's the point of that?  (I suspect the point is to make you scream at your friends so that your throat gets raw and you order drinks more frequently...).  Sadly, more and more bars seem to have gone that route and they feel less like bars than slightly more grown-up versions of frat parties.   Given my quest to find bars that feel like bars, I was so happy to find Sunita a while back, and it remains my go-to in Manhattan.  It's a perfect bar: the drinks are great (especially, as everyone else has pointed out, the passionfruit jalapeno martini, which is extraordinary); Sunita (the owner) doesn't stint on the pours or swap out cheaper alcohol for whatever you've ordered; the bar is comfortable and has a nice ""salon"" kind of vibe; he music is good but doesn't overwhelm; and Sunita is gracious.  There's no fratty b.s., no screaming til you're hoarse, no pressure to order another drink or get out so someone more profitable can have your spot... basically, an old-fashioned bar with new-fashioned drinks.   This is what a bar should be.",2,,2

30,Alisa Z.,"Orange, CA",194,315,66,4.0,5/2/2015,Nice tiny place with delicious drinks! I love Sunita's passion fruit martini. Both the times I've been the place wasn't croweded.

Some of my perennial favorites are the cucumber martini (smells like a spa!) and the red pepper concoction (the heat!). There's always something new, and she'll most surely take requests.Add it to the LES roster, filed under mellow sexytimes.",10,5,10

Pretty impressive. This place is cozy, intimate and relaxing. I loved the drinks that Sunita concocted and I got more than a little buzzed after two (I admit have a low tolerance, but the drinks were pretty strong). I came for my friend's birthday and had a great time. Sunita is not a place for a dance party, it's more of a ""sit down and talk"" kind of place. I would say that Sunita is a great place to start the night.",2,,1

But: they suck, the venue is often crowded and full of tourists. If you just actually want a drink, and a great drink, come to Sunita's. She has a short menu but can make whatever you like. The jalapeño martini is legendary and I love her sazeracs. It's rarely busy (sad for her but great for me) and tends to have regulars. The space is cute but small. The decor average.

48,Kara M.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",5,30,38,4.0,6/18/2014,"I was invited here for a date and was a little suspicious when I first walked into a completely empty bar on a Saturday night (especially since the place about 5 feet away was packed). However, it's a very cozy and comfortable spot with delicious drinks. The passion fruit jalapeño martini is mostly sweet, but packs a nice kick from the pepper. Our bartender, Sunita herself, said it was the most popular drink on the menu and it's easy to see why. It was delicious and you could barely taste the liquor.I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to return here. Although the drinks and atmosphere were nice, nothing about the place really stood out to me. It's another dimly lit downtown bar to have on hand if you happen to be meeting someone in the area. It's a nice place to start off the night but wouldn't be a final destination.",,,

Its easy to get in, small place, no bouncer, no hassle. Felt like a 1920s feel. Very chill, very cool spot. Great place to catch up with friends or even a date. Went on a weekend night at around 11 ish, not crowded so it was really nice. Recommend giving it a try!",1,,2
50,Joshua B.,"ASTORIA, NY",25,11,9,5.0,1/4/2013,Very solid spot.  Quiet.  Intimate.  Music is done very low in the background and doesn't distract at all.  Great place to go to when you really want to talk and be heard with great cocktails.  Drinks were well balanced and crisp.  It is very quiet and small so you can't be intimidated by being heard with what you say.  Major props to the owner/bartender who was very friendly and open.,4,,2

She always had great recommendations for drinks. The place is nice and intimate, quiet and a great place to talk to someone or a small group of people. the only problem is the sign for the bar/lounge is so small I walked past it the first time. My only gripe was that I had to select cocktails from the shorter weekend menu and not the regular menu.",2,,1
53,Yesenia P.,"Orlando, FL",187,195,25,4.0,3/1/2013,Tiny bar with great drinks. You have to get there early if you want to grab a seat though. The space gets filled up pretty quickly so this isn't a bar you want to hang out in all night. I heard they were known for their drinks and they do have a small menu of special drinks as well as a selection of beers and other alcoholic beverages.There seemed to be just one employee in the whole bar - not sure if she is Sunita - but she was great. Music was really good too.Only lost a point because I got a little claustrophobic after a while,2,,
54,Ricki W.,"Sacramento, CA",10,8,2,5.0,2/2/2015,"The owner of this establishment makes some of the best drinks you will ever have. You must try the jalapeno martini. The place is small, cozy, and the music is great.",1,,1
55,Jacqueline C.,"Leonia, NJ",492,20,1,5.0,10/9/2012,"Sunita Bar is named after the very friendly owner/only bartender, who takes her mixology very seriously.  This bar is intimate and definitely somewhere you could take a date for that ""second drink"" to get to know her better ;).  There's definitely a very chill vibe  - good music, comfortable couches to sit on, and great drinks.  I definitely recommend the jalapeno margarita - it's a spicy papaya/jalapeno combination that I guarantee you will enjoy.That being said, Sunita Bar is great for parties.  After being introduced to this bar a couple weeks ago by a good buddy of mine, my boyfriend decided to have his birthday party here last weekend and it was terrific.  Because this place is generally not too crowded, it was very easy for him to have thirty or forty friends at the bar at any given moment.  And even though Sunita was the only person working the bar, she did a great job at keeping everyone happy.",2,,2
56,Lisa T.,"Hayward, CA",57,1364,6,3.0,7/8/2013,"The drinks here are decent and there's never a crowd, even during peak hours. It's a good place for groups or a date.

59,Lee M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,0,5.0,6/29/2012,"I love this bar! It's home of my absolute favorite cocktail ever, the Perfect Affair (the spicy jalapeno drink).  Sunita can even adjust the level of spiciness for you, and she infuses the vodka herself.  The drink goes for about $10, but I think that's a fair price for the quality and the work that goes into mixing.  The atmosphere is sophisticated/chic.  It's a small space but a perfect place to bring a date.  Sunita, the bartender and owner, is also super friendly.",3,,2
60,L. E. S.,"New York, NY",3,52,1,5.0,10/20/2012,"Hands down, the best bar in the Lower East Side.. Sunita, who runs the place, is just the nicest person anywhere, and has a sixth sense on how to prepare drinks exactly the way you like them.This place is way under-appreciated and I think suffers from being squeezed between Back Room and Nurse Bettie, with not a lot of signage, so people aren't aware of it.  In a way, though, that makes it perfect.  Hidden in plain sight!",2,,1

I'm not talking about the bar only. The owner Sunita is a sweetheart. I went there twice only and the second time i went she remembered my favorite drink (the passion fruit jalapeno martini) has to be spicier than she normally makes it. She gets an extra star for even remembering me!  oh i can't put more than 5...       Anyways, If you're looking for a relaxing, laid back bar this is it. I had a good time the first time i went. Second time i dragged my friends there and had a blast.",4,1,6
63,Vicky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,77,59,5.0,2/24/2012,"I've been here twice, and in just as many weeks. I usually don't frequent some place that much unless they are close to me and good or it's just that great.Sunita fell into the second category. While not terribly far from me, it's a little bit of a trip compared to my other haunts.What makes this place so nice is that it's not loud. By not loud, I mean in the sense that it's not flashy and gimmicky. It's utterly calming. Once you step through the door (which I completely missed both times, just know that if you see Nurse Something with the same door number, you'd passed it) life just naturally slow down.Sunita is the owner and bartender of this bar. Though to call it a bar is a little misleading. A lounge would do it better justice. She makes all the drinks herself, and with real fruit thingies. The word escapes me right now. Very friendly, not that I had much of a chance to talk to her because it does get busy, for a one woman show, and you don't really come here alone, it's a bit too romantic for that.I'd tried all the cocktails in the vodka section. I had the ginger saketini too. The first time I favored the ginger saketini, but that might be because I had an overload of sugar that day and needed something light to clean me out. The second time I couldn't get enough of the lychi. I love how the lychi is soaked in it's own juice before being dropped into my cup. I'm a bit of a slow drinker so by the time I finish the lychi has soaked in just the right amount of vodka. I hate it when it's completely soaked, too bitter and all the fragrances of the lychi is gone.The signature jalapeno martini was good, but not my style. When it cooled (or is warmed...?) it's kind of gross. I suggest you drink it quick if you decide to get this one.There's a variety of other liquor and such that is all around the same price. I didn't venture to try them. Just stick to simplicity and the menu and you'd be fine.There's soft music in the background, no tv or anything else. It's very dim in there, the couches are a little ---make that quite a bit beat up, but it's masked a bit by the lighting. And beside you won't really care as it gives it the cozy feeling, especially with how tiny this place is. Then again any bigger and the service will suffer. I think it's the perfect size.So glad I'd found this place. A bit sad I didn't find it before when I was living just around the corner. Oh well, better late than never.---One last note:I paid with card the second time and while it going through my bank it showed a different, read higher, amount than what my bill (plus tips) was. I was initially worried and was going to call Sunita about it, but got busy and once it gone through, it went through for the amount it was suppose to. So if anyone else had this mini heart attack, just know that it's not Sunita trying to scam you. And if it went through for the wrong amount, I'm pretty sure that Sunita would be reasonable enough to correct it, provided you have your receipt and/or she remembers you. All the more reason to talk to her no?",1,,1
64,Leslie S.,"Geneva, IL",13,322,256,4.0,5/4/2011,"I do love the jalapeno martinis here - so much, I have to admit that I've never tried any other drink! It almost doesn't seem fair for me to review the place, but I had to put my two cents in: these martinis, which honestly do taste as though they are blended with actual jalapenos, really are worth the trip. Quite simply, nothing else compares. In fact, I just had the blood-orange jalapeno martini at The Stanton Social and can tell you right now it in no way, shape or form lives up to the standard set at Sunita.Amazing martinis aside, the staff really do go out of their way to accommodate you. Though we hadn't been to the bar in at least three months, Sunita herself remembered us and welcomed us wholeheartedly. It was like Cheers, but with class and sophistication.",3,,2
65,Christina P.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,3/20/2012,"I'm almost reluctant to write a review since this is the perfect happy semi-secret hideout for chill NY natives trying to get away from the hordes of rowdy masses and pretentious wannabes filling up almost every other watering hole. My selfish self wants to keep it a classy, drama-free zone where I could have the bar to myself, my friends (or dates) and Sunita. On the other hand, I wish I could give this bar 10 stars and shout my love for it from the rooftops. How could I not show my love to the person who's been concocting my favorite cocktails in the city for all these years? Sunita is part of a dying breed of bartenders/bar owners: the expert mixologist who also lends a sympathetic ear and never forgets a face. If you go often enough, she'll start mixing your favorite drink as soon as you walk in the door, before you even say a word  (Jalapeno passion fruit martini, extra spicy FTW.) Seriously, Sunita is a BOSS on all levels. Her lounge is worth the trek down to the LES. Go by yourself if you have to. In fact, you may enjoy the experience more if you do...",1,,
66,Laurissa Y.,"New York, NY",141,106,88,4.0,3/24/2011,"I made the mistake of promising a connoisseur of spicy foods the prospect of jalapeno drinks at Death & Co on a warm, balmy summer night. In fact, I made the idea of spicy refreshing drink perfection so appealing it became an overwhelming disappointment when we were quoted a wait time of 2 hours at the door. Thanks to yelp, I was able to regain a modicum of respect -- maybe I even impressed with my faux insider knowledge? who knows. The drinks were delicious, inexpensive, and the tiny place was charming and hidden. Years later, I find Sunita a great refuge when the bars in the nearby area becomes too much, too ""LES""y for a chill evening out. It's a trek from any station but the JMZ, and it's hard to call it a a ""destination watering hole"" but it's great as a night cap after one too many drinks at Nurse Bettie's next door.",3,,3

Mind you, this is Saturday, a little after midnight. (During our stay 5 more people ventured in here)Sunita made us 2 absinthes ($14 each) and I had to try the jalapeno martini ($10). It was incredible! Worth the money. She tastes everything she makes (save for the absinthe). I can't wait to save up more money and come back here.

She is friendly, knowledgeable and oh-so talented.I came for a friend's birthday. The place is very small and intimate. It has just a bar, a couch and a few chairs to sit at.We sat at the bar and started to peruse the cocktail menu. The font on the cocktail menu is a little tough to read. I cant imagine trying to read it after a few drinks, but this is not the kind of place you get sloshed at.Each cocktail is a recipe of ingredients that dont seem like they will go together, but they do. They really do. It took me a while to decide what to order because everything sounded delicious and I wish I had the time, money and the liver to try every drink.Sunita said the jalapeno passion fruit martini was the most popular so I gave it a try. It was delicious! I dont like sweet drinks, and this was just perfect. The spicy jalapeno made the passion fruit less sweet. I had to stop my self from chugging the whole thing at once.My second drink was the El Diablo. Tequila, creme de cassis and lime. It was really good, but not as good as the first drink. My friend had the lychee martini which was subtle and refreshing.Each drink costs between $10 and $12. And each one is worth it!",2,,3

She uses the freshest ingredients.  She actually makes her own syrups and infuses her own liquors.  She is a perfectionist and very methodic about what goes first and what goes after, in order to make you the perfect drink with the perfect taste. Great spot for a date or just a relaxing night. And yes, Sunita is the DJ, the bouncer, the bartender, everything!!!

Sunita even remembered details from the last conversation which was two months ago. Basically, Sunita loves her bar as can be assumed by her love for creating cocktails, her detail to the atmosphere, and her menu.                                                                                                                                               Second, atmosphere.

In addition to the bar, there are two red leather chairs with a small table, two red couches that three to four could fit comfortably, and a table that can hold three to four as well. Sunita places candles on the bar and tables add to Sunita Bar's intimate and classy atmosphere, there is also a chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

RIIIGGGGHHHHTTTT.and, i'd pretty much agree with you ... except i went to sunita's for hermano's thirty and dirrrty birthday party and it was a status-changer ... wait, a LIFE-changer.sunita is everything you'd expect ... she's cute. petite. impeccably maintained. owns the same ikea lounge chairs that i have. most importantly, she actually has a cocktail list where i'd be more than obliged to take a sip out of each creation. she's also empty 8PM on a saturday night which was key because our lil group of 10 was loud and just wanted to throw our stuff in a corner and not worry about anyone jacking it. sorry but mama needs TWO hands to enjoy her $12 cocktail. examples include the passion fruit jalapeno martini, elderflower gin and this red thing with rye. sunita also popped our absinthe cherry and didn't pass judgment as nine 30 year olds (and one charming 26 year old ... ME!) watched her, entranced, devise the licorice-tasting concoction. i guess as you approach your 30s, you've gotta work THAT much harder to stay relevant.* * - kudos to the snarky yelper who told me that via g-chat ... you know who you are. sars.",29,32,27

93,Dre S.,"Long Beach, CA",1,21,2,5.0,11/20/2011,"Nice relax crowd on a Saturday night, drinks are tasty and affordable. I paid 8 bucks for stoli and tonics which is a pretty good price. Sunita runs the whole bar so be kind to her, she works hard and mixes nice cocktails. Its warm when you arrive so take off your winter clothes and just chill. Her martinis are good but don't expect to get drunk. I switched to Jameson on the rocks to get a better buzz. Her focus is clearly on taste so enjoy the tasty drinks and relaxing atmosphere.

I always felt comfortable and in the midst of good people while at her sophisticated/relaxed bar that always drew me in to either start off my evening or end it there. It is right next door to the hidden speak easy bar called the backroom. If you are into trying really good martini's - ask for her specialty -Jalapeno Mango Martini! She used to be a chemist in her previous life, so she's an expert!",6,1,6

Would definitely go again!",,,1
105,Noel R.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,189,2,4.0,8/1/2007,"Small, clean and inviting little bar tucked away amongst the trendier bars. I bet money Sunita's bar will out last them all!!Mainly because of Sunita herself who is the charming, stylish but unpretentious bar owner. She pointed out that tonic in Hendricks is sacrilege and converted me onto soda. Later in the night when the English can lose whatever manners we're supposedly famous for, Sunita kept a smile.  I don't give 5 stars unless there's a wow factor which is a little unfair on a bar like this. I should give it an extra one for the cleanliness of the restrooms late on a Saturday night in the LES.",5,,5
106,Marco H.,"Maplewood, NJ",21,39,2,5.0,2/1/2012,"Sunita is an awesome host, but get there before 10pm if you want to just chat with her.  She is the only one working the bar and can get swamped.  The passion fruit-jalapeno martini is incredible!",1,,1
107,Brian F.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,156,5,5.0,1/2/2011,stumbled into this tiny lounge in the earliest hours of 2011 with a group of ten and took over.  Drinks were strong and good and the music seemed perfect for the new year that swam before our drunken faces.,4,,3
108,lora c.,"New York, NY",76,254,22,4.0,10/7/2010,"I'm jumping on the bandwagon but Sunita is the bartender who turned me onto the magic of a jalapeno cocktail. For a reasonable tenner, you get a delightful and well-made cocktail, that is sweet, spicy, and will leave you craving for another (and another, and another). The bar is a narrow joint but easy-going. Your mouth will drop when you realize that Sunita is not only the owner, but also the only employee (ie. she not only makes your drink, but takes out the trash, cleans the dishes, etc) so give the woman some props (or a bigger tip!). This bar is a little oasis in the LES and you really do feel like you're just hanging with friends in your living room. Make a little small talk with Sunita and it's likely you might get a drink comped.",5,2,5

Plus you can spy on all the hip kids lining up to go to Back Room, which is right next door.Nice, laid-back vibe, chill music, great drinks. Not the biggest space, but I've never had trouble getting seats, either at the bar or on those plush couches. The mango jalapeno martini that gets a lot of buzz is actually a passion fruit jalapeno martini, and definitely worth trying  (she can make it more or less spicy depending on what you like). Cucumber ginger martini is also legit... she slices the cucumbers on the spot, so it smells super fresh. Agreed with all the other reviewers: Sunita, the bartender, is awesome.",4,,5
111,Greg M.,"Greensboro, NC",1,13,15,5.0,3/6/2011,"Cool spot. Interesting music and nice vibe. Five beers on tap and loads of mixed drinks. Easy to walk past the joint, so walk slowly.",3,1,2

113,James S.,"New York, NY",2,3,0,5.0,11/18/2010,"First, the cocktails are amazing. The Jalapeno Passion Martini is famous for a reason, and is an amazing blend of sweet, spicy, and strong. If you've never had it, you really need to, but don't get me wrong, the entire menu is amazing. Sunita (the owner/sole employee), really knows liquor, and really cares about every single drink she mixes (going so far as to taste each one with a stirrer before serving). The atmosphere is relaxed without being ""dead"", and the clientele is generally friendly. It's chill without being boring, and classy without being pretentious or uncomfortable. I highly recommend this place if you want to be able to have a conversation and enjoy the company you're with.",4,,3

116,Francisco H.,"Astoria, NY",71,234,15,4.0,11/1/2010,"Sunita Bar reminded me of my college dorm room due to its size.  However, I got a good vibe from the place.  The bartender's drinks didn't mince on the liquor (always a good thing).  I tried absinthe for the first time here and I will always associate Sunita Bar with this foul-tasting concoction that I can't wait to have again.  My only problem with this place is that I have to make multiple subway transfers in order to get to it but I guess that's a small price to pay.",2,,1
117,Katie Y.,"Washington, DC",177,502,162,5.0,9/15/2009,"I hosted a bachelorette party here, and it was exactly what we needed - great for groups because it's a small and intimate setting with the perfect type and volume of music, not to mention killer cocktails made by Sunita. Despite being short on space, Sunita did a great job of maximizing the space that is available - you can comfortably sit on the couches, even alongside strangers, or you can sidle up to the bar, or stand by the bar, or sit outside... so even when the place did fill up a bit it never felt crushingly full for claustrophobes. The Passion Jalapeno Martini is, in fact, all that... and her signature cocktails are all made with good alcohol (no rail) at $10 a pop. My only complaint is that when it does get a little busy, it may be hard to get Sunita's attention - she is, afterall, only one person and she is making time-intensive drinks. So if you go, bring a little patience in your pocket.",7,,7
118,Tian X.,"Manhattan, NY",85,117,9,4.0,12/14/2009,"If you enjoy chatting with friends over interesting cocktails, dim candlelight and light background music, you will enjoy this place.

It never gets too noisy or crowded here either, so its a great place for a small circle of friends.",4,,4

We got other drinks but i can't remember what they were. They were all great, so don't hesitate to try any of the interesting cocktails sunita makes. The only thing, this place is pretty tiny and if you come in with a group you might not find a place to stand/sit, depending on the time of night. Some of our group was almost out the door since there was no room to come all the way in, but we came at peak bar hopping hours....",3,,3

The place is small...I would say if 35 people were in there it would feel very crowded. The bartender was very nice and accommodating. They have absinthe, which is cool...but the cool part is that she prepares it the way that it is supposed to be prepared. I would feel guilty making her go through the process if the place was crowded, but we were there when it was empty and it was fun to watch. I highly recommend.",7,,7

Now that I live in the city, its much easier to get over there, and I indulge regularly. Sunita herself is very personable and an excellent bartender. She'll customize her drinks to your taste, so just let her know what you want. The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with a group of friends, but its a small venue so avoid planning a big event here. Definitely a great place for a quality cocktail.",7,,7
131,Spike G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,51,0,2.0,2/27/2011,"The main problem with this place is that it is literally the size of a closet. If you have 10 ppl, it feels busy. if you have 20, it feels packed. i called sunita bar to have a birthday party and showed up about 15 minutes than originally anticipated. The bar was so incredibly crowded that several of my friends could not even get inside. I had spoken to Sunita (the owner/bartender/manager/waitress) ahead of time to make sure she could handle a 20 person party, but when we showed up, there was literally NO room. My frustration was that when I spoke to her upon arrival, her response was a mere shrug, and a ""well, you never know, it gets crowded"". To me, this was analogous to ""sucks for you"". No apologies, no acknowledgment of how unfortunate this may be considering I had invited a group for my birthday.  I told her we were all going elsewhere, hoping this may bait her into offering us some type of concession, but she again just offered a phony smile and stated ""ok. have fun.""All i can say is this: I know this is probably a pretty cool place, adn I've had friends who've had a good time. But i've lived in nyc for a very long time, and i've hung out on the LES longer than sunita bar has been in existence. if you have a tiny space that cannot handle a party, dont agree to host one. I'm not boycotting it, but I'm very very disappointed not only in the lack of foresight (literally guys, the bar is TINY), but in the lack of compassion/care at the reality that i had booked a party at a bar where my friends couldn't fit.its a big town with a lotta bars. if you have a group, go elsewhere.",2,,

There was no one in Sunita Bar and we almost thought it was closed.Despite the fact that we brought the crowd in (we were celebrating a birthday and had a group of about 20), the bartender was unfriendly and slow to serve. After about an hour, I asked her to close my tab and she completely ignored me. I let it go and continued to mingle. Other people gradually started to come in and the bar got a bit busier.When I was about to head out, I went to the bar to close my tab and was again ignored. I reminded her that I had asked to close my tab an hour before and she started giving me an attitude. Then she refused to serve drinks to another girl in our party because she did not like my tone.It's unfortunate that we had such a bad experience because the bar IS cozy and cute.

Sunita, the friendly bartender slash proprietor, runs her place like a Mom and Pop operation (this one without the Pop), but puts her focus exclusively on grown-up libations like mojitos, spicy martinis and a cut-to-the-chase selection of top-notch spirits with an emphasis on good vodka and bourbon. No menus required - Sunita is a master-mixologist, so you name your pleasure and she'll get to work.
