0,Eli B.,"Queens, NY",4,59,69,5.0,8/13/2018,"After doing a lot of research on all of the restaurants participating in Restaurant week, my friends and I decided to give Capital Grille a shot. I made a reservation about 3 weeks ago for a party of 6. On the reservation I specified that I would like a private room if available and luckily we got one for no charge. Our waiter Billy was very attentive and gave us his opinion on what the best options were from the Pre-fixe menu. He also told us about the Generous pour event which includes 6+ glasses of various wine's to pair with our meal for $28 more. We all took part in the generous pour event because you can go to any other restaurant in the city and expect to pay that much for 2 glasses, what a steal.Billy brought out a couple of baskets of bread (all of which were awesome) and we got started with our meal. Most of us started with the wedge salad and a couple of others started with the clam chowder. The wedge salad had giant pieces of bacon and a heaping dollop of bleu cheese. Very tasty. The clam chowder was also quite tasty and didnt last very long. For our Entree's, the majority of the table opted to pay the extra $10 for the Kona Crusted NY strip. I opted to stick with the regular Bone-In NY Strip. Each steak was cooked to the way we ordered it and it was all incredibly tasty. For the sides we did a 4:2 ratio of mash potatoes to French Green Beans. The mash potatoes were the star of our meal, just awesome. For dessert we each shared the Espresso Cake and Creme Brulee, all very good. I didn't get to take many pictures of the meal because I was already 4 glasses of wine deep and completely forgot. I can't recommend this place enough as this was one of the best meals I had in a very long time. The value for what we got was absolutely crazy and I will be returning very soon! Don't be turned away because you think its just another chain restaurant, they clearly are doing things the right way.",2,,
1,Colette G.,"Shoreham, NY",94,183,82,4.0,11/18/2018,"Cap off a Broadway show with a meal at this Capital Grille. The steaks are like butter! Melt in your mouth delicious. We had a party of 11. Make a reservation if you can. Large parties I would recommend requesting the upstairs area, as it's more intimate and quieter than the main floor.  Although they don't advertise a kids menu, they have children choices that are delicious. 4 ounce filet mignon or chicken fingers and fries are both great choices.We enjoyed a great variety of menu choices in our party. Porterhouse steaks, Caesar salad, lobster with tenderloin, calamari appetizer, au gratin potatoes to name a few. We all shared our meals with each other, and all were excellent.The only reason I don't give 5 stars is our server was not up to snuff.  We had to flag her down for everything. Another drink, clear some plates, more dressing etc. Also, as the side dishes are separate, they should come close to when you get your meal. They did not. Same with our desserts and coffee. Some of us finished, some still waiting.Overall it was a great place to have a special meal for a special occasion. Will definitely be back. Hopefully the service is better because for the prices and the 5 star food, you should experience 5 star service.Still I highly recommend!",2,,
2,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,8/8/2018,"I came with coworkers for Restaurant Week lunch and was pleasantly surprised. It's a gorgeous space and impressive throughout despite being a chain. It's definitely a Midtown corporate vibe, and it's got expense account (though not eye-popping) prices to match.The RW lunch menu ($28) gives you a choice of appetizer and entree, which I believe were two salads and a clam chowder. Some raves from the group about the clam chowder; I went for a salad which was fine but forgettable.Most of us went for the cheeseburger, and I don't think more than a couple managed to finish it. It's a big, satisfying portion, and all the usual accoutrements are fresh and flavorful. What wasn't flavorful was the patty itself, which though it had a great juicy texture just didn't have that meaty taste I look for. Similarly, truffle fries had a mouthwatering scent but didn't deliver that earthy flavor.Pacing a bit on the long side but never egregious, and they did a great job handling our group of 12.This is a good use of Restaurant Week (Del Frisco's still delivers the ultimate RW lunch), as you get a good bang per buck. One of our party members opted to order from the regular menu and blew through $50 easily. I would also skip drinking here as by-the-glass prices are high.",2,1,3
3,Angelica B.,"Manhattan, NY",67,99,376,5.0,7/15/2018,"Not usually a fan of a chain restaurant but they had me a lobster crab cake and you get two! The service was impeccable , dare I say the best I ever had ?! Food:I started with the delicious must order lobster crab cake and lobster bisque . My favorite ? Lobster crab cake , it had so much flavor without the side sauce and that was just an added bonus and I must say everything tasted fresh. For my main dish I got a filet mignon  with a side of their rich mash potatoes, cream of spinach and Brussels sprouts with bacon which ended up being the best dish and that with the crab cake has had me waiting to go back. I always love a good steak house with the very own amazing sides or apps",1,,
4,James S.,"Seattle, WA",573,85,161,4.0,3/24/2018,"This was a solid Steakhouse for a group of 8 people. It wasn't terribly busy at 7:30 on a Friday so we could have found a table for more people. One of my friends got a porterhouse and he loved it. We got two crab cakes, two spinach, 2 calamari appetizers, and two truffle fries, two lobster mac. This was the perfect amount of appetizers and sides. Note to self make sure to go for the $100 bottles of wine. I got one that was $80 and even though it was rated + 90 you could tell the difference.I got the New York strip which was 14 ounces. Next time I'm going to the filet mignon. I think I would like that better because it would be more tender and it was 10 oz.This place was close to Times Square so it was nice to walk around there afterwards. But it was a far walk from Penn Station. I would just take the 320 bus from Secaucus to Port Authority. It only takes 30 minutes. And is a 15-minute walk to the restaurant",3,1,2
5,Audrey L.,"Englishtown, NJ",121,121,377,5.0,7/20/2018,"We were 5 girls coming here for the prefix dinner for $39 after our Wednesday matinee show.  We all loved it.  The menu allowed you a soup or salad. I had a fresh, delicious green salad with a light parmesan vinaigrette  dressing. I then had the dry rub Kona steak...about 14 ounces and sauteed spinach. I was able to exchange the potatoes for the veggie.  It also included a dessert. I had the homemade sorbet with 3 flavors. Most of us indulged with a glass of wine. I enjoyed everything about Capital Grill.  The venue is very sophisticated and elegant. There's an open kitchen. Our waiter got all our orders correct which was a big plus.  The hostess was delightful and we couldn't have asked for a nicer experience.  We would definitely return on a future trip.",2,,1

7,Elizabeth B.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,82,239,4.0,9/28/2018,"Overall, solid experience at the Capital Grille. I've been to several locations across the country so I'm aware of their impeccable service and good. The ambiance is elegant yet cozy. After traveling for over 7 days with our two teenagers, my husband and I needed a break and a nice dinner on our own. We decided to go to Capital Grille. There are three in a very close proximity. We went to the wrong one but the hostess immediately accommodated us. She was gracious.  Our waiter was great and most everything was perfect. The only feedback I have is how my fillet was over cooked. I ordered it medium and got it really over cooked. If you look at my photos you can see how both of our steaks were slightly over cooked, mine more than his. My husbands rib eye had so much flavor, you over looked the charred pieces. Mine on the other hand burnt off the seasoning that was on it. I would go back because this was the first issue I've had at a capital grille... ever. But in future, I'm going to bring it up to the waiter.",,,
8,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1726,624,4345,5.0,12/15/2017,"So I came here to grab sometime to eat while I was at Rockefeller Center and Radio City doing the Xmas thing. Wanted a place to get a good meal and a cocktail  and it was a block walking distance away. This place has a bar area and a fancy upscale dining area in the back. I was in casual clothing dressed for cold weather so I wouldn't have even thought to try and sit in the dining area so I found a place at the bar. The bar was pretty busy and had a WallStreet feel to it as far at the people that was there. I felt like I was around tons of men who trade stocks and buy real estate lol . I was tended to right away by Mike the bartender who was fantastic and super friendly . He explained the menu to me and made suggestions that ended up being right on and I loved what I got. Cocktail... had the Stoli Doli which is their signature cocktail.... pineapple infused vodka . $15 but nice and strong.  Also tried some Cabernet wine from Paso Robles that went excellent with my mealSoup- the Porcini Mushroom Bisque was EXCELLENT . I mean - I know I will dream of this and want to come back for this! :) mike recommend the steaks here... most of them were super large portions so he recommended me trying the sliced filet mignon with mushrooms, onions with fig essence. The meat was excellent even tho I am more of a ribeye kinda gal - and this was 10oz vs the other options that were like 16oz and more.  I ended up sampling their flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. Both were really good. And I'm not a cheesecake person at all but this cheesecake was like wow. I read about the lobster Mac and cheese which is one of my favorite sinful foods ... I will definitely be back with friends to share that, try other items and to have the porcini mushroom bisque again.",13,5,9
9,Chrissy B.,"Queens, NY",16,113,189,5.0,6/3/2018,"This review pertains to private events only. I came here for a CE course which was pretty intimate with about 16-20 people. The waitress was very attentive to our needs, the table bread were served pretty quickly, and she made sure our glass of wine was always filled. The table bread consisted of different varieties of breads to thin crackers. For the entree, I opted for the  citrus glazed salmon which was pretty delicious. I expected it to be bland like most places but I'm so glad I was wrong. It had a nice crisp and was well seasoned; to my surprise, I ate the whole thing. The dessert spread consisted of cheesecake, creme brûlée, and chocolate espresso cake,All in all, the food was great  and I would definitely come back.",3,,1
10,Tam R.,"Somerset, NJ",50,69,54,5.0,2/6/2018,"Just got back from an excellent dinner. It's restaurant week so we had the options of the regular or restaurant week menu. Drinks were great, steak was amazing, we ordered the filet and grilled shrimp,  aged steak, clam chowder was tasty.The warm bread was an added bonus. Wait staff was attentive and helpful with the selections of wine and food.The ambience was more on the professional/adult side. Noise level was louder than I thought but that was not a problem for us. Came with a friend so might not be appropriate to bring the kids.There is coat check, which is helpful since it's cold out. Centrally located.",,,
11,Rose L.,"Queens, NY",75,122,152,4.0,6/12/2018,"How have I never reviewed this place? I've been here at least a doze times, and I almost always have a good experience. The only time it was kinda wonky was when we had a party of 7-8 in one of the private dining rooms, and the waiters kept forgetting about us, but other than that, it's solid. We were here about a week ago again to take advantage of the theater menu, which they have between I think 4-7pm everyday. You get to choose a starter, an entree, a side, and a dessert for I believe $42 or $45 or something around there. This is an incredible value, because that's how much a single steak can cost if you get it a la carte. My go-to is the clam chowder (def worth a taste if you haven't tried it before), the kona crusted steak (my fave!), and the creme brulee - altho I do prefer the cheesecake (I think you can pay a little more and get it instead of the creme brulee). Overall, I think it's a solid meal for the price. It may not be the best steakhouse in the entire world, but what I love about coming here is that they are consistent and consistently good. I know what to expect, and they always deliver.Other items of note:Lobster mac and cheese: tastes good, but the amount of lobster is inconsistent sometimes - but when you get a good dose, so worth it.Bread basket: brown bread with raisins is my favorite, but all the other stuff is good too! I basically get full before the appetizers even arrive.Fried Calamari: they pan fry it and stir in pickled peppers, and it's a great combination. Sometimes it can be a bit oily b/c of the pan fry.Truffle Fries: I think they have some parmesan on these too. No real truffles - just truffle oil, but it's still good!",,,

14,Beth H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",346,985,1269,5.0,5/3/2018,"This review is for private dining. I am in Michigan, and was tasked with finding an appropriate diner venue for my boss to host 15 high-profile investment advisors for dinner, the night before their meeting, in proximity to the meeting venue and hotels. The Capital Grille fit that bill. They have a variety of accommodations for private dining, which made it easy to find one that fit our needs perfectly. The rooms are elegant, yet comfortable. The private dining manager was responsive and making arrangements from afar was a breeze. I could see the details of the rooms online, which was very helpful. We were able to choose a set price per guest and even choose the wine ahead of time. The menu choices were excellent and decadent. The room cost requirements were appropriate for the size of the party/room and reasonable. The dinner was last night, and I just received a big thank you from my Big Boss that the venue and dinner was excellent, and thanked me for finding it. (score points for me!)  Thank you Capital Grille. We will definitely use your services again for the next pre-meeting dinner.",1,,

The steak was cooked medium to perfection. Their wine selection is astounding! We had the Caymus 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon which was a fabulous, well balanced wine. They have an app where you can save your favorite wines and make reservations, however it can't seem to save your wines...great idea though. Nice place to wow a date!",,,
16,Shawna S.,"Miami, FL",26,116,125,5.0,3/7/2018,"I'm a fan of the Capital Grille without regard for the city I am in; I have very, very rarely not had an optimal experience.But, this particular location deserves an individual review.I made an advance reservation by phone.The agent I spoke with was polite.And, when I called back, twice, to alter my reservation, she maintained her hospitable demeanor.The day before, I also received an accommodating reminder with the same professional and friendly tone.On arrival, the exterior location was under construction, but that did not interfere. The interior had the expected classy decor.Our hostess was ready for us at the front and we were immediately led to a private booth.Anthony, our outstanding server, arrived in seconds offering us menus and drink options. He presented the evening specials and because of the later hour, (9:45 pm), was able to hesitate at our table and briefly chat. Service and hospitality at its finest!As always, the flatbread and rolls on the table are fresh-baked.Though I was set on ordering the porterhouse, as I always do, I went off my plan and chose the remarkably underpriced special, Twin South African Lobster Tails. My dinner companion went for the Filet, from which I shared a healthy portion.Both the surf and the turf were precisely broiled to perfection.The advertised 10oz lobster serving was monstrous; enough for 2 with some left over.And, quite the bargain at $54.00!!!The Filet had a perfect char with a juicy, pink center.Combined with the sides of mushrooms and the most homey mashed potatoes, we had a perfect dinner.Somehow, Anthony coerced us to order, and finish, a healthy slice of the classic flourless chocolate cake. This is a long-respected establishment with predictably high standards for food and service.We were not let down!",1,1,1

The location on 42nd Street is better than this one - this location might be a bit overrated. The fam and I went for Restaurant Week. The herb roasted chicken was really dry, as was the halibut that my cousin ordered. I get it, who goes to Capital Grille for anything other than steak, but whatever...The lobster mac and cheese is solid, but not enough to redeem the meal. The calamari app is awesome, though.I've had better. Judging off both of my experiences, maybe it's better as a lunch option than a dinner one.",3,,

27,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3836,3382,93,4.0,8/24/2017,"It's never my preference to eat at expensive chain restaurants, least of all when I'm on vacation. I guess my latest visit to New York was technically a work trip, which is why I ended up spending one of my evenings at the Midtown West Capital Grille.I'm one of many lawyers who decided, ""Fuck the law, I'm gonna write books (and also Yelp reviews)."" I got an invite to speak on a lawyers-who-write panel for a bar association conference in New York a couple weeks back, and I met with my fellow panelists for dinner the night before the event.The dinner wasn't covered, and I was a bit confused when the organizer informed me that he'd booked a private room at the Capital Grille. He noted there was a food and beverage minimum for the room, and that I was expected to put in $100 for my share. This all seemed pretty unnecessary for a party of five, as well as a wasted opportunity for a group of people visiting this great food city from different parts of the country. To make things worse, I'd already planned a late second dinner with friends, and was only going to meet my co-panelists for drinks. I showed up ready to have a bad time.As soon as I walked into the room, I understood. Turns out I was not just the only woman and non-white person on this panel, I was also the youngest by a few decades, and the only one who hadn't written a presidential biography. The organizer was a lovely Texan man who said there was a Capital Grille in Dallas, and it was always reliable. Everyone ordered the filet.Once my resentment evaporated, I had a lot of fun. We were in the Phillip Johnson room, and it was quite pleasant, quiet and comfortable with a round table big enough for about a party of eight. Service was attentive and professional. Our waitress checked in on us at regular intervals, and we were never wanting for anything.I didn't eat a full meal here, but I did get a half dozen oysters, and they were good, fresh and tasty, served with mignonette on ice. Mostly, I drank. I had a couple glasses of red wine, as well as a cocktail and a pour of Courvoisier (we had to reach that minimum). All very nice. The cocktail was a twist on an Old Fashioned called the In Fashion, made with Russell's Reserve 10-year small batch bourbon, Grand Marnier, and black walnut bitters, served over an orange ice sphere with an amarena cherry. Thanks to the New York law requiring chain restaurants to display calorie counts on the menu, I now know that an Old Fashioned is about 220 calories. Good to know, I guess.I was in a great mood by the end of this dinner. My dining companions were friendly and fascinating, and I was pleasantly tipsy. There are definitely better places to eat for $100 a head in New York City, but if you want the comfort of a private room in midtown, I guess you could do worse.",3,5,7

The dinner rolls are piping hot and crispy. The crisp bread/cracker is meh. Served with butter.Clam Chowder - I liked this. Nice and creamy with a decent amount of seafood chunks.Dry Aged Sirloin - cooked perfectly but still a bit chewy.

Perfection in a bottle,try it if you can. I opened with the Lobster Bisque (with a very nice portion of real lobster meat ), now that's how to make Lobster Bisque.

I would have rated this a 100/100 except for the fact that the waitress dripped some of my choice wine on the table,and my sleeve, as she withdrew the bottle after pouring my glass.( Somebody teach her to twist the bottle counter-clockwise as you lift ), unless you expect me to suck on my sleeve to get all my fermented grape juice  :)  So we'll give it a 99/100 and 5 STARS.  Highly recommend.",1,,
34,Almond B.,"Northridge, CA",1,35,13,2.0,7/9/2018,Service at the bar side was good. My Lobster Mac & Cheese was too salty and although the lobster was cooked perfectly there wasn't enough of it. I paired it with the filet which was grilled perfectly well done how I like it but it lacked flavor and seasoning. If I just want something in a hurry I would come back but it's not top of the list for sure.,1,,
35,Sydney C.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",115,29,31,5.0,8/22/2018,"In short, everything was delicious. Bread came out right away, which I usually pass on, but didn't this time; it came out warm, soft, and really fresh. We ordered the calamari to start which was not too oily and perfectly battered and crispy. For the main course we got the Gorgonzola NY strip medium rare (of course) cooked perfectly, tender, and fully of flavor. The Gorgonzola may be a little too strong of a flavor for some, but I thought it worked well. We also got the roasted chicken which was also good. We couldn't finish all the food, so I took the chicken for lunch the following work day - still delicious the next day. As a side, we ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon - delicious but probably not too healthy. The environment was very romantic. The lights were dimmed, almost a little too dark, as we struggled a bit to read the menu. Other than that, great date spot.",,,

40,Clarissa K.,"Hollywood, FL",3013,751,3413,5.0,12/10/2016,Capital Grille is one of the best steak chains. They do everything right. There is no ordering bad everything is wonderful and they have high standards thus 5 stars. Was invited for a business dinner as we were a group of 28 not easy to find a restaurant to accommodate such a large group. Originally we were scheduled for another restaurant that I was looking forward to but it was explained to me our group was too big not only did we get our own room on the second floor it was open to the entire restaurant so you got to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere. This restaurant was in walking distance from our hotel the Hilton in midtown. Upon arriving we waited about 10 minutes in the lobby until we were lead to our tables. One round and one long table I preferred the round so I could talk to everyone at our table. We had several servers specially designated to our party. Fantastic service as we never went without anything not even for a second. We had a beautifully set menu for our group with more choices and food that one could even eat or drink. We started with seafood towers OMG do they do this right wonderful assortment of the freshest and coldest seafood. Just the way it should be I had one oversized shrimp and I was in heaven. Also the crab was fantastic. Other appetizers were crab cakes another favorite. Our salads were fantastic majority of us had the greens with the roasted Brussels sprouts. Main course if you have the opportunity get the Chilean Sea Bass in short supply so get it while you can before it is extinct. Also they prepare it the best in the world. My portion was gorgeous and so big yes I had to take it with me for a late night snack. For dessert creme brûlée a classic light and always served with the freshest of seasonal berries. Perfect meal in the perfect venue for 28 persons.,24,16,22

At first was offered an odd location of a table which I don't think they should place ( near kitchen entry ) especially when I had a reservation but let's get down to the positive . They quickly placed us elsewhere and where we took the opportunity to eat from the RW menu.   We ordered yummy cosmopolitans and Jumbo crab cakes in addition to RW options. Seriously everything was sooo delicious  !!!!!My filet mignonette also perfect . Our waiter Jason was perfect all was great and nice detail of providing an additional slice of cake  for my cousins birthday. First time here and will definitely return ! Thanks for excellence,,1,

46,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19,5.0,4/10/2018,"The Capital Grille on 51st Street is certainly one of the best restaurants in the city. I certainly love coming before or after a performance on Broadway. The menu revolves around the delicious steak, but is much more than that. The other meats and seafood are also amazing. My first time here was magnificent. We had just come from a performance of Wicked on Broadway and were looking forward to our meal here. Immediately as we entered, my friend and I were impressed with the beautiful decor and the friendliness of the hosts and hostesses in front. We were promptly seated at a lovely table with an impressive menu. The wine list was also excellent, and the cocktails quite nice as well. I ordered the shrimp cocktail for my appetizer. Shrimp cocktail is one of my favorite things to order at a new restaurant that I am visiting. I was certainly not disappointed. The shrimp were plump and juicy, with a perfectly spicy cocktail sauce. We also ordered a Caesar salad. It was perfect, with beautifully dressed, fresh lettuce. For the entree I had to go with the house specialty, the steak. I ordered the fourteen ounce New York strip. It was just what you would except from a place like this. Juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection. It was also incredibly tender. Overall, impeccable. My friend also had steak and loved it as well. To go along with the steaks we ordered the parmesan truffle fries and grilled asparagus. The potatoes were perfectly done, and the flavors were spot-on. The asparagus was great and served with lemon mosto, which gave it a nice taste. For dessert I had to go with the double chocolate cake. It was spectacular. Served warm just the way I like it, with creamy, fresh ice cream. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive and courteous. The waiters and waitresses made sure everything was to our liking. These standards have been the same every time that I have been back, either for lunch or dinner. I certainly had an excellent time at this wonderful establishment. I urge you to go as soon as you can, it will be delicious. The locations on Wall Street and 42nd Street are just as good. I hope you enjoy Capital Grille- 51st Street as much as I always do!",,,

The entrees were fantastic. The salmon was perfectly medium, steak was hearty and juicy but the sides and appetizers completely stole the show. The crab cakes, Brussels sprouts, and lobster Mac n cheese are addicting and can stand as a meal on their own.

50,Kanoe I.,"Honolulu, HI",563,166,682,5.0,6/25/2016,"Tonight was my first time dining at The Capital Grille and I really loved it! We ordered off of the Theatre menu, which was $39 with your choice of a soup/salad, a main entree, an accompaniment, and a dessert. This was a great price because the portions were big and the food was delicious. The restaurant is classy and modern and the ambience is nice, with dim lighting and a quiet atmosphere. There is a bar in the front of the restaurant that looked like a perfect place to grab cocktails with friends. We were seated at a lovely booth and greeted immediately by our waitress. She was excellent throughout the night. The Theatre Menu choices were:Soup/Salad:*Field Greens*Caesar Salad*Cup of Clam ChowderEntrée:*8 oz. Filet Mignon*Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin*Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon*Double Cut Lamb Chop RibsAccompaniments:*Mashed Potatoes *Fresh Creamed SpinachDessert:*Creme Brûlée *Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake*Trio of Handmade Ice Creams*Seasoned Fruit SorbetsWe Ordered:Soup/Salad:*Caesar Salad - It was nothing special but the portion was nice. I was expecting a small, side-order portion but this one was like an entrée. I did love the fresh greens and freshly grated cheese. Entrées:*Seared Salmon - I loved it. The salmon was cooked with a light citrus glaze and accompanied with green beans. I liked it because it was light and healthy. The portion was also big, so I ended up taking it home. I highly recommend this dish. *Kona Crusted Sirloin with Shallot Butter - My friends ordered this and enjoyed it. They also couldn't finish it and took it home.  This comes highly recommended as well!!Dessert:*Creme Brûlée - Yummmm. Topped with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries, I loved it! *Flourless Chocolate Cake - Recommend this if you're a chocolate lover. It is dense but not too sweet. Try it it you like chocolate. *Trio of Homemade Ice Creams - This wasn't a fave of ours. There was a little aftertaste with some of the flavors that was a little different. Won't be ordering this again.  I must add that the bread basket was quite impressive. There were at least five or more different types of breads to try and all were delicious. It was an overall excellent dining experience! I am an out-of-town visitor and I love when I find new restaurants that I enjoy. I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in town.....",6,2,4

Ed Sullivan was our server, and he was very kind, respectful, and friendly. We opted for the restaurant menu. I chose the filet mignon and my husband had the NY strip with mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and the steaks were cooked perfectly to the temperature we requested. Since it was our anniversary, our server Ed brought us a complimentary glass of wine with our dinner, and he also surprised us with a dessert. It was a Creme Brulee Cheesecake with strawberries and blueberries. That cheesecake was so nice and creamy and the crunch from the Creme Brulee topping was like icing on the cake. It was very yummy.

We ordered the fries but I didn't have any. The crab cakes was the essence of food artistry.  I didn't care too much for the iced tea but I love the club soda (I guess I was thirsty).

I also like that the tables aren't one on top of another and you can't hear a complete strangers conversation. Our waiter and server were really nice and engaging, which made the overall experience that much better. To eat, I had the salmon with mashed potatoes for dinner and the crème brûlée for dessert. My date had filet mignon with mashed potatoes and the chocolate cake for dessert. The mashed potatoes tasted as if they were homemade, both the salmon and filet mignon were perfectly seasoned. The desserts were the perfect ending, both having a sweet and savory taste. I also had s cocktail,  but can't remeber the name. I do remember it being tasty and satisfying,  however.

They also gave us complimentary champagne for the table! The food itself was quite good, we tried the steak and the burger and both were cooked exactly as requested and fairly tasty. The dessert was a chocolate cake, and again for the special occasion, they gave an extra dessert with a candle in it and 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate.The service was warm and formal without being too stuffy.

The blue cheese dressing was yummy and so were the bacon pieces. -Filet Mignon  was average at best. They couldn't get my temperature right, I ordered medium well and the steak came out medium rare. The actual cut of meat wasnt the best either, this was the first time I experienced fat on my filet mignon. Not impressed. -Sides: mashed potatoes, they were pretty good. String beans: average, nothing to brag or complain about. Creamed Spinach (we ordered this as an extra), did not like it at all, it had a weird taste. Other people at my table said they enjoyed it but I personally didn't find it to be appetizing. -Chocolate Espresso Cake: very rich and heavy, first few bites were enjoyable but after that I was done with it. We decided to do the ""generous pour"" for $28 extra per person. It's supposed to come with 7 tastings of wine but we did 3 glasses instead. I think this was a good deal and would recommend giving it a try. The generosity of the pours is based on who is serving you, our waiter was pretty generous for the most part. Based on this experience, i would not reccommend coming here for restaurant week. I do feel if I came outside of restaurant week, my experience would be better. Not sure if I'll ever get around to giving it another try, simply because there are so many other awesome steakhouses in the city.",,1,

The filet mignon was very tender but needed some salt and pepper. As sides we got the mashed potatoes,creamy too bad it's not meant to be shared and we got string beans with tomatoes. It was a strange combination. We did not care for it. The huge disappointment was the lobster mac and cheese. They delivered it to us after our entrees. It was quite hot.

I dined with a friend and we shared the lamb rib chops, the lobster mac and cheese, and the caesar salad. All were absolutely delicious!One cool thing about this place is that when you're ordering drinks, they bring over an iPad and you can swipe through their cocktails and wine list. Each drink has its own page where you can see a picture of the drink and its ingredients. If you're looking for wines, you can filter the selections to make your choice easy. Very helpful! I had the Blackberry Bourbon Sidecar, which was a little strong for my liking and not as well-balanced as I would have hoped, but it was still good.Overall, a great experience-the food was great and the service was excellent.",1,,

I do jump on a daily basis between eating meat, being vegetarian and being vegan, so I don't have meat more than twice a week, if that. However, the steak in NYC really is worth a try!

70,Sarah M.,"Washington, DC",709,248,193,2.0,1/4/2016,"*2.5 - Following a day in the city the week after Christmas (Dec. 28) we came to Capital Grille for dinner. Despite arriving about 10 minutes before our reservation, we were seated in just a few minutes in the back by the wine cellar which was a beautiful, private feeling spot. Edgar was our primary server. At TCG, they've switched to an electronic menu for the wine which is sometimes nice if the software is user friendly but in this case it was not. We asked for a hard paper copy of the wine list for easier searching, but TCG has gone all digital with wine - no more paper lists. Though the food menus are paper. After attempting to search for a good wine by the glass, we went with ordering a cocktail instead.To start, we ordered the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad with aged Balsamic and the field greens salad with tomatoes, fresh herbs and a Parmesan vinaigrette. The greens salad was nice and refreshing but a tad overdressed. As for the mozzarella salad, we remarked that it was ok but nothing exceptional as well as the mozzarella wasn't as creamy as one would expect it to be. Shortly after our appetizers were cleared, we got our entrees; double cut lamb rib chops and the sesame-seared tuna for me. Cutting through the middle of the lamb chops, we could easily tell that they were not right. Of the four, only one was done correctly and another semi correct. So while they may have not been to the point of being inedible, we had higher expectations for TCG. My tuna, which was sushi-grade was correctly properly and the gingered rice was nice and fluffy. The tuna came with three different ""sauces"" as our waiter explained it in small individual dishes. Of the three, only one tasted right for the tuna. Overall, our recent experience here was fine. Nothing awful but for a steakhouse, the restaurant/chef should know better how to even cook several lamb chops and, as with any hospitable restaurant, patrons should not feel as though their server is trying to run them out of it. I wouldn't say he wasn't attentive but rather he was a little rough and insincere.

The shrimp was tough, lukewarm, and bland. The steaks were excellent so that's why I'm not giving this place 1 star. The lobster mac and cheese was a disgrace. There was NO cheese! Imagine hard crispy dry pasta with heavy cream poured over the top. The lobster was so chewy. We sent this dish back. Overall, a terrible expensive experience.

Starting off we went with one of our favorites lump crab cocktail - such a goodchoice it was the biggest portion we've ever been served the lump crab went allthe way to the bottom of the metal container it was served in - the meat fresh, sweet and so plump! My husband said his porcini dry rubbed and aged rib eye was one of the best steaks he has ever eaten - I tried a smallpiece and it was cooked to perfection - a beautiful crust from that rub - it melted in your mouth.I ordered the seared tenderloins with the butter poached lobster tails. Now this is where I take one star off. The lobster tails were totally overcooked - for this to be one of the priciest dishes on their menu it should of been perfection. The lobster in the mac and cheese was cooked better (PS: The mac and cheese is a MUST order!) I would come back here in a heartbeat and am open to trying their location out here on Long Island.",1,,1

83,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",67,162,86,4.0,4/18/2017,"Tonight we feasted while at a work-related dinner which was held at the midtown chapter of The Capital Grille.  The hostess who greeted us prompt, friendly, and immediately took our coats as we walked in.  She then led us to the back room where the wait staff was ready to help find our seats, as well as fill our glasses with wine.  For starters, we had the spicy, jalapeño calamari which was cooked perfectly!  The texture of the calamari itself was not overly chewy and the crunch of the batter was impressive.  The pickled jalapeños and peppers added a nice kick to the dish, but my only complaint is that the texture of the pickled peppers was too limp in comparison to the fried calamari.  I wanted each bite to have that vinegary element, but every time I placed both pieces of food in my mouth, I was so disappointed from a texture perspective - of the peppers.  I may have enjoyed them more if they were crunchier. The table bread came in a variety of rolls and sliced sourdough breads that were pipping hot - perfect for the salted butter to melt into a liquid gold onto the starchy bread.  The roll had a perfect crisp to the outer shell, but a soft, dense, and chewy middle.  The salad that came was a mixed fricassee, romaine lettuce, and mixed greens plate that came with three different types of tomatoes, and the dressing was maybe a Caesar dressing that wasn't overly apparent on the dish, which I liked. For the main course, I had the 18 ounce bone-in kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter.  I definitely had leftovers of the perfectly cooked medium steak which was accompanied by a wilted piece of greens.  The presentation of the dish was not that impressive, but the melted butter on top glistened the perfectly charred piece of meat.  For sides, we had Sam's mashed potatoes which were DELICIOUS!  Almost comparable to Jacob's Pickles's mash potatoes because they were hot, buttery, and gooey in consistency.  The steamed broccoli was simple and with the exception of the mash potatoes, the meat and broccoli were not salted which I liked because it is healthier.  However, from a taste perspective, the meat definitely needed more salt.  That being said, I would rather have under-salted food than overly salty, which is not pleasant at all! Dessert included three different dishes (brownie cake, Brûlée style cheesecake, and the coconut cream pie with house made caramel sauce).  The last dish was AMAZING and quite addicting.  The pie's tart was moist and buttery.  The custard and cream on top harmoniously joined together with the shortbread-like crust.  The butter cookie on top was also tasty and added a nice crunch to the overall dish.  I enjoyed it thoroughly with my chamomile tea. Service was fantastic - our servers were attentive to our needs and kept our glasses filled with wine, water, and tea.  They were polite and opened our doors for us as well, as we exited.",1,,1
84,Ahu S.,"New York, NY",122,450,87,4.0,7/28/2016,"A great choice for business lunch or dinner near Rockefeller Center. As Capital Grille's usually are, this one is cavernous and inviting in the old school boys club kind of way. A large bar and wall of private wine cubbies greets you if you enter on 51st, but you can also enter from within the lobby of the Time Life building. Grab a booth table if you can since they're roomy and cozy. It's never too loud, but with the right level of din to hold serious, or not-so-serious, conversations. The food here is consistently good and on par with the other locations. They're obviously famous for their steaks but I also like their fish dishes. The salmon with Marcona almonds was fantastic. Oh and don't miss the truffle fries, they're fantastic! It's not cheap, but when the nearby options include Ted's and Bill's (what's up with the generic guy named bars?), Capital Grille will always be my go-to.",2,2,2

I'm writing this review from my house as I enjoy my reheated left over porterhouse steak. I've been to restaurants all over the world but have to admit that the service and the food at this chain restaurant was incomparable. I had an amazing experience. I'm so grateful for my 2015 birthday dinner. Words can barely express how happy I was with EVERYTHING. I've never given 5 stars before . Capital grille and my server Brian deserve it .

Updated review","Highly recommend for a business dinner. Food is excellent and space is well aerated. Chardonnay - I originally ordered a glass of riesling, but they were out. Instead of coming back to the table empty-handed, the waiter was kind enough to bring out a comparable wine for me to try before taking my next drink order. Seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tails - Great approach to surf and turf. Medium steak had a nice pink center and lobster tails were perfectly succulent. Au gratin potatoes - Thinly sliced pieces of potato layered with a blend of cheeses. Loved the crunch and a perfect complement to the surf and turf. Lobster mac and cheese - This is how you do it folks.",5,3,3
91,Christina L.,"Ithaca, NY",179,93,114,5.0,5/20/2016,"We made a reservation here for lunch after my sister's graduation at Radio City. The reservation was for 1:30 (through opentable) but we arrived at 12:30 hoping to get seated. To our surprise, they had some space and seated us in one of their private dining rooms on the second floor. The decor was warm, friendly, and very well kept. This is definitely a place that if not jacket required, it's you'd feel weird if you didn't have a jacket. To celebrate, a few of us got some drinks--hefty prices but not unexpected in midtown.For entrees, three of us got steaks, two got the salmon salad, one for the sea bass and one got the citrus salmon. For dessert, we shared the sorbet, crime brûlée and warm chocolate cake. Everything was fantasist. Beautifully seasoned, great flavor and had excellent presentation. The graduation girl got the filet mignon with caramelized onions and mushrooms and those mushrooms might have been the best mushrooms I ever had in my life! Our desserts were wonderful--I'm a big fan of crime brûlée and this one did not disappoint.Our waitress was very attentive throughout. My father is an impatient person so at times, he felt like she was never around, when my grandfather (ironic because he is if not, more impatient) commented that they probably just want to give us space. She was very knowledgeable, accommodating and even offered to take pictures for us. Great service staff!What an amazing meal for a special day!",3,,1

But it is Restaurant Week, so they were busy -- There is a huge tip bowl at the coat room with suggestive $5 bills. A little tacky me thinks. Only restaurant in New York that we visited where the tip bowl was so offensively in-your-face. There's plenty of room in the restaurant for you to put your coats (we got a booth), so try to forgo the obnoxiousness.  Steak was a little tough but you could taste the beef flavor. They served what was on the menu, really liked the bacon bits that came with the Wedge salad.

Made reservations about a week in advance and a day ago I heard about another special they were offering called the generous pour featuring 8 different wines from female wine makers for an amazing $28. Hey..I like wine and 8 being more than I usually enjoy during one meal I was up for the challenge!Service: I normally rate food first as I feel it's the most important but in this case our waiter Robert really made the visit special. Explained the full menu plus the Restaurant Week choices fully and made excellent suggestions. Suggested the perfect wine pairings from the salad through the dessert course, perfect service!!!Food: We were very fortunate to be here during restaurant week. $38 for a salad, entree, side dish, and dessert was quite a bargain at this establishment. Our party ordered the Caesar Salad, the classic Wedge Salad, Filet Mignon, Grilled Salmon and based on Robert's recommendation, I upgraded my dry aged sirloin to the Kona Bone In Dry Aged sirloin. The food was excellent, if I were in private I would have been gnawing the meat off that sirloin bone! The generous pour...Robert matched the wine perfectly with my courses and were a bargain at $28. Robert even refreshed my Syrah because it paired well with my dessert!Atmosphere: Classy, classic, elegant, but we did not feel like it was a stuffy establishment. Great feel and the people actually make it feel very warm.Value: Pricey but what a great deal with Restaurant Week.

We try and really do our homework to avoid going places that aren't a good restaurant week value. We have both heard good things about the capital grille, and with the average steak costing about $40-$50 (not including any sides) we thought restaurant week was the perfect time to try. We were not disappointed. The first course we got the Cesar salad and the wedge. We both preferred the wedge, the thick cut bacon on it was fantastic. The Cesar was good but it was your basic Cesar salad. The bread basket they give you is phenomenal. It comes with a variety of breads, we both wanted to eat the onion focaccia one forever. We both got the dry aged ny strip for our entree with the mashed potatoes. The steak was perfectly medium rare and so incredibly delicious. We got one of each dessert,  chocolate flourless cake and cremebrulee. I love cremebrulee and this one was great. I think looking back we would have just gotten two of those (the chocolate cake was good but very rich after a big meal. We had a wonderful experience. The decor was beautiful and staff was friendly.

We opted to order a glass of wine from Hidden something (ha) and a mojito de uva. The beverages of choice were great. As for the meal, we just went straight for the entree. It is customarily too much food if we order apps as well. We ordered the dry aged porterhouse and the sliced filet oscar with lump crab and bearnaise. For our sides, we chose the sauteed spinach with garlic confit and the sams mashed potatoes. The food was delicious. However since we had bread from the bread basket which was delicious by the way, we could not complete our meal. We took half of the food home. We know we were full but wanted something sweet.

Within fifteen minutes, despite the fact that the restaurant acknowledged the temperature issue, and both tables already in the room pointed out that it was uncomfortable, four more tables were seated in this room, making the temperature even hotter. My husband went to speak to the manager, because at this point our creme brûlée was melting on our table. The manager apologized and comped us the bar tab, which was nice of them, but at that point we couldn't finish our drinks nor the dessert because we were so uncomfortable and hot. The best part of the evening, however, came after we got home, and spent the rest of the evening with a massive case of food poisoning. I suggest a hard pass on this restaurant going forward - you can have a pleasant meal at Ted's Montana Grill, Ruth's Chris, or Del Frisco's within a five minute walk if steak is what you are after.",,,
112,Les L.,"Dallas, TX",81,56,1,3.0,12/17/2017,"We are huge Capital Grille fans, having eaten in NYC, Dallas, Fort Worth and DC-Dallas regularly. Have to say this one was not up to their standards in food and service. We had two people waiting on us and it wasn't clear who was responsible. Shrimp cocktail arrived with no plates and entrees less than five minutes later and plates never came. Steaks over cooked, didn't complain, but was never asked if they were to our liking. Asked for bread twice before it came when we were almost through with our meal. At these prices, food and service should be much better. Plates finally cleared and no offer of coffee or dessert until I already had my card out to pay.",1,,

My husband took me there for my birthday and they were so accommodating.  Excellent service and food deserves recognition.  They decorated our table, gave each of us complimentary Proseco and a large dessert.  The food was excellent as well as the service.  If you like to eat at the bar, they ha a wagyu burger/wine special as well.  We will be back!",,,

Made reservations, but they were running a little late so we waited about 15 minutes for our table.  This was a last minute decision to come here for dinner and was totally under dress but they did not give me any trouble.The inside of the restaurant looks fancy and dim. Great place for date if you are trying to impress. The chairs were cushiony and comfortable.For starter she had the clam chowder while I had the caesar salad.  The clam chowder was not too creamy but was delicious. Caesar salad was normal.  For entree she had the filet mignon and I had the sirloin steak.  The filet mignon was a little burnt on the outside but the inside was a perfect medium.  The sirloin was cooked perfectly too. It was a little more flavorful than the filet mignon but a little more fatty.  It was a pretty big steak.  For dessert we had the cheesecake. It was delicious. Kind of like half creme burlee and half cheesecake.  It was not overly sweet and just tasted really good.Our server Jonathan was excellent.  Everything came fairly quickly and made sure our food was ok.  Our water were continuously refilled.  Overall we had a great experience from this restaurant.",3,,

Our food was delicious - I had the field green salad and the dressing was amazing. We both had filet, mine medium my husband's rare plus. Both steaks were cooked exactly right - to perfection.

The food was amazing, perfect NY Strip Steak, good clam chowder, nice desert. Overall, for $42 a great deal - I'd be willing to pay much more for that! Only downside: The wine pairing didn't make any sense. What happened - there was no connection between wine and food, eg a heavy red for the desert. Still - enjoyed the evening, very classy location, and delicious food!I originally gave 4 stars - changed it to 5 after my second visit.

127,Mel T.,"New York, NY",415,1213,2873,4.0,2/24/2014,"**WINTER 2014 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**Two friends and I had a reservation on a Friday night at 7 p.m. While the place wasn't packed, I would still make a reservation - especially if you plan to go during restaurant week. For $38, you get an appetizer, entree, side and a dessert. Here's the rundown:Appetizer - I went with the clam chowder. I'm not crazy about clam chowder but it was good - not overly creamy (which I hate) and there was a good amount of clams in there.Entree - I decided to splurge and go with the extra $10 upgrade option. This was the 18 oz. bone-in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter. I am no steak connoisseur by any means but I do know that I enjoyed every bite of it. The shallot butter was pure heroin. There is no other way to describe it. I couldn't really taste the Kona (Hawaiian coffee) but I didn't mind. At first, I thought 18 oz. might be a little too much - but let's not be silly. There's no such thing as too much steak, right?Side - I chose the French green beans but they were a tad too salty. My friend got the mashed potatoes and as soon as I took a bite, I wish I had gotten that. It was creamy perfection.Dessert - To top off the meal, I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake. This was my first flourless cake experience so I didn't know what to expect. The consistency was almost brownie/chocolate bar-like. I'm probably not explaining it very well but trust me on this one, you can skip it. it was way too chocolatey and rich for my taste. Go for the cheesecake.Wine - I think our server mentioned there were over 1000 (?) different bottles of wine. Some are pretty reasonably priced too. You can get a bottle for $30. We weren't sure which to order but we knew we wanted the prosecco. When we asked our server, she seemed pretty knowledgeable. I also appreciated the fact that she told us that the different bottles of prosecco tasted pretty much the same - and didn't try to push a more expensive bottle on us. Which brings me to my next point - service was great! Our server was always checking in on us - refilling our water glasses and more importantly, our prosecco glasses!The Capital Grill was more of a splurge for me but I would definitely come back for a special occasion. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some daydreaming to do about that shallot butter.",5,,
128,Ji P.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",108,10,5,2.0,2/5/2016,"I made a reservation weeks ago for restaurant week dinner for a very special occasion. When we got there, there was a huge crowd of people in the waiting area. We ended up waiting more than 45 min to be seated. They kept telling us ""Your table will be ready shortly"".. (I had to be somewhere by 9pm and needless to say I was late to the meeting.) I understand things can get crazy during restaurant week but no one apologized to us or tried to make up for keeping us wait that long. How unprofessional and inconsiderate. Positive: Filet mignon & creme brulee were good, our server was nice and that's about it.. Will not be going back.",,,

Their dining room, for lunch, closed at 3pm so we were seated at the bar. Worked out perfectly since we had about an hour to eat. My 3 course meal consisted of Caesar salad, salmon, and creme brûlée. The food itself was satisfying. Service on the other hand was somewhat friendly and strange. We were first greeted and served by a female bartender, but toward the middle and end of our meal she completely tuned us out. A gentleman bartender took over and took care of our needs. The place itself is extremely beautiful the workers on the other hand seemed too pretentious. Would I return? I'd probably get a different feel at the dining room tables, but not sure if I would actually make an effort on going back. I prefer to spend my money else where.",1,1,2

Once we got to the table we were delighted to find the table with confetti and a hand written birthday card to my mom. Honestly that was the nicest and sweetest thing a restaurant has ever done. The act of that alone deserves 5 stars itself.For the table we had the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella as appetizer. We also decided to share the bone dry crusted sirloin, filet with lobster tail, scallops and lamb chops. We also had a size of asparagus. The scallops with mushroom risotto was my absolute favorite. Everything else was good but not too memorable. The crusted sirloin was pretty burnt. The asparagus was a little disappointing... Kinda tough. On opentable I requested that if I don't get a chance to choose a dessert, please choose one for me, anything but chocolate. They brought out 3 desserts for the 4 of us. I was so happy to see my mom so happy! I did notice they kinda just threw spoons at us though but at the end, we were there to celebrate my moms birthday and as long as she left happy, I don't care what happens.",,,

I see people wearing shorts and sneakers. That was surprising. Anyhow, let's focus on the ambient, staffs and food.Staffs here were very welcoming and came by the table more often than you think to see how everything was going which wasn't bad. This place was all dimmed but good enough with some light where you don't have to turn your flash on to take pics. **Now for food. I came here thinking whatever I order will be small portions so why not get some appetizers along. I ordered the sliced filet mignon with caramelized onion and mushroom, to die for! It has a sweet taste which brought out the the meat flavor along with the mushroom! I had it cooked medium rare and that's the way to eat it. The middle was pink, not red so there was not blood dripping. It was the best dish I had!! I also ordered the half a dozen of oysters. The oysters were very thinly sliced and long. I must say it tastes very fresh and delicious. There were maybe one or two sand in the oysters, but that's normal. My bad ordered the 14oz ages sirloin steak and it was huge and thick. We both ordered medium rare on our meats. His however, due to the thickness, medium rare looked like it was so raw inside. I couldn't even swallow the center raw part which was disappointing, but my bad enjoyed it so its really preference. Along with his steak, he also ordered a jumbo crab cake cocktail. Do not order this. It tastes and looked like those meats you pull out of a king crab and dip it into sauce. That was it. Nothing special. Lastly we ordered the cheesecake. It was good, but definitely I had better.",5,3,4

133,Akeema R.,"Manhattan, NY",57,38,118,4.0,6/2/2015,"I came here for my birthday and they did not disappoint. They had birthday confetti sprinkled on the table and a customized birthday card. I'm sure they do this for everyone who dines there on their birthday. It still made me feel special and it was so thoughtful. A lot of these places you'll be lucky if you get a free dessert or happy birthday. So bravo for going above and beyond. The complimentary dessert and champagne was a plus. FOODThe calamari was delicious. Crisp yet tender and I absolutely love hot cherry peppers in my calamari. The crab cake was so lack luster. Under seasoned, underwhelming and uninspired. I wanted it to taste fresher and have more crab. The corn succotash that accompanied it was great.They had a special of lobster bisque that was a total fail. I honestly believe they were trying to get rid of the clam chowder they have on the regular menu. The lobster bisque did not taste like lobster nor did it have much lobster in it and the texture was weird. Total waste of $15 for that small cup. The double cut lamb chops were heavenly. Cooked a perfect medium they were tender and seasoned well. Seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tailWas divine. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and lobster was cooked perfectly literally melted in my mouth. They also had a king crab special with steak. I didn't want the steak so I just asked for a side of crab. I couldn't believe they charged me $28 for that less than half portion of crab with 3 legs pieces attached. It essentially tasted like nothing. Honestly I believed the chef shocked it in some boiling water then put it on a plate to be served. I was baffled by the lack of care and flavor.For dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the chocolate hazelnut cake. I didn't expect to like the cream pie as much as I did. I thought it would be cloyingly sweet and it was surprisingly well balanced. Had a lot of different textures ranging from crunchy, creamy and chewy which was very nice. The hazelnut cake was good. It could have benefited from being left out at room temp a little before serving the ganache and mousse was a little to stiff. Good flavor though. SERVICEEveryone was superb from the hostess down to the bussers. Polite, smiling, water glasses never went empty our server was very funny and chatty but in a good way which I loved. Honestly if anyone there hates their job they are great at hiding it. AMBIANCE Very romantic with dim lighting and candle light. Low noise level. Beautiful bathrooms.  Great art and I love the open kitchen.",3,,1

This two story building offers an intimate dim lit setting but yet is causal and inviting. I ordered the daily special of lobster mac & cheese. Honestly the BEST mac & cheese I EVER had in public! The penne pasta was ""al dente""  and well seasoned. I was not cheated with small pieces of lobster, NO! I had full claws, there was no denying that.

I asked the server to recommend a couple of dishes to me and he basically read me the entire menu then cackled to himself. Then, when the burgers came out, we asked the other server which ones were medium and which one was medium rare and our original server came by and cut us off and remarked ""we go by seat number! stop asking him!"" ....Anyway, we had the soup, burger with truffle fries, and a creme brulee/chocolate cake. Soup was good albeit a little small, burger was an extremely large portion and just okay, truffle fries were good, and creme brulee was disappointing.

It didn't look too full when we got there though, so reservations might not have been required. I ordered the Gorgonzola truffle steak, medium ""plus."" I was told this would be something in between medium and medium well, but it was basically just medium well. Despite that, it was very tender, which is impressive. As for the overall dish, the cheese was unsurprisingly very strong and overpowered everything else. It was good though, especially since I like Gorgonzola. We also ordered two side dishes to share - truffle fries, and Brussels sprouts with bacon and Parmesan. They were both pretty good; I prefer thin fries and these were on the thicker side, but they were seasoned and cooked very well.

Had the filet steak for main course.   It was delicious, however it was not cooked to how I ordered it.   It was much rarer than medium.   Others had similar issue.   Perhaps just how they define medium is really more rare.  Desserts were excellent as well.  We had one of everything on the menu in the group and no complaints.  Capital Grill is pretty consistent no matter where you go and this was no exception.   It's a strong choice",,,

Yesterday was empty. We had the lump crab which I really like there. And the shrimp cocktail which was ok. The food is not cheap but about average for seafood.,,,

156,Saba C.,"JAMAICA, NY",146,53,4,5.0,3/2/2016,"It's an overall nice place to eat. We came here during restaurant week.It was a Friday night, and we had reservations for 8:30pm. Got there early, and there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated; we were seated at around 8:50pm. Still, the hosts/hostesses did a good job in maintaining the calm despite several people expressing their frustration at the tardiness - free champagne was offered to everyone waiting eventually.The service here is on point, I must highlight this immediately. Our glasses were never less than half full, and the servers were definitely on top of their game despite having a full house to cater to. When we were seated our server promptly came by and suggested the nightly specials and the restaurant favorites. We didn't have long to wait for our food (or maybe we thought so because there was plenty of bread at the table while we waited), and when they did arrive the portions were not small despite being restaurant week and the quality of the food didn't suffer because of it, either. Overall a great experience - we'll definitely be back!(afterthought: bathrooms were spacious and clean too)",1,1,1

The ambiance was nice, the service was great, the food was really good... until I found a long ginger hair in my mashed potatoes.... Needless to say I was disgusted ok? They graciously replaced both myself and my husband's meals. We literally had a full meal to take home, the kids loved it the next day. Unfortunately this just put me off and I won't be going back. It took me 2 days to lose the feeling of that straggly hair in my mouth UGH!!!!!",,,
158,Helena Q.,"Cambridge, MA",231,302,7,3.0,5/19/2016,"Overall, I wasn't super impressed with the quality of the food for the price. The bread crust was ultra tough (though it tasted very nice) and the lobster salad I got had overcooked lobster. Also, the dressing on the salad was overwhelmingly citrusy, to the point where I couldn't even taste the arugula. However, tasting bits of what other people got -- the filet mignon, tuna, and salmon -- it seems those were much better.",,,
159,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,200,300,4.0,10/1/2017,"I'm not a big fan of chains, but I make an exception for Capital Grill. I've dined at the Chrysler Building location three times in the past. This time I dined at the West 51st St location in Manhattan with an opentable reservation. When we arrived, the white table napkins were changed to black napkins because our slacks were dark. The only other place that did that was Veranda in the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas.  The service was nearly flawless with one slip up. Our server Josue Minor was,overall, exceptional! We were given an Amuse Bouche that was delicious. Our appetizers were the Mozzarella with tomato and basil with 15 year aged balsamic that was excellent and large enough to share and the Russel Sprouts Salad with toasted pecans goat cheese and smoked bacon which was also excellent and large enough to share. I wish they indicated that on the menu since my dining partner and I were baffled at how the tuna tartare was listed as ""for 2"" but the appetizers we ordered weren't. They should be. Entrees were the Sushi grade sesame seared tuna with gingered rice and 3 sauces and the Seared Halibut with Sake braised mushrooms and miso butter. I had asked for the tuna medium rare but it arrived rare (although the center was a little warm) But... it was seared flawlessly. The skin with the sesame crust was perfect so all is forgiven. Not only that, but the tuna overall was one of the best dishes I've ever had! The Halibut was equally good. We had a side of grilled asparagus with lemon that was excellent. Because the portions are large, we shared the sorbets for dessert which were excellent as well. A wonderful meal. Why 4 instead of 5?  Two issues. They provide a bread basket and bread plates but no bread knives. I had to use the same knife that I used to cut my Mozzarella and tomato salad with balsamic to cut the butter that was presented. Second issue is that the the watier mentioned the sorbet flavors prior to our ordering them, but when he brought the sorbet he said that the flavors had actually changed from what he had told us. He should have returned to the table when he learned that the flavors were changed and informed us of the changes to see if the changes were acceptable. But, the extras more than made up for the minor slip ups.",,,

H-O-R-R-I-F-I-C. It's all about the subway system out here.Service was decent here. Nothing too spectacular compared to CA. But for NY, our waitress was EXTREMELY friendly. So props to that.My friend and I ended up getting their theatre pre fixed meal, which was the cheapest and NOT ON THE MENU. I ended up with the steak, which was eh-- I've had better. We also got the lobster mac & cheese, which was also eh as well. Nothing was really memorable or too spectacular for me.The atmosphere/environment was very dim and romantic-- which was absolutely horrible for photos unless you add 10 shots of flash. So if you're trying to instagram, don't even bother-- the lighting is way too dim.Overall, this was a decent place if you're on a strict budget (especially with good seatings at Wicked). But if you're in it for the quality-- you're better off with Ruth Chris. With that said, I doubt I'd come back because STEAK IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE.Turn Ons:- Great service.Turn Offs:- Food was mediocre.",3,2,2

Our waiter asked us if we were celebrating anything and we told him that we were celebrating my boyfriend's new job. We ordered a bottle of wine and a filet mignon each with mashed potatoes and the lobster mac and cheese to share. We did not order an appetizer, but our waiter brought us Caesar salads anyways, which were delicious. Our entrées came and the steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were soo delicious. When we were finished (aka to stuffed to eat anymore because we left with doggy bags), our waiter brought us the dessert menu. We told him we were too full for dessert. He came back and surprised us with a dish that said Congratulations in CHOCOLATE with a small flour less chocolate cake and cheese cake topped with fresh berries.

The service was impeccable, our waiter Edgar always made sure we were well-taken care of by checking on us every so often. Only one hiccup was that they forgot to bring out our Fried Calamari appetizer until I asked about it when the entrees were being brought out. So Edgar apologized and comped it out of our bill, as well as gave us a voucher for a free Calamari appetizer during our next visit at any Capital Grille. We all ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and were overall pleased with the selection. For appetizers we all had the caesar salad, which was a little overdressed and not as impressive as the waiters talked it up to be. For the entree, I had the 14 oz. Bone-In NY Strip cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We had a bottle of Cuvée Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon to keep us warm and rosy. The highlight of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were so buttery with some potato skins mixed in. Classic creme brulee to top the meal off - it was a great experience altogether and our server for the evening played a huge role. Thanks Edgar!",1,,

The service is top notch; the waiters and waitresses always make the customer their top priority and are very friendly. The food was great, on this occasion we only ordered drinks and appetizers. Since I am allergic to seafood, I had the truffle fries, the steak sliders and the lamp chop lollipops- the food was amazing.

177,Ray A.,"Westport, CT",2,6,3,1.0,11/15/2015,"We had a decent meal but I have to give this restaurant a ""1""  based on service.  We left a small shopping bag underneath our booth when we left last night.  I realized it today and called the restaurant.  First the receptionist insisted there was no possibility it could still be there and flatly refused to check the booth.  Then the manager got on the phone and also refused to check the booth. ""It's impossible"" he claimed.  I asked him to check our reservation to see where we sat but he refused. ""Our cleaners would have found any bags left"".Well if you have been in the dark restaurant and looked under the booth with lots of nooks and crannies, it certainly would be possible for a small bag to be left under the seating area. Also if it was found by the cleaning crew last night, what kind of top restaurant has dishonest cleaners who wouldn't turn over a shopping bag. In either case it's just despicable.While the shopping bag certainly might not be there, it is beyond bad service to refuse to check the booth or with their cleaners.  We spent $500 on a dinner for four and it will be the last time I ever eat at any of the Capital Grilles.  There are too many other fine steak houses, including Ruth's Chris right next door and Mastro's a block away to settle for either bad service or dishonesty.",1,1,1

While it was flavorful, I had to share my bone-in dry crusted kona strip with shallot butter which was juicy, cooked appropriately, and was plentiful.  It just seemed strange that a waiter would recommend a dish and then agree with us later about our objections to the dish.  We honestly shared our feelings with the waiter and he did remove the Parmesan  truffled French fries from the bill.  We did enjoy the fresh mozzarella,basil,tomatoes with 15yo balsamic-fresh,tasty, good portions.  Would we go back?

They gave us the regular menu as well which was freakin' huge. The clam chowder was great and the 10 oz sirloin was cooked perfectly. The cheesecake had a caramelized coating which was delicious. They gave us enough sides for all of us instead of individually asking us what we wanted. Sam's mashed potatoes was delish and the French green beans were crunchy and fresh. My friend got the salmon and she said she's had better. My other friend got the filet mignon and he said it was nice and tender, though it looked a little charred on the outside.

Very, very dim. Fancy and spacious. Oh, and DIM.Food: I ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter. Holy mother of baby J, this was the best steak I've had in my life, to date. I asked for it medium rare and it was cooked so perfectly I could kiss the chef (probably not, but maybe a hug will suffice). The flavoring was both sweet and savory, and the meat was tender. Also, the portion was humongo. A hefty $49, but well worth it if you are willing to treat yo self.My mother got the original filet mignon dish and loved it. My sister ordered the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms, but she complained that over time, the onions and wild mushrooms made the dish way too sweet. We also shared the spinach and oscar-styled roasted potatoes. Both sides were generously portioned and accompanied our dishes very, very well.Oh, and a shout out to their bread selection here. Breadsticks, french bread, multigrain. Y'all have the key to my heart, carbs.We were too full to try dessert, so maybe next time.Service: Fantastic. Friendly, prompt, and not too overbearing.

You get 1 star for that.Starter: Caesar saladBlue cheese wedge salad with bacon I had the wedge and thought too much dressing and I love bacon but the size of the pieces was conflicting with the salad I believe. Entree:Bone-in strip (14oz) Filet mignon (10oz) Both dishes came out looking like sad, airplane food. Both looked dry visually. I had the filet and it was DRY and I got it medium. It was so depressing that I didn't bother trying my friend's steak but he also said it wasn't so good. We both agreed these steaks were at the bottom of our list.Dessert:Both got the creme brûlée and I personally like more of the custard and a thin layer of the caramelized sugar but it tasted more like 1/2 and 1/2 so it was too intense for me. My friend, however, destroyed his and my leftover so this is subjective. Service:I won't put our server on blast but I do know his name well. We both felt kind of forgotten and service was slow and it's a Tuesday night! It didn't seem to be crazy busy so no excuse. He's a very friendly guy when you do catch him but overall, not attentive. Ambiance:Nice setting, feels very warm and cozy. I guess that is a plus, I'll add another star for that (from my initial 1!)

I went on a holiday day but it was not at all busy and now I know why.First the drink menu is on an iPad because they went paperless, the problem with that is that if I cannot make up my mind in a fewSeconds I'm forced to star at an iPad held by another person for however long this indecision occurs. That's no fun. They do have a decent Malbec that goes well will steak.I chose the usual filet. It came out perfectly medium rare but it was otherwise not that interesting just a piece of meat for my mouth... The Parmesan truffle fries are really good. The mashed potatoes are basically creamed whole potatoes which also are very good. Tastes like a destroyed fresh potato in my mouth.They bring you out a random selection of 'bread' but half of it is a large non salted cracker. However the bread itself is warm which is a nice touch.
