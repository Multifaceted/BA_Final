1,Tommy S.,"New York, NY",1,1,1,1.0,11/6/2018,"Aweful! Don't go unless you care nothing about how your food taste like. I asked for a chopped steak, medium rare, but unfortunately the restaurant only do well-done anyways. What I got was a HUGE meat smelling like shit, or like pigpen, same. I've never tried eat wax, and today I did, the baked potato was ""medium rare"" and I actually ate some of it because that's the only thing was acceptable on the table. Also the High C smoothie was actually taste like vitamin pills in drug store, how? Did they really put vitamin C in it?  I've never write a food review on internet, hoping this could be useful to you. Please consider something else.",,,
2,Tom M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,7,3,1.0,10/20/2018,It was a poor experience. My Quesadilla was too spicy. The waiter took my glass to refill water and never returned. He also had body odor. The bus boy was amazing.  Cashier was talking in her cell the whole time while ringing me up. Good food..poor service.,,,
3,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2296,4010,4.0,3/18/2018,"I have a friend who makes restaurant choices in a rash manner - just walking into the first place he sees. I like to be a little more planned and educated, but when he whisked me into this diner we stumbled upon it felt right.There was a long counter area with vinyl covered chrome bar stools and late 70s era tables and chairs to match with a woodsy burn orange color palette that looked kept up.We scored a booth, menus got sort of thrown at us and coffee was quickly dealt out.  The menu was large and our older waiter from El Salvador was fiesty and pushy with a whimsical verve. I ordered the egg and bacon breakfast for around $8 which came with hasbrowns, toast, coffee and juice.   It was what you'd expect from an old school diner - in a good way. The place gets busy and it seems to have a local following - so plan your visit around peak times, don't expect too much in terms of culinary innovation but go sit at the counter and get breakfast.*local character *old school diner that isn't too greasy.",9,3,9

6,Ashley A.,"New York, NY",3,91,202,5.0,7/22/2018,"Best pancakes in NYC- I will disprove anyone who says otherwise! There's something about a diner that is inviting and relaxing but when the food is amazing that just adds to the experience! I recommend the Lumberjack breakfast with pancakes (obvy), the mozzarella sticks, cheesecake , and the carrot cake here. Definitely a place worth visiting and taking visitors to when they are in town!",,,
7,Sangduk S.,"College Park, MD",175,62,47,1.0,1/16/2018,"You'd expect Orion Diner & Grill to be ok, you know?  I'm not walking in expecting more than an IHOP, not great, not horrible, just somewhere around below average.  I've lived in this area for several months now and I had yet to sample Orion Diner & Grill's wares. Its yelp review is on the low end and its patrons seem to be on average, 65+.  Today we said, ""ah fuck it, how bad could this corner diner spot be?""  After all its always bustling with grandpas and grandmas.  It was immediately clear that we'd made a grave mistake.  Time slowed down as we wondered if eating was always such a difficult, joyless task.  The cheesesteak was like biting into ripped pieces of shoe leather.  The salmon was absolutely tasteless.  The soups were like dirty mop water.  The worst part was watching the server use his bare fucking hands to plate a house salad for a customer in the next booth over from us, right after having used a cloth towel to wipe the discolored crevices of a dirty table.  Even sadder was the recipient of this unsanitary dish, some poor old grandpa who was on the brink of death, just slowly gnawing away at the soiled, yellowing lettuce leaves like a 300 year old sea turtle.  The service was fine otherwise I guess. Food came out fast, the waiter was polite enough.  The main problem is that you just can't get your appetite going when you're surrounded by a bunch of limp vegetables raspily crowing for more water as they wither away and basically die in front of you.  I witnessed a 5 minute struggle during which a grandma barely successfully brought a forkful of egg from her plate to her mouth.  She then proceeded to grin broadly, satisfied as if she'd just achieved the impossible.  As I looked away from this spectacle back down to my own sad plate of shitty diner food, I screamed in my soul, 'NOOOOOOOOOO' and ran outside the diner.  Fuck this I can't go back to Orion's, it's a bleak in-your-face example of what the future holds in store for all of us.",1,6,

11,Shade F.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/2/2018,"Worst service I've ever received and should of got a zero rating because 1 Star is being generous. Do not give your money to this racist and sexist establishment. The waiter was an older white male with an accent. He didn't introduce himself or give us time to look at the menu, and when he first came around and expected us to say our order immediately he used an obscene gesture to wave us off when we weren't ready. when he came back around the second time to take our order when I seemed hesitant about my order instead of giving us more time or even suggesting a meal, he instead said ""maybe I should leave and you can call me on the phone when you decided what you want"" in a sarcastic and condescending tone.  I told him I didn't appreciate the comment he didn't even apologize. He also didn't take note that our glasses were filthy! I don't know how they got an A. When we called him over to just cancel our order. He immediately and rudely took our glasses and said goodbye, yelling it loudly multiple times to make a scene. Not only is that the worst service I've had, but refusing us service would have actually felt like he was doing us a favor. I don't recommend anyone eat there, for sub par diner food anyway!",,,

13,Yanni R.,"East Norwich, NY",0,23,3,5.0,8/11/2018,"Don't agree why it only has 2.5 stars.  It's a bit small.  But for NYC, the portions are large, prices are fair and the service is fast!  Come on!  The chicken souvlaki is great.  And they have great lunch special where you get a free soup!",,,
14,Reva R.,"New York, NY",391,163,2444,2.0,12/14/2016,"Years ago, there was an award winning ad written by a famous, well-respected ad man, his initials are E. McC. & it was for Horn & Hardart cafeterias-the headline was great, & it works for this establishment, too.  It said: ""You Can't East Atmosphere"".  Well, I always try to see what the good stuff is when I write a review, & I'd say, in my opinion & based on my visit w/my friend--the good here is the atmosphere, and we also encountered a very nice, helpful female server.  I'm afraid that's the best I can say.  My food & my friend's food did not have any flavor/seasoning--it was bland, tasteless.  He had eggs Benedict & a salad instead of fries.  I had ordered  from the lunch special menu--the philly cheese steak--and a matzo ball soup.  The matzo ball was nice, kind of light & nice chunks of celery & carrots & dill, yet, no flavor...my entire lunch was totally without flavor. A flavorless Philly Cheese Steak. I loved the painted sky & clouds on the ceiling in the front of the restaurant & we loved the spacious booths in the front.  And the nice clean windows.  If only the food lived up to the atmosphere....because, as that great ad man once wrote--You can't eat atmosphere .  I won't be back to try anything else.",6,4,5
15,Maura M.,"New York, NY",18,28,4,2.0,3/4/2018,"They poached their eggs well, were good with coffee/tea refills, and I didn't leave smelling like a deep fryer. However: The ham tasted like the gas grill it was grilled on, half the bacon was deep fried and the other half was soggy, they forgot ingredients in my boyfriend's omelet, and they brought white toast instead of rye - even after checking which type. Home fries were mediocre. We came here because we found that East Side Diner was closed and didn't feel like walking to Joe Jr. Won't be returning.",,,

Also, open 24 hours!",,,
17,Usti H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11,100,120,1.0,1/1/2018,"Worst customer service I've ever received-I ordered a very simple order of Buffalo Wings and Home Fries online from Orion today at around 12pm and I waited for 1 hour before calling them to see what happened to the order. As soon as I told them I was calling about an order, they proceeded to yell at me to ""be patient"" as they could not find a delivery guy. I was taken aback and immediately they hung up without even asking about my order number or anything at all. I waited 1 more hour and I never heard back from them and I did not receive my food. So I called again and the guy spoke to me with such attitude saying he doesn't know what happened because he wasn't there during that time, and I need to call back tomorrow morning. Again they did not ask for any info regarding my name or order number and hung up on me. I think this is the worst customer service I've ever gotten at a resto :( sadly I can't comment on their food but I bet it's just as subpar as their service",,,
18,Sara S.,"New York, NY",183,132,340,2.0,8/21/2016,"TL;DR: overcharged and ended up with food poisoning after eating here. The quality and service has gone severely downhill. The recent bad reviews are real, fellow yelpers. After a long walk yesterday my partner and I were starving. We were looking up different options in the area when we noticed Orion was nearby. YES. Large portions + diner food = happy tummy and wallet. My spinach omelette was alright, lackluster at best, so I was grateful they had Tabasco. The sausage in my partners eggs tasted really off, but we were hungry and attributed it to the type of sausage. Rookie mistake. Today he's feeling all of the awful side affects of food poisoning. To top it off our waiter up-charged us. I kindly brought it up with the hosted and asked to see a breakdown of the check. I noticed the waiter charged us $6 for my bacon which is clearly listed as $2 on the top of the breakfast menu. I usually let these small things slide but decided it was appropriate after our disappointing meal. As I was bringing it up with the hostess, the waiter popped in out of nowhere and instantly gave me an attitude insisting I had asked for a whole order ($6). Don't get me wrong, I love me some bacon, but I've got a small appetite and there's no way I would've agreed to an entire plate of it. After asking the hostess to see a menu, the waiter stuffed $3 in my hand and stormed off. Holy moly bad customer service. The Orion diner was one of our go to spots for cheap eats in the area. I had a soft spot for this particular little diner since my boyfriend and I stopped here on our first date, AND continued to eat here for years after. Needless to say I'm pretty damn sad to see this place has gone downhill.",2,,

Updated review","I don't know what's going on with this place. I placed an order on 7/26 at 1:40am and was given a delivery estimate of 2:20-2:30am, I waited until almost 3am before contacting them and then falling asleep - only to be told nothing could be done because the manager wasn't there. Fast forward to today, 7/30 at 7:30am a delivery person rings my bell to deliver food from the restaurant but the delivery person notices that I look very confused and asked me if I ordered food? I tell him - No. Then I get a message saying the restaurant attempted to deliver my food but no one was available to accept it. I then realize they were trying deliver my food order from a week ago..:",1,4,
25,Jake B.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",10,2,0,1.0,4/8/2018,"Stay away. I've ordered from Orion and been there many times and usually it's ok but nothing special by any means.  This last time I got burnt pancakes and packaged orange juice instead of fresh squeezed, which I paid $5.50 for. I politely made my compliant saying that I am a loyal customer who has spent $100 in the last week alone.  What did they do? The manager yelled at me saying he doesn't care how much I have spent and hung up on my call.  I don't mind over paying for diner food but if i am a loyal customer I would like to be treated with respect and get edible food and drink.  If this is the only place open you won't suffer, but I would recommend other diners if you are deciding between one or the other.  I have no patience for people who do not respect loyal customers and are rude when I have been there multiple times and never complained until today.",,,

As soon as I was seated I looked around and noticed the window side tables were all empty. I asked the server politely if I could switch to one of the window side tables, the server replied with a straight face ""No."" I asked him ""Why?"" And he said ""maybe, sometimes we get busy."" First of all, I looked around again, there were four other customers besides me, the place was 10% full, it was noon. Second of all, I was asking to switch from a four people table to another four table, it didn't even make sense why he couldn't let me switch. And lastly, within 10 minutes after our conversation, a two party walked in and were seated at one of the window side tables. Bravo.Despite the bad service, the food was decent, thus the three stars. I ordered pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. The bacons were bacons. The server who refilled my coffee seemed pretty nice so maybe I was just unlucky that day.",2,,

Extended wait time, broken food containers upon delivery, wrong orders, overcharging, cold food... if there's something that can go wrong on a delivery order, they'll make sure to check that box.

This is the perfect place to go on a rainy day, to get some comfort food. I usually got the grilled cheese and fries, with mustard and I can't complain. I got what I ordered. The menu has everything a diner offers and it is served well in a modest fashion. Because it is near school of visual arts (SVA) you often have tables of college kids eating and talking their future projects, but that's part of being in New York. I've been there alone, and in groups, and I have never waited to be seated.

57,Evan R.,"New York, NY",429,307,36,2.0,12/14/2014,"We ordered from here, for a late night snack delivered. The Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich was the second worse in New York. A few pieces of eggplant breaded and deep fried. One of the slices of eggplant was completely unripe and destroyed the thing. Also there were like only a few drops of acid tomato sauce on it and a small slab of really really plastic mozzarella cheese. It came with fries that were greasy like from a time machine set to forty years ago. This is at most a $5.00 sandwich, if it was good, but they charge $10.50 for it, and it's really bad.The Caramel Sundae & Brownie was actually very good, and pulled this place out of the gutter - if it was the eggplant only, I would have given 1 star.

I had to help host a conference across the street and called in an order of a dozen different entrees for my group with very specific requests the week before. Orion Diner verified the order and delivered directly to the conference room exactly at the time I specified with each bag numbered as I had asked. I ordered Georgie's Famous Salad and a bottle of water. The salad looked so fresh with a well-seasoned roasted salmon filet, roasted bell pepper slices, chunks of tender pear, olives, walnuts, almonds, fresh mozzarella, mesclun, and other greens and was packed in a big, clear, plastic bowl of goodness with a lid. It came with a raspberry vinaigrette on the side and a warm roll that had dried berries in it, 2 butters, salt, pepper, napkins, a fork, and a knife all in my own white paper bag. So yummy- I finished all of it! The fresh ingredients kept me from going into a post-lunch coma.So delicious! So polite! So easy! So careful! So thoughtful!",11,11,11

My husband is very upset that his corn beef was so bad. No flavor at all he says. The mashed potato was cold and had a funny garlicky flavor (probably powdered mash potato) and NO GRAVY! He's flabbergasted that they didn't even ask if he wanted gravy. He ordered a soda and he had to ask for the straw.

The food is great and they've got some pretty not so traditional diner dishes to try out as well (and some amazing fried ice cream!) - but on top of some great food the biggest draw here is the staff, whether it's your first time at Orion or your 101st they treat you like family from beginning to end.

Portions are huge but what's the point if the food is barely decent?  Worst part is the service -- it's distinctly unfriendly.  The hostess automatically puts you at the worst table even when the place is empty, as if she's expecting someone better to turn up, and asking to change seating gets a death stare. Wait staff appears harried and never smiles. Checks arrive before they're asked for. Just not a pleasure to eat here.",,,

The three of them repeated it and continued to laugh. Super offensive and upsetting so I felt the need to post my experience. It's sad to think people in the restaurant and hospitality industry would make comments like that, particularly when all I was looking for was a quiet meal and was keeping to myself. I won't be going back ever and I will be discouraging others from going there as well. Cleanliness was also an issue as I watched one of the servers wash a coffee cup under the hot water for tea thermos and serve the same cup to a different customer without a proper cleaning. there are many way better diners in the city with much better service.",4,,

He was in dire need of some food because of a big Saturday night and usually a greasy diner is one of the best ways to go. We came in and the people were very friendly and sat us right away. After looking over the menu it contains your traditional diner fair. Nothing special so we both ordered their biggest breakfast sandwich and my brother also ordered a chocolate milkshake. The milk shake might be one of the better ones I've had in the city. I think they use a very rich brand of chocolate ice cream and just mix it with some milk. It's a thick shake that you can't really drink with a straw and very tasty.I was disappointed with our sandwich. It had 3 eggs, cheese, bacon, and some peppers and onions on it. Overall I thought it was very tasteless. I'm all for a nice greasy sandwich in the morning but it has to at least taste good. It felt like this place had never heard of salt and pepper.

The decor is really nice, especially for a diner where you aren't expecting the nicest atmosphere.

The eggs were slimy, and they gave me a quesadilla instead of a tortilla. This is some of the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant.",1,,

Further, the individual on the phone that i have talked to 5 times now and keeps telling me 2 mins.The restaurant also REFUSES to reimburse me any money for my meal, which is ridiculous. I would appreciate that a representative from Orion reach out to me ASAP with a number or an individual i can reach out to in order to fix this situation.This has been a terrible experience and no customers should be treated like this.",2,,

Service:Our waitress kept forgetting to bring us things, to her defense, it was the only restaurant open after Sandy hit and she was clearly being worked hard. She was still super nice so yay!Food:Texas burger: lettuce, tomato, cheese with a fried egg on top, it was one of the lunch specials for 9.95 and include fries. The burger decently sized, moist, very edible but nothing extraordinary. Fries were your standard fries. Fish n Chips: I was slightly skeptical as they had fisher smell than usual but they were surprisingly well made, light crispy batter on the outside, hot moist fish on the inside.Lunch specials are served with coleslaw, soup, fries, and my fav, a pickle, yum!",4,1,1

It's doors are always open, and it's menu quite extensive.  You're sure to find something satisfying and filling here.  It's good old fashioned diner food that'll do a body good, no matter what time of day (though I have a feeling that it's more satisfying in the wee hours of a friday night/saturday morning after night out on the town)I had the breakfast quesadilla which totally hit the spot (from what I can remember...)",,1,

Updated review","ugggh...just too many mistakes lately to tolerate any longer. Bye bye, Orion. Next time someone orders eggplant, try not to use aluminum tasting freezer burned pre-packaged from 1978. Next time someone asks for Swiss cheese on anything, try not using cheddar. Next time someone asks for rye bread (and says it twice, after you ask, ""white?"" and they answer ""No, not white, Rye""), try not using white. Next tome you serve a roll, a bun, a croissant, or a danish, try not to use a ridiculously stale one. Bad diners can last a long time in NYC, but even Cosmos died at some point.",2,2,2

171,Jacqueline T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,32,0,2.0,10/8/2012,"first the good news: Orion is open 24/7 which is a big boost to the neighborhood now that my beloved East Bay Diner has shuttered after 30+ years.  and, it also delivers, so that 4am craving for a grilled tomato and cheese on rye is just a phone call away whenever the spirit moves you.  the bad news is, the food is pretty hit or miss.  I just got finished eating a turkey meatloaf platter that would've been excellent had it not contained an entire salt mine in it and I mean, we're talking instant high blood pressure here.  the obviously frozen mixed veggies were barely cooked and the mashed potatoes were glopped together, so it was impossible to determine if they had been made from real potatoes or not, but my guess is not.  to their credit though, the mushroom gravy atop the meatloaf was very good and had big, chunky sliced 'shrooms in it that you don't get in a can, so I know there's some attention to detail being paid during preparation.  my fresh lemonade was delicious too and the chocolate cake I got for later looks pretty damn tasty, so all is not lost.  breakfast might be your best bet as a frittata I ordered in a few weeks ago was great, even though the accompanying hash browns were completely tasteless.all in all, I'll be a returning customer, if for no other reason than its 'round the clock availability - a major plus now that both the Lyric and Euro diners have also closed recently.",1,,
172,Eve P.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,1,0,5.0,10/18/2013,"Seriously amazing , had a late night craving for icecream and stumbled across this place the waiter Cosmo is absolutely amazing and hilarious and incredibly attentive I got a HUGE ice cream sundae cheesecake and delicious fries for 20$ I had to come back tonight to see Cosmo again the grammarcy burger had so much cheese melting on it the fries were hot and crispy and the red velvet cake was delicious and had strawberries the other server came Round 5 different times to refill my coffee and was right there with more silverware the second I accidentally dropped my fork",,,
173,Spencer A.,"New York, NY",4,6,0,1.0,3/25/2012,"Horrific customer service, ordered delivery, when it took over an hour, I called to check on my food, and was told it would take another 20 minutes and before I could say anything else I was hung up on. A million other diners to go to, this place is not worth the space",1,,1
174,Kerri L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,2,3.0,6/15/2013,"Exactly what you would expect from your typical diner. Nothing special but nothing to really complain about either. Always very clean. Big menu, fair prices. If you're looking for standard comfort foods at odd hours this is probably one of the better options in the neighborhood.",,,
175,Brianna F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,0,1.0,3/22/2015,"Hate to be an a-hole...but I can't speak positively in regards to the quality of food nor the service I received with my order. I ordered super early in the morning but I ended up throwing 70 percent of it away. It was not a taste I would like to reorder ever again. Two stars below a Denny's. On top of that, the man came back twice to my door trying to explain something in spanish with his phone in hand....I tipped extra  in person with what I had on me in cash and told him many times I don't understand him at my door...but he kept pointing at his phone map. Please let it be known that I tipped him on my card in advance yet he asked me in person ""no tip?!"" For what?! You were in my designated delivery area. I thought I was simply ordering as usual with eat24.com... I  do not know the full extent of what he was saying so he returned to my apartment twice to explain yet again what I couldn't understand. Not purchasing from here again.",,,
176,Scott F.,"Manhattan, NY",23,7,0,1.0,2/21/2013,"This place is dead to me. My girlfriend and I each had a cup of matzo ball soup which turned out to be sour tasting which means it was laying too long. Then 1 night we were having dinner and we were very warm, so we asked if they could open the window. They did, but without asking us, the waitress closed the window. When I said something to her, she said that her customers behind us were cold. Well, we are customers as well and resented the way the waitress treated us. Of my girlfriend ever goes in there again, it will be without me.",,,
177,Aclaire H.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,114,17,4.0,5/19/2012,Food was pretty good. Service was decent. Will most likely be back. :),,,
178,D. R.,"New York, NY",3,15,0,1.0,6/25/2012,"I ordered a late night veggy focaccia sandwich via delivery and it was thoroughly disgusting.  I would definitely keep that in mind folks.  I had to toss it in the garbage.  The mushrooms were uncooked and rubbery, the cheese barely melted, the bread stale and the sight was just a mess.",,,
179,Tom S.,"New York, NY",294,10,0,4.0,5/27/2012,"I go to the college down the street, so I'm here quite often. The service is great and hilarious, the guy we always get served by is a card. The food is pretty good and pretty cheap, good for a college student. Lot of memories at this place and I have never had a complaint about this place. Love it!",,,
180,Scott C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,36,0,2.0,3/9/2012,"Nice job with reno, but food and service lame. Tried twice, burnt pancakes, wet omelette, friend's not pleased with their meals either (turkey club, greek salad, don't remember specifics). Staff tried but not up to task at hand.",,,
