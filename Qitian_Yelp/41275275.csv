0,Gordon E.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,72,0.0,5.0,10/29/2018,"I like Whiskey Town a whole lot. This is a bro bar. I can't exactly pin down which part is the bro part, but this is a place to find bros. Whiskey Town traffics in young men who wear long-sleeve, buttoned-down shirts one buys at Macy's that their moms picked out for them. For various reasons, the bar is for and about women. Finding out it's a woman's bar is always somewhere around midnight, when the DJ goes straight to boy bands? The bouncers are very large, and fast to help out if a woman feels slighted by some drunk dude. The danger versus safety equation is to seem dangerous, whereas I think everybody is safe.  I think Julian is an excellent bartender who knows how to pour and how to cut someone off if they're getting too drunk or on their way there. I've also been there when it's not busy, and he has the ability to have excellent conversations and really listen. This bar is similar to Sweet and Vicious, another bar close by. This bar is also similar to Wonderland Ballroom in Columbia Heights of Washington, DC.",1,1,1

After I paid I noticed it said $20 minimum so he was definitely just saying that to pocket my cash. 9:45 on Friday 11/16. Management needs an overhaul. See u later, whiskey town",,,

3,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1899,817,3.0,12/8/2017,"Chill little bar that I had a fun couple hours at. Great music (90s, top 40, pop, dance), energetic vibe, fun-loving youths. Free popcorn on quieter nights, although ""quiet"" here is still ""crowded"" elsewhere. I went on a Thursday night, so it wasn't as ""greasy"" as it would be on the weekends, greasy being how I describe sleazy fist-pumpers and duck-faces. I don't know if I'd return intentionally, but I'd recommend it on a downtown bar crawl.",5,3,4
4,Katie C.,"New Orleans, LA",374,123,173,2.0,5/2/2018,"Late night bar with a dance floor scene in the East Village. I've gone out here a few times with friends. I'm always amazed at how nice and polite the staff are here because it is kind of frat row central. It tends to get a little overcrowded and overheated. Drinks are a bit pricey for what they are. You effectively can only buy cheap domestic beers with the exception of Brooklyn Brewery. There is a pretty high credit card minimum as well. The crowd that goes here is relatively rude. They would rather just push instead of say excuse me. There is also no coat check or place to put your coat without running the risk of having it get stolen. I've seen worse bathrooms, but it isn't a comfortable place to go to the bathroom.",,,
5,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",605,382,801,2.0,4/3/2017,Just not really my kinda crowd or place. Music was just all 90s or top 40. Nothing amazing. Obviously if you like that kinda thing you'll enjoy it. Pros: Bartenders were attentive and tended to you quickly. Also there's 4 bathrooms so it's good for the crowd. Cons: Whisky town is really packed and the crowd was rude and pushed people around.Didn't stay more than an hour. Got bored and probably won't come back. And take this review with a grain of salt. What you will enjoy on a night out is totally different from what I would enjoy.,2,,1
6,Farrah G.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,4,0,5.0,9/7/2018,"I love this bar. Have been coming here for nearly 3 years. The drinks are well made, the bartenders are great people, and the atmosphere whether a quiet night or a crowded one is always welcoming. Have been here on a Sunday early afternoon and a Friday night and everything in between and always enjoy myself! One of my favorite bars.",,,
7,Katie G.,"Barnstable, MA",0,6,0,1.0,3/24/2018,This bar is not fun - on top of that and more importantly  the bouncer is extremely disrespectful and not worth the visit.Condescending ( by the way 10 people between 25 years old and 30 years old ) to all sharing IDs willingly - is the only word applicable for the disgusting bouncer.I will forever spread negative remarks about Whiskeytown because of this experience. Do not make the time to go here,1,1,
8,Holly M.,"New York, NY",41,105,175,4.0,10/16/2017,"Stumbled here by accident and it was a happy one! It is the perfect combination between bar and club and the DJ was AMAZING. The space is nicely planned, so you can sit and drink with your friends, sit at the bar, stand near the dance floor or dance. there is a photobooth which was cool and the DJ actually listened/played our suggestions. Even though it got crowded as the night went on the guys there were not creepy or grabby which is always a plus. The bartender really did an amazing job keeping everything fast and smooth even though there were a ton of people there. I would certainly go back for a night out on the weekend if you want to dance or just sit and chill. I know I will at least need to go back to try the whiskey this time since. 10/10 would recommend you stop by this place between the villages.",,,

10,John W.,"New York, NY",150,50,17,1.0,1/15/2018,"Came in here tonight after seeing some music at Rockwood, just stumbled upon it in looking for a place for a drink.  It was trivia night, found two seats at the bar, (one of the 2 seats was taken, but the guy said I could sit).  Then the douchebag bartender, (friends with the guy who gave me his seat) asked what we wanted and asked me to ""get up so his buddy can have his seat back"".  I nodded and ordered my $6 Brooklyn lager. Fuck You bartender!  Your buddy said I could have his seat.  So shame on you for asking me to get up.",1,,

Bartenders are great, beer is cold, and the pickle back shots are still kicking my ass!

Soooo good!!",,,
13,Emery G.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",422,330,2484,4.0,1/23/2017,"Came in because we were attracted by the 90s 00s rock music that we once loved. One the music was over we left.

The bartenders are super great...the pours are good. The food is so so...so don't come here hungry. Good music and a basic atmosphere.",2,1,

The crowd is definitely a super young crowd. Everyone is very pushy, drunk, college-y, and frankly annoying. It is so hot and it takes you ten minutes to get from one side of the bar to another. Other places in the area like Phebes and The Wren are definitely still fun but less crazy and don't make you feel like you're at a sweaty college frat party. The one thing I enjoyed was the old school music.",2,1,1

Will definitely go back and recommend it to anyone that wants to have a drink in that neighbour hood and to anyone that enjoys a good whiskey/scotch/bourbon. The selection is interesting and unique,,,
22,Olivia R.,"Hoboken, NJ",267,143,48,5.0,12/27/2015,"I love this place. Maybe it's the hot bartender Zach or the dive-y dance party ambiance but it's truly one of my favorite go-to spots in the city.It is, however, slowly becoming too popular for it's own good and the lines are getting serious but I don't hate it just yet.

Drinks and dancing. So yes we came here. We had a tequila shot. My date went and had more and was still sober. So what? They played good dance music, well, not really. But beggars can't be choosers. We danced, we flirted and somehow we ended up in the Photobooth with mischievous plans...Def come here if you like the NYU 20s scene. We, unfortunately, are a bit older by a decade and well, after doing a few shots, we had to take out party elsewhere. But we did have a good time and I was able to steal in a kiss...",8,9,8
24,Bernardo C.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",535,161,54,3.0,4/12/2016,"Drank here with a big group this past weekend. Sorry to say it didn't live up to the hype. The atmosphere was cool with the red lights and set up of the bar/space. The music is where they mostly went wrong. They would play some really dancy music and then switch to like a blue grass hit and then to early years Taylor swift. Kind of a super college vibe in not the best way. For example, some girl was fascinated with my coat and asked me to take it off so she could take a picture with it...how tasteless.",,,
25,Kayla C.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,1/17/2017,"My friends and I used to go for drinks at Whiskey Town frequently, however after spending 5 minutes in the bar recently, we will never return. A few friends and I dressed up in Santa-outfits as a part of Santa-Con 2016. After bar-hopping for a few hours, we landed up at Whiskey Town. However, when I went to buy a drink at the bar, I was confronted with the rudest bartender I have ever encountered. I tried to pay for my $11 drink with my debit-card when he informed me that there was a $20 minimum. Not having any cash on me, he told me to get cash out at the little ATM located at the back of the bar. I had $400 stolen out of my account previously that year after using an unmarked ATM, so I mentioned that I didn't trust those types of ATMs. He then refused to serve me, which is illegal in New York State. (If an establishment accepts card-payments, they are not legally allowed to enforce a minimum.) I was a bit annoyed, but not angered at this point, so I stated that it was illegal to refuse my payment by saying ""That's illegal, just so you know."" But as I turned to leave the bar, the young white male bartender replied saying, ""Well you're probably not legal in this country!"" I asked if he was serious and he said, ""Yes,"" before refusing to communicate with me further. I then went back to my group of friends and suggested we leave, but a friend of mine was outraged and went back to the bar to demand the name of the bartender. He replied with ""I don't have a name,"" and refused to speak to her further. At that point we called the manager. Before speaking with the manager (Josh, I believe), the bartender went up to him and whispered something in his ear. I then recounted the story from the very beginning, to which the manager replied, ""My bartender never said that."" I couldn't believe he was implying that I was lying so I informed him that my friends and I were going to take our business elsewhere, to which he replied casually, ""Okay."" Upon leaving, my friend asked for the email address of the owner. After waiting for a while, the manager returned to address the situation outside on the side-walk. (We spent the wait talking to the bouncer who was lovely.) After hearing me out again, the manager apologized saying, ""I'm sorry, but I could never imagine my bartender saying that."" To which, I replied, ""Well, he did."" I didn't need another white male mansplaining to me why I was in the wrong, so I told him that even if he offered me free-drinks for the rest of my life, I was never going to return to his bar. This prompted him to give me the 3 email addresses of the owners, before we left. Never in my four years of living in the US (legally, may I add,) have I ever encountered such terrible customer-service and blatant xenophobia. I would give zero stars if Yelp allowed. Unfortunately I will never return, and will never support any establishment that validates a xenophobic, sexist, or racist narrative. (P.S. I was just going to ""let this one go"" until a friend reminded me that it is important to speak up, now more than ever.)",1,,
26,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",5000,1699,3185,5.0,7/10/2014,"Free microwave popcorn with so many different optional toppings from hot sauce to old bay to honey? What? Yes! I fecking love microwaved popcorn, so this is like the playboy mansion of dive bars for me. They also have pickle backs and may I suggest the spicy ones?My party played Cards Against Humanity which they have in stock along with a real jammed up jenga and I drank and ate popcorn. LOVE.Not the cheapest dive bar around, but on a Thursday hot and steamy summer night it was cold, empty and had all of the above going for it. Definitely a great corner spot. If I lived nearby I'd probably be here on the reg.Oh, they let you keep the koozies. BOOM.* I'd suggest coming here with your own crew for debauchary. As mentioned, there was maybe one other person in the bar the whole time.",13,9,10
27,Tom O.,"Boston, MA",1,9,0,5.0,1/18/2016,"My kind of place. Relaxed atmosphere and extremely friendly bartenders. Cheap drinks and and fun trivia. The bartender made an announcement that they would be closed for the new year weekend ""because the staff needs to get drunk too."" Thought that was pretty funny and down to earth. This is the kind of place to go and kick back with a few beers and avoid all those god damn yuppies (even if you are one).I also left my bag at this place because I indulged in their beer bucket specials a little too hard, and they immediately found it and let me pick it up the next day. That was legendary, 5 fucking stars. Thanks again guys.",1,1,

This place is a solid spot if you want to get drinks with friends and dance and don't really care about much else. But it does get VERY crowded and the folks behind the bar weren't always the nicest.

31,Risca P.,"Elmhurst, NY",186,116,92,2.0,10/27/2015,"Came here this past Friday night with my sister and her friends. One of them just turned 21 (oh boy) so they were pretty much out to get crazy. We were hanging out by the bar and dancing. They played a variety of music but mostly today's hits. It got crowded pretty fast and the next thing I knew, the birthday boy disappeared. Turned out he got kicked out (not sure what the full story is but from what I heard, one of the bartenders said something about him). Sadly, my sister had just ordered a drink for him so she had to chug it herself. We left to go to 13th Step but the birthday boy didn't want to stay so he bounced because he felt bad. None of this made sense to me but I just went along with it even though I was exhausted after a long day. The people who stayed were me, my sister, and one of his friends and somehow..we ended up here again after 13th Step. At our second visit, the crowd has doubled. There was hardly any space to move around in and it  became very uncomfortable. Why does the doorman keep letting people in if it was already over the limit? Go figure. We hung out by the DJ booth but by this point, I was already running low on energy. It was about 2am. Whiskey Ward is your basic east village dive bar. You come here to get drunk and just dance like a maniac. The crowd, at least on the night that I went, seemed to be of people who were under 25 years old. I could not stand how crowded it got. I am all about good music and having fun, but if the space does not allow for it, then there is no fun to be had!",1,,
32,Jonathan O.,"Manhattan, NY",247,41,0,3.0,12/30/2015,"Dive. All beer comes in cans (with complementary koozie). Beer is cheap(ish).Good place for drinking, especially if you have a group of up to seven (as per the seating situation in the bar). Food comes from the pizzeria across the street and is delivered to the bar. The bartender puts it into baskets at the bar with wax paper and tries to dress it up a bit. Still, it's not bad for a pizzeria. Fun for trivia night! Give it a try.",,,

The drinks were $10 a pop, and i figured, i'd get some whiskey, because, why not? First of all, the drinks they give you are HUGE, pint glasses if I'm not mistaken. Not to mention, everyone in the bar was raging like I've rarely ever seen! People were having the times of their respective lives, it was quite a site to behold. When we walked in I thought it was weird how hard everyone was partying, but after ordering a drink and seeing the size of it, it allll made sense.

Total disclaimer: the bar was empty when we were there and we were already tipsy from an earlier open bar. Regardless, the people in Whiskey Town took our sauced up party and brought it up a few notches. Offering us pickle backs with the option of a spicy chaser was just the beginning of this love affair. They also dropped free popcorn on us, had plenty of games to play (Jenga, Cards Against Humanity, etc.), and had decent HH specials. Mets and Yankee games were rocking on several large TV's and the tunes just kept coming. Smooth move, Whiskey Town. I'll be back for more shots sooner than later.",7,5,10

About 7 of us squeezed into a booth and were playing apples to apples (available behind the bar) on a very awkwardly sized table. There wasn't really enough space for both our beers and the game. It was quiet and the bartenders were very friendly. My friends enjoyed the pickle back shots (the reason my friend chose the bar). Around 10:30 people showed up in droves. The TVs turned off and the DJ started playing loud dance party music.

42,Christie M.,"Chicago, IL",19,138,3,3.0,3/24/2015,"I was in the area looking for a chill bar to get a few drinks. Whiskey Town hit the spot. It was crowded, but not too crowded that it was too loud, or a turn off to be there. The night that we were there, they were doing a beer shot combo. We passed on the drink special but did get cans of beer, served in really awesome Koozies. I really liked that about Whiskey Town and certainly made this bar more memorable. The bar is laid out kind of awkwardly, and there wasn't a ton of seating, but I'm assuming that that could have been because they were clearing room for dancing. Definitely a lot smaller than I was imagining, but a chill place regardless.The service was great. Despite it being pretty crowded, my husband was able to get excellent service at the bar. All he had to do was hold up our (empty) beer cans, and the bartender gave him two more without any trouble at all. Nice when a bartender remembers your order and keeps the drinks comin.",,,

They have these booth thingys with a tiny table for drinks, which is nice but the booths can get kind of cramped. The bartender here was awesome. Friendly, chatty, but not overly so, gave us free popcorn all night and may have poured generously.There's nothing quite like a place where you can actually talk and drink and laugh with friends. I don't know what this place is like on the weekends or if it's just going in and out of popularity, but it's going toward the top of my short lists.",,,1

Let me explain.The Good:- Fun and tasty drinks. - Happy Hour till 9pm with two bucks off all drinks, average prices.- Clean bar with that homey dive feel.- Board games.- Photo booth.The Bad:My friend planned her birthday party here on a Saturday night. She spoke with one of the owners and loved his energy! She was told it was okay to bring food, but she wasn't told that the cramped seating and limited table space meant she would NOT have anywhere to place the food. We ended up placing the food on the seats, further reducing the already limited knee-to-knee seating.There may have been a misunderstanding between the owner my friend spoke with and one of the bartenders. She requested for seating for fifteen. Their booths hold an affectionate eight. The owner cleared two side-by-side booths for us, so we thought, but after the owner left, the bartender told us we only had one booth and that all other booths were reserved. We asked to move to a bigger, more spacious area. Again, told that everything was already reserved. He was a cool guy, but we didn't feel our PLANNED and DISCUSSED needs were met. We made the best out of the little space we had for the fifteen-plus that ended up coming.",3,1,1

61,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5152,3.0,10/26/2010,"New York loves their pickle backs, and Whiskey Town isn't about to jump ship on this drinking trend that shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It's a bit of a polarizing libation, and admittedly, when the New York born salty elixir began bubbling up at places around San Francisco, I was dubious to say the least. Jameson and a shot of pickle juice just sounds like a recipe for disaster. But strangely, it's not half bad! It's like a deep fried Oreo: you might try it once just to say you did... but there's probably little reason to imbibe in a second dosage anytime in your adult life. Unless you're looking forward to unexpected cardiac arrest, that is. The pickled whiskey isn't the only notable option in their library of creative drinking items, as they also feature mixed drinks in pint glasses and shot/beer combos that are sure to get your motor running. They also sell six-packs of beer and put them on ice in a Coleman cooler to take back to your table (complete with Whiskey Town coozies, no less). Now that's what I call a party!Like most bars, Friday night brought out quite the slew of weekend warriors where fist pumps were plentiful, popped collars reigned supreme, and sour glances were exchanged with the regularity of a geyser in Yellowstone National Park. If that's your thing, by all means, beat that beat, my friend. But for myself, a return visit on a Wednesday or Thursday seems a tad more palatable.",7,4,5
62,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,1.0,6/25/2011,"Disliked this place from the beginning. It was packed to the gills with dudes and hippie girls jumping around to hits from the 80's and 90's and sporting glowbands on their heads like it was going out of style (um...it did, read the memo from when you were 8 and it was cool).There were obnoxious guys in here that kept stepping all over my feet to shove their way to the bar. I finally moved out of the way and still felt claustrophobic. Normally I enjoy a packed bar but these people on a Friday night were super obnoxious.My drink was only $10 and it was pretty decently strong but tasted like the bottom of my shoe. Maybe I'm too old for this place cuz it seems to attract a certain NYU like crowd that I'm just not into.I don't know how anyone plays board games or anything in a bar filled with people trampling all over you.

If you're not in the mood to fight your way through an immovable barrier of striped button down shirts to get to the bar, then skip it. Its one redeeming quality is that it has the kind of music that you can get REALLY cornball to--songs you know every word of--a bizarre mix of the 50s and early 2000s.

Don't ask me how I got here, becuase before I reviewed this place I had to look to see what neighborhood it was in. Yeah, it was one of those nights. I felt like I was 3 shades too drunk and 5 years too old for the bar. In my blur I got the sense it was a college bar? Guys in collared shirts were grinding on girls in heels to top 40 music. I think we just stood there on the dance floor and stared at everyone.10 minutes later, after perhaps a cocktail was consumed, my partner in crime slurrs, ""Where the fuck are we?"" So we left.

If you liked that whole era of music, then this is the place to be. My friends and I didn't stop dancing the entire night.Oh and the pickelback shots are actually delicious.Also, reserving a table for a birthday or gathering is the way to go.

It's really hard not to when the drinks are so delicious and the picklebacks are so...easy to shoot. It's also worth mentioning that I was not a whiskey drinker.

I've been here more times than I'd like to admit, every visit unprepared to dive into an ocean of sweaty, post-college, bridge-and-tunnel bodies on a weekend night. The guys who work the door are nice enough for looking absolutely miserable. However, crowd control is not Whiskey Town's forte. It was way too packed in there last time I went and management just kept filling the bar - only have I felt more like a sardine when riding the F train at rush hour. It should be noted I do not like being in a clown car, much less do I like drinking in them. But, typically, on nights with a packed house such as my last experience, once I'm settled and/or my patience outlasts others just enough so that the stifling crowd thins itself, Whiskey Town is a good time.There are a number of things I genuinely like about this bar. Mixed drinks are typically under ten bucks and come in those big-ass glasses that college bars serve Long Islands in. Beers can be purchased in coolers or served with free koozies - or are they cozies? Photobooths will always score points with me, even if I don't take advantage of them being there. The communal bathroom set-up works as it should, the one thing about Whiskey Town that actually helps reduce traffic. Generic top 40 hits typically keep the party going till last call.The minglin' singles of the metropolitan New York area will surely enjoy this place most, if they don't mind a rogue elbow to the back of the head on the way to and from the bar. If you can get there early to snag a booth - do it. Your night will be that much more enjoyable - anything to separate yourself from the sea of meat.",2,2,

I'll definitely have to try their whiskey there - it is the whiskey tavern after all.

So needless to say one of my friends was annoyed and told the bouncer to relax, and he proceeded to not let her in at all.

Like the siren's call, this lures me into the murky depths of inebriation at Whiskey Town.They might not have the best whiskey list in town, or the widest selection of beers. Combine the two at an eminently fair price, however, and you have a winning combination. I would gladly pay the pittance of $10 for Rittenhouse Rye and Brooklyn Summer Ale any day.But what if you hate people and prefer to drink alone, making only terse conversation with your bartender? Or amongst one or two equally antisocial companions? On a date? Can Whiskey Town accommodate your needs?You are in luck. Whiskey Town is not afflicted with large crowds of undesirables. It brings a small-to-moderate crowd, people who appreciate the value of conversing at a polite volume while drinking. There are booths. There are ample bathrooms. A photo booth! Board games!The only way I could like Whiskey Town more is if it incorporated as an actual township, under the benevolent leadership of Mayor McWhiskey. I would move to that town, wave to my neighbors as they mowed their lawns on weekend mornings--well, probably mid-afternoon, as we'd all be nursing nasty hangovers. It would be a perfectly idyllic life. The American Dream.Alas, Whiskey Twp. is a mere dream and nothing more. I can reflect on that better life, but as I exit Whiskey Town, the sadness of realization sets in. I shuffle off, dejected, back to a mundane and more sober world.",1,3,5

She booked a table a few weeks before, and Carl got it ready for us right away (seating capacity a few people smaller than he mentioned, but it was not really an issue). Didn't even require a minimum/bottle service to get the table (although I'm sure the 15 or so of us would have gone over whatever minimum they had anyway).Josie the bartender hooked me up very quickly each time I walked up to the bar. The drinks were delicious, and they have a pretty cool cocktail list. Most cocktails were $10 (Highly recommend the Rita Moreno if you enjoy spiciness + vodka). Picklebacks (also delicious) plus a beer were $10, and beers by themselves ranged from $5-$7. This is for a Saturday night at a cool looking establishment in the East Village, mind you, so these are very reasonable prices.The music was pretty decent house DJ. Lots of people dancing.

My boy and I decided to park at the bar while the girls play drunken Jenga in their booth. Bartender introduced us to Baker's Whiskey (I believe it's a Whiskey) and we felt fairly nice after one. I also believe he said it was 53%...scha-wing! the chicks were downing shots of pickle-back in between games. We took one with them even though I'm not a fan of pickles and to my surprise, their pickle juice had a nice kick to it at the end. I actually enjoyed this shot and recommend it.",4,2,3

I really, really enjoy their Happy Hour. $2 off yummy drinks that normally cost $10. $8 for a drink may be more than you're willing to spend in a dive-ish bar but consider that these drinks come in pint glasses.Once the copious amounts of vodka and whiskey (sometimes together) hit your system, Carl, the super-friendly bartender, will hand you that menu book.

The bouncers don't seem to care about the space and capacity of the venue so they don't turn anyone away or make them wait outside. Therefore, it is a giant sea of shoulder-to-shoulder people inside. Getting a drink takes a lot of pushing and waiting, and then finding somewhere to actually enjoy that drink is nearly impossible. I've never seen a bar be so beyond crowded so consistently - and not in a good way.

Updated review","Hi, my name's Jen, and I'm a Whiskey Town regular.I think it's safe to say this is my go to bar in the village.  I'll bring my friends here for a quick shot (pickle backs of course) or a date to chat it up and beat in Connect Four (challenge me I dare you!). I heart Whiskey Town.They have a few bartenders that rotate shifts through out the week and since I come in on random days I didn't think they knew who I was...or so I thought.One night, my friend Cass M. and I came in for some PB's. We ordered our usual (The Manager) then sat down to play some Connect Four.  Some time passes, and one of the bartenders comes over with a tray of 3 PB shots.  I look around confused. He's looking straight at us and moves the tray closer...closer...closer...holy shit it's for us! So all 3 of us take a shot together and he walks back behind the counter. THEN, after I beat Cass M. one last time we walk over to get the check. The girl asks me for my name. My name? I never gave it to the bartender...but I thought I'd humor the situation and hesitantly said Jen? She comes back with a check that says Jennifer at the top. WTF! The bartender remembered my name...and I didn't remember his. FTL. I do now though! Thanks for the shot Carl! :D",6,6,9

Insight #2 - Bourbon drinkers won't find anything out of the ordinary on their list and prices were about $10 - $13 for the stuff I wanted to drink which I thought was a little high especially for a place serving cans of beer in cozies.",1,,

It's on East 3rd St between 2nd Avenue and Bowery.  All was well however, because I made it in time for Trivia night. We got ourselves into teams, and as the games progressed so did the competition.  We started out second to last and ended up landing in 2nd place-but I think we should have won considering I saw the team who won cheat.  This was confirmed by a girl on another team.  Sigh, neither of us wanted to be THAT girl.  The drinks were great, and they have a decent happy hour on beer.  They have tons of ryes and whiskeys, and if you come for trivia, and you're really good at shout outs, you get lots of free shots.  Overall, the space is big, they let you bring in food from outside, and the whole ambiance rocks.Totally my type of joint.",1,,

Oh and then the other bumper cars that are less aggressive all seem to be blonde colored and seething at my very presence in their ring. The content of the crowd, however, is not what based my judgment on since it was Saturday night in the East Village and that sort is a given. While not the sports bar that I had originally imagined the million times I've walked by, Whisky Town is a town that I'd rather not visit on a weekend getaway. The music is the type of top forty you can't dance to. The bathrooms are communal which mean while they go faster, if you pick the wrong door you may find a pukey mess behind it. The credit card minimum is $20, my vodka soda was $8 and if you buy a beer they serve it in a free koozie. One cool thing they do is sell mini coolers of beer ... though I didn't get them so I can't report a price. My conclusion is that if you are going here on a bar crawl or looking for a new sausage cart, then this is a good spot on the weekends. Just wear padding.",9,13,8

The place obviously focuses on whiskey drinks so that's what I suggest getting there. I drank wine which wasn't very good but expected. You can also order beers which come in a Whiskey Town koozy that you get to keep!

Just a few of the words that come to mind. I do enjoy the inexpensive beer cans sold in koozies, and being able to purchase a cooler of beer is even better. Nasty bathrooms = expected. Getting to the bar can be an adventure, so locking down a booth and becoming friends with the waitress is definitely the way to go. Also, there usually seems to be a decently good ratio of guys/girls... I always notice a lot of women here looking to sort of dance the night away.In my opinion, it's a 3 star bar (I'll be generous) -- only because I don't end up dropping a lot of cash here and any place where beer cans are more prevalent than beer bottles gets at last a timid thumbs up. It's actually a 5-star bar if you are looking for a pretty cheap, somewhat fratty, pop music dance party type of place. But for me... well, at least the people here make me laugh.",1,1,1

I was there for a birthday party but the rest of the guys in the room seemed pretty detached and I have no idea what they get out of being squished and pushed for hours on end while trying to dig beers out of a cooler. I give the bar stars for nice space layout and cozy booths but take away stars for no bar stools and a broken photo booths that stole my dollar and expensive cocktails (10+).

I can't say one bad thing about this place. Justin, George and their team were more then accommodating. 6 packs kept in ice coolers table side!! Love it!Let's just say ......I closed the bar and didn't have a problem recalling events that happened throughout the evening/morning...Drama!!! And I was one blotto lady ;PI hope to visit again soon.... because this place is cool!",1,1,1
138,Ben C.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,110,18,3.0,11/17/2008,"I came here last week for the 88 cent Evan WIlliams whiskey night. Needless to say, that was a great deal. And there are plenty of good things to be said for the place. The exposed brick walls are really nice, the koozies and coolers are reminiscent of college tailgating if you're into that, bartenders are friendly and fun to watch as they acrobatically juggle liquor bottles (""How much more do you think they make in tips for doing that?"" I asked my tactless friend. ""You're supposed to tip?"" she answered).The main downside is that it's just one small room. In a bar that attracts a lot of college kids and has a raucous vibe, it's nice to have a little extra space. Here, you're probably gonna get pushed around and stepped on...if whiskey makes you belligerent, watch out.",1,1,1

140,DH H.,"New York, NY",90,896,2,3.0,8/7/2008,"We were here for a few minutes, and it seemed oddly familiar.  It didn't look quite right, but we then realized it used to be some sort of egyptian or buddhist or something theme bar that wasn't very good then.  They removed all that stuff, added a buck hunter game, TVs with CMT playing, and canned beer.  It's still not particularly notable.",1,,
141,elisha C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,1.0,12/30/2010,"Double edge sword...Good environment, but if you order a cocktail the bar tenders will charge you for a double without you ordering one and then when the bill comes...you're screwed.  Doesn't seem fair to me.  Take whatever you think you bill is going to be and double it. Shady business.",1,,
142,Annie K.,"Boston, MA",99,385,12,3.0,2/2/2011,"Came here on a Saturday night with a bunch of my girl friends.  We're all mid-20's, so we were older than the general college crowd, but we had a great time.  The drinks were SO big and strong, we were all drunk in no time.  But that sadly meant that we did not get the picklebacks we had planned on trying.The DJ was a huge asshole, and I talk to the DJ's everywhere I go.  He played a lot of great music, but when it got later in the night and we really wanted to dance, he wasn't really picking it up and didn't know some more popular songs, even those that were popular in the 80's/90's.  Definitely more of a sing-a-long bar, but still fun.Much smaller than expected and they let way too many people in.  Also, no coat check, which is kind of annoying, but the bouncer watched our coats for us after one of our friends flirted with him.  Unisex bathrooms were great - made the wait so much shorter.  Thanks boys!",,,
143,Liz C.,"Elmhurst, NY",2,10,0,5.0,10/29/2010,"One of my favorite bars!whiskey shot + pickle juice chaser sounds weird, but it is actually really good. The pickle juice is like a palette cleanser (like ginger is to sushi) and once you down it, it feels like you didn't even take a shot of whiskey because there is no burning.The most chill bartenders are here. One time, my friends and I got a free round of beers.Music is always good. And when it's crowded on a Friday or Saturday night, everyone is dancing and having a great time. Sunday nights are quiet, my friend and I had the place to ourselves. Decided to try out the photobooth, which is a fun extra.Only con is that they only have beers in cans, but they put them in coozies so I guess that makes up for it.",1,,

This way, you and your friends have space to dance because no doubt, you'll want to!! The DJ plays eclectic music pulling out old favorites that you had forgotten about (i.e., Toto's Africa).  Not only was there dancing... there was singing!  Everyone I was with on Saturday had the best time.",,,

147,Johan F.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,10/3/2012,The bartender was useless. He just had eyes for the women at the bar and didn't pay attention to much else. The deal breaker was that he kept former girlfriends at the end of the bar and fed them with drinks and charged them for just a fraction of the full amount. Don't go there.,1,,
148,Kathleen Y.,"Astoria, NY",106,388,6,2.0,2/7/2009,"I know this is a whiskey place, but any bar that doesn't have at least one beer on tap is lame.  They also give you these foam can holders to go with your beer so you can feel more like an overweight suburbanite sitting in your La-Z boy recliner.Everyone there was older than me and I'd put the median age range around 32.  Probably won't be back.",,,
149,Bobby V.,"Manhattan, NY",2,35,0,1.0,8/14/2012,Extremely crowded in an extremely small place.  The music is really loud so it makes it tough to socialize.  The crowd is bizarre as it's a bunch of random groups from the area.  Went here twice to give it a second chance and it was a mistake.  Wouldn't even go here as a last resort.,1,,

153,Nic B.,"Miami Beach, FL",323,517,60,4.0,4/4/2009,"I'm always really happy when George Michael is playing in a dive bar and there's couch seating. It wasn't too crowded on a weeknight. What does that mean to me? I get to do impromptu dance-offs with grown white men. Because it's where I really shine (rhythmically speaking). There's also a B&W photo booth. Because, let's be honest, you can never have enough strips of your friends/random strangers taped to your mirror. And, finally, the bathrooms: there are 4 stalls with closed doors and a communal coed washing hands area. So, if you're talking to someone, you can watch them go into the bathroom and then stalk them by the hand washing area to make sure they publicly wash their hands. Not like that happened or anything. Sidenote: They have trivia there on Monday nights.",11,10,10

'nuff said.the meh points:1. this place is tiny!2. the waitresses like to push you aside when they deliver coolers/ drinks3. drinks can be a tad pricey for the east village. 10 dollar mixed drinks...not terrible, but not exactly a good deal either. their beers are pretty decently priced (and being canned, they all come with cozies) at around 5-6 dollars a pop, and their shot and beer combo wasnt too shabby either4. their specialty drinks weren't that good...the john daly, kentucky snakebite, irish car crash were just OKwould i go out of my way to come back? probably not, but i wouldn't be against it if some friends wanted to meet here again. oh, and 30 dollar tab minimum",,1,

163,Betty B.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,30,0,3.0,2/7/2012,"Went here in search for a quizzo night...or bar trivia for those of you not from Philadelphia. It can definitely be summarized as an a-typical dive bar but that being said, I thought it wasn't too bad. Initially it was dead but then more people started to show up and they had a decent turn out for the trivia which was really well done and a lot of fun. The drink specials are impressive but they have a poor beer selection. I know, I know, you are thinking well it's a whiskey place. Granted that's true but having good beer to back that up helps. Also in terms of the whiskey selection, they had some phenomenal bottles yet didn't have some of the best go to standards like Glenfiddich. Very surprised by that. The bartender was nice, the place was in good shape though it did smell of windex. This is another great place where you go to if you are looking for a good drunken night, not if you want to just sit and relax. I'd go here again for the trivia, and the hysterical beer cozies they give you with every beer. Got to love the small little details.",,,

Unfortunately being a Guinness fan and fan of craft beers, the fact that they only have cans is disappointing. Especially given the fact that I paid the same amount for a can of Guinness that I would for a draft in other places. They have a decent selection of whiskeys. They mixed a good G&T also. I think I need to revisit it on a less busy night when it is more relaxed.",1,,1

170,Brent B.,"New York, NY",46,59,0,4.0,12/8/2007,"My relationship with whiskey, specifically bourbon has been rather up and down lately. I've noticed that after I have more than 6 I'm more likely to fall down, and that is really counter productive when one considers the amount of time I spend on a bicycle. Whiskey Town has been there for me through thick and thin in moments of self discovery and recovery and for that I owe them a huge thanks. The two owners are very gracious and always seem happy to see me, no matter what level of intoxication I show up in. The selection of whiskey is good, not great and that cost them a star, but considering they are still fairly new and that I really only drink Jameson's and Maker's Mark it's really not that much of a problem. The space is about as bare bones as a dive bar can be without seeming to try to hard to be a dive bar, which means the restrooms are clean. In a neighborhood that's over saturated with bars that speaks volumes. The crowd on the weekends can be a bit unruly, but that pretty much can be said for any east village bar. Check this place out on a non-weekend night and you are almost guaranteed a good time and a hang over. If you see me sitting at the bar, feel free to buy me a drink and I promise to say thank you as prove my membership in the never leave a full glass on the bar club.",3,2,4

172,Ned R.,"Chicago, IL",94,20,0,3.0,12/3/2009,"I give this bar three stars, simply because it is a very sweaty, fairly dark, moderately smelly place.  I enjoy coming down here some nights because of the plentiful amount of women in the 6-8 range.  As Marshall H pointed out, it also is excellent for nutts to butts action.  Fairly fratty, once thought I saw Megan Cratty, and if your ever there before 11, try the chicken patty, you'll go straight batty, especially if you don't end the night bagging a fatty.",,,
173,Joe V.,"Canton, MI",50,415,2,3.0,5/10/2008,"I've only been here on the weekend. The staff is friendly and as attentive as they can be. I generally show up around 10:30/11 when I go. By 12, the place is usually ass-to-ass. Although the staff is nice and works hard, there simply aren't enough of them to handle the amount of people that jam into this place. The $6 cans of beer are a bit steep for an East Village side-street bar. If they let about 15 less people in this place on a busy night it would make it much more tolerable; it's just not big enough to handle the crowd that shows up. So...it gets docked two stars for the overpriced beers and the crowd-control factor. Other than that, this place is very cool. Good atmosphere and good crowd. If you have a party and reserve one of the couch areas, it can be a lot of fun. I suggest requesting the area by the door...that way you can go out to smoke (if you so choose), you're by the bathroom, and if the waitress is swamped you have easy access to the bar...well easier access anyway.",1,,
