0,Juliya G.,"Washington, DC",299,92,166,4.0,11/16/2018,"I can't believe I went to NYC to try The Smith when we have one right in our backyard in DC! Needless to say I'll be frequenting the DC location very soon.I had the pancakes and the mushroom omelette.  Both dishes were delicious! The pancakes were fluffy and fresh and the dollop of ricotta was a refreshing bonus.  The omelette was the perfect consistency and had a lot of flavor, but then again, I'm a sucker for anything truffle!For my drink I had a Bloody Mary.  It was a solid choice, but I do wish they had a few more garnishes to play with!",,,
1,Linda D.,"East Bronx, NY",75,264,1433,5.0,11/4/2018,"So, we've never eaten at this location. We've been to the one by Lincoln center! As as the one on the west side, the service was fantastic. Our waitress was Megan. She was supper attentive! The restaurant was quite busy.  We had some drinks, and ordered some small plates to share. We started with the spicy salmon tartare, that was on the crunchy rice!! We ordered the cauliflower flat bread. Then we went with the gnocchi with truffle! What a dish! We also ordered a side of the jalapeño cheese grits! Oh yes and our waitress sent us out a complimentary burrata, that had the most delicious tomatoes. I think they were roasted! We will definitely be back here! We like the area of this restaurant!",1,1,1
2,Danny O.,"Manhattan, NY",12,126,0,4.0,11/3/2018,"I was a bit skeptical going in - I tend to be skeptical of restaurants that don't specialize in a particular area, and instead try to cover lots of different areas.  The Smith did win me over, though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there.The menu is wide-ranging and covers many different kinds of cuisines.  I sampled a few different styles of cuisines to see what they could do.  I had the chicken parm as an entree, with the cheddar grits and mac+cheese as starters.The mac+cheese is served in a skillet, and it's very tasty.  I like how the edges get crispy.  The grits were surprising - most NYC establishments can't do authentic grits, but these were very solid and authentic.  Props for that.  And the chicken parm was very well made and tasty.  The chicken was cooked to its juicy, moist, best self.  My wife had a salad and also enjoyed her portions.  I'd recommend and will probably try to head back if I'm in the neighborhood.",,,1
3,Ian K.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",297,152,195,5.0,9/23/2018,"Mr. Smith goes to Washington was a great film, and The Smith is a dandy restaurant. Start to finish, things were top notch. I've be a plethora of times, and here is my story. Reservation was quick and painless like a trip to the dentist. Called and was granted access to the The Smith for a table of two for 7:30 without a hitch. Drinks/food:-Bread is eh. I don't go there for the bread, but it's nice to have. -Taquila soda was nice. Nothing crazy, just hit the spot. Our waitress was super detail oriented with this. -I got the Shrimp Scampi w/ Cheese Grits ($21) VERY good. Fresh shrimp and grits were fire. Snag this on a cold evening to warm up your soul. -Dessert was the Blueberry Cake. Again, very good. Can't go wrong with butter milk ice cream. Overall, I'll always love The Smith and you will too.",,,3
4,Akeela H.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,5,5,5.0,10/22/2018,"This was a GEM of a restaurant to find!   As we were preparing to go to the Met for our cousin's performance, we were famished and super short on time from all of our day touring of the city.  This place was the perfect spot, and we all left incredibly satisfied! It was a super busy Friday night crowd so we were happily impressed we were able to be quickly sat and taken care of by the staff.From my husband's Manhattan to my Moscow Mule to our sister's bottled Apple cider Ale, our drinks were delicious and wonderfully made. Each individual of our table was super impressed with his/her meal (1 pasta, 1 burgers, and 2 chicken pot pies ). All plates were empty and our tummies full of good food and vibes for the show ahead!",,,
5,Yordon D.,"London, United Kingdom",30,44,748,5.0,10/23/2018,"Yes!!! Anyone going to the smith is making an excellent choice, I walked passed their other location on 2nd avenue and the place was jam packed! I have either the best oysters of my life here, simply because they understand how to dress them up. Avocado on toast was very real and flavorful, all in all a wonderful experience!",1,1,1
6,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,3.0,5/24/2018,"Just Meh. We arrived for our 8:45 reservation on a Friday night and this place was packed. We were seated around 9:05 at a TINY four top table. Our first thought was that we picked badly because this place was so loud that we practically had to scream at each other to hear. Not the best place to eat if you care about conversation. Our waitress took forever to come over both for greeting and taking orders. Getting drinks took equally as long. The chairs and table were extremely uncomfortable and at a height where we couldn't even cross our legs to try and get comfier. At one point we spied a table nearby pop out the table extenders on their tiny four top into a bit of a bigger circular table so we did the same. We actually laughed when the waitress asked if we were getting any sides in addition to our $26 and up entrees because the table would be too tiny to even hold more than 4 plates. At that point I was thinking, ""if my $26 entree isn't enough food to fill me up without a side, i'm gonna be pissed."" Food arrived super slow which was no surprised based on the way things were already going. The Atlantic Haddock with brussel sprouts, butternut squash, bacon and dijon bureau blanc was a great dish. Flavorful and a mouth watering combo. The brussel sprouts however were undercooked and inedible. Luckily there were only 2 of them. Others in my party had the Salmon with almond mousse and truffle vinaigrette which was given 5 stars, and the skirt steak which was also very good. Overall due to the uncomfortable tables and chairs, noise level and very slow service I wouldn't rush back here.",2,,
7,Andrew C.,"Melville, NY",147,638,2320,4.0,5/3/2018,"This was my second time in this midtown east restaurant. The last time I had come with family and I found the restaurant very busy and loud. Today I was dropping by for a business lunch that turned into a short lunch meeting. The ambience is somewhat upscale with a modern décor flair and a young audience for the most part. It can be very noisy, so be prepared to talk loud to your guests and servers. My previous dining event the food we had was all very good which included fried chicken, salmon and large meatball. The only complaint I had was the Martini drinks were weak pours which was disappointing considering the price. Other than that, I still came back for lunch since I do like the food.",10,5,10
8,Melissa T.,"New York, NY",106,110,104,4.0,5/27/2018,"A newer addition to the Smith restaurants around the city-much smaller than my favorite in Flatiron. Casual yet classy ambiance and great food. It's always a great spot for brunch or dinner with some notable items. Gnocchi is to die for. Smaller portion, but it's rich enough to satisfy fully. Great steak, chickens dagger dinner fresh baked cookies.Slightly in the pricey side, but as usual-it's Manhattan..",1,,
9,Elisa G.,"Huntington, NY",348,306,1495,3.0,8/10/2018,Took the kids here for dinner because I was in the neighborhood. It was so noisy that I couldn't even hear anything. They need acoustics so the sound doesn't bounce off the low ceiling. The food was good but not amazing and I still can't hear myself think,2,2,2
10,Mary L.,"Longmont, CO",14,76,59,4.0,10/23/2018,"Had a wonderful brunch in a fun and relaxed environment. We have a diverse group with me ordering avocado toast, my daughter ordering French toast and the guys ordering steak and eggs. Every dish was fresh and delicious.  Did not have cocktails but will next time. Can't wait to return for lunch or dinner! We had reservations for 10:30am and did not need them. I bet it gets busy later.",,,
11,Erin D.,"Charlotte, NC",189,339,324,4.0,5/13/2018,"I'm a big fan of the Smith, and I love to have brunch here whenever I'm in the city. Make reservations in advance, as this place is popular and fills up quickly. They do have ample space to accommodate bigger groups - which I appreciate as we had 12 on our last visit here.The menu is large and offers you many sweet and savory brunch options. As an app, we like to order a French toast for the table to share. I ALWAYS order the avocado toast- huge portion of avocado atop crispy, delicious toast. My boyfriend loves the eggs benedict.Prices are reasonable, restaurant is beautifully decorated, and staff are great. My only complaint is they don't have sweet-n-low, which I think is a standard sweetener and it's all I like in my coffee.",1,,1
12,Taylor H.,"Norman, OK",439,2,2,4.0,8/12/2018,"Loved the aesthetic's of The Smith in East Village. Brunch was great- I had the Sicilian Baked Eggs and loved this unique combo of breakfast foods- it's baked eggs in an iron skillet with red tomato sauce and veggies. My friends had the eggs Benedict and the salmon toast-also highly recommended. Everything was delicious and high quality! The service was unbelievably kind and considerate. The only thing is that I am a big believer in dark, steaming drip coffee. The coffee was not my favorite (though I'll say I'm VERY picky about coffee and usually unimpressed with most places drip coffee). It was rather weak and not quite hot enough. All in all I love the Smith and will definitely be back!!",1,1,1
13,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3646,951,2085,5.0,7/23/2018,"This place just gets it especially for lunch. It is a big place but it fills up during lunch time. We ordered the shishito peppers which were pretty good. They had good pepper flavor without being spicy. The hummus also comes in an interesting presentation. They come with big crackers which is kind of awkward if you are sharing it.  The flavor was good though. The highlight of the meal was the burger. This is one of the top burgers in the area. It was juicy and the toppings really make it come together. They cooked it perfectly! The fries were thin, salty, crunchy, and delicious. The added benefit of coming here is service is awesome and the food comes out quick. They understand that most people dont have a ton of time on their lunch break.  The only critique is it is a little pricey for lunch. Overall, this place gets it.",17,2,12
14,Hugo F.,"Huntington Station, NY",75,74,1,2.0,10/21/2018,"The waiters were really nice. The food was not bad but not inspiring. Not for the price tag but of course, you're probably paying into the high rent of the location. I had the Smith burger and it had that quality beef that doesn't come too tightly packed in a patty which allows for juiciness. But no signature sauce or anything, pretty boring. I tried the Cavatelli pasta, which was good, but not wowing. And they don't give you Italian bread with it. A vicious crime to Italian dining lol They did offer a toasted bread upon request which sufficed. The place has a nice old NY decor about it and it attracts the local uppity drinking crowd, but it's spacious and not congested at all like most establishments in the area. But in this new age of artisan chef extraordinaires with exciting menus in underwhelming but quaint establishments, a grandiose pricey establishment with unremarkable food seems out of place in the village.",,,
15,Katie M.,"New York, NY",266,47,114,4.0,3/22/2018,"I have been to The Smith once before, about 2 years ago for my roommate's birthday. I decided to try it again as it was close by, and it just so happened to be Saint Patrick's Day and my boyfriend's birthday.I remember the first time being so-so, expensive, and nothing amazing. I suspect there are many other choices in a lower price range in this area, so The Smith isn't a must.. but we got a last minute reservation for two smack-dab in the middle. If you want a place to talk, this isn't it. I didn't really mind, it was actually quite entertaining to people-watch.Anyways, to start, we ordered the Mac and Cheese on a skillet. 5 tables around us had ordered this as well, and I noticed this throughout the night. It was pretty good, priced highly for mac and cheese but regardless of the price it was quite delicious!! Not too dry and decent portions.I ordered the Shrimp Scampi ($27) which I admit is a bit steep but I loved this dish. I wish there was more shrimp in this because they tasted so damn good but the portion was enough for me (Keep in mind I don't eat much, so if you want something more filling, maybe opt out). It was lemony, fresh, and buttery!! Comfort food all the way.My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Pot Pie Saturday special. He actually didn't like this one, mentioning that it was dry and nothing special. It wasn't thick or hearty, and even a bit watery. It was a thin crust rather than a deep dish pie. Based off the other Yelp reviews of this dish, many seemed to enjoy it, so perhaps this subpar one was because it was St. Patricks Day and they needed to rush their orders...For dessert, we ordered the Apple Pie and Ice Cream Sundae -- both really good, but of course. How could anyone screw up these two staples? It was a good dessert to end with and my experience with The Smith has been reawakened. I'd come back if I wanted a mid-high range priced American meal.",1,,
16,Shawnee E.,"Brooklyn, NY",106,67,49,4.0,9/9/2018,"This review is for the Mac and cheese. Try the Mac and cheese. It's one of the best, if not the best I've had so far in NYC. Hits all my personal marks - crunchy crust, white cheese, gooey inside but not too gooey. Sooooo good. The calamari is also pretty good. My cocktail was so watered down it wasn't even funny so that's why I can't give 5 stars but I'll be back for sure.",1,1,1
17,Christopher B.,"North Hollywood, CA",441,212,255,4.0,10/3/2018,"The Smith...Well listen. It's been awhile since I've posted. I've even lost my elite status , lol.But I must say I was very hesitant of this place. New York? Recommendation? Times Square? All bothered me.However, I must say... Again. The food here was top notch. I could tell the chef didn't just throw out a plate. These recipes were well thought out. Everything kind of worked together no matter what you ordered.I dare to say this chef was born poor. Only because her /his palet was exquisite. The muscles and soup of the muscles were done so well.The sea bass melted in your mouth. The gnocchi was so good I almost slapped myself. I think the pasta was made fresh.The fresh drinks made me want to add tequila. I'm happy with this place. Even better was the waiters and service. I admire happy people in service! I know how hard it can be especially in big cities. And this place was seemless service. Bravo!!!",,,

19,Emily D.,"New York, NY",40,189,340,4.0,12/18/2017,"I came here Friday night with 3 friends. We had a reservation for 8:15 and came a few minutes after that. They had to set up our table but it didn't take long. I would definitely recommend making a reservation as even though this place has two floors it fills up fast! We decided to order some drinks and then two appetizers. The Mac n cheese (obviously lol) and the calamari. I love Mac n cheese and the Smith always delivers on it. The calamari was pretty good too. We each ordered entrees: the Friday special scallops, the steak salad, the Smith burger and the branzino. The scallops were good and had a little kick to them. The smith burger was okay I didnt enjoy as much as the last time I had a burger there. For drinks I decided to get the cucumber loco which is like a margarita and very refreshing. It's one of my favorite drinks on there menu. Overall the Smith is a great place to grab some food and drinks. The price is a little steep. We spent about $200 in total for 4 people but you always have good food and great service.",1,,1
20,Dorothy Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,59,5.0,11/9/2018,"Friday lunch for 20 people. I was struggling to find a place that can fit that many people and kinda American cuisine while not being too expensive. Most places nearby are too small. I only called on Wednesday and was afraid they couldn't accommodate me. It ended up working out. They gave us the section in the back near the bathroom. That could fit like 25-30ppl so it was spacious for us, 2 tables of 10. I ordered the Smith burger and it was better than expected. The ""Smith sauce"" was something tart, reminds me of mustard but not the type I don't like. Bun was very soft so no struggle biting through whole thing.  Fries were plentiful but a bit overfried. They didn't give Heinz ketchup, it was something chunkier and more tart. I like it. We were given both sparkling and tap water on the table. Even the sparkling was free. I like how their bubbles are very small, you can't really see it so the bubbling is gentle in the mouth. Food came quick despite our large group. The rest of the restaurant was 70% full so pretty good for a weekday. Glad it wasn't packed so not loud I'm looking forward to try their other dishes, but I'm just really happy that my friends liked this place",,,
21,Joy S.,"New York, NY",31,93,238,4.0,12/19/2017,"No wait at 6pm because we called and made a reservation beforehand.Service was great tonight! Our waiter was really attentive and promptly served us our appetizers, entrees and desserts. We shared the mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, salmon tar tar, duck wings and oysters of the day. The mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and salmon tar tar were my favorites.For my entree I had the spaghetti and meatballs  and it was amazing! Would get it again. And I'd highly recommend the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.",1,,
22,Loni S.,"Merrick, NY",9,74,92,4.0,11/5/2017,"Went here yesterday for brunch for my fiancé's birthday. Had reservations for 12 people. We were seated promptly in the back and started to get waited on immediately my an awesome waiter. I wish I got his name. Bloody Mary's- delicious. Mimosas- great. The random pieces of bread that they put on the table in little plastic bags? Not necessary and tasted a bit stale. Seemed like an afterthought for the restaurant as a whole, but anyway. Most people ordered the avocado toast or the mushroom truffle toast with two over easy eggs (what I got). It was. Delicious. Served over a thick piece of ciabatta, melted fontina, with a side salad (not needed). It was amazing. I also got a side of home fries which was a very generous portion. They were also delicious! My sister got the salad with chicken which she said was great. Someone got the meatball sandwich which I believe was also good. Overall, the waitstaff was very friendly and super attentive (granted it was a table of 12 girls..I'd wait on us too! Hayyyyyy ) and the food was delicious and came out super speedy. I believe there's a room downstairs for parties which is pretty cool. Plenty of bathrooms as well. Downsides- wish we had a round table for the amount of people. It was also super noisy and warm in the back but I guess that comes with a popular crowded place.",2,1,
23,Kyle B.,"Tampa, FL",6,44,178,3.0,12/22/2017,"The Smith is an absolute must try for both locals and tourists alike. Be forewarned! weekends, like any other hip, happening spot; this place gets jam packed. Therefore, unless you make a reservation in advance, you may experience a longer wait time to be seated. I missed both of my reservations, the advanced one and the rescheduled one--pathetic; however, being that I was a party of one they were still able to accommodate me upon arrival by seating me at a communal table. Nothing like share your personal space with a group of perfect strangers who each have such interesting conversations going on to keep you entertained.The Belgian waffle itself wasn't my favorite; it was a bit too doughy for my taste. I think the blueberry compote and mascarpone that accompanied it were the stars of the dish. Contrarily, the skillet roasted macaroni and cheese was banging. Talk about creamy and cheesy. The dish by itself is enough to share. No lie. Sadly, I left my fifteen dollar, half eaten to go, which I was looking forward to eating later that evening at the restaurant. Didn't realize it until it was too late to turn around.Overall, I'd say The Smith is pretty good. Besides feeling overlooked by my waitress at first, which I will chalk to her being very busy and overwhelmed, the service was on par. The food came out in a timely manner. Didn't have to  wait long at all. I could definitely see myself returning when I'm in the city again. Besides, they owe me another Mac and Cheese, anyway.",,,

Updated review","The Smith is wildly over-priced for what is being served.  We came for lunch this time and two entrees and two drinks came to around $70 before tip. Why?!Well I did order a $20 short rib pasta dish. It was good, but was way better the next day for leftovers. Short rib was tender and perfectly fatty. And for the price they were generous with the meat, there was more meat then pasta. The burger game here slays me though.  Adding an egg costs $3. The burger comes with fries and any substitutions for the fries are also an extra  $3. Voila- a totally average $23 burger. Setting and service were all swell but I won't be returning.",1,1,1
25,Amy T.,"Ithaca, NY",49,27,5,5.0,4/29/2018,Look at that food? Would a sad person post those photos? Absolutely not! Because I am never sad (that's a lie I cried two days ago) but it is not a lie that I am never sad when I am here! I got excellent service and some amazing food! Fun fact check the lil peephole in the bathroom wall! There's a cute lol surprise that isn't sad either! I am a person that sometimes gets sad and listens to Whitney Houston  to feel emotions that I am scared to feel without her but I don't have to do that when I am here because this place is happy!,1,2,1

27,Candice T.,"Washington, DC",2,50,26,5.0,5/28/2018,"I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends going away party. I've been here before for brunch, but this is my first time for dinner. The drinks were really good. I got a few of the punches which were not too sweet and had just the right amount of alcohol.I ended up ordering the vegetable Bibimbop.I was a little reluctant to order this since this is an American restaurants; however, it well exceeded my expectations. The rice was cooked perfectly, and the vegetables were well seasoned. We had a lot of fun, and the service was really great. I would definitely recommend it for a group setting on the casual side.",,,
28,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,4.0,3/23/2018,"The Smith always delivers. If you want a classic New York restaurant that has more of an upscale vibe to it, this is your spot. Sure, it's filled with finance meatheads and UES basic white bitches, but it's a trendy place and that's what comes with the territory. Always make a reservation.Shishito peppers: big ones, but they were so overly salted. Just wanted to wash them with water. I say skip. Spicy salmon tartare: not spicy. But delicious! A funky and healthy appetizer to get your meal started. Salmon entree: cooked to perfection, on a plate of veggies. 6 oz, for those counting calories. Steak salad: not enough steak to be filling enough on its own as an entree. The 5 oz of steak were cooked so well though. Just expected a bit more for this price. I am such a sucker for goat cheese! Hot fudge sundae: was trying so hard to be healthy up til this point, but my company insisted on this. Loved the chocolate bar it came with, the chocolate sauce, the flourless chocolate cake (you can sense a theme, yes?), and the two delicious scoops of vanilla ice cream. Oh, how I love chocolate and vanilla together. Service is always impeccable at The Smith. This location is modern, posh, and just poppin'. They are run like a well-oiled machine, and it's a pleasure to experience every time.",5,7,6
29,Karli D.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",6,21,57,3.0,4/13/2018,"The Smith is a quintessential New York City brunch spot; good food, good drinks, long waits, and messed up orders. Sat down and got a Bloody Mary and a Bellini. The bloody was made with a good amount of horseradish so it had a kick. The Bellini was ""just peachy"" and refreshing. We originally ordered the The Johnny and received the eggs Benedict. I do have to admit - they immediately turned out a new dish for us. We also had the Sicilian, the sauce was a sweet and spicy marinara - highly recommend. The wait time was annoying but it was worth the wait. I would recommend for a group since it has big tables and large open spaces.",1,1,1
30,Devencie E.,"Chicago, IL",2,11,25,5.0,8/1/2018,"My wife and I love to eat! We're usually exploring and reviewing the thousands of restaurants in Chicago. But this weekend we decided to do New York! The atmosphere at this restaurant screams welcome to New York! Simply walking up or walking past this restaurant and one thinks yes, this is a great place. We shared the Mac + Cheese skillet starter. Honestly it's a bad choice if you plan to order more food. We could only put our forks down for maybe a minute at a time. It was that good. I work as a banquet manager for a luxury hotel downtown Chicago and my chef would be jealous at this Mac +Cheese. For my wife the Benedict Johnny: cheddar cornbread, maple chicken sausage, poached egg, roasted tomato hollandaise. Severed with home fries. She was indifferent about it. First she would embrace the caramelized onions in the potatoes, which was different. Then she would let the hollandaise marinade on her palate as if she were trying figure out what was missing in this dish. For the novelist, Breakfast Pot Pie: bacon, sausage, baby portobellos, cheddar biscuit top, and sunny side up eggs (I scrambled mine). I should have paid closer attention to the menu. I am not a fan mushrooms. But outside of my personal dislikes it's an extremely savory dish! We had a great time at The Smith! Pro tip ask to sit at the communal table to avoid the wait. Another pro tip, the restrooms are unisex and it's awesome. Until next time Mr. or Mrs. Smith",1,1,1
31,Jessica P.,"Bay Shore, NY",12,64,200,4.0,11/5/2017,"Came to the Smith yesterday to celebrate my sister and I's 28th birthday and it was wonderful! Let me also mention that it took me months to find a reservation for 12 ladies for brunch. It was harder to get this reservation than it was to get into college. I called at least 15 places- I worked my way down the map of Manhattan from the upper West Side down to the South Street Seaport- no one was biting. Anywho.. my sister and I had been to the Smith a few times prior and never were disappointed so when I called their East Village location and they said yes, so did I! Very accommodating. They had a nice size table toward the back of the restaurant for us. Only down side was that it was pretty toasty back there- borderline uncomfortable. But that all washed away with a round of drinks, an attentive waiter, and great company. Again, our waiter was great! He gave recommendations, indulged our barrage of questions related to the various ""toast"" options, and consistently refilled our coffees- always a good sign. We all ordered a few different things. All very happy with our meals. My sister and I shared the avocado toast and the truffle mushroom toast- a great choice on our part because it really gave us a little bit of each. Of course with a side of bacon. Food was delicious. Sure, there are plenty of amazing, chic, and trendy brunch spots in Manhattan to choose from- but if you can't get in with the ones who mean most, who cares? The Smith is a consistent classic that never disappoints. Thanks for a great birthday!",,,1
32,Patrick N.,"New York, NY",301,235,785,4.0,4/7/2018,We came here for a late dinner after watching a screening at Lincoln 13. This place was packed at 8:30pm on a Thursday. The space is fairly large but they tried to pack as many tables as they can. The food:- short rib cavatelli: perfectly done. The short ribs had a right amount of fat. The sauce wasn't too heavy and the pasta was Al dente. - mushroom pasta: a bit salty. Overall solid dish with a lot of complexity. Tldr; we only tried the pasta but will definitely try other dishes if I am in the area again,1,,2

Loved the vibe and the food was great and perfect for brunch!",,,

Updated review","Still a great place to bulk up on some hearty carbohydrates (winter is coming, folks)! I've moved further away since my last review and have since then resorted to delivery. It's actually one of the few restaurants where delivery is just as good as eating in-store.Standouts: chips with hot blue cheese (seriously, I live and die by these), mac n' cheese (insider food made this thing famous), ricotta gnocchi, fries, anything on the brunch menuPass on: burger, calamari (soggy), any of the steak / chicken / salmon plates (just not worth the price)There's an $18 delivery minimum and I think it goes to show how obsessed I am with this place considering I'll still order at least 3 times a week!",,,
36,Angela S.,"Miami, FL",52,105,123,5.0,3/13/2018,"This was the best brunch we've had in a while! The food was cooked fresh to order and was sizzling as it was placed before us on the table. Service was also quite quick which made our experience quite delightful as we wanted to get out and explore the City. We started with their monkey bread - totally delicious. Wished the portion was a bit larger though. Had to fight off my kids with my fork!  We then ordered other dishes such as the vanilla bean French toast, baked eggs, and eggs Benedict. Their cappuccino is to die for as well!",1,,1
37,Mendel F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",132,75,78,4.0,2/14/2018,"The Smith is a solid option. This is one of my spots when I'm not feeling adventurous but want a better than average meal.I've only ever had good experiences here. The food is consistently tasty and fresh. The menu does however change from location to location. I've had the chicken pot pie, mussels, steaks, and their burgers, can't go wrong with anything here.The servers could prob be a little more helpful with suggestions and more attentive for when we wanted to order more, or just refills. This is definitely a place to come on a date, with family, or just looking for a bite in a slightly upscale eatery.Downside is that it is a bit pricey; entrees range from 25-50ish, and if you get drinks and an app it can easily be 60 a person. That being said, it's really very decent food and always a good experience.",3,,
38,Nikolina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,130,179,4.0,3/10/2018,"Went here for brunch with my friend. It was around 12pm on Saturday and no free table! But we reserved one and got seated right away. So the place in general looks cozy, they have main and ground floor with the bar and restrooms. They also have cool photo machine where you get 6 pictures for $5 ( I personally very sentimental about that one and usually get pictures :)).The staff is very helpful and friendly, we got 2 complementary bottles of water and a smile from waitress. So I ordered The Smith egg Benedict which was really good! The sauce was little salty for me, but meal in general was great! My friend ordered mushroom omelette which looked really good too. The portions are big, so you dont need to get appetizers because you ll be so full after. I really liked my experience and would love to try different locations!",1,,

The mussels were so amazing; I ended up drinking the broth like a soup at the end. We also split the burger which was SO SO good with amazing beef, a delicious special sauce, onions, and lettuce with some great bread. There were a lot of fries that came with the order but we couldn't be bothered because the rest of the dishes were so great. The calamari was good but had a sauce on top of it so it got a little soggy. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!!!!",,,

For the record, I loved my Benedict Johnny and my friend enjoyed her breakfast pot pie, though she really would've rather taken mine over hers after one bite of my delicious home fries. We agree my dish was incredibly flavorful and the roasted tomato hollandaise was perfect, for both the eggs and fries. The chicken sausage and the cornbread just catapulted this BJ outta this world! The pot pie, which is no small potato, is toothsome and tickled our taste buds, too. The dough was decadent and remained as fluffy as a pot pie can. These were excellent choices, and I encourage you to order the same when you stop by!Now, you may wonder if I have been raving since ""aw yeaaaah"" then why not the full 5 stars. Well, the only reason why is because my drink didn't live up to blow me away like my BJ (hehe) did. Between the Bloody Mary and Gatsby 2, go with the BM, you won't regret it.",1,1,
41,Claire M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,2,4.0,9/4/2018,"Kinda pricey but worth it if you want a flavorful american-style treat! We got the vanilla bean french toast and breakfast pot pie (i recommend the french toast, the pot pie was kinda weird for breakfast but still tasted good!). It took a little long for the food to come but they refill your water really fast and serve you bread and butter while you wait!

In addition to the heavenly mac & cheese, we also got their burger ($18) which came with bacon in it as well as their mussels. Both entrees came with fries. By the end we were so full we had no room for dessert, but our waitress recommended the strawberry shortcake. Speaking of our waitress, she was so sweet! The entire staff was very attentive and brought everything out relatively quickly. We were worried about getting a table since we didn't have reservations, but they seated us immediately.

DON'T: get the salmon, bland and nothing special, MUST: Concord Grape Soda (BEST GRAPE SODA HANDS DOWN) They actually make this soda lol  MUST: hot potato chips(Not overhyped at all) Totally worth spending $8 the portion is large but it's enough for at least 3 people.",1,,

My BLT plus E, bacon was way too crispy, to the point where it was close to burnt. The mac cheese is overpowering, great for photos , however the bitter cheese is very overwhelming. One thing I actually did like was the hot chips blue cheese fondue, but be careful eat to many and you might feel nauseous like I did.

The bread itself has that salty, eggy flavor and the banana compote on top is the right amount of sweet. I, personally, didn't add any syrup because I felt the compote gave it enough of a sweet flavor; however, if you have a sweet tooth, I'm sure if you added some syrup it would be delicious. The eggs benedict we got substituted with chicken sausage. It was nice they were able to accommodate this change. The english muffins on the benedict were very fluffy! Yum!",,,

Have also had the Hungry Teacher, which is their Old Fashioned. We had the Hot Potato Chips and were very happy. Delicious, crispy and fresh chips with plenty of cheesy goodness on top. :) The couple next to us was closing out their bar tab and moving to a table, but took the time to ask if it was worth ordering, since it looked so nommy.

A bit on the expensive side at $30 a roll, but nonetheless, it is delicious.If you want to play it safe, you really can't go wrong with brunch at The Smith.

That night, I was way too anxious to eat but I had a few bites of the tomato soup and it was good.Fast forward to 2017, we finally got to fully enjoy a meal here. To start, we got an order of their mac & cheese which they are apparently known for and the waitress recommended it. We also go an order of the zucchini burrata flatbread because, hello, burrata. Both were equally good but the flatbread didn't make us hate ourselves when we were done eating it so if heavy isn't your thing, skip the mac.He ordered the Bar steak and I got the ricotta gnocchi with truffle cream sauce. My husband enjoyed his steak and I loved my dish. It can come in either an appetizer size ($14) or entree size ($19). I opted for the bigger one- go big or go home! It was super filling so i wrapped it up with our leftover mac and cheese so I could hate myself all over again when I heated up the next day.They have a photobooth downstairs, next to the bathroom, which is where we got engaged back in 2015. Sadly, it was broken when we went back but we just used our phone to have a fake photobooth session. 6 photos for $5 & it accepts card as well as cash.Our waitress was attentive and super knowledgable.We went on a Tuesday and there was a decent size crowd so I would recommend making reservations if dining during peak days/times.",,,1

We made a reservation for 9pm on a Sunday and when we walked in the dining room was still relatively busy. Our waitress was awesome! So personable and friendly and helpful. We ordered drinks- a few of us got the Hungry Teacher and another got the Mule. The drinks were $14 a piece which is standard for Manhattan. We got the hot chips as an appetizer while we perused the menu. Those are easily the best chips I've ever eaten-covered in delicious bleu cheese. I ordered the Mac and cheese that I had seen so many photos off. My friends ordered the house steak and the mussels, both of which were served with fries. Everything was absolutely amazing.

Updated review","I was really disappointed on a recent trip to The Smith for lunch. A colleague and I decided to go out for a nice lunch one Friday after a big promotion but were very underwhelmed by the food. I ordered the chicken paillard and a side of brussels sprouts, and both were not good. The chicken was very tough and chewy and I didn't end up eating much of it, and the brussels sprouts had almost no taste. I was excited to celebrate here as I've had a good experience at The Smith in the past, but this lunch changed my impression. With so many great places nearby, there isn't any reason to have a below-average meal.",2,3,2

On to the food!  I wanted to try a housemate soda so I got the Shirley Temple.  It was good but not over the top in anyway.  I'm just going to say this now, do yourself a favor and get the HOT Potato Chips.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese but these very absolutely addictive.  I could not stop eating them!  As for a main course, I got the Vanilla Bean French Toast because I saw it came with super thick bread!  It did come out thick but it wasn't anything that would make me want to come back and I only ate about half.  I did end up eating half of someone else's Burger Supreme.  It was good but had a slightly odd/different taste to it.  The raclette cheese wasn't melty like real raclette and once it settled on the burger was not the best.  The fries were skinny and hot, lovely! And the peppercorn sauce wasn't bad either.  And of course, can't survive without dessert.  A group of us all tried the Birthday Cake (comes with a lit candle!) and the sticky toffee pudding.  The cake wasn't half bad and not overly sweet.  The sticky toffee pudding was addictively good though!!!",,,

81,East V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,0,1.0,8/17/2018,"The food is just okay, not great, and quite overpriced. If you live in the East Village and want to pay these kinds of prices, I promise you have better options. You've got Hearth, which is quite nice, and you've got The Copper Still, which is a bit lower-key and the food is so much better. The one thing I DO really like about this restaurant, which has kept me coming back and back, is that instead of asking you what kind of water you would like (which is an invitation to order bottled water), they preemptively bring you filtered water, both sparkling and still. That is a wonderful environmentally responsible thing to do! I have eaten here probably 50 times for that reason alone. (Also, it's a half a block away from my apartment.)All of which leads me to the reason I won't patronize anymore and the reason I would give them such a low rating, in addition to the fact that I think their food is woefully overpriced.  That is, in the dead of summer, on a 95 degree day, they not only have their AC cranking, but they have every window open, and their windows are floor-to-ceiling. So essentially they are air conditioning the sidewalk so that the planet may burn and with it NYC. That really sucks and furthermore is quite frowned upon by the city. So -- that's the end of me and The Smith.",,,

The Smith is really expensive. Im still debating if it was worth the cost. I thought the food was delicious...but maybe not for the high price tag. 3 meals, and 3 appetizers ran upward of $200.  Eh.",,1,

84,Amana C.,"DE, DE",137,423,927,3.0,11/27/2016,"The Smith is such popular restaurant in NYC, one that everyone will suggest you visit.  I was never able to go when I lived in NYC mostly because you have to wait so long to be seated, so I was glad that I was able to check it out this week since the city wasn't crowded for the holiday week.I was very disappointed when I went for brunch this week.  A few of us ordered the rancheros, husband ordered the egg white omelette, someone got an avocado toast. The consensus was that all of the foods were underwhelming in flavor.  On the menu, the description of the food leaves you anticipating all of the flavor that is to come, but doesn't deliver when the food actually arrives.I will say that service was amazing, and the reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2.",2,1,2

87,Sara R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",49,27,222,5.0,9/15/2017,"The Smith is always a solid choice for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Typically I go for their raw bar. They regularly offer Contuit Bay, and Moose cove oysters, along with an oyster of the day. I go for the Moose cove just because I prefer more delicate oysters, and these have a sweet initial taste that pairs well with their sauces. The Contuit Bay are a little meatier with more brine. All oysters are served with horseradish, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, and mignonette. The Smith is a great to share a few appetizers as well. The sesame hummus with spiced, thinly cut chips always pleases. The eggplant rings with harissa aioli and fresh potato chips smothered in blue cheese are also some show stoppers. For entrees I'd go for the pork chop, salmon or burger. I've tried the cod with ratatouille, and it honestly lacked some flavor and the cod texture felt a little chewy. Definitely stay for dessert and try the smores in a jar!",,,

After no doubt assessing us for sobriety, they said they could put us up...in the downstairs room. Which turned out to be spacious and empty and a place to call our own. So points for putting up with our baker's dozen of dumbness. Also points for tasty fries and delicious drinks like Mountain Valley Sour (green tea vodka, apricot, egg white, mint, elderflower) and Cucumber Loco (silver tequila, cucumber, lime).",3,3,3
92,Fiona L.,"Loir-et-Cher, France",579,62,10,5.0,1/18/2018,"I'm a fan of The Smith, and I've been to their LES and UWS locations.The Smith is a reliable place to get brunch or lunch or dinner, because they're opened late. Brunch menu ends at 3pm, and dinner menu is prompt. They offer week day brunch, or at least on major holidays that fall on a weekday. There is usually a wait, so plan accordingly or make a reservation. On MLK day, a table for 2 had a wait for 20 minutes at 2pm. I experienced a wait only in the LES location, because I think the UWS location is a little bit bigger.The burger is excellent, and comes with a very very generous portion of french fries. You can get away with sharing the fries, or can sub the fries for a house salad instead.The salad is a little pricier than a salad at Chop't, but not by much, and is enormous. It will definitely fill you up. Ask for the dressing on the side, as the salad is romaine based.My sister had the eggs benedict, which was a standard eggs benny. The hollandaise wasn't as hot as I prefer, but my sister says it was delicious and she'd recommend.",,,

96,Saloni C.,"Manhattan, NY",343,55,30,4.0,12/16/2016,"The Smith is a solid spot for good ol' American brunch. If you're in the mood for something sweet, both the waffles and the Vanilla Bean French Toast are amazing dishes to go for. If you're in the mood for something savory, however, I highly recommend the Sicilian Baked Eggs. The sauce has a little bit of a kick to it and it literally feels like I'm eating a pizza for breakfast - but without any of the guilt. Brunch entrees also come with a free juice or cocktail, which is a pretty good perk!The only downside to this place is that it is super packed on weekends. Reservations are a must, and even then, expect to wait a little before you get seated. This is not the best place to catch up with in old friend, as it can get pretty loud and is hard to make conversation if you're seated inside.",,,
97,Chad V.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",32,104,255,4.0,11/12/2017,High throughput brunch spot. Excellent food across the board. Downside is brunch will be crowded and high decibel noise level that comes with it.,1,,

Mac & cheese was too. Fries were to die for. The only thing I didn't like was, you guys didn't have these 2 specific cognac beverages I preferred.

I noticed this and told the waiter who said they would re-place my omelette and the manager soon came over and apologized. My girlfriend then had to eat her waffle alone... When the bill came my omelette was NOT taken off the bill and I had to ask to get it removed. TERRIBLE customer service.

For those who show up without a reservation, expect a wait of about 30 minutes to an hour during busier hours (aka brunch on weekends and dinner on weekends). The restaurant itself is pretty casual with a trendy vibe. The wait staff is friendly and attentive, even during busier hours so I appreciate that. The food here can be a hit or miss. I had the pork entrée with grits and that was absolutely delicious while my friend had the black pasta dish and that was flavorless and gooey. The mac & cheese was pretty hearty, but the salmon salad was lackluster. I'm thinking of returning here one day for brunch since that is what they are better known for.",1,,1

104,Alexa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,67,0,4.0,10/20/2017,"Stopped in unexpectedly last evening. We didn't have a reservation but were greeted and seated promptly.I think I've been drinking and dining too much lately in Brooklyn--too many times now I've been served by bartenders and wait staff where they act as if it's summer break and their parents told them they had to get a job. I'm an outgoing person and I fully appreciate people in the hospitality and food industry who take pride and delight in what they are doing and who want to engage their customers in discussions about their work.To wit: I once asked a bartender in Ditmas Park what kind of a drink he felt like making me. The appelachain bearded douche bag replied with ""Nothing."" On 3rd Ave in Gowanus I celebrated my 2nd wedding anniversary by having dinner at a restaurant that was owned by the same folks who owned another restaurant a few doors down where we hosted our wedding reception. We told the waitress this, and she seemed bored and stoned. Zero personality. It would have been nice had she:a) wished us a happy anniversaryb) thanked us for choosing to celebrate our anniversary at their other locationc) perhaps bought us a drink in celebration thereofThis girl wasn't connecting any of those dots; I'm not even sure if she was breathing. The experience overall was: blech. I'm nothing this is a trend in Brooklyn only, not in Queens or Manhattan.At The Smith the entire staff couldn't have been a nicer -- from the busboy, to our waitress, to another waitress who saw that we had finished something and took away our plates (rather than pass it by cause it 'wasn't her table') all the way to the exiting of the restaurant where they thanked us for dining with them. I engaged our waitress and she actually had conversation with us; about the food, what her recommendations were, etc. I happened to mention that it was my birthday and they brought out our dessert order with a lighted candle. Having ordered too much, they gave us a doggy bag with the unfinished portion of cake and on the box they hand wrote ""Have a great birthday!""The food was delicious, which was an added plus.",1,,
105,Alma W.,"New York, NY",296,95,129,4.0,6/25/2017,"I'm smitten with The Smith's brunch. A menu has never so perfectly captured the foods I love to eat and combined it a solid execution. My Saturday brunch (~11:30am) started with a pleasantly not too busy restaurant and I was able to easily move up my noon reservation. I had a peach Bellini and the Sicilian Baked Eggs and my friend had the Huevos Rancheros (sad, no bottomless brunch option). Everything was quite substantial portion-wise and tasted as described. The Peach Bellini was sort of underwhelming, i.e. it tasted like just prosecco and not much fruit.  Nothing blew me away, however, which keeps me from giving a 5 star review. My friends eggs were kind of just a blob of scrambled eggs; tasty, but no stunner. My baked eggs could have been a bit yolkier for my taste, but the bread that came with it was so good. I'm craving the whole dish right now as I right this review. Highly recommend. The atmosphere is pleasant and not too loud. The Smith delivers when it comes to making a solid impression in all the minor details. There's both flat and sparkling tap water. Our waitress came at all the right times. Our food arrived fairly quickly after ordering. While tables were a bit tight I never felt like I was forced onto another group.For this price point the atmosphere is excellent and the food solid, but you could probably find better in the area. On one hand I'm likely to return for a safe and reliable brunch option, but on the other hand know that you're not missing out on too much if you never try The Smith.",,,

108,Fiona P.,"Old Tappan, NJ",191,12,1,3.0,6/27/2018,"Went here for dinner with my cousin. I can't say anything about their lunch or brunch which I read is very good. I had the spicy salmon tartare, and a caesar salad. The ""spicy"" tartare was okay, the fish was fresh and the avocado was good, it wasn't anything special and it is one of my pet-peeves when something on the menu is labeled spicy and it is not one bit spicy. I don't need my nose running but it was so not spicy I would be surprised if you told me they used black pepper to prepare it. The caesar salad was a caesar salad, I got exactly what i expected when I ordered it. The drinks we ordered were very good, I thoroughly enjoyed my cocktail, and everything was reasonably priced.",,,
109,Brandon H.,"Manhattan, NY",665,11,33,5.0,8/1/2017,"This useful review is for the five stars that this place deserves simply for the fact that everything was well executed - from the food, to the service, the aura, the crowd, and the scenery.I came here the other night looking for a good meal and accidentally stumbled across this place. The crowd was amazing, everyone eating was so kind. When a vibe to a restaurant attracts positive customers, then something must be right.Although a little noisy, the open space allowed for intimate conversations. The waitress connected to us and built a decent/sometimes humorous conversation that wasn't overbearing. She checked in at the right times and was fast to serve us.When it came to the food, everything was done right. My salmon was paired with the right white wine, and the dessert was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I recommend this place most highly for a friend, a family member, a lover, or someone you just swiped right to, ha! Above average prices, but TOTALLY worth it. Enjoy!",,,

It was hotter than outside. We asked to be changed and told no, since it was all the same. Mid dinner we realized that the a/c was not working, but just in the back.

114,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,3.0,9/24/2016,"This place is pretty overrated in my opinion and is super popular among a young crowd. You should always try to make a reservation especially on a weekend. I've been here twice for dinner and brunch. The most recent time was for brunch. We shared the Mac and cheese, which is famous for being the cheesiest. It is really good and definitely really cheesy but not the best I've ever had. I also got the breakfast pot pie, which is pretty good. It has sunny side up eggs over a potato baked thing with bacon and sausage inside. Other friends I was with got the same thing or the Sicilian baked eggs. Overall the food is fine but overpriced in my opinion. I also got the passion punch brunch cocktail, which was good and decently strong but also pretty expensive. It just seems like an overall casual place, so I wish the prices were cheaper, but they're still remaining popular. Not somewhere I'd personally choose to go to but am not opposed to going to when another person suggests it.",,,
115,Sami M.,"Castleton-on-Hudson, NY",127,48,67,3.0,1/20/2018,"Had lunch here with my mom on a Sunday around 3pm with no wait. It's noisy and loud inside, with little personal space, so it doesn't feel very intimate at all. We were a little uncomfortable with how close we were seated to other parties and how hard it was to have a conversation amongst the noise. We came because there's a lot of hype around the Smith right now, and the food was good, but not totally worth the price tag. Service was great, and it's perfect for a luxurious brunch. I certainly wouldn't pay to come back here all the time, but it was a good meal nevertheless.",,,

Their brunch special goes until 4pm - free brunch cocktail or juice if you order any brunch entrees. They can also make any of the cocktails sans liquor as well so it's kid-friendly.My must-have at the moment is definitely the Mac and Cheese. It's so incredibly delicious and a big portion too. We got it as a side and couldn't finish it between the two of us and our entrees. As for the cocktails, I definitely recommend the Passion Punch if you like passion fruit and mojito - it's the perfect mix of the two.",,,
117,Arielle Lana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",311,101,186,5.0,6/6/2016,"I'm always in eating in east village, no matter what time of day and the smith is probably my favorite brunch spot.I've been here around three times and i always get the steak and eggs. Steak is a very small portion, but comes in this Mac and Cheese patty that's pretty much to die for. A little on the pricey side ($22) for the portion.Tried the breakfast pot pie and banana french toast the last time i was here too - SO GOOD. Will definitely order one of these next time. You get a free drink with brunch too! And the drinks are around $11-$14 so it's worth it.Another time I came here, they cooked my steak well done instead of medium rare, and while I was waiting for a new steak, they gave me grilled Brussel sprouts that were actually delicious. Great service every time! I always bring friends here. It's best to make a reservation through open table first though, to skip the wait.",2,,
118,Al T.,"Hartford, CT",1,56,3,2.0,11/27/2017,"I have gone in the past many times for dinner at The  Smith. Food and service has always been excellent. Until tonight. A manager took my order because my table had no assigned server. Why was I seated at this table or better yet, assign someone to do the job?  I had to ask someone for bread which came as a stale piece of bread. Food was tasty (oysters as a starter and cod). I use a walker, therefore need to use the handicapped bathroom. Although staff knew I was in that location, upon exiting the area I find the partition had been closed. Not easy an easy task to push open a sliding glass wall while manipulating a walker. I had to bite my tongue when asked if I wanted dessert and/or coffee. All I wanted to say ""Get me out of here"". Things can go wrong but correct them. Don't just ignore them. Should I return for dinner in the future? If I do and get this same service, I shall walk right out.",,,

My first visit to The Smith at this location was less than stellar. While the place was mostly empty the service was mediocre at best. One of my co-workers noticed a dirty glass as soon as she sat down. I on the other hand only noticed the lipstick on my glass after I drank from it - I noticed the texture - yuck! They missed part of my order as well. Manager came by and apologized. Everyone has an off day, so I held off posting a review. Went back today for a business lunch. We had reservations and arrived on time. Still had to wait for them to turn over a table (even though there were other tables open?). Ok, no biggie. The service was slow. It took forever to order, but the waiter that took our order was very nice. It was slow coming out. I asked for no bacon on my burger, which was of course put in on top of the meat and between the two patties. It was already so late I just pulled it out instead of sending it back.

With a side of perfectly roasted brussel sprouts. The goat cheese cheesecake with a raspberry sorbet as interesting as it was mouthwatering!!!!! With a shot of espresso and bailey's on the side?! YES! I also liked that at the bar, they have hooks to hang up your purse you that you're not uncomfortable while enjoying your drink(s). They have a large variety of drinks and that bartenders definitely took care of us. We requested berries in our prosecco, having none at the bar was no set back for them, they still made it a point to find us some berries in the kitchen.

Ambience is for sure downtown chic and lifestyle blogger-eqsque with the dark wood finishes and white and black tiled floor. Our crew was the least-trendy people there, but the staff was still extremely nice and accommodating to us. WHAT I / WE GOT: - Brussels Sprouts: Sweet n Spicy n Crunchy. A must have for sprouts lovers like me! Plenty to share - Chips + Blue Cheese: super, way a lot, coma-inducing carb central that is so dangerous I had to have it moved away from me. If you like blue cheese, you'll LOVE THIS. - Avo Toast: HUGE portion. Two slices of bread (excellent crisp on the crust), healthy slab of avo on both, and 2 poached eggs!

The prices are not too bad for brunch and the food is 100% worth every penny!

Recommendations are the mac & cheese + Brussel sprouts to start, STEAK & EGGS (top 5 brunch dishes I've ever had in my life) the chimichurri is what made the dish phenomenal in my opinion.

A small portion of home fries for $6! Every brunch menu is priced in mid to high teens. I felt guilty for myself for wasting my precious money for what is not worth the money... Never again.",1,3,2

Updated review",This is my second time coming to this location (5/13/17) but I've been to The Smith 3 times in total. My boyfriend and I love this place so much. This time we came here for breakfast and the food never fails! I actually really wanted to get the pancakes but since my boyfriend wanted to get that as well I decided to order the ranchero scramble and it was delish. I should've added some lemon to have some acidity to it but that's okay! It was still great. We also ordered the potato chips with blue cheese and my boyfriend loved it so much since he's obsessed with cheese Our waitress Sarah was very attentive and lovely. She kept checking on us and another waiter came over to see if we were fine. She gave our check as soon as our food was taken away but told us there's no rush which was great because we both needed some time to drink some water since we were both so full. Also when I was signing my name I noticed the pen has The Smith logo on it and when we were leaving I made my boyfriend ask if we can keep the pen and she said yes and gave another one to me hahah so sweet. We will always come here when we're in the city!,,,
134,Marg M.,"Hazleton, PA",11,31,43,4.0,1/18/2018,"Hi Yelp Fam! Over the weekend my gal pal Brenda and I took a trip to the Big Apple to see the sights, eat some food, and stay relevant with current youth culture. Her niece goes to a fancy liberal design school in the East Village so we went to visit her. She showed us small gals around the Big City... but you know ol Margie... too much walking around and her big ol tummy starts to grumble and she gets a little hungry. Thankfully, we were with a True New Yorker (LOL) and asked her niece where a good place for some grub was. Wow! She suggested we go to this fancy place... the Smith. Now I may be old, but the only smith i know is Morrissey so I said sure why the heck not. Love to be adventurous and spice it up every once in a while. The place has some real fancy ambience if i do say so myself.. Has a classic feel. We sat down and immediately a young gal came up to us with two fancy shmancy bottles of water. ONE WAS SPARKLING! I was wowed to say the least. What a spiffy joint. The menu had alot of interesting foods fo choose from, some classics and some hippy dippy city type foods as well. However, the food was quite EXPENSIVE. That's what you get for the Big, Rotten, Apple i guess. Anyway, Brenda and I are coupon queens so we know how to get a good deal. We decided to split a mac and cheese and a side of fries (Brenda's niece suggested the mac and cheese and boy oh boy.... was it CHEESY! Yum!) Our waitress must have taken at least 20 minutes to even show up, she was cute but awfully unfriendly and rarely checked on us. Other than the god awful city service we received, my oh my was the food YUMMY !! The mac and cheese so creamy so cheesy I was DEFINITELY running to the bathroom afterwards and THAT is how you know it's cheesy enough. The fries were fresh cut, and even though Brenda doesn't typically like anything other than the fries at the Capitalist pigs of McDonalds, she thought these were just delicious! Although it was quite expensive, you do get what you pay for. Except for the nasty waitress Jenny I hope you read this. Love yall! Have a great day!",1,1,1
135,Natalie F.,"New York, NY",3,29,8,3.0,12/10/2017,"This review is for take-out only. We showed up around 6:00-7:00 on a Sunday evening, ordered a burger, a salad, and two mac and cheeses. We were told someone had to wait inside for the 30-45 minutes it would take to prepare the meal, which didn't seem to bad, since it was Sunday and decently busy. What's weird right off the bat is you have to order from the bartender, there's no separate station for ordering take out and it's not even at the front counter. It's just kind of strange to make the bartender do this as well as tend bar, but if it works, it works. Only problem: it didn't.After almost an hour of waiting, we inquired where our food was. They apologized and went back to check on the food. Another twenty minutes later, we finally received our food. All they did was apologize after we stood in the front part of the restaurant for over an hour waiting, unable to leave. I think that they forgot to put the order in, since when we received it, it was still hot, and they had gone back to ""check in on it"". Once we got the food, it was all really good. The portion for the salad was incredibly small though for it being eighteen dollars, we think they might have given us the wrong size since there are two different sizes on the menu. Food's good, but don't rely on take out or delivery at all.",,,

139,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1212,6223,5.0,12/12/2016,"I'm a fan of this ever expanding trendy brunch spot. It does all of the little things right... and some big ones too. Specifically the bloody's and the Burger Royale (double beef patty, local American cheese, apple smoked bacon, house pickles, red onion, 50/50 sauce, sesame bun, fries). Ohhhh that burger royale. It might be my favorite burger at the moment. There's a lot going on, but it doesn't overwhelm and each bite has a lil' something extra in it. Kudos for it being topped well, served with fries, and ringing in at $17 ($20+ burgers is a pet peeve of mine). Sure, you can brunch at a dozen spots in the area (and some will even keep your drink filled for 90 minutes), but if you want to hit a more refined (trendy) brunch/lunch spot, The Smith is for you. You won't be disappointed. Protip: order the avocado toast or pancakes and share them with the tablePro-ertip: order the above and don't share them with the table Pro-esttip: it's usually crowded, so sit at the bar",21,7,16
140,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,2/10/2017,"I went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a weeknight. The place was pretty crowded, but we were able to find a seat right away.To start off the meal, we decided to split orders of the shishito peppers and beer-battered string beans. The shishito peppers were good and were a decently-sized portion. The beer-battered string beans were even better and were complimented nicely by the dill dip they were served with.For my main meal, I decided to go with the salmon and swapped out the bok choy for Brussels sprouts. The salmon was cooked well and was a good size. The rice, squash, beans, Brussels sprouts, and ginger butter hash that it came with was very tasty as well--though it was a touch on the salty side. Nevertheless, the dish was quite enjoyable and filling.Overall, they served up some great food here and the atmosphere was very lively. In addition, the food came out quickly and the service was friendly. It is a little on the expensive side, but not a bad place to check out in the neighborhood.",,,
141,Chantel H.,"Brooklyn, NY",407,169,122,4.0,6/9/2017,"I came here on my birthday because someone referred this place. I like trying out new restaurants so I gave it a shot. Pros:1) It was family friendly. My party consisted of a 5 month old (who cried for a portion of the dinner), a 7 years old (who talks nonstop) and two adults. I was waiting for someone to scream ""would you shut that baby up!"" but luckily (for them) it never happened. 2) The shrimp cocktail, although a little on the more expensive side, was very delicious! It was very fresh and didn't have a fishy after taste (if that makes any sense). I ordered two (one serving had about 5-6 shrimp) and killed both orders on my own. Cons:1) The macaroni and cheese wasn't the best. Yes I used my birthday dinner as an opportunity to scope out a new mac and cheese spot. I guess I had high hopes based on the rave reviews from both my referral and my waiter. It had good cheese to pasta ratio but something about the flavor wasn't working for me.2) The desserts were a little on the weird side. I ordered some type of deconstructed strawberry shortcake thingy. The flavors didn't mesh well. I think the manager sensed it and asked if everything was ok. I explained my concerns and he stated that this was one of the new desserts they were trying and he would let the chef know this wasn't a great option (this is also a pro as they are open to constructive criticism).Overall:I will definitely be back. Like I said, I love their shrimp. Oh yea, and their salmon wasn't bad either.",4,4,4

I've always had a reservation, and wouldn't recommend going at prime brunch times without one, it's always crowded.  The food is excellent, the service is great, and you can't beat the free brunch cocktail that comes with the brunch dishes!Some dishes I've ordered:- Egg white omelette - fluffy and well cooked, lots of goat cheese!- Steak and eggs - my favorite brunch dish there - the potato pancake is to die for, and the steak is always cooked to perfection- Sicilian baked eggs - very solid, tasty tomato sauce, artichoke hearts are amazing, and the eggs are well cooked- Avocado toast - a classic, very well done, but would go with one of the other brunch dishes - Pancakes - simply delicious!!! So filling and the perfect amount of sweetnessThe Bloody Mary is delicious, but a tad spicy.  Not a huge fan of the passion punch, it is a bit too sweet for my taste.  I tried The Gatsby cocktail last time, and it was pretty good!The ambiance is really nice in there, but it can get a bit loud.  Try to get a table on the first floor by the windows, those are the nicest.  The service is good, nothing excellent but no complaints.Overall highly recommend if you're looking for a good brunch spot to bring friends or family!  Love this place!",,,

Which meant getting the classic Manhattan cocktail, titled here as the 'Midtown Manhattan' . This particular mix recommended by our bartender was incredible she suggested we substitute the house whiskey for the Bulleit Rye and it made such a difference. It gave it a nice, twiggy finish. (Idk the best way I could describe) just know it gave me all the feels. And Cherry O' Baby is pretty good if you like a fruity autumny blend. To eat, kept it light and ordered the Spicy Salmon Tartare. So good highly recommend if you come here as a starter or snack in between drinks. Salmon over avocado served on breaded rice. Once again, delicious! Shout out to the bartenders Janet and Banji. They definitely looked out. Very nice and so attentive. Will come back again.",,,

Decor was impressive. I sat downstairs where the walls were lined tastefully with already used bottles of alcohol.

151,Adam G.,"Farmingdale, NY",101,77,159,4.0,1/22/2017,"The menu seems like it covers a little bit of every thing. In other words, pretty much any one could find something to eat. Including Vegans, one option I would highly recommend, is the Vegetable Bimbimbop. This dish is extremely tasty/flavorful and the ingredients seem to all compliment each other including the edamame, kimchee and fried egg. I was little skeptical to order a staple Korean BBQ dish at a Bar or Gastro-Pub but my Mother already had her mind set.  After sampling the Bimbimbop, I was pleasantly surprised with the array of flavors.The Spaghetti and Meatballs was the Sunday Special and I could not resist after hearing the servers description. This is definitely something that can be shared as the entire dish would be very filling for one person which the server made us aware of. The Meatballs are made with healthier meat and the pasta was very good as well.The Salmon was above average  and definitely one of the lighter option on the menu which was a  perfect compliment  with the other dishes which were heavier.  I saw other customers with the Burgers which looked amazing from the street and inside the restaurant.The table is pre-set with both Sparking and Purified WaterThere is a nice long bar which seemed to offer a handful of customized drinks. There is no televisions. I don't think they fit or are really necessary I thought I might be able to catch the end of a game when it said Restaurant & Bar on the door. Service was above average as the server was friendly, helpful and efficient. Our server did a great job of explaining the menu and making suggestions which made it possible to taste different things. The lighting and acoustics are appropriate for meeting people and holding a conversation but can get crazy on the busier nights. The price is reasonable for the quality of food. I would have to see how the crowd and service is on a Friday or Saturday night and try the Brunch to dish-out 5 stars but they are close.",,,

Updated review","Me and feyonce stopped here for dinner before going to see blue man group. It was pretty lively and loud and a decent amount of peopleService was good and food was better. I got the seared tuna with mushrooms, sunchokes, baby spinach ($29) and it was delicious. I thought I wasn't going to be full from looking at my entree when it came out but I was pretty stuffed. He got the pastrami spiced salmon with roasted cauliflower, house made kraut, and dill ($26). Also yummy. We shared a side of the jalapeño cheddar grits (never skip ordering this goodness) and both of us were pretty full. On the pricier side. Great meal and good staff. Will definitely return!",2,1,1

Each ordering a glass of the Malbec, which was a particularly good pour, we continued with orders of the seared tuna salad and sirloin burger, respectively. While my friend's salad left a little to be desired, my burger was delicious! Topped with gruyere, tomato, and crispy onions, it was perfectly prepared. Furthermore, the large mound of fries that accompanied it were both hot and tasty- and enough for my friend, too.Also, the service was both fast and friendly. Yay! I'm a fan.",1,,

I wish they were more up front about the fact that you don't get a free cocktail if it's before noon, but otherwise, the food was awesome. I had the Sicilian baked eggs dish and it was just out of this world. I also tried my friend's Belgian potato waffles with poached eggs, and it was good, but overall actually a little bland. Considering how dynamic it looks, I was expecting it to be more flavorful. I did love the potato waffles. We also had a side of home fries, which had the most amazing spices. Finally, they gave us free orange juice and apple juice (you can choose a juice before noon) and my OJ was pretty solid. I would return just to get those eggs again! It was easy to make a reservation, too, which is always a plus. 5 stars because mine was so good!!",,,
155,George W.,"New York, NY",0,19,2,5.0,4/15/2018,"This has been a great spot ever since Pizzeria UNO closed down. I think it's been in this location for roughly 10 years. And let me tell you I've never been disappointed. This is upscale comfort food that delivers great taste and quality ingredients. I've sampled 95% of the menu not including cocktails but everything is good and their burger is top notch. Even the deserts are great. And to find Sticky Toffee Pudding on any menu is a rarity, but when they actually get it right it's astronomical. I think The Smith speaks for itself in the amount of time it's been at the 3rd ave location and then opening several around the city because of its singular success. I'd recommend to anyone. It's become a New York staple in a town where that's incredibly difficult to do. Bravo!",,,

157,Kristin C.,"New York, NY",463,49,70,5.0,2/26/2016,"My go-to brunch spot with friends on the weekends. Ample seating with super-friendly and personable staff. It could get a bit loud, but that's expected for weekend brunches around this area. A good amount of the more breakfast-inclined dishes come with a free cocktail or juice and they give you both sparkling and still water upon being seated.My favorites will always be the Hot Potato Chips and Sicilian Baked Eggs. The chips simply fulfill any blue cheese-enthusiast's fantasy. The baked eggs prove to be a hearty, satisfying meal when paired with their bread and equipped with a slight kick of spicy. Portions are extremely generous, which make the price definitely worth it and then some. Some other notable qualities: you'll find a cool photo booth located downstairs when you make your way to the vintage-inspired decorated bathrooms.",,,

Made a reservation for two while walking there and were accommodated immediately. For starters, we got the mac and cheese which is to die for. So delicious, its a must to order from the appetizers. Could not finish it between two people because it was really heavy and we wanted to save room for our entrees. I got the NY strip and my friend got the filet mignon which were both cooked exactly the we had asked for it. Enjoyable time overall.",1,,
159,Erin L.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,0,2.0,4/11/2018,"This used to be my fav brunch spot, but no more.  My girlfriends and I always got the avocado toast and it was amazing!  Standard Manhattan price for 2 pieces of toast piled with avocado and each topped with a poached egg.  HOWEVER, the last time I went, the dish changed.  It is now only 1 piece of toast with avocado!  The single toast does have two poached eggs on it, but regardless it's absolutely less food and of course the price is exactly the same as it was with two pieces of toast and twice the avocado.  I was such a die-hard fan and to now almost chop a dish in half and still charge the same is crazy and disappointing.  $17 for one piece of toast is wildly over-priced. The other items there are very delicious and the service is always great, but to take advantage of people like that is gross to say the least.  Will find somewhere else to get my avocado toast.",,,
160,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,3.0,6/7/2017,"Le boyfriend and I enjoyed a nearly two hour workout at the gym and we were famished. Since we were in the area I knew The Smith would be a relatively safe bet minus the fact that I knew we might either have to sit at the bar or find another option since their wait time is usually obnoxious. We lucked out and were seated immediately.This location is like every other except it adds a touch of sophistication to a beloved, grungy part of the Manhattan island.  The decor is the same black and white tiles, the atmosphere busy and the air filled with different conversations, languages and clinking of mimosas.  Our server, Emily, was lovely. She was very efficient and quick to offer us menus and remind us of their brunch special: order from the brunch portion of the menu and receive a free glass of bloody mary, bellini, barnstormer, passion punch, the gatsby or fresh squeezed juice. Although there are no bottomless specials here, at least you have the chance to save a few dollars. Seated towards the back, we were in our old makeshift island of tables for two surrounded by booths and corner seats. The windows were open and let the cool, damp air inside and made for great people watching. Looking at the menus, there is a lot of food to choose from so The Smith really is a safe bet if you happen to bring a large group or picky eater. We ultimately went with the vanilla bean brioche french toast with caramelized bananas and truffled local mushroom toast. When our food arrived, I couldn't believe how I didn't order the french toast: it was thick, fluffy and covered in syrup and bananas. It tasted sweet but wasn't overwhelmed and felt like a perfect naughty treat for someone on a health kick. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed my toast though I will they piled on a bit more cheese but that aside it was fantastic and the greens that came on the side came in a light dressing that complimented the taste of the truffle oiled mushrooms. Of course, being the basic couple that we are we washed them down with a few mimosas and sparkling water. Our meals came in went, coffees were refilled and then came our check. Considering we had more than a few mimosas, the total wasn't too scary and fairly reasonable for two people. Signing the bill, I took note how the brunch crowd seemed to disappear and the volume of the venue went down.  It wasn't a loud or bustling anymore and seemed to be more calm - perfect when you're about to enter a food coma.",,,1

163,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,3.0,9/8/2015,"I came here for brunch recently with a bunch of friends. My friend had a reservation so we didn't have to wait to be seated. We were placed inside, where it was dark but comfortable. I knew I had to try the candied bacon scone which was $9 for 3 scones. The scones were wonderful, with the delicious taste of sweet, crispy bacon; buttery and soft, crumbly scone and crystallized sugar bits on top. For my main course I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which came with romaine, smoked paprika aioli and french fries. It was pretty good, but I don't think the chicken was fried... It seemed more like there was a little bit of breading on grilled chicken, so I was kind of disappointed and felt that the menu was misleading. The flavor of the chicken sandwich was decent though and they gave me plenty of fries, which were pretty tasty. I also got to try the fried string beans, which were quite good. The fresh taste of string beans was still there and it had a nice satisfying crunch to it. Since it was my friend's birthday, the restaurant presented my friend with a chocolate cake with a mini vanilla milkshake, which was absolutely adorable! I tasted a bit of the cake, which was very chocolate-y, rich and sweet. It also had this delightful warm, gooey chocolate filling.",9,7,7

I liked the atmosphere, it was pretty crowded, but we were able to get seats at the high top tables by the bar for all 4 of us without much of a wait. We ordered Irish coffees at first, but man did they fail on those. They tasted horrible and weren't made correct. I only took off one star because our waiter was really friendly and let us order something else and didn't charge us for them. I ended up getting a Smiths Ale, which is their own beer. It was really good and if your a beer snob like me, you will like it. We didn't eat anything, but the plates I saw other people get looked really good. I'd definitely try dinner here another time.",,,

167,Annis K.,"Forest Hills, NY",8,27,47,3.0,7/16/2018,"The food wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular where I care to return. Before I left for the restroom, I had my brioche bun on a plate, some lettuce on another plate and a large plate of potato chips in front of my seat. Returned from the restroom and my brioche bun and lettuce were gone. My friends didn't even realize someone removed the two items from the table since no one asked them if it can be removed. We asked for our unfinished mac and cheese to be bagged and a guy (busboy?) took the dish away. A waitress came to us and said our mac and cheese were tossed away and they are making us a new one as replacement.",,,

169,Jus T.,"New York, NY",62,17,29,4.0,4/30/2017,Not sure if we bonded with the waitress but we revived the ultimate service accompanied with complimentary drinks (plural). No waiting time or reservation for the table was necessary but would suggest doing so. Very cool spot even though I've been at the other locations. You shouldn't be disappointed stopping by.,1,,2
170,Mandy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,25,0,5.0,3/5/2018,"The Smith truly went above and beyond on our visit. There were four of us in our party and we had a reservation. When we first arrived, it took an extra 40 minutes to get seated, so we relaxed and drank cocktails in the bar. We didn't say anything, but as soon as we were seated a complimentary hummus platter and veggies appeared as a thank you for our patience. The food was delish (we had shishito peppers, oysters, and hamburgers). Afterwards, we decided to skip dessert, since we had already splurged a bit on the meal. Our server overheard us, and brought over complimentary sorbet. It was such a lovely meal with great service and we will definitely be back, once we are done digesting our extra few courses!",,,

Updated review","Good vibes. Okay food.  Some odd things like regular potato chips smothered with a heavy cheese sauce. Mussels were small and overwhelmed with the creamy broth. Small piece of bread served in a small envelope?   Moscow mule was served in a regular smallish tall glass.  Lobster salad $32 was a few small pieces of lobster over greens, not worth it. Beef brisket over a squash mash was pretty good. The black pasta was gooey and heavy. Fried chicken/waffles was excellent, but pricey for fried chicken.",2,1,1
174,Zach W.,"Baltimore, MD",40,162,251,5.0,8/28/2015,"On some level, it's not fair. I felt legitimately bad for some of the food I had tonight, because I knew that it would be the best thing at most other restaurants. Four items, four 10s. Wow. We started off with the hot potato chips (with blue cheese). Now I personally strongly dislike stinky cheese and had never even considered putting it on chips, but I guess that's why I don't own the Smith. Also the bowl was huge, be careful. The chips were amazing and unnecessary and some of the best chips I've ever had. Midway through the delight of the chips came OH MY GOD THE WORLD'S BEST MAC AND CHEESE. THE. BEST. MAC AND CHEESE. EVER. IN THE WORLD. THE BEST!Ok I'm done. Get the Mac and cheese and thank me later. Creamy, rich, cheesy, mind blowing, stellar, unbeatable. It's amazing and...is it weird to say I miss it?Next came the entrees. We were pretty lost in the menu so we asked the waitress for suggestions, and she said the flounder. According to my girlfriend, light things like fish ""cut through the richness"" so obviously we went with that. It was some of the best fish I've ever had with a side of vegetables that perfectly complemented it. We also ordered the tagliatelle, which was unbelievable black pasta with delicious shrimp and enough garlic to keep the vampires away for at least a week. Highly, highly, highly recommended. I could barely walk out of the restaurant at the end. We didn't even finish our bread, a feat that I'm pretty sure was a first. I will wholeheartedly concede that the price was steep, but for the best meal I've had in a long time, I still have to give five stars.",2,1,2

177,Emma P.,"Hoboken, NJ",12,86,94,4.0,11/16/2017,"Are you going to have the best food you've ever tasted at The Smith? No, but it's a good trusty standby that serves decent food at reasonable prices with a good selection of drinks. I've been coming to this location since it opened and it is my favourite of the various Smiths that have popped up all over the city. The service is pretty good and they have some nice touches such as serving a basket of bread and butter as soon as you sit down and complimentary bottles of still and sparkling water. The menu changes a little from time to time so it doesn't get boring and each night they have a special. The menu is American bistro type foods with a nod to what is currently 'in fashion' foodwise. You can get a good burger, a reliable steak, pasta dishes, a varied selection of salads etc etc. It's a good place to come with a group of people as everyone will find something to their liking. Brunch here is pretty good as and it's open until midnight daily so it's a good one to remember if you need to grab a late dinner.",,,
178,Amanda T.,"Manhattan, NY",124,22,2,5.0,7/16/2017,"This is absolutely one of my favorite ""go to"" spots for something a little more special than dinner but not as grand as an important celebration (although totally suitable for either). My favorite dish is the Tagliatelle, which is a black pasta, shrimp, scallion and crumbled garlic bread dish. The pasta is cooked to perfection and the shrimp seems to be lightly breaded. I try not to get this every time I go, but it's just so good. I've also tried the hot potato chips (snacks) and fried calamari (starters) that both equally satisfied the cheesy and salty cravings I had. The meatballs (Sunday special) are juicy, flavorful and filling, and the burger is way better than I anticipated. There isn't any dish on the menu that you can regret, the food is cooked perfectly and seasoned really well (which is a big thing for me). I'm always satisfied, impressed and in love with the ambiance of the space. PRO TIP: It can get really crowded, really quickly -- but it is absolutely worth the wait... even if you have to squeeze in by the bar to try a speciality drink.",,,
179,Eda O.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,36,13,2.0,2/10/2018,I was most annoyed with the lack of accommodation.

180,Nick D.,"New York, NY",80,508,704,3.0,7/22/2015,"I'm a huge Mac and cheese lover so of course I had to check this place out since everyone says it's the best. Came here on a weekday night around 9 pm and was surprised with the noise level. It was so loud we could almost not even hear one another talk and we were in a close table. People repeatedly would bump into my chair, so I was a little upset with the environment going on.I ordered the Moscow mule and literally knew it was gonna be bad based on the glass they used. It was way too sweet and had to return it and replace it with a beer.Moving on to the main attraction, the Mac is definitely very good. Wouldn't say it's the best I've had, but it's certainly good enough to possibly return to this restaurant.The service was pretty good. It was super busy so I guess it was good despite the fact. Iffy if I would return to The Smith.",2,,
181,Stephanie A.,"Tampa, FL",14,40,1,3.0,11/26/2017,"I had the Smith Burger. It was just ok. I'm a bit of a burger snob though. The meat itself had little seasoning which is important to me. Wouldn't order it again. Rest of my party enjoyed their meals, however my sister-in-law was told the Eggs Benedict came with home fries by our waitress only to be told my the server who brought the food out, that they did not. Server was still very nice. We hing around to chat for a while and one server/busboy kept coming to the table to see if we were still there. That wasn't cool.",,,

We sat at the bar to get drinks. The bartender was quite preoccupied and it was difficult to get his attention. We finally ordered our drinks (dirty martini for me and the hungry teacher for her) which came out well. It took another bit of time to get the check when our table was ready.After arriving at the table, the server gave us menus and a bit of time.We started with the burrata which was absolutely fantastic. The garlicky bread it was served with was so good.I then got the cavatelli pasta with short rib and it was worth every single calorie. I am obsessed. MyFriend had the shrimp and grits and loved it as well.Service was pretty good if not a tad pushy.I'll definitely be back to try their Mac and cheese!",,,
183,Tanisha L.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,42,99,4.0,10/22/2016,The service was great. Went after 7 and was able to find parking. If your heading there on the weekend be sure to arrive early because there are a lot of small local bars around and you will not find parking. I just happened to get lucky! The wait time was very short I would say about 15-20 mins. Sat at the bar while waiting and the barista was kind enough to give us a discount on the drinks since we were heading to dine in the dining section. The food came out fairly quickly. My only concern was I asked for well done and it came out medium rare. The mac and cheese was delicious! I would definitely recommend this spot. It was a friendly atmosphere.,,,

185,Morgan G.,"Manhattan, NY",606,244,720,3.0,7/20/2015,"I live really close to this restaurant but only yesterday did I decide to venture in with some friends visiting from LA. We made a reservation in advance for Sunday brunch which I highly recommend; while there was a line out the door to be seated, we were seated immediately with a reservation. I had heard good things about the brunch here so I was excited to come here. I was shocked to find that the restaurant had an entirely separate lower level with more seating and a bar - this area was a bit quieter than the bustling upper level, but loud all the same. The service was friendly and speedy despite a crowd - we were immediately served water and drinks that came complimentary with our brunch selections. I got the OJ, which was fresh and refreshing, especially in the scorching summer heat. After reading Yelp reviews, I ordered the potato waffle Benedict, which I partially regret since I'm not a huge fan of breakfast potatoes. While I loved the poached eggs (there were 3), the potato was too much and I ended up leaving them on the plate, even though they were an essential ingredient in the dish. Next time, I'll trust my gut and get the mushroom omelette!",1,,1
186,Tiff H.,"Dunwoody, GA",1140,1666,6936,2.0,6/11/2016,"Long story short? Very overpriced brunch. Long story is this:SERVICE:The server was around but not really. He was around for us to make our order and bring us our food but no for much else. It got busy, but for some reason, he seemed to stand around a lot. He was pretty good looking though. FOOD:After pouring ourselves some water (both sparkling and tap water were available), my sister and I decided to share a couple things since there wasn't really any entree that stood out:Latte - $5 is pretty steep for a latte, but it was a rather large one. Glazed Donuts - deliciousness in donut hole form. Who would've thought simple glazed donuts could be so delicious. They weren't worth $9 but it sure was tasty. Honestly, this was the highlight of the meal. Fruits and Berries - huge disappointment. It was literally a small fruit salad poured into a bowl and drizzled with honey. $9 for this is pretty ridiculous. Breakfast Pot Pie - I don't know what possessed us to order this. We were pretty full from coffee, donuts and fruit, so this order wasn't necessary. Even so, we tried to eat it and were disappointed to find that while it was supposed to mimic a pot pie, it was far from it. There was a bottom crust that was hard to eat beneath the pie filling and sunny-side egg top. There was one or two pieces of potato, a couple pieces of carrot and a little gravy - ladies and gentlemen, egg pot pie. A big let down, to say the least.Expensive prices, slow wait service with average food made it a sadly unbearable brunch. While it was super convenient in location to my sister's apartment, it was not worth the price.",3,1,
187,Alexandria T.,"Houston, TX",471,655,1979,3.0,7/6/2015,"A large group of us met for brunch on a Sunday at the Smith. Someone had made a reservation for our group of seven, so they were able to seat us right away. I loved that their brunch entrees come with your choice of a drink and seemed to include pretty much anything other than coffee. This made the price of the entrees seem really reasonable. They also brought out complimentary bread, which was a nice way to start the meal. Their menu has a lot of great options for brunch, and I had a really hard time deciding what to get. I was between the Sicilian baked eggs and the BLT + E sandwich, and I ended up getting the sandwich. It was huge, messy, and delicious! It had so much bacon on it that I was able to take some off to share! It also came with a huge serving of fries that I wasn't able to finish, which never happens! I tried a bite of the potato waffle benedict and really loved the unique spin on the classic eggs benedict. We also shared a side of the jalapeno cheddar grits. They were creamy and cheesy, with just a tiny bit of kick. They really surprised me by being some of the best grits I've ever had. The food that I tried was all really delicious. There were a few drawbacks though. The place is seats a lot of people, but it was super loud, so it made it pretty hard to have conversations with the whole table. Also, somehow one of the entrees didn't arrive with the rest of them, so we had to awkwardly wait for a while to eat before I signaled down a bus boy to get our server. He misunderstood me, and I had to ask again for the server. They were able to get the entree out within ten minutes or so, but if the service had been better, we wouldn't have been waiting for so long before they realized the mistake.",1,1,1

I initially was looking for a nice breakfast spot as I checked out yelp and saw and read some nice things. However when I set down I was given the lunch menu. After confirming with my waiter if I missed breakfast I decided to go ahead and try something for lunch. The braised short-rib pasta was soooo GOOD!! I have bookmarked this place for my next visit to New York. Hopefully I'll get to try breakfast and have lunch there soon.,,,
189,Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,317,179,1.0,11/15/2016,"I had heard many things about this place but I honestly wasn't the least bit impressed. They served ONE small bag of bread for a table of 6 people as we waited and that was beyond annoying. I had the tomato soup as an appetizer and it was WAY too heavy. It was like mashed tomatoes instead of tomato soup... One of my friends had the Caesar salad and it was pretty bad. I've never seen someone mess up a salad but this place sure did. For my meal I had the grilled chicken, my friend ordered shrimp cocktail and calamari from the starters as a meal. My chicken was okay, nothing I'd go out of my way to have, his calamari was cold and the shrimp cocktail has the sauce on it already.Everyone else had mussels which they enjoyed but because I love mussels I had better in other restaurants.I honestly would never come back here. Even their drinks are terrible. Not a good experience at all. Avoid this hyped up restaurant, it isn't good.",,,

I'll come back to try their burgers and avocado tacos. Tried their crab cake tots, pretty good, although the portions were small, it's a great bite before your entree. I'll opt out of this next time though, I rather try some avocado tacos or fried eggplant. This is the type of restaurants I'll come back once in awhile for dinner.",,,

Make a res (even same day) and you'll never have to wait. The free sparkling water is also a great perk, as the drinks can be a little pricey.  You can go for pure comfort food like potato chips in cheese sauce, burgers, or mac and cheese, but the lighter dishes like the entree salads are fabulous also.",,,

I'd give sit down a five star rating, but their take out service is subpar at best. Ordering is either done at the window outside, or at the bar inside, making it difficult to order in the winter as it's usually crowded at night. The bartenders rarely know anything about the take it and give wait times that are far from accurate. The food quantities are also inconsistent. I have waited an hour for a container full of mac and cheese and have also waited twenty minutes for a container half full at the same price. Sit down meals are perfectly fine, but their take out service brings down the overall quality of the restaurant. Will not be returning for take out, will most likely return for a sit down meal.",,,

""Fresh"" air flowing, and it compensates for the proximity of the tables.Service : The host was very sweet, and pretty comical actually. This is always a great start first thing thru the door.  The waitress herself seemed a bit off though.  I'm not sure if she was having a bad day, but she definitely looked irritated the entire time.  She was never ""rude"" per se, but... eh.Food : Everyone seemed to like their food a lot, drinks as well!  It is nice too that a lot of the brunch menu items came with a ""complimentary"" drink (OJ, apple juice, grapefruit juice, peach bellini, bloody mary, barnstormer, passion punch).Cheddar Biscuits - The cheddar in the biscuits sort of oozes over during baking, so I was expecting that great fried cheese accent.  However, the biscuit was a bit dry, and the cheese was pretty flavorless.  This was just okay.Corned Beef Hash - Ah ha.  THIS was delicious, and a perfect amount of food (for me at least...usually I never finish my plate).  I feel that for others though, it might not be enough.  It came with 3 over easy eggs and a sort of thin layer of hash.  The ""salad"" is negligent.  I was worried that the hash, not being super abundant, was going to get lost in the eggs.  The hash is super flavorful with nice chunks of beef, and not filled with too much potato.  This was definitely a winner!Definitely recommend making a reservation, but certainly worth trying!",,,
