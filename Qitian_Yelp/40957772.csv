0,Christa R.,"Queens, NY",355,46,23,5.0,10/31/2018,Such a cool little bar in lower east. Came here after work for happy hour on a Tuesday (bummer that there's no burlesque show then but I'll be back) and had a few cocktails. It's intimate and wasn't too crowded which was nice but I imagine it can be tight on busy nights as it's a small bar. The happy hour special goes until ten pm which is a great deal and nice wide open time window. The bartender was amazing and so nice and was quick to take my order.,,,
1,Douglas K.,"Queens, NY",143,547,1,4.0,10/19/2018,"Nested in the the bustling streets of LES, you'll find this little gem to either start or end the night with a drink. Surprisingly, the place is rarely for a Saturday evening which is a nice surprise for the area. Drinks are reasonable and the live DJ put everyone in a good mood. I would say that they do have a small bar so selection may be limited. Worth checking out with a small group.",,,
2,Whitney M.,"Montclair, NJ",37,17,0,5.0,8/30/2018,"An incredible place! We went on a Wednesday night. The bartenders were friendly, knowledgeable, and talented. The speciality drinks were expansive, well priced, and fairly original. The vibe was welcoming, friendly, and fun. A diverse group of folks were in attendance to watch and support the free burlesque performances. The performances were great! High energy, good costumes, and a variety of ""types""--super feminine women, non binary, queer women. The only downside, it's extremely cramped with limited seating. We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed! You could barely breathe without touching someone. Despite the small space, I'll definitely be back again'",1,,

However, the cocktail did not turned up as good as expected and more than half was just ice. Three sip and my $14 drink was over ... kinda sad.Hope was just the bartender, prob would give it another try?!",,,
4,Jing X.,"Brooklyn, NY",258,641,2734,5.0,10/19/2018,This bar has it all!  Happy Hour until 10pm!  1 free well-drink with a purchase with the yelp check-in offer.  And free burlesque shows on Wedn & Thurs nights with an emcee who keeps you laughing throughout the night.  The dancers change every week.  Solid place to have a guaranteed good time on a weeknight!,1,,1

6,Jamie W.,"Somerville, MA",141,142,639,3.0,7/8/2018,"I really really wanted to love Nurse Bettie. The space was small, but very chic. I love the look of tin ceilings and chandeliers. The space is eclectic, but perfectly dim. I wish the back area had a ledge or a small table because there is no where to lean or set your drink in that part of the bar. Despite the small space, there was an awesome DJ, but the music was a touch too loud for the low key vibe of the bar, especially because there's not really any room for dancing. The drink menu was super promising and one of my friends had an excellent cocktail, but the two bartenders were night and day in terms of quality. The brown haired bartender took a full 15 minutes to make 3 drinks and they were awful. The balance was completely off (and tasted totally different than the excellent drink the other bartender took a minute to make our friend). Next time I'm in the city I might give this place another try, especially for the burlesque show, but it's definitely not top of my list.",1,,1

10,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,7/24/2017,"Friday night, wanted to try a different bar in the LES with a good happy hour. This spot not only wasn't crowded but had nice deals all day.Plenty of bar space in the late evening; grabbed a stool while looking over the happy hour. $5 draft beers, $6 specialty cocktails, $5 wells - all until 10pm (or all night, depends on the day I suppose). Had the Cuban Iced Tea ($6) to start - a ridiculously strong concoction of thick alcohol and hints of iced tea that somehow worked together. Also ordered the Grapefruit Jalapeno Vodka Soda ($6) - an odd combo but drinkable nonetheless. Ambiance is pretty chill. Music isn't too loud and a couple dogs came by for petting sessions. Bartender is quick and friendly, plus the vibe is different from the normal crowded bar scene.",1,,2
11,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,5.0,7/11/2017,"LOVE Nurse Bettie! Being a big fan of vintage pinup/cheesecake art and ephemera, I just about squealed when I saw this bar on Yelp and knew I had to check it out. The interior is super cool and the happy hour is DOPE. (1/2 off well drinks 'til 10 pm every night.)We came on a Saturday so we missed the Burlesque but that happens Wednesday and Thursday nights at 10 pm (conveniently when happy hour ends, lol) and is supposed to be lots of fun. It's a small space but surprisingly wasn't crowded even on a weekend and had plenty of cozy seating. People were very chatty and convivial, and if you're single, this may be a great place to meet someone as the atmosphere is very conducive to socializing and the decor is a great conversation piece without being schticky. Best of all, the bartender is awesome! My BF thought he looked familiar and it turns out he used to work at the Farmhouse across from The Hotel Chantelle. He sent us a round of custom shots on the house and was great about honoring the Yelp check-in for a free drink during HH. I mostly stuck to well drinks to get better pricing, but if you're feeling splurgy, I highly recommend ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" cocktail, which is basically a fancy mojito. ($14)",1,,1
12,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,4.0,5/4/2017,"Wow great spot on the LES but super, super small. This spot would be best enjoyed by a party of two or less. It is not good for groups, but that's definitely a good thing!After a recent dinner in the area, a friend and I wanted to keep the conversation going with some cocktails. I had bookmarked this place, and you should, too. This intimate bar has a stage and free burlesque show that starts at 10pm. That's like 3 hours after my bedtime on a work night, so I cannot personally attest. But it seems cool. Happy hour runs late with very reasonable drinks. I like their beer selection and my friend liked their hard stuff. They have mixology type drinks with all the bells and whistles. You can keep me from a craft beer once I have my heart set. I will be back for surePro Tip: check in during happy hour to get your second drink free! Awesome deal. Tip well on both rounds.",2,,
13,Julianne G.,"Manhattan, NY",46,257,601,4.0,8/24/2017,"We came here last night (Wednesday) for happy hour and eventually the free cabaret show. // SeatingFor our group of 8, there were 3 places we could have sat. It's a very small bar. All of the seating was taken when we first came ~7pm but all groups left within the hour. We got the seating area with the bar stools and booth closest to the stage. However, so many people are standing between you and the stage by the time the show starts it's not the best view. There was also a go-go dancer on the windowsill if you want to sit near that area. // Happy HourDrinks start at $5 for beer, $6 for mixed drinks, $7 for wine. I tried both the speciality cocktails and we asked the bartender to not add any sugar/syrup to either of them. The Cuban iced tea with mint wasn't too sweet and had a nice bitter aftertaste. I preferred the Svedka jalapeño with grapefruit soda. It pretty much tasted like a vodka soda with a hint of grapefruit. We also took several pickle backs $6 - so many that the bartender ran out of shot glasses whoops! BTW best pickle juice I've ever tasted! Make sure to check in on yelp and get a free drink after your first one",3,1,2
14,Bart P.,"Gent, Belgium",11,2,1,4.0,9/28/2017,"It's a laid back fun place! Small but cozy. Interesting crowd. Not overpriced. However, don't leave your drinks on the bar. They will disappear because the bartender mistakes long drinks with glasses of water.There's at times impro burlesque dancing, which is fun and entertaining for sure. Overall a very pleasant experience. We had a great time.",1,,1
15,Arlene C.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",31,6,13,4.0,6/1/2018,"Enjoyed the drinks specials and the Bronx Pale Ale draft beer during Burlesque Happy Hour night. Liked that it was a very chill atmosphere before the show.  It did get hopping (the crowd, I meant) when the show started.",,,
16,Fatima H.,"Forest Hills, NY",298,246,330,4.0,1/22/2018,Always a great show. I believe there is no cover on Thursday nights. Be prepared for a large crowd in a tiny space. It was a bit tough to enjoy my drink as ppl kept knocking into me. I would come back but probably try to come earlier to nab a seat.,3,,3
17,Sara M.,"Orange, CA",32,1,0,5.0,9/8/2018,"Cocktails, ambiance and service are top notch. This place is small but packs a punch. The bartender's expertise is hard to top. Each drink was made with precision.",1,,
18,Andres D.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,34,16,5.0,3/22/2018,I have a great affinity for this space. It's so small you HAVE to talk to the next person. Great drink specials and the Burlesque is a great look inside the venue.,,,
19,Mary C.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,19,0,5.0,7/19/2018,"Small cute bar for a date night. Great for happy hour drinks (HH for $5-$10). Pretty good deal and  bartender is super friendly and nice to chat with. Apparently, there is free burlesque show after 10 PM on Wed and Thurs so I will definitely come back to check it out. However, it is best to come early to grab seats since there is limited space.Great music and chilled vibe. I enjoyed the space when there is sunlight out and enjoying a cocktail.",,,
20,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,5.0,5/29/2017,"We stopped in on a random Tuesday night and it was great! A teeny tiny hole in the wall, with pictures of fancy old school pin up ladies... But the seating is a couple little couches up front and few seats at a bar. The cocktail menu has a lot of varied drinks that are super tasty, I got one with grapefruit vodka that was very refreshing, and the minty vodka drink tasted refreshing as well! Would definitely recommend for a nice casual fun night for smaller parties.",2,,2
21,Chantalle U.,"Las Vegas, NV",223,246,106,4.0,1/22/2018,"The only downside to this place is that it's tiny. Other than that IT IS AMAZING! Okay, I'm getting carried away by using all caps but you guys. First off, great staff. They're very friendly and they've got a good selection of cocktails. Second, they host burlesque shows! Say-what!? Yes, they do and it's always good for date nights or just an after work drink.",,,
22,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,4.0,11/14/2017,"Small bar but good drinks. They have happy hour deals til 10pm which is pretty sweet, and they don't water down the drinks either. Prices are decent even without happy hour. The atmosphere is cool and they play good music. It does get pretty crowded on weekend nights but would be a good place to come to earlier and then go somewhere bigger later. All in all, solid option in the area and I'd definitely keep it in mind when I'm looking for later happy hour deals!",1,,
23,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,100,19,5.0,10/30/2017,"I love this place! Been there multiple times when I didn't want to deal with insane crowds and worse attitudes. It's chill and intimate. Pin up decor. Heads up: Free burlesque on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 10pm. DJs on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Yelp check in gets you a free well or draft beer with a purchase during daily happy until 10pm (you can't share your free drink with a buddy though). Even without the BOGO deal, a draft beer is just $5! Score! Only down sides are the tiny bathroom and the music can be loud. I definitely recommend coming here for cheap drinks without egos during happy hour in a relaxing space.",1,,
24,Jacqueline M.,"Middletown, NJ",9,24,7,4.0,2/14/2018,Wow! Great little bar! Dropped in for drinks on a Saturday night and the DJ was so great that we ended up staying. It's a small space and it felt like a house party but the crowd was friendly while couples danced. Winner!,2,,
25,Kimberly P.,"New York, NY",336,64,40,4.0,5/15/2018,"Sexy dancers on a Thursday night? Need I say more? If you want an intimate date or to enjoy a dim lit setting, this place is for you. With affordable drinks and seating all around you'll find yourself having loads of fun. Although the place itself is on the smaller side you'll find a seat with no problem. Swing by after work on wed/thurs for the show, but any day would be fun.",,,
26,Salome M.,"New York, NY",51,170,161,4.0,3/10/2017,"If you want to have a fun filled, entertaining evening, Nurse Bettie is the place to go. Cozy, friendly and super fun. Some of the most beautiful women in the LES. Their performances were stellar and the host for the evening (i am forgetting his name) was really funny. I love live shows and this one was one of the best i've seen thus far. Cocktails were $14 (on the steeper side) but say if you had a rum/coke, or vodka/soda, its $8. Cheap going by NYC standards. Definitely going back here and most definitely dragging my friends there as well.",,1,
27,Sergio E.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,12/5/2017,"A friend told me about this awesome little bar with live burlesque shows in the lower east side, so we had to make a pit stop. At first I found it hard to believe that such a small space could operate a full bar and live show, but after just 5 minutes it all maid sense. There were a few house cocktails that were delicious and the fact that they have Guinness on draft is a major plus. I must say that the burlesque MC was hands down one of the funniest performers I've seen in NYC and the dancers were all very talented as well. I wasn't sure how my girlfriend was going to react to practically naked women dancing in such close quarters, but she ended up loving it and even participated in a stage event.Definitely a must do if you've never been!",,,
28,Pedro A.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,3.0,3/17/2018,"Corey is a great bartender. The other guy, (a little shorter, used to work on other bars on the Les) charges random prices for the same drink.not cool. And not like nurse Bettie.",,1,
29,Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",92,253,398,4.0,7/21/2016,Came here today and I gotta say it was a blast. The burlesque ladies are fucking amazing. Each women had their own flair and style to present to the crowd. I gotta say my favorite was the dark and mysterious lady with the long jet black flowing hair. Boy does that women know how to entice a crowd. She kept on impressing and kept the crowd roaring.I gotta say the audience is pretty damn spectacular. There was an older woman who was a bit scared to get up on stage for the crowd but boy did they surprise me. They cheered her on all throughout her performance. The only downside I'd say is the bartenders. It takes forever to get their attention. Even when the place isn't crazy busy. The other bartender signed off on the free drink if you check in on Yelp. Yet when I ask suddenly I'm told it's only during Happy Hour. Don't be a douche and pick and choose who to vouch the offer for.Regardless great show. I'd certainly come back for the ladies.,,,

We had no idea it was a burlesque bar, but it definitely explained the pictures on the wall. Maybe it's because we came from a great speakeasy with great cocktails, but these at NB were just not that good. There were four of us, and none of us enjoyed our drinks. I ordered the Rump Shaker which has bulleit the whiskey, apricot jam, lemon juice, carpano antica, and bitters. The drink was just overly sweet and not to my liking. Others complained their drinks tasted a little watered down. Just not a place I can see myself visiting again.",1,,1

We were tempted by the free burlesque shows and the amazing happy hour! Jalapeno watermelon vodka? Yes please! The bartender, Jeff, definitely knew how to treat us well.

38,Eavan M.,"Port Jervis, NY",0,2,0,3.0,1/1/2018,"Spent New Years at Nurse Bettie with a small group of friends! It was my first time there but had heard great things about the bar. The place is small, but cozy and intimate. The biggest complaint I have is their choice in DJ. He was awful. I don't know if a friend was doing him a favor by hiring him on New Years but he played exclusively 80's and 90's music - which is absolutely fine and awesome. But when we wanted to suggest a song from the 80's or 90's he didn't have it! He was playing some weird stuff that really didn't vibe with the place. Would recommend seeing if he'll be there again next year before going back for an event. The bar itself, and the bartenders were very cool - 5 stars!!!",,,
39,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,5/5/2015,"I've been to this bar a few times- don't let the size fool you. While it's tiny they really utilize the space very well. There's a booth in the back that folds down into a small stage where the girls can do their thang. It's also on a fairly quiet block, so you don't get as much nonsense pouring in as you would at other bars in the area. The bartender there, Craig, is an awesome guy. He's super friendly, has excellent taste in music (think classic rock), and really knows his way around the bar. He's a LES local who can do some fancy stuff with the booze! He also has no problem keeping ya company if you come in alone (who drinks alone? Not me...). They have a great little cocktail menu, I think most are $12. The Hell on Wheels, a spicy tequila drink, is good. But the Pimm's Cup steals the show. So damn good! Ginger beer and Pimm's...it's a New Orleans drink that I had never tried before, and this is the only place I've come across it in NY so far. Standard beers, I remember Stella. The music varies depending on whose bartending. I've come when they were playing some swing and oldies, also punk. No matter what it's never top 40 crap. They also have free Nurse Betty matchbooks with customized art on them, which is something I think not enough bars do anymore. It's a great bar, and has a unique vibe different from the usual stuff in the area :)",2,,
40,Isabel J.,"Manhattan, NY",145,4,0,5.0,7/15/2017,"In the past couple months, Nurse Bettie has quickly earned the No. 1 spot in my rotation of NYC happy hour deals. Tucked away on the lower east side, the burlesque-themed bar is the epitome of class and old school decadence, but there's a catch: the drinks are CHEAP AF! Unlike many (all) of NB's neighborhood competitors, the bar in question offers $5 well drinks from 5-10 every day of the week (yep, weekends included!). Once happy hour closes, however, drinks remain affordable and made with the utmost attention to customer satisfaction. Most of NB's bartenders (excepting one particularly rude fellow--you'll know him when you see him), are true professionals who are both expert mixologists (excuse that heinous term) and friendly, easygoing guys.

Incorrect advertising is annoying. Dirty glasses EVERYWHERE. I removed 11 glasses from the back of the little bench we decided to sit on. Cleanliness should be a priority, especially if you aren't busy. Drinks were subpar at best. Not mixed well and garnish was sad. The decor and feel is trendy burlesque but the music was hard rap.And there's 1 unisex bathroom in the back and it was TRASHED. Filthy. ugh. I'm giving this place 3 stars for potential.

We each got a shot of grapefruit vodka ($5) and a lager ($4). Pretty sweet deal.The place is on the small side, with mostly seats by the bar and along the wall. There's a couch up front and one in the back, by the bathroom (which is clean, I knew you'd ask). Ambience is dark and intimate, until around maybe 10:30-11pm when it starts to get noticeably loud - the DJ starts doing his magic as the space fills up with late-night drinkers. But it's not unbearable - neither the noise level nor the crowdedness. As the night went on, I sipped on a NB-75 cocktail (which didn't taste overly fruity - score) as I watched 2-3 people casually moving their limbs around to the music. Yes, I guess you could say there's a dance floor - Nurse Bettie is what you make of it.All in all, a thumbs-up for the drinks and ambience. Good spot for romantic dates or girls night out (given you're not a party of 5+).p.s. 1 free drink after a purchase during HH upon Yelp check-in!

49,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,7/21/2015,"A cozy, intimate, and very suggestive cocktail bar. I had been here a few times when I had just moved to Manhattan a few years ago, and just visited again recently. Not much has changed, which is a good, nay great thing. They still play the same old school music, have the same fun, yet awkward-if-you-haven't-been-drinking-enough burlesque shows, and have the low-key vibe that can be turned (turnt) up to 100 mph in just a short moment. Not a bad place to bring a date who doesn't mind the low key night turned into a crazy experience.The bartenders are all very friendly and very liberal with the pouring of the drinks. The service can be a little spotty when it's busy (duh), so just be aware when you're there for a show or when it's peak drinking time. Prices are pretty standard for normal hours and the happy hour specials are decent. You can get a free drink with a Yelp check-in, and they're always pretty good about not pouring you something crappy.I like that Nurse Bettie seems to have gained a nice cult following, but isn't crowded to the point where I no longer enjoy being there. I've often found myself here randomly at LES happy hours or late, late night weekends for a drink before last call, and it's always a fun time.",14,8,13
50,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",78,342,32,5.0,12/11/2016,What a great bar.  The decor was great.  The Saturday night happy hour was great.  $5 tap bear and one free drink from yelp.  The bar is small and cozy.  The bar tender was very nice.  I highly recommend it.,,,

BUT I did come here one Halloween and it was kind of lame because not many peeps were in costume.. Boo-hoo. However, I must say definitely one of my favorite places for happy hour now. 5 bucks a drink and a Yelp check-in earns you a free drink during happy hour! YAAAASSSSS. Cory, the bartender, was cool people and quickly confirmed me and my girls' check-in offer, no hesitations, got me my coconut rum with pineapple juice quickly. Thank you sir. The girls and I had an extensive conversation with the bartender about vodka, the quality of vodka, and his favorite vodka. I don't care much about vodka but apparently my friend did (or she pretended to) but I appreciated how friendly he was and that he gave us a sample of some liquor that came up in the conversation. Cheers! The bar started getting crowded and eventually he was too busy to engage us in convo but Cory was cool, my drinks were refreshing and made me feel like I was on a tropical island made with real coconut rum (Malibu) with real pineapple juice (Dole). Whoop, whoop! Great HH.",3,1,3

Not very crowded at all, and pretty quiet, so definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a scene. In fact it's so intimate that I can't imagine how they squeeze a bunch of dancers in the space, but somehow they make it work I guess. They made me an excellent extra dirty martini, and they won my heart. Nurse Bettie is just what the doctor ordered!",5,2,5

The spot has a charm to it, with 1950s pin-up models on the wall, candles, couches, and just the right dimly lit mood. I went with the nurse who loved me, which was a mixed with green tea vodka, lime juice , mint and served over rocks.  I'll def. come back and check out the happy hour (great yelp check in offer with that by the way) and I'm also curious to see the burleseque show during the week.",3,2,2

Different dj yes and it was obvious. ( dj: thirty something Beardo playing house/techno and rap music ) (( hello this is not Webster hall ))Any good dj knows the key to a good night is to read the crowd and keep them engaged. No one was moving - no one was in anyway moved by the music playing in the background.  I tried to give the dj an opportunity to redeem himself by suggesting something decent that might bring him to the creative less generic world but sadly he wasn't even aware of who FKA twigs was, nor was he friendly or in anyway engaging with his fellow patrons. Isn't the job of a dj to keep the crowd involved and interested. In the sad two hours spent there I watched the crowd slowly diminish...  : ( DJ FAIL.",1,1,

I really loved the music they played:  No rap, no hip hop, no techno the nite i went, which was either a Friday or Saturday.  It was kind of light punk, maybe 80s ska type if that even makes sense.  The crowd was cool too....except  there was this one weird couple that looked like they were looking for a party to join them in the after hours, ha!  They had this serious look on their faces staring everyone down and whispering to each other every once in a while....weird.  Maybe they were vampires, idk.

63,Avi S.,"New York, NY",12,98,27,4.0,12/13/2015,"So two friends and I randomly popped up here on a Wednesday night, and because of the shows here this place was packed on a Wednesday. First thing you notice its a really small, cozy type of place. The stage is all the way in the front so you'll see people standing on the couches and whatnot to see the show. Drinks here are nothing special, standard bar drinks. People really come here for the burlesque show. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but I definitely had a good time here. My only quarrel is that sometimes you'd feel a bit inclined to tip the dancers when they walk around, which I understand why they're doing it but can create a uncomfortable dynamic.",2,,
64,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",314,307,317,4.0,9/22/2015,"Alright, I really really enjoy this place. A VERY small place with two tables. An old fashioned, dreamy, cozy, ambiance with brick walls, dim lights (very dark), and painting of suggestive burlesque dancers on the walls. We came right before the free burlesque show started, and it was PACKED. We were squeezed in like sardines, and it was very uncomfortable. However, I was incredibly impressed with how attentive and speedy the bartender was considering the crowd. My bestie and I ordered a few stoli O's with cranberry which were incredibly strong and provided for a very fun night. The strong drinks and show make up for the uncomfortable spacing. I had never seen burlesque before, I have to say that the show was INCREDIBLE. So much fun, the women were so talented, the host was terrific, and there was an intermission so we managed to secure a spot right in the front when the crowd left to go outside. I cannot believe that this little, tiny, place puts on such an incredible performance! This place is so unique and fun, where else would you find a place like this!? Only on the lower east side! We had such a great time!",4,1,3

Its a small cozy place with two tables and couple of couches. Its really a small place and was fully packed.I couldn't not see the stage, so the bouncer told me i could stand on the couch and see the show. That was really nice of him, i could see the whole show.The staff is nice and friendly, the girls who were performing were amazing. Awsome dance moves! Bar is very reasonable as compared to other bars in same neighbourhood.The best thing about this place is there is no cover charge. Tips are appreciated and they deserve too.Definitely will be going there soon.",2,2,1
66,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1075,1948,46,3.0,6/4/2014,"I like this place, came a few months ago and yet the memory still sticks out in my mind, so that is probably a good thing. I remember I was meeting a friend here, friend was late, but that never bothered me. Sometimes I like that my company shows up late. Gives me a chance to explore the place on my own, chat up the bartenders, size up the clientele, admire the decor, basically do my homework before endless chatter ensues with friends and others. The bartender was a local, grew up in the LES, told me that the neighborhood has changed a lot (Read: gentrification). Bartender had tons of friends stopping in to say hi and just ""talk story."" Animals and all. Yea, love this city. Dogs and cats get a lot of love here. Animals mingle among us in bodegas, bars, brunch, etc. And he was exceptionally good-looking. But that is just run-of-the-mill New York. Gosh, I am pretentious ain't I? Nah, I just like eye candy...all the time. I do remember though I gave the bartender a Hamilton, and for some reason, he seemed to forget he owed me some change. Happy hour was all night, so my beer was $6. I mean, I was going to tip him well, but maybe he was a space cadet or what, but the whole interaction was interesting. Was he a hustler or what? We will never know. Maybe he thought I was paying him for his sparkly eyes lol...I didn't come on a Burlesque night, and from the other reviews, I don't think I will be coming on those nights. The place is small, so if you got everyone and their mother-in-laws in here, not sure I could deal with the madness. But definitely come here on an off night, like Monday or Tuesday night. Sidle up to the bar, chat up the handsome bartender (watch your Hamiltons and whatnot), enjoy a beer, and then fire up your space craft and head out to another hip spot in LES, cuz there are so many...",10,5,7

68,Vineet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1848,971,1636,5.0,3/19/2012,"Nurse Bettie brings to my mind how a small place can be so optimally utilized. Trust me this place was a complete surprise to me when I visited it first time. Located on a tiny bylane of LES, this place lives it upto all the hype and excitement around it.The first time I went here was with a group of yelpers during our crawl session in LES. This was our last spot of the day, by that time many people had dropped out of our group. We walked in here expecting nothing on a Wednesday night but were surprised to see a live burlesque show going on. The performers were sweet, naughty, humorous and made sure everybody out in the audience had a nice time.Second time I went here on a Thrusday evening but reached very late but still didn't pay cover to get in. I guess they don't have any cover on Burlesque show nights. The place was buzzing with people, mostly were LES hood regulars. The presenter for the night gave a really nice performance. Yelp check in got me a free drink!! Moscow mule was really awesome.It is now one of my favorite bars nestled in the Lower East Side. They have some great specialty cocktails and  fun music.",8,1,8

70,Brooke S.,"New York, NY",105,30,0,5.0,8/10/2015,"I LOVED this place.  Best bachelorette party ever!  We reserved a table (there are only 2 tables available), and we had a great view of the dancers if they danced in the back, which is by the front door.  If they danced up front, it was harder to see because everyone stands.  That's probably the only downside, but luckily they are all about you standing on the booth to get a better view.  They called up the soon-to-be bride and had her perform a dance, which she nailed.  Then she nabbed a free drink!  The various girls have ""themed"" dances, and Ms. Barbara Streisand totally nailed her part.  I was super happy and impressed with all the ladies and their dancing.  The alcohol is pretty darn good as well.  You can get themed drinks or beer, and I tried a watermelon wheat beer for the first time here.  It was most excellent (I know, I was also surprised!). This place is super cute and quaint.  They utilize the space well, and it seemed to attracted a really fun crowd.  So, bring your dollar bills and have some fun!",2,1,2

I wouldn't spend my entire night here. It's just that kind of place. Extremely chill and laid-back. I like that you can check-in on Yelp for a free drink and they have happy hour all night long everyday (like midnight or beyond). The drinks are not particularly special nor strong., actually they are so watered down! I hear they have burlesque shows Thursdays and Friday nights but other than that, this place has been pretty empty everytime I come here. I'm sure ill return at some point, but it will continue to be a stop-and-go sort of place. Nurse Bettie? More like Nurse Boring :/",9,4,4

This show is for YOU.The most awkward part is if you have to go to the potty.The restroom as in 1 bathroom is located next to the main stage.Good luck mosh pitting through the crowd to get to it.But despite it all, the crowd was lively.20's-30's crowd.Good looking girls for the guys.Solid fellas (even a few Brits in the house) for the ladies.Come stacked and ready to have a GOOD TIME.I feel like tonight is gonna be a GOOD...Night.",2,3,

I've only had the well drinks and beers here (and a Black Russian--not technically a well drink!), since those are the drinks on special, so I can't testify to the cocktails. I'm giving four stars as opposed to five since the Black Russian was $9, which I think is a bit steep (although it's probably standard now). Also, the noise level can vary wildly based on who's manning the music. Edit: I forgot that one time, when I asked for gin well-drink recommendations, the bartender (whose name escapes me) made me an original creation for $5 that was more complex than a traditional well drink. Very nice.",,,

The LES as you know by now is home to a bunch of great divey to regular bars with great prices, and are different sizes. I will say this: this place is on the smaller end of the spectrum. I mean REALLY small. I came in here a week or so ago with fellow yelper Bobby C. and it was the first time i'd actually come here. There wasn't any burlesque happening but from the size of the place I was thinking: now how would they even have a burlesque show in this super small space?

76,Marlon T.,"Washington, DC",1180,2606,2124,4.0,1/17/2014,"On one of the random ""things to do in NYC"" lists you can find on the internet, I saw an entry, ""go to a burlesque show"" and it suggested the bar Nurse Bettie. Since we were staying in the LES, Nurse Bettie was just around the corner.Upon walking in, a stripping boy flung his sock at my neck. I didn't know what to do so I just threw it back. It was somewhat crowded but still possible to grab a bar seat. I ordered a beer, relaxed in my seat, and watched a burlesque show.I guess I've been to a burlesque show before in SF but it was like an event, not everyday. At that one, you had all the dirty sounding saxophone music while women in skimpy outfits were dancing (no stripping). I saw it as more of an art form than voyeurism. I'd say it's the same here at Nurse Bettie (but no one used the cool dirty sax music). It'll be some women (or men) doing a striptease all the way down to stickers covering their nipples usually. It was a contest that night based on whoever got the loudest cheers.I would for sure check out this spot if you have time. This is another reason why living in the LES is awesome because you'll get that NYC experience of a burlesque show in a random small bar. Pretty happy I stumbled upon that internet list--this bar and the other entries made my NYC experience very memorable.If you want an amazing dirty sax song, listen to this:Gato Barbieri - Europa",1,,

They were able to carve our a space for our group on the couches to drop coats and allow some to sit and catch up, without the music level making convo impossible. From what I remember, cocktails were decent and poured with a heavy hand. The bartender was very accommodating and made sure you were 100% happy with your drink.We stayed til about 11, leaving just as it was getting packed. While the space is small, it's super cozy with warm, dark decor. The crowd was a good eclectic, mix of people in their late 20s to early 40s - thankfully sans the typical douchebaggery and correlating convos you find dotted around the LES.I can't speak to their burlesque shows but definitely a perfect little lounge bar that we will be returning to.",1,,

Awesome ambiance, I love the lighting and the huge pin-ups on the wall, and while it wasn't empty by any means, it didn't feel overcrowded. My only issue was with the volume of the music. I love to jam out, don't get me wrong, but to be sitting a foot away from someone and have to scream at them is a little unnecessary. We ended up wandering into No Fun afterwards and encountered a similar problem, but given the younger crowd and crazy dance floor there, I'd expect it. Nurse Bettie doesn't have that, doesn't need to be that, doesn't deserve to be roped into that category. Tone it down and we'll be back for sure!",,,

The ladies that performed here did their thing and were pretty entertaining.The only reason I am writing this review though is to make it known that the bartenders here detract from the experience. I seem to have experienced the same thing that a few people have written about, as my girlfriend and I made drink orders and got completely ignored. An almost identical story: the guy bartender wearing glasses listened to our order, then proceeded to walk out of the bar and never addressed our order again.

85,Amaya S.,"Los Angeles, CA",851,513,894,2.0,10/24/2012,"I stumbled into Nurse Bettie (literally, my heel got stuck as I was walking in) waiting for a friend.  I was initially impressed by the small space and decided to get a drink or 2 (more like 2).  It was early so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I know this is normally code for depressed maniac or hooker but I was neither (at least that night).There was a sprinkling of people there, and one lady who I assume was going to be in the show later. Otherwise she had on that godawful wig for the heck of it. Also, to the couple who couldn't keep their tongues out of each others mouth..... YUCK! I'm sounding more and more like a depressed maniac aren't I?::::::::::SERVICE::::::::::This is why I've rated the Nurse so low. The service, sucked.  I'm a chatty gal, not overly chatty, but when I'm alone at a bar I like to spark up conversation. The bartender couldn't have been less interested in providing that aspect of customer service. She was more occupied with staring into space. Id much rather have a average drink with good service then a good drink with bad service.  :::::::::DRINK::::::::::I had a spicy margarita which was good.  I love spicy drinks.  And I had a cucumbery drink that was not so good.  But I drank it anyway cause it was STRONG. Yes!!!!!I didn't stay to see the show, so no comment on that.  Cool place in the LES but the bartender needs a shot of espresso",1,1,1
86,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,5.0,3/2/2012,"In an era when many new bars open up and try to cram as much modern technology into every nook and cranny like some Vegas mega-sports-bar-ultra-lounge Frankenstein monster it is surprisingly refreshing to walk into a place such as Nurse Bettie.Like a throwback to the 1950's Bettie Page style pin-ups. Simple, chic, and sexy with free burlesque shows on Wednesday and Thursday nights performed by some pretty talented and hot temptresses. You can almost picture this place full of men in fedora hats and women dressed to the nines back in the day drinking proper cocktails while enjoying the visually arousing entertainment on the stage.Nurse Bettie is a small, cozy, and intimate spot. On many nights this place is jam packed with patrons taking in a few cocktails - especially on the nights when performers take to the stage in all their feather and glitter glory. Dimly lit with not much seating save for a few benches and bar stool seating. Mirrors and retro pin-up pictures adorn the brick walls. Small stage setup to the side of the bar area. Everyone is here for a show, and some even become part of one whether they mean to or not. It's all part of the world that Nurse Bettie invites you into.What Nurse Bettie lacks in stature she makes up doubly with ambiance, as there are very few places like this in our rapidly becoming gentrified city. Not many spots where you can walk in the door, see a sexy girl dancing on a small table next to it in retro-pinup gear, order a cocktail such as a Moscow Mule, and then take in a terrifically bawdy burlesque show. The bartenders here do a good job slinging the booze. Only about five quality beers on tap, and around six featured cocktails such as the Mule, Au-Pear, Ginger Martini, Cucumber Margarita, Pimm's Cup, and Aperol Negroni. Be advised that these drinks pack a punch and they don't skimp on the booze here. The Nurse does a wallet friendly nightly happy hour featuring $4 well cocktails and draughts all night on Sun/Mon, from 6PM-10PM on Tues-Thurs, and from 6PM-9PM on Friday/Sat. Bring a friend, bring a date, unwind after a long day at work - Nurse Bettie will get your heart racing and your blood pressure pumping! She might even offer up some mouth to mouth and a spanking if you are lucky enough!",21,12,20

It is a 1950's style pin-up burlesque bar complete with live shows and awesome drink specials. This place makes me want to don my finest Dita Von Teese ensemble and grab some girlfriends and head here for a ridiculously fun evening. I never even knew a place like this existed in New York. Mind blown!The Yelp group trudged in here after 11. At least I think it was after 11. Things are a little fuzzy at this point as I had seriously underestimated the strength of the drinks at our previous bar (which was Hotel Chantelle in case you wanted to know). All I do know is, there was a naked woman singing ""When You're Good to Mama"" on a stage in the back using a giant feather fan to taunt and tease the crowd as she flashed us her perfectly tweaked nipples. Around the room were other burlesque dancers who weren't completely naked, i.e. they wore panties and sequin tassels. I apparently made a comment to one of these dancers as they were making their way to the stage. This caused her to stop, talk to me, and then proceed to tell the naked dancer on stage what I had just said... who THEN repeated it over the microphone and pointed at me in the audience.Uhhhhh... honestly I still don't remember what I said to this woman but the resulting look she gave me will be etched in my memory forever. I couldn't tell if she wanted to passionately strangle me or have sex with me. Either way, I'm coming back to Nurse Bettie for my next checkup.",6,9,8
88,Andrew C.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,65,13,4.0,3/9/2015,"Definitely need to come back for the burlesque shows. This place is TINY- I couldn't imagine this spot when it's actually packed. A small seating area on the left when you walk in, with about 6/7 stools around the bar, a small standing area and a small stage in the back of the room. But the couple times Ive been in there have been at the end of a night in the LES and I am always pleased by whomever is bartending or the locals chilling at the bar. Everyone is friendly and the vibe is just right.",,,
89,Rose Mary C.,"Bronx, NY",13,7,1,2.0,1/18/2014,"Went this past Wednesday night for a bday and must say the show was great! The burlesque dancers were friendly and the hostess was very funny and had an amazing voice.BUT....the bartenders were douche bags! First asked one for a Malibu (coconut rum) and pineapple, he then comes back and says we have no Malibu but I can make you something similar. He then proceeds to tell me they have flavored vodkas. I'm like no I want rum, he then makes me a rum and coke which is nothing like Malibu and pineapple. I tell him I wanted something similar and proceeds to tell me that I never asked for pineapple and argues with me. Wtf? Then, I leave my tab open. When I go to back I ask the available bartender (a different one) that I want to close my tab. He goes 'who the fuck are you?' I'm like excuse me who are you talking to. He's like I don't know you so how am I supposed to give you your tab. I said there's ways of asking a customer their name and that's not one of them. He said well next time you should go back to the bartender that knows you. I'm like you don't know me to talk to me like that. I was obviously pissed off as I don't take those jokes lightly. He then gives me some postcard to write my info down and I ignore it. I would have given them more stars but the rude and inept bartenders fucked it up!",10,2,2

My interest was piqued however when I saw the Pickle Martini - this sounds more like me!The drink includes gin, Pickle Guy's pickle juice, dry vermouth and fresh black pepper. I was shocked at how much I loved the drink! I always wanted to be cool and like dirty martinis, but whenever I order them I don't like them. This, however, was SO DELICIOUS! It was more a hint of pickles than overwhelming. Really balanced, a bit salty, but I love salty. Make sure to order a nice tall glass of water with it! Yum! New favorite!",1,,

Updated review","NB has become a regular stop for us in the LES and MLK weekend was no exception. We met and chatted with the owner (Stephen) who was a gracious host and an interesting guy. We really enjoyed talking with him. The mood in NB is laid back and intimate. The drinks are well=made and unique for the cocktail set. While the space is small, it's big on making you feel comfortable and unwinding. HIGHLY recommend Nurse Bettie!",,,

I did (and so my Twin Elle and my Dearly friend Nina).  They are very talented Dancers, I call it Art. Creativity and a way to make you admire the show.Cocktail drinks are pretty strong for the price they are charging (Specially if you buy the Yelp Deals that's even BETTER!).  Every cocktail has a great kick in it (from fruity, to citrus, to Bitter). So make sure you know what you want to order...Place is pretty small, but enough to fit 30-40 people (pretty tight).  I recommend to stay as close to the stage as possible to get a great view of the sensual dancers.",7,5,11

The stage is fairly low so if you are under 6; and more than half way back in the small room, you cant see much unless you stand on chairs and sofas, and even then you wont see any of the floor work, etc. Great vibe and fun time but if you really want to see everything get up close early!",1,,

Plus, when you check in for the first time, you get a free drink with a purchase. I will be saving that for the next time I go.The bartender was nice and he new his stuff. I was impressed with the drinks. My favs were the: Aperol Negroni - tasted like a spiced orange with some twangMoscow Mule - a very refreshing ginger beer version of a mojito.I wasn't a fan of the Au Pear. It was just soOo sweet, which he did warn us. But it's always good to try everything. About the environment: This place is a nice gem, considering with how sketchy the neighborhood is. Anyways, I was quite surprised with how small this place was. I guess I just had this glamorized idea of how it looked. Especially since I have a friend who talks about this venue all the time. That's fine, I got over it. We arrived early because its known this place gets very packed. Burlesque shows start around 10-10:30p. We arrived around 8pm. It was pretty empty. It started to pick up a little bit around 9ish.We sat along the wall, where the stools were fixed into the floor. Note to self: stools are not friendly for those with more than averaged round posteriors. They were very uncomfortable. Plus my fixed seat was in front of a pillar, making me sit in such an awkward position. Causing my leg to cramp up and fall asleep.Literally at 9:58pm, droves of men came pouring in from outside. They crowded the front and was packed! Wow. We only stayed for the first act of the show. The girls were good, it was just uncomfortable to enjoy ourselves after the crowd of really tall men. It wasn't the scene for us five-foot five-rs.Other than that, I will definitely go back. Probably just during the happy hour times, since specials are until 10pm on some nights.",,,

The stage is basically a corner that's raised up a bit, so it feels quite intimate. So intimate that if you have to use the one available potty, you're kind of all up in the performer's faces and dressing area. I can't comment on the bar much, as I only had one drink, but the draw here is really the entertainment.",1,,1
119,Olivia R.,"Hoboken, NJ",267,143,48,3.0,8/21/2012,"I came here for a friend's birthday on a Thursday night for the free burlesque show at 10pm. Maybe I had higher exceptions for the free show but it was just okay. As a former dancer (not stripper), I was expecting a little bit more talent. Some of the girls were not the best looking and/or were slightly overweight.. perhaps I'm more judgmental as a woman but if I am going to be looking at half-naked sex kittens, they should all be attractive enough to make me watch enviously and wish I was that hot. However, some of them were pretty good and very sexy but not across the board. The hostess sang midway through the show and damnnnnn that girl has a VOICE. Incredible performance.Last thing - the bartenders...So a bartender is a someone who specializes in making drinks, right? Making creative, fun, tasty, and strong drinks is their ""art"" so to speak and they should be elated when someone asks them to whip something up off the top of their heads I asked the bartender to make me something fruity and tasty, his choice. He got so angry and became disoriented at my request for him to come up with a drink on the spot. Um.. that's your job -- to be knowledgeable on alcohol and it should be easy for you to come up with something you learned in bartending school. I switched to vodka tonics when I realized the bartenders were clueless when it came to drinks beyond red bull vodkas or rum & cokes. Oh please bear in mind that the venue is teeny tiny and you should reserve seating if you are coming with a group.",5,4,1
120,John H.,"Manhattan, NY",64,22,4,4.0,9/18/2012,"Amazing happy hour prior to their burlesque shows on Wed or Thurs nights. This place is small and can get super crowded, so you may need to show up a bit early and stake out a space near the front of the stage if you really want to see the show. Luckily, with drinks being so affordable (including free when you check in via Yelp), the time before the show passes quickly in this relatively low key establishment. The bartenders are awesome, especially if you stay after the show and continue to keep the tab open. However, the other clientele can be hit or miss. I've had friends meet someone special as many times as i've had them thoroughly creeped out by some weirdo who is a little too worked up past the show. Therefore, I recommend going in groups so you can watch out for your friends. This is also a good place to take first timers to a burlesque show since there is no admission fee and there isn't enough space for the dancers to get very close to you and possibly make your friends blush or feel uncomfortably close. Still, a night here will give them bragging rights about the evening and make you seem like a very cool and knowledgeable host/guide in NYC.",3,,2
121,Alyssa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,46,69,4.0,10/11/2013,"Stumbled upon this place via Yelp and the boyfriend and I decided to check it out. First of all, this place is pretty small.. there's the bar area, two small sofas for a lounge area and then a little stage that fit the six people that were dancing on it. That's all a part of Nurse Bettie's charm though! It was small, but packed with people having a good time.Why did I fall in love with this place? The music, hands down. I'm not sure how the music is on a daily basis, but the night we came, they were gettin' down to motown and disco. ""I'm Comin' Out"" by Diana Ross won me over when we first grabbed our seats at the bar. Good vibes all around, friendly bartenders pouring stiff drinks..

I checked pictures of the place and expected it to have a downstairs that my fellow yelpers did not photograph, but that's all there is folks. Just a small bar area with a few tables here and there.I unfortunately came on a Saturday night...so no burlesque dance performance for us. I will try to make my way back here on a burlesque dance night if I could.The place seemed very alternative, hippie, with a little scenester feel to it if that makes any sense. Even though the place isn't really my scene, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the regular crowd there was not all that mad that there was a bunch of asians crowding up their bar.Bottom Line:Do not forget to check in, the place does have promotion if you check in via Yelp! The prices here were actually not too bad I paid $15 plus tip for two cocktails (when I'm used to paying $20 including tip) So I was glad the place was nice to my wallet.

Because Nurse Bettie is that hip, closet-sized, crimson lit bar with an intimately stellar burlesque show that has not and hopefully will never go anywhere. Nestled low on the edge of Alphabet City and the Lower East Side, it's off the beaten track enough to stay under the collegiate radar. It's a throwback to the days of fedoras and pinups, with a little bit of circus crazy thrown in. The sexy shows and truly cool bartenders lack pretense or attitude and it's just a damn fun place.

We walked in the place was very attractive, but it was all down hill after that. The place was very crowded, and there was one bartender. There was a couple making out in the corner and all of a sudden I turn around and the man making out with the patron was now behind the bar, bar-tending. Finally we get to order drinks. I ordered a dirty martini on the rocks, simple right? Well I taste it and it tastes as if the bartender did not put in the vodka. I simply asked the bald bartender to put a ""splash more vodka"" in which he responded with ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, ITS A FUCKING VODKA MARTINI"" I was in shock that this was the response I received, so I said to the bartender ""are you seriously talking to me like this right now I only asked for a splash more vodka"" in which he responded ""how about a splash more tip"" I then removedMy tip from the bar and then Mr. Personality decided to start pouring more vodka in to my drink and I said okay thats enough. He did not stop and continued to pour the vodka in to my drink until I moved the glass and the vodka then went all over the bar. Needless to say I finished my crappy drink and left. I defiantly will not be retuning to this bar, nor will I recommend it to anyone else. Hopefully the owners/manager sees this review and reconsidered their employees. Paying them to be rude to their customers, make bad drinks and get paid to hook up with girls... Seems like the owner is getting robbed too.",8,9,

And he texts me back to say 'oh I'm sorry, I just miss you so much and think about you all the time' and it's like are you mental?"" Jerry, the bartender would probably say this all in the span of 10 seconds. I'm not even kidding. She also carries a slight accent and besides being preternaturally thin,  she also talks super fast. Apparently it's a kiwi thing. Kiwi meaning New Zealand. I came here for yelp drinks and sampled the Au Pear, the Moscow Mule and the Aperol Negroni. Let's go from worse to best. Aperol Negroni - Just awful. An assault on the senses, there's no way to make a Negroni that isn't offensive to one's moral fiber, spirituality and sense of adventure. To be honest this was slightly less offensive than a regular Negroni, the Aperol makes it taste like 1940's cough syrup. Moscow Mule - A concoction with ginger beer, mint and I believe mezica. It tasted like a watered down Mojito. Plus side is Jerry serves it in a pint. I think you're probably getting the equivalent of 3 drinks in this one. Au Pear - The girliest drink there is and my favorite. I believe this was mainly pear juice and absolut citron (I'll have to check my notes). Lightly sweetened, neutral base and just delicious. Yes I know it comes in a martini glass and its orangeish with chunks of fruit floating around. I don't care.",1,2,1

We arrived around 230 and were advised they ran out if mint ( apparently they make a really great mojito when they actually have all the ingredients) my friend and I had a very different experience While ordering drinks i had the nicest hipster bartender ever ,though I'm not sure he could see out of his foggy fake square glasses . She on the other hand encountered grumpy hipster who seemed to annoyed by her presence. We only had one drink since the bar we really wanted to go to was just a few doors down .I did love the decor , inexpensive stoli drinks and my hipster bar keep.Hated the filthy ass bathroom and hipster man that was swinging his wolf purse around like it was couture.I still have my free drink check in on yelp so of course I'll go back.",,2,1

We arrived just after midnight on a Friday, and there were maybe five people in there. First, we asked the bartender for a scooby snack and he looked at us like we were stupid. I get that maybe not all bars make this drink, but when I googled and showed him in my phone what was in it, he laughed so arrogantly and said, ""Haha. No. I can't. We don't even have that."" He was just really rude about it. Then came my drink... I asked for raspberry vodka with lemonade. He made my drink with sweet and sour when I specifically asked for lemonade. There is a huge taste difference. It's happened before, which is why I always ask first if they have lemonade. So, not surprisingly the drink was way too sour. It was gross. I will never come back here simply based on the bartenders attitude.",,2,

If you stand in the center of the room you can touch all 4 walls!!), so I'll describe the interior as, cozy. It was a little crowded on a Saturday night, but not unbearable, and just right by the time 1am rolled around. The bartenders were super personable (and easy on the eyes).

This was a great place to catch up one-on-one, and it was nice and quiet.  (I really hate going to classy, cozy places like Vintry and having my conversation drowned out by blaring music.)  I would definitely come back here for a glass of wine or cocktail on my own.  It would also be a fabulous place to go after a nice dinner, before heading home.",13,,10

Makes sense, right?  Well, ""Mr. I am From LA"" doesn't seem to like it that we are there before he's changed the wipe board and finished opening up the bar.  He uses the ""F"" word various times and whines about his coworker opening up before 6pm.  We had one drink before we left for our dinner reservation.  3rd time here and can safely say I won't be back.  Who needs a cranky bartender who thinks he can be vulgar and rude to customers?

Updated review","Nurse bettie never disappoints me.Went here this Thursday around 9:40 pm on a girls night out. We were lucky to find a spot right by the stage and got $8 for two cocktails before happy hour ended. The place soon got crowded after 10:10pm and it was almost impossible to fumble your way from the door to the front.Burlesque was always great! The repertoire was different from Wednesday and felt more exotic. They've got a great vocal, three Russian performer who were sexy as hell, no joking, and a super funny Asian hostess. Ambiance was great. The bartender Alex was super cool as always and made STRONG drinks. All in all this place made my night, again.",1,,2

We came here for my birthday last year and they could not have been cooler about it. After a few free drinks and a birthday song, Calamity Chang brought me and my equally unsuspecting friend on stage to engage in an impromptu dance-off. Good times all around.Everyone should really see a burlesque show at nurse bettie's at least once. It's one of the few shows I have been to that truly cater to both the male AND female patrons. There is nothing sleazy about it - there is an art to each dance and the girls really have fun with it.",2,,1

We lucked out and scored the couch towards the back wall. The rest of the seating is bar stool only, which is a bummer. NB makes up for the less-than-ideal seating with the ambiance; it's so cozy and dimly lit. It's super chic - a great spot to take a date. Although, I can't imagine how busy and crammed NB would be on a busier night. It's so narrow! I wouldn't want to take a date into that. Or just myself for that matter.I waited at the bar for a few minutes before I was acknowledged by the bartender. A simple nod would have sufficed. He wasn't even helping another customer. Slightly frustrating, but whatevs. NB had a Yelp check-in offer. I wish more places that I've checked in via Yelp offered free stuff to their patrons. I've checked into A LOT of places - and, sadly - there haven't been many deals. Kudos to you, NB. I saved it for use at a later date because NB wasn't our first stop and it was getting late.

They even had free BBQs in the summer. They also have an awesome free Burlesque show with hot babes and one of those woman has quite a set of pipes.

I was trying to figure out where the burlesque dancers perform in such a tiny space. Sadly the bartender rubbed me the wrong way. I walked up to the bar to order and said ""Hi, how's it going?"" and his blunt reply was ""I'm going to need to see your ID."" Although I'm flattered to still be id'd, the way he asked was rude.

Or strike up a conversation.  The owner makes regular appearances and lives close by. It is a true neighborhood bar. The drinks are cheap until 10:00. $4 tap and rail. Can't beat that!

It's not just a random boob shake, each girl had her own routine.We went on a Yelp deal so that made it even better. Drinks are okay.

This place is small but fills up quick on a Thursday night at 10pm for the burlesque show. My friends and I sat outside and didn't actually see the show but it sounded like a lot fun.

182,Dennis R.,"Harrison, NJ",274,112,35,4.0,1/30/2013,I love this place the drinks are great and so is the burlesque show. Its always fun and I have introduced scores of people to this place. Its also something fun to do with a date and also something different to do. Its also a good place to go in a group and the people are pretty friendly ehre.,,,
183,Gene X.,"San Francisco, CA",528,1140,743,5.0,11/27/2009,"Hm, free drinks with a pasword & more free drinks with @foursquare checkins. What else do iPhone nerds need (or in my case, iPhone geek)?  Well they have pizza with your drinks early in the evening and the space is really nice - not that big but not too tiny so it's good for a few friends to take over almost with your own peeps.Plus Alex was bartendering the night my sister and I went and he pours nice strong drinks.  Definitely would like to come back here next time but I suspect they'll get too popular and discontinue the free drink password thing...",4,1,1
184,Brian S.,"Queens, NY",24,140,14,3.0,6/18/2012,"This place could have been better but for the fact that the bartender basically disrespected my girlfriend by not making her drink until about ten minutes later.  We arrived on a Saturday night around 9:30 or so and there was no more than five people inside.  I ordered a beer and she ordered one of the specialty cocktails.  The bartender gives me my beer instantly, but then goes outside to talk on his cell phone for five minutes, then comes back inside and talks to another patron for another few minutes, until finally turning towards us and apologizing for making the phone call.  He was trying to get someone to get over to fix the credit card machine.  OK, buddy.  Make the drink first then address your CC machine because without our drinks you don't even need to be concerned with my CC.  And another thing, if your machine is down, please tell me before I order my drink that you are taking cash only.  I hate having to leave a bar to wander around finding an ATM that is going to charge me an additional fee to take money out.Other than that incident at the beginning, this place could be a nice little gem.  They have a few couches plus some bar stools.  The music is excellent - its not your everyday Top 40 crap that you hear all day long on the radio.  They have a good mix of some oldies and other genres.  The drink prices are not too steep but not the cheapest either - probably about average.  I think they also have burlesque shows on the weekdays.  I've never been to one before but I'd come back to check it out sometime.Spend a few hours here and you could have a rough subway ride home, especially if you plan on taking the hellish J train.",1,,
185,Noor S.,"New York, NY",58,144,0,5.0,4/27/2010,I was having a mini-party with about 10 friend on Friday and was looking for a chilled out bar in the LES that would take a reservation for my group and have a fun but chilled out vibe- this was perfect!I was slightly stressed when i first got there because I had booked a table and when i got there there were none and the bartender said he thought i had cancelled my reservation. I quickly explained that I hadn't and he shoo'ed (literally!) one of the groups away and we got our table. Yay!!This place is especially nice before 11 before they have huge windows that they leave open and outdoor seating.. but alas at 11 the neighbors dictate that all the windows and doors are shut and the bar starts to feel a little smaller. Still really though. Perfect if you are a small group that mostly wants to chat but will also dance to a couple of songs. Really nice bartender that gave me free drinks all night (twas my birthday) and fun music.,1,,1
186,Katie H.,"New York, NY",2,21,7,5.0,8/26/2014,excellent show. such a great time. go early if you want a seat for the performance. bar fills up pretty quick!,,1,
187,Line B.,"Manhattan, NY",113,291,18,4.0,11/11/2012,"A cute little sexy burlesque inspired place. I do love the decor of this place and should I have a girls night out in this area this would be a place I would go to again. I also like that they do not mind if you take food with you as they do not sell food. Another really good thing is they have great specialty drinks that should be tried out at least one and an even better thing is for us Yelp users. If you check into this place on Yelp you will the first time you do it get the offer buy one get one for free special. Even better that it was happy hour where it was half price for a drink, so I paid $4 for 2 drinks, that is not a bad deal.",,,
188,Jacq O.,"New York, NY",52,40,4,4.0,1/10/2011,"So my husband and I just celebrated our 40th Grown and Sexxi bday at Nurse Bettie on Thursday night January 6th, and it was HOT! We had about 45 guests show up, but in addition to the regular crowd, it was packed!! The burlesque performers were captivating,,,enchanting,,,oooh lalalala...lol...Atomic wings and cupcakes from Pleasant Pastries made the night ultra special. Stephen was accomadating,,,Happy Hour until 10pm,,, the decor, the vibe and the pin up pics were awesome! Looking forward to my next visit to Nurse Bettie!",,,

198,Jools And Meg M.,"Manhattan, NY",232,8,0,4.0,12/10/2014,"This bar is so cool. Burlesque nights are fun, especially coupled with the longest lasting Happy Hour scene -- $4 drinks/drafts till a whopping 9PM! One of my favorite places in the LES. Everything's yummy about it.",,,
199,Erica L.,"New York, NY",60,310,0,2.0,7/6/2010,"I was with a group of 5 and we were the only people at the bar around 11 PM on a Monday night, plus the bartender and a few of his cronies.  We had a couple of rounds of drinks ($4 draft and well drinks all night long) and were having a good time, but the bartender and his friends started mocking our conversation.  We ignored them, but it put a damper on the evening.  Nobody wants to be mocked, especially by the people we're paying for service.Overall, cute ambiance with the retro paintings and lighting and of course the cheap drinks are awesome, but I don't think I'll go back.",,,
