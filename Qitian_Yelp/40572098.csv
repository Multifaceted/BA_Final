0,Dave K.,"Alamo, CA",31,169,285,4.0,5/2/2018,Great spot for a day drinking people watching cocktail!Total dive bar but a heavy hand and THE ONLY spot in NYC or SFO you can get a goose soda for $10!!!When wife is shopping in SOHO definitely come here.,,,
1,Kauai H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,6,5.0,10/24/2018,"If you are going to be a lounge lizard, this is the place to be one. I stopped in when a person in the neighborhood pointed to this corner bar on Spring St and told me I would be comfortable going in as a single female to read and address an urgent email while enjoying happy hour. The patrons and staff are friendly and welcoming. After a couple of cocktails I left behind my gym bag that I had hung on one of their bar hooks. The next day, even after hundreds came in and out of that bar that previous night, the bartender went down stairs where she retrieved my bag with a big smile. When I looked inside, everything was in it along with a couple of valuable items, including a rare jade bracelet I had taken off at the gym. I also had a very good time at Spring Lounge, obviously!",,,
2,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,1.0,4/9/2018,"Had heard good things about this bar, so we came to check it out on a Saturday around 4pm. Upon walking in the door this man who was seated off to the side basically shoved his whole upper arm into mine forcefully. I was pretty shocked, turned around to see what the hell, and he just says ""ID"". Maybe just say excuse me next time!? WTF. I am in my mid thirties and certainly don't mind being carded. I however do mind being touched in such a rough manor by a man when entering an establishment. It's also an issue if your door person is hidden so far off the entrance that he has to tackle people to check ids. None of the other three people I was with were carded after me. After that annoying experience, we entered a total hot mess scene that was overly crowded and so loud you would have to yell at the people you are with to hear them. It was like a frat house from NJ threw up in there. It has pretension of a SOHO bar without any personality. This is far from a good dive bar. We left after 5 minutes and I would never go back based on the scene alone, not to mention the unwanted touching.",3,2,1
3,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11030,4.0,10/11/2017,Spring Lounge is a NYC dive bar institution. You know it from the graffiti shark outside.Surprisingly great beer selection (they have cans of Sip of Sunshine!).Tons of mixed seating and a back room.BYOF friendly so bring that pizza with you. And they take credit cards.,2,,1
4,Patrice C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,69,152,4.0,5/20/2018,"Open early in the morning, I used to go to this bar to study when I was in college years ago and lived on the block. We stopped in for a drink before breakfast and ended up staying till lunchtime. The bartender was super laid back and there is free WiFi. There's a variety of beer and spirits and the patrons were open and fun but respectful. A guy next to us at the bar was studying and we chatted with him for a few minutes before letting him go back to work. Beer is beer is beer but the vibe of this place is great. Laidback, divey without being gross. Bathroom was very clean.",,,

6,Tiffany W.,"Manhattan, NY",60,12,13,5.0,4/23/2018,"Spring Lounge was my saving grace for a last minute large reservation for drinks for my company's staff outing. We were able to reserve the back room area for our group of 30 which was a perfect size space for people who wanted to sit and drink or stand and chat. Although the rest of the bar was super busy, the bartenders kept our drinks flowing with little to no wait time. I'll definitely be back!",1,,
7,Nina M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",159,230,96,5.0,7/6/2018,Great bartenders and chill vibe. Kind of takes you out of feeling like you're in the middle of SoHo. Reasonably priced and lots of beers on tap.,1,1,1

9,Michael H.,"Chicago, IL",473,643,393,5.0,9/23/2017,"This joint was one of my favorite stops in NYC!  When you walk in the door you can smell how old it actually is.. trust me & they open at 8am.  Great windows at every angle over look Little Italy, beautiful bar, ancient wood floors, awesome little tables by the windows as well as a ParTyiN' ""Nook"" make this place just amazing!  They have about 8 beers on the draft list heavy on the locals as well as a full bar.  Clientele seems to be heavy on the locals as well.. I witnessed a 90 year old man ParTyiN' at the bar & chatting with the tourists!  Service is great and they have great bartenders that pop up from the floor behind the bar; no your not seeing things.  The bar is a beautiful place.. must stop in SOHO!

10,Sabrina S.,"New York, NY",158,16,8,5.0,3/15/2018,"I have an absolute soft spot for this place, with its shark décor and all. The bartender I've seen a few times is also incredible and makes sure everyone gets a drink instead of standing around trying to get his attention for 10 minutes. (I will say, I went a few weeks ago, and that bartender sucked. He took about 6 shots while I was there, then spilled a pint of beer all over me.) Anyway, I love this little spot. It gets crowded and loud over the weekend especially, but it's a sort of cheery crowded. I would recommend it as a regular spot.",1,,
11,John M.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,216,83,5.0,2/18/2017,"After searching for a place to grab a quick drink with an old friend after an unexpected run-in, the Spring Lounge was a sight for sore eyes in an area that was full of crowded, tiny restaurants unfit for my simple, alcoholic needs.When the bathroom door has a sign indicating there is an early drinkers club that meets from 8am to 2pm daily - and immediately you know that there is probably more truth than humor to this sign - you know you're in a gem of a dive bar that many may call home.With no well liquor, a small but respectable draft list, dozens of news clippings and family photos on the mirror behind the bar, and some exposed brick in the back that is clearly from the 1800s (not merely an interior design decision), Spring Lounge is able to walk an interesting line between a place frozen in time and a modern, curated dive.With sharks strewn throughout the bar (a holdover from one of the previous owners I was told) and christmas lights abound, there is warm quality that surrounds the place and seems to equalize the men in suits, hipsters, old timers, and average Joes who all seemed to be in an unspoken pact of peace  as we all drank there late on a Monday night. If it wasn't already obvious - I am in love with this place. They didn't mind us bringing in a few slices from next door either, which was nice, and the tab ended up being pretty reasonable for a few hours of drinking (though admittedly I was sticking to Gansetts for most of the time).",,1,1
12,Sophie H.,"New York, NY",5,13,0,1.0,5/5/2018,"I live nearby and often stop in with my partner for a quick drink. My partner has frequented this place for years. We will never be returning however. Today I stopped in because I badly needed to use the bathroom. The bartender screamed hello at me twice as I walked in to the bathroom and continued to yell in a hostile tone ""oh you need to use our bathroom?"" ""You're welcome"". As If this wasn't enough for him, he continued to scream at me as I left ""thanks for your business, come again!"" And then ""MANNERS!"" ""MANNERS!"" I ignored him. Great way to scare off regulars and locals. Really unnecessary. There are no public bathrooms in NY and not only that but I am a frequent patron. Really rude and hostile management.",2,,
13,Scott G.,"Norfolk, VA",8,11,1,5.0,6/16/2017,"My kinda bar...good beer, cool vibe, and a smartass bartender.  Congratulated my wife for winning last week's wet t-shirt contest, and said that I was better looking than the guy she was with...thanked us for coming, then kindly told us to get the f#*~ out of his bar...perfect!  Awesome place for day drinking and people-watching.  If you don't have a sense of humor, you might wanna keep looking...",,2,
14,Michael L.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2,146,96,4.0,11/7/2017,Nice Neighborhood bar. Respectable choice of beers on tap.  If it wasn't for the one neighborhood drunk sitting at the bar it would have been a perfect place to be.,1,,
15,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1212,6223,4.0,3/23/2016,"Dive bar that can serve brews before Noon on Sunday (and serves from 8am M-S). Nice little twist there. Happy to say they have above average draughts as well. Prices aren't quite as dive-y as you'd hope, but still reasonable. There's a TV in the corner, should you need to watch the Manchester derby*, like I did last week. Manager was happy to put it on the tube, even though no one else but me really cared. It's been a bit empty in my visits here, but they've all been random afternoon sessions, so that's exactly the atmosphere I was hoping for. Overall, a cool spot to grab a drink and for some people watching. If you're into the no frills bar experience and shark decor, you'll enjoy yourself here. Bonus: while drankin they brought out a basket of bagels and spreads. * - We're pals if you know what this is",18,9,11

Not sure why, but it's shark themed and honestly, I gotta say I love it! Stopped in last night with a bud-- the bouncer was the man, the bartenders were attentive, but definitely not overbearing. They're got a great selection of beers and the bouncer told us that they change it up all the time, which I definitely appreciate.There were  ton of people there-- there's lots of seating at the bar, tall boy tables, and window seats/benches full of friends.

Free bagels and fixings today (Sunday) My only complaint with today's visit is that that bartender had friends from out of town stop in and all her attention was focused on them. Hey, ok, have a nice visit but if I have a $20 on the bar maybe it means I want another drink.",1,1,1

We're both 23 and I'm a US Army Veteran. We didn't even walk through the door before we were screamed at by the bartender ""We don't serve food here, you need to be 21 to get in here"" while about 15 fifty to sixty year old men started cackling at us. If you're a woman, please don't go into this establishment. Additionally, any bar that shamelessly turns patrons away at the door is no place I would recommend giving your business to. Way to respect your Veterans and women!",7,4,
33,Thalie A.,"London, United Kingdom",189,323,379,4.0,1/13/2014,"I used to spend far too much time here back in my 'stomping days'. Yes, far too many good times.Being away from it I was wondering if the magic would still be here. The neighbourhood vibe, the winning service, beer samples, juke box and overall dive attitude. Well, I can happily say, it's all still here ---- during the week!The customer service never lacks in here but the ultra cool locals vacate come Friday night making way for the annoyance of out-of-towners, college kids and those who have no idea what 'alternative style' is so make a mess of it.I stopped in around 12ish to try a new beer and mull over past sessions. Immediately greeted by Owner #3 (lol) I sampled the Empire Cream Ale. Tasty. I indulged in a half pint and a few giggles with other patrons. Spring St. has added free hot dog Wednesdays and free bagel Sundays to their arsenal...although this place never needed any gimmicks because it's the owners, staff and locals that make it so brilliant.The place has gained extra bar space but other than that, it is virtually the same place that I would walk into & stumble out of all those years ago.I cannot help but smile being in Spring St. Lounge. A solid 4 stars!",35,34,34

42,Katherine C.,"Manhattan, NY",112,33,6,4.0,2/14/2015,"I go here too much. 4 stars because the bathrooms are pretty offensive. Considered a dive bar probably because it is dark, dirty and sells PBR-which is fine by me. It does get very crowded but if you are able to grab seats on the benches along the walls then you are set. Mostly a younger crowd...early 20's-early 30's tops I'd say. However it is a pretty relaxed atmosphere. I almost always have a positive experience here.Bonus- They have a cell phone charging station where they have every single charger you could possibly need. Just don't get too drunk and leave your phone there because it's super annoying having to run back there at 3:45am to claim your life force before closing time. Double bonus- The pizza place directly across the street never disappoints. **They have a $20 minimum on credit cards, but there's an ATM at the duane reade right down the block.",1,,

My group came on in and luckily found a table all the way in the back, next to the large windows. The staff was cool about even bringing in my puppy, who was in carrier, as long as he was behaved. What you see is what you get with this place: a no frills bar with funky decor, an upbeat crowd, an awesome selection of draft beer, whiskeys and single malts. The spot we claimed was perfectly positioned so I could still catch glimpses of the Rangers playoff game. They even allow you to order/bring food in, which is what my group did (we got some hummus and felafel from the place across the street) Four hours later and many shots of Jameson, beers and glasses of Bulleit bourbon in, we were hammered, happy and ready to call it a night.

I've been here a few times and every time I've gone I've found friendly and interesting people to talk to.

The place is always packed on wekeend nights (gets super packed around 9:30-10pm) but if you get here before ""bar rush hour"" you'll be able to grab a nice spot either in the front or the back of the bar. The place is super laid back and great for people watching. I guess since it's so close to soho it draws a good looking crowd... very plaid shirt kind of place.My only complain is that the place only has two TVs. I wish I could make this my ""lets go see that awesome Yankees game"" bar but unfortunately that is not the case. I have to go down the street to firefly for the sports bar kind of vibe.Anyways, I love this place, highly recommended for a good time.",,,

65,Craig S.,"Santa Monica, CA",63,31,35,5.0,3/31/2013,"Around before I was born, the walls are covered with local history. The bar has an atmosphere that will make you feel at home right when you walk in. Rule of thumb, dont expect fancy...if you want a nice bathroom, go elsewhere, there are plenty of bars in the area to cater to your desire to pee in luxury. The bouncers and bartenders are quite possibly the nicest people around. If you frequent the place, they treat you like family. If you are new, they treat you well and are always friendly. There does tend to be a frat bro/sorority girl crowd that attempts to cloak their snobbish tendencies...but they usually leave after a beer or two. If your easy-going, don't want NYC scene or prices, and just wanna sit with friends, talk, have a drink and take it easy, this is your spot. As a side note...This place had an epic Pre-Sandy party and stayed open until the power went out....but, the true sign of how awesome/good of people they are, they kept the bar open all week, literally every other business was closed in NoLita and they served up cold beers on Ice until 10pm every night, in pitch dark/post-apocalyptic Downtown. If that doesn't win your respect and loyalty, I dont know what will. This has and will remain forever the best bar in NYC, hands down.Pros: EverythingCons: People bringing pretentious attitudes to this type of establishment",1,,1

I was asked to ""get the fuck out"" after walking in with 2 of my other coworkers when gathering for a daytime meeting earlier today. I sat down and took out my computer and hoped that I would be able to connect to the wireless network. After being unsuccessful in this attempt, I walked up to the bar to ask the bartender what the wifi network is. He said there isn't any network which was s a lie because the guy sitting next to me was using his computer. Then after I attempted to ask the guy next to me, the bartender screams out at the guy and tells him not to tell me. Then the old bartender goes on a profanity laced tirade saying that  since we couldn't spend $2 to get a club soda, he wouldn't allow us to use their wifi. Sir, can I set up to handle business first? I had full intention on purchasing a whiskey after I was set up. Then he continued to say ""get the fuck out"" to myself and my other guests.I was there to have a meeting with some business clients and it wound up being very embarrassing.I hope no one goes to this place and has this experience ever again.

During my first five minutes I decided this was a great dive bar. They have a pretty nice beer selection with a very friendly bartender. Most of the crowd appeared 21-45 in age and there were multiple places to sit and relax!  We enjoyed the bar so much we went for a second night. The bartender remembered what we were drinking.Both nights we went were around 11:30PM and that was during the week. It was busy but you could still move around the bar.  Yes the bathroom is small.Overall this is a great bar to watch the game or meet up.  I'll definitely stop again!  Keep up the good work,",,,

I take full responsibility for being an idiot and forgetting to sign out (I wasn't even drunk, just forgot.) But the manager could not have been worse to deal with. I thought they had overcharged me and called to get an itemized receipt - was not accusing them of doing it on purpose, just wanted to see why the hell it cost so much. She immediately goes on the defensive, saying ""first of all, our bartenders would never do that type of thing."" Okay? I never said they would. I just wanted a receipt! And perhaps this is common practice in bars but they did not keep the receipt of my bill because ""there is no reason to."" I can think of a few. I tell her I don't think I drank that much so we go through what I ordered - four beers and two shots split between two people - ""um that IS a lot."" Surprising comment coming from the a manager of a bar that opens at 8am on weekdays. Turns out the $50 they charged me was accurate mostly because of fee that tack on for credit cards, $8 shots of whiskey (no well, all shots are minimum $8) and expensive drafts.Definitely never returning.",2,1,

I guess soho sets the bar bar kind of high, so since this bar has wooden chairs and some 'flair' on the walls, it automatically gets classified as a dive bar...I would argue this is more of a 'beer' spot since they have a pretty sick collection of beers despite a lot of the crowd sticking to bud light bottles and jameson shots (...not that there's anything wrong with that). Regardless of classification, they do have beers listed on a chalkboard with abv/pour size (which I like), they also have a lot of wooden seating/space, and I would describe the crowd/bar staff as eclectic and friendly (which I like). It's a great atmosphere to sit around, drink a beer, and have audible conversations in a convivial setting (yes, I broke out the word convivial. what of it???).The single/lockless bathroom and the drink prices (reasonable but not divey), bring this down to a still-solid 4-star establishment.",,1,

The place got packed very quickly (on a Wednesday night too!) and soon people were vying for chairs.The beer list was great and not expensive, well drinks were around 7$ and the bartenders were very attentive!The crowd was interesting, a good amount of different people: old, young, hipsters, businessmen, chicks.

After battling the crowds on a recent trip to NYC I was desperate to find a non-touristy reprieve, and luckily we stumbled upon The Spring Lounge!It was the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and there were a few people lounging around in the bar, which was incredibly cozy for a dive bar. The floors, chairs, benches, and tables were all wooden, giving it a unique feel. We decided to grab a spot at the bar and have a few beers. They have a pretty decent beer offering on draft and in the bottles, and the average beer is roughly $6-$7, which isn't bad. They also have a decent whiskey offering, but I noticed that the majority of people were sticking to beers.The bartender was incredibly friendly and was talking to all the people at the bar (locals and tourists alike). He mentioned that you can bring food in from the restaurants surrounding the bar, as The Spring Lounge doesn't have any food offerings.If I'm ever in the area I'll be back, it was a clean and friendly establishment and a great breath of fresh air for the area.",,,

When I asked what appeared to be the bar manager what was up, she said they don't do happy hour on Wednesdays because of the free hot dogs.Well,  #1, the free hot dogs are barely decent and worth about 10 cents. #2, it's time to update your website.",4,,1

He proceeded to ask us what we wanted to drink and kept them coming (drinks were good btw). We chatted and laughed and had a great time. The atmosphere is very laid back, ppl were friendly and cool with each other (maybe it was all the booze?) The bar/lounge itself wasn't too crowded when we arrived, but got considerably filled as we were about to leave. However, there was still plenty of space to move around without being molested. Note: the big ass moose head over the outside door of the bathroom might freak you the fuck out, especially if you're tipsy/drunk. Other young men approached our group, asking us to take pics with them or just making small talk, which made the Original young man who accosted us a bit possessive but not in a bad way.

It was then I realized what was wrong with it all. My latest visit wasn't too bad for a weekend night, which has helped me bite my tongue. Ultimately, I wanna believe they're down at heart, but know that putting up with tourists and transplant a-holes is how they're gonna get money on weekends.

And really, it'd be nice if they could finally put a lock on the men's bathroom door. Fair warning:  There are two very small single bathrooms, one for men, one for women, and if someone opens the door on you--well; it's all you for all to see.

105,Sarah C.,"Arvada, CO",0,72,0,4.0,12/15/2011,"Not sure why this is called a lounge.  It's basically a treehouse located inside a building.  Wood everything, with interior design that looks like a 1950s era 12-year old boy's fantasy, and I mean that as a compliment.  About as friendly and unpretentious as you can get.  I wouldn't go to a bar on my own (not a drinker) but with friends, this is a great choice.   It's small and comfortable, the music is decent (i.e. I actually recognized a few of the songs), and there's no need to look super glam.  Definitely a come-as-you-are situation.  The people are all just regular folks sitting around, hanging out - a pretty diverse crowd, actually:  a few hipsters, a few tech geeks, some Wall Streeters in suits, some older surfer looking people - really a range.  Amazingly, I didn't see any ""hey baby""ing going on, which was great.  There's nothing wrong with someone cute saying hello, of course, but no one wants to fend off drunken handsiness at every turn.  Spring Lounge isn't the kind of place where you'll have to worry about that.  If you luck out and can sit on one of the window benches, you'll have a great view of both the inside and the parade of folks walking by on the street.  Next time I'm in NY I'm going across the street for pizza and stopping in after dinner.",,,

But it didn't stop me doing it one unexpectedly crazy Friday night at one of my favourite local haunts - the shark of all sharks - aka Spring Lounge.

Yes QueenB is Queen of this place- they go way back (probably spends more time here than in our lovely home down the street) and lucky I'm pretty good with ""in-laws"" and think they're totally awesome it would be a somewhat awkward situation otherwise. I was first initiated here even before I moved into my neighbouring-apartment, of course QueenB nicely selected this location for me to drop off my deposit check and pick up the new keys... all I can say is it's lucky I got through the front door a couple of weeks later as I have no idea how I even made it back alive let alone with both key sets thanks to Dan's ""complimentary"" whiskey shots in between pints of IPA...Staff are all superduper coolcats. I wish I were around more during daytime hours to benefit from their FREE food giveaways- hot dogs, chili, chicken, bagels...

A round consisting of a modified black and tan, made with Guinness and Magic Hat #9, and a pint of Magic Hat #9 was $12, which is decent. The beer was perfect in temperature and carbonation.

155,Joe C.,"Montville, CT",28,1053,1821,4.0,1/1/2009,"This small bar can sometimes get loud and crowded, but it's got a warm unpretentious atmosphere often not found in NYC bars.  If you didn't look out its large glass windows, you wouldn't think this place was in the city, but rather located in some small college town.  It's that type of bar. The beer prices are affordable and the beer selection offers something for everybody.The location is great; between Little Italy and SoHo.  It's always good for a few drinks, before or after dinner on Mulberry Street.",1,,1
156,S. K.,"San Francisco, CA",49,63,0,4.0,11/28/2006,"I concur with the description of The Spring Lounge as a Neighborhood Bar and not a dive bar.  Very apt.But, the best thing about The Spring Lounge is that they have Oasis in the jukebox.  Whats not great about that?? Unfortunately the album is their only US commercial success Whats the Story, Morning Glory, but that album is filled with great singalongs that are great for bars!!  The only problem is that I've been twice and never ended up hearing the songs that multiple quarters were invested in.   Somewhere out there Champagne Supernova was played twice for me but, without me.  Frown.",1,,1

161,Lara R.,"New York, NY",155,362,81,4.0,1/3/2008,"I liked this place. We found our way over here when walking to hit SoHo from the EV. I liked that they were carding oh at 2-3pm on a Saturday.

162,Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",848,673,374,4.0,4/3/2011,"So, my mom and I came into this bar because A. John Mayer comes here and B. We wanted a drink. The bartender, Tracy, was awesome and super cool and friendly. It's really really crowded when you walk in but it's worth it. The music, first of all, is amazing. I walked in and they were playing The Cure which slowly transitioned into David Bowie, Talking Heads...etc. My gin and tonic was fucking fantastic and my mom loved her Liberty pale ale. It's a great place to stop at and get a drink and if you're there at night, a lot of celebrities frequent the place. We're actually going later on tonight again just for another round. Great place.",,,
163,Kristen G.,"Madison, NJ",130,30,4,3.0,12/6/2010,"Spring lounge is the kind of place that is not a final destination. From my experience, I have been there a few times. The bar tenders are really nice and the people there are friendly. It is a cute dive bar that is usually a good place to meet up with people before going north or south of Spring St. Apparently it is also on a good corner to catch a cab before the night is through.",,1,1

How crowded this place gets is insane. I guess it's probably a great place for 18-24 year olds, but if you're looking to actually talk with people and knock a few back, it's not a great choice. It's definitely an acquired taste..I'd likely choose 2-3 other options before going here. Maybe I need to give a day or early evening visit a chance! Friday night? *boo*.",,,
167,Pete R.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,241,25,3.0,8/24/2011,"When you want a drink but don't want all of the Soho, this is good place to go. One part dive, one part trendy Manhattan I find this an oasis in the yuppiness of Soho. Not that the crowd isn't yuppies or the area. It serves cold beer and shots in a atmosphere that should make any grounded person feel comfortable. It makes a great place to take break if out shopping with the lady or fun stop during San Genaro. Don't forget Pomodoro is across the street so once you have tied one on nicely you can head there for vodka sauce pizza",,,

172,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,4.0,5/25/2008,"An old fashioned bar with a great selection of beers on tap.  Ten beers at all times, five standard (Guinness, Stella) and five which rotate on a weekly basis. I love it just for the chance to test new beers on tap. The bartenders are happy to give out samples to taste. Only down side is that a lot of these beers are not widely distributed so finding a six pack for the weekend is usually a no go. They have one cheap beer on tap; I recall that it is Schaefer for $3.00.  I tend to go for the microbrews. Go for lunch, bring a sandwich.",,,

I first asked what kind of scotch they had and the bartender just waved his hand at the bottles behind the bar. I couldn't see which bottles were the scotch bottles so I asked him again, and he pointed to a list of scotches listed above the bar. Fine, I ordered what I wanted and he poured me a Johnnie Walker. When I said that's not what I ordered, he said to me, ""You'll like this one, it's nice."" Um, that's not what I ordered. When I said I'd like the scotch I ordered, he looked at the other bartender, as if to say, ""Who is this fussy person?"" and reluctantly got me the scotch I wanted. I call that terrible service.",,,

We found seats at the bar and the crowd was always polite as they reached around us to order and receive drinks. The music was nothing to take note of but I liked that it wasn't blaring because it gave us a chance to chat and catch up. Laid back, comfortable, and the bartenders were quick and efficient. When my friend left me alone to go the ladies room the bartender passed me a shot that the crowd next to me was taking. It was a weird lemon tasting thing but, hey it was nice anyway.",,,
184,Liam C.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,3.0,9/11/2008,"back in the day this was a great little spot to hang out, meet good people and settle in for the night. sadly, it has changed over the past five or six years to host clientele of the b&t variety. also, guys tend to outnumber girls 10 to 1, so if you're a single guy, you probably want to think twice if you plan on meeting someone special here.on the other hand, the bar still has the same nice vibe. usually it is host to a nice friendly crowd, and the juke box offers some good songs to pump out. a few years ago this bar was easily 4 stars.. maybe even 5 but sadly the standards have slipped to only 3 these days.worth a go tho!",5,,3

I came here on a Tuesday so I'm not sure if the crowd is always like this but it was mainly an older crowd (30s and up). My friend and I didn't care about the crowd though because they had cheap drinks and a comfortable atmosphere. The music was TERRIBLE. I didn't think a place that looked like this would randomly play MC Hammer then switch to some 80s saxophone-type of music then to Bon Jovi etc. Not my kind of mix at all. It's a little dirty and I wish they had more places to sit but overall this joint was pretty good. I would definitely come back here for a relaxing quick drink before I do anything that night.",2,1,2

Bartenders are more interested in talking to patrons than serving an afternoon crowd. I even went back a few days later to give this place another try. Better service this time, but still too hard even sitting at the bar. And I'm not one to complain about service.
