0,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3646,951,2085,4.0,10/30/2018,"This is a hidden restaurant right off the busy street that makes you feel like you are stepping back in time. The decor has an old school feel to it with all the antique furniture and paintings.They do a $50 prixe fixe menu which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. As an appetizer I ordered the portbello and goat cheese terrain with asparagus. It is served cold but the goat cheese had great flavor and the asparagus was perfectly cooked.For entrees I had the salmon with pumpkin seed crust. They had some sort of fruit on top that I was not a fan of. The salmon was good though and had flavor. I also loved the crunch of the pumpkin seeds. For dessert I had the plum crumble which was pretty good. The flavor was a little muted but it had good texture. The plums were not mushy and the crumbly gave it a good contrast with soft and crunchy. A dollop of ice cream would have put it over the top!All of this for $50! Unbelievable price for nyc. This was quality food too so I would definitely come back and recommend. If you want to take a step back into a different time come to the kings carriage house.",24,6,19
1,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,8/29/2018,"I finally had the chance to come here for afternoon tea with a friend. The place is small, cozy and adorable with an old Victorian ambiance. Upon entering, there is a comfortable dark brown couch, and elegant chairs with a little circular table in between, with natural sunlight streaming in from the large front window. There is a display of ceramic dogs and plates, along with a pot of deep pink flowers and green leaves. There are white stairs leading to an upstairs area which I did not get to see. When my friend arrived, we were taken to the back dining area, which was really nice and more spacious than it appears from the outside. The tables are covered with white table cloths with a dark purple and pale green flower arrangement in the middle. The walls were yellow and had tons of interesting photographs and plates throughout. There wasn't a huge selection of teas to choose from and they were not that unique, which was a bit of a disappointment. I just went for the classic Earl Grey which was smooth and strong. I think the tea that sounded the most different was Cinnamon and I should have gone for that. I did like the tea pots that the tea came in though - They were all shapes with themes such as Mary Queen of Scots, Alice in Wonderland and Pinocchio. We were served 3 tiers of deliciousness on the tea service caddy. The top plate had 4 different types of sandwiches, savory bites; the middle plate had scones with jam and cream and the last plate boasted several types of sweets. There was even a separate plate for chocolate covered strawberries! My favorite little sandwich was chicken salad with cranberry bread. The chicken salad was incredibly flavorful, very tender and had a satisfying crunch. I also liked the open faced egg salad sandwich, which had just the right amount of mayo and seasoning. There was an open faced sandwich with cream cheese and thin slices of cucumber, which tasted light and refreshing. Last, a cute little box with white cheese, diced peppers and tomato on top was quite tasty, particularly the oh so creamy cheese. The scones were delightfully flaky, moist with blueberry and not overly sweet. The jam and cream it came with was wonderful, though I would have preferred clotted cream. Dessert was a lovely assortment of mini cupcakes, cookies and cakes. There was a dark chocolate mini cupcake with vanilla frosting which was very airy and velvety. The sugar butter cookie was pretty yummy and melted in my mouth. I enjoyed the lemon tart which had the perfect lemony citrus taste and the crust was nicely crumbly. There was also a glazed poppyseed pastry which was pretty good. Then there were little chocolate boxes with yellow sweet cream inside, topped with blackberry and raspberry, respectively. These were bite-sized wonders of intermingling flavors of chocolate, cream and fruit. The only one I wasn't a fan of was the citrus coconut cake, because I don't like coconut for the most part.The chocolate covered strawberries were a decent size and delectable. I love the taste of rich, dark chocolate and sweet strawberry. The price of all this was $25 per person, which isn't too bad. All the finger foods were well prepared and the service was great. Our waiter was nice and everything was brought out in a timely manner. I would like to come back to try the brunch!",13,5,9
2,Rafia J.,"Edison, NJ",78,106,54,4.0,6/30/2018,"This place is extremely cute, very Victorian, and chic! That's what attracted us to check this place out and we booked a reservation for the same day without a problem. It's beautifully decorated and it looks like one of the tea houses that you'd find on every street corner in England. We ordered a basic tea and pastry plate and were immediately served with a delicious mix of sweet and savory pastries. This place isn't as fancy as everyone makes high tea places to be but it does have a very European feel to it and I like that it doesn't bite your wallet hard. I would definitely go back there for a fun day with friends.",2,1,1
3,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",449,1224,32,5.0,3/7/2018,"Of all the restaurants in Manhattan, I am pretty sure that getting a reservation for Saturday brunch at Kings' Carriage House is the most difficult of them all.  My New Years resolution was to take my mom somewhere fun every month--I actually got a head start in December with a Pure Barre date--and have been crushing this goal, while having fun in the process.  I somehow managed to get this coveted reservation after talking to the manager to find out the secret, and so my mom and I were able to be there on a rainy Saturday.  The prix-fixe brunch was superb and shockingly reasonable.  We both started with a green salad and then had the pistachio-encrusted salmon, which were excellent.  The details of the decor of that little townhouse were a feast for the eyes and I have no idea where all of those presumably antique teapots came from.   Overall, it was a nice lunch of good conversation and delicious food.  I am certain we will be back...if we can finagle a reservation!",3,,2
4,Kate O.,"New York, NY",337,122,500,5.0,2/7/2018,"Sunday tea for three...Drip drop rain, drip drop tea cup!Finger foods are best This was a great experience! It's one of the best prices I found in the city and the location was perfect. We went on a cold, rainy Sunday so that really added to the warm & bright feeling inside!We had the champaign option and I was really full afterwards. The tea service is not a good option for someone with multiple or extreme food sensitivities. And seems to be best shared with a group of 3-7. It's definitely an experience that can easily take 2 hours to savor everything.I'm not sure how frequently the menu changes but I could definitely seeing this be a seasonal friend date.",1,,1
5,Tee D.,"New York, NY",0,421,0,5.0,11/3/2018,"Absolutely adore this place! Best in NYC for afternoon tea! Not only is the price amazing but every single sandwich/scone/sweets were delicious! The teas are very simple, just your basic green tea etc but the experience, food, and atmosphere was the best!",,,
6,Michael S.,"New York, NY",11,5,5,5.0,3/18/2018,One of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC in my 3 years of living here. The #1 for the value and #1 for the atmosphere (if you're into feeling like royalty).Don't even get me started on the amazing breads that get switched up every time. And the soups are also to die for.The eggs are also just heavenly. Not sure how they manage to make the scrambled eggs into such a symphony.Just look at these plates I've had here. Unreal. 5 Stars.,3,2,1

Updated review","My updated review is in light of the fact that I went back to this restaurant twice more (once for high tea and once for a regular luncheon) and had... a bit of a mediocre time of it. The lunch was quite lovely but pricey. I ended up paying about $37 (including tax and tip) for a cream of cauliflower soup, a bread-roll, a medallion of filet mignon with salad, and a chocolate torte cake. While all was delicious, nothing truly stood out in quality as being drastically different from similar restaurants that offered similar prices. Finally, high tea was, sadly, quite a disappointment. While all the food was of the highest quality, I found the ratio of food to be very off. First, I had high tea with my husband and we got a surprisingly tiny proportion of food for two people. Second, we ended our meal feeling quite unsatisfied because the savory bites (which make up the first tier of the tea service caddy) were too small in number while the sweet bites were so numerous and rich we couldn't even finish them. So we felt as though we had simultaneously too much and too little food -- not what you want to feel after you've paid $65 (in total, including tax and tip) for a late luncheon!I still think this restaurant is a fabulous place of host an event, especially because events get a hell of a lot more savory food out of the kitchen. Additionally, the restaurant itself is very charming and service is very pleasant. But the high tea was sort of a disappointment so I'd suggest you stay away... unless you *really* enjoy sweets and can binge on them to fullness!",2,1,
8,Laura N.,"Carlstadt, NJ",1,48,0,5.0,6/28/2018,"It's been so easy to enjoy every single morsel of food I've ever had here. We've frequented this restaurant many times over the years, mostly in the private dining room, and it always delivers. Usually I get the filet for my main, but I've happily devoured everything I've tried here. The filet. Sublime. The wild salmon. Unbelievable. The duck. Incredible. Beyond the food, I truly love the decor of the restaurant and all the thoughtful detail that goes into the space, including tea sets. I can't forget to mention the service is impeccable. Love. Yum. Yes.",2,,
9,Ellie A.,"Jacksonville, FL",200,1,1,5.0,9/16/2018,"My sister and I popped in right when they opened for afternoon tea on Sunday. Although we didn't have a reservation, they were so accommodating and sweet. The decor and china were lovely. The little sandwiches, desserts, and tea were delicious and we were both full when we finished even though we had skipped lunch! I highly recommend King's Carriage House, especially because it is such a great value but still such a delightful experience. I have definitely had more expensive afternoon tea that I wasn't as satisfied with. We'll be back!",1,,1
10,Tal D.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,46,8,4.0,8/26/2018,Came here today for a friend's brunch.  It was lovely. I love the decor so much! The food was also fantastic. I had a chicken breast and my husband had a salmon both were delicious.,,,
11,Malini G.,"Ozone Park, NY",66,52,1279,5.0,4/11/2017,"By far the cutest tea room I've been too. I seriously love this place. Walking in, it feels more homey than anything. It was just two of us and we wanted to enjoy some afternoon tea. We had reservations but didn't specify in our reservation that we were there for high tea, the waitress spoke to some upper management and they decided it was still okay, we appreciated it since technically we didn't have tea reservations. We opted for the earl grey, and it came in the cutest tea set! The teapot and tea cups were so pretty, we just had to stare at them for few mins(lol.) Tea was good, it was empty the time we went. Waiter very nice, hostess as well. We kind of wanted to explore the other floors of the restaurant to see the decor but was running late for something. Will definitely be going back. Too cute to  just pass by!",1,,1
12,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,134,290,5.0,4/1/2017,"Made a reservation for tea a few weeks in advance, but ended up coming on a super snowy day.  My friend and I were the only ones there for afternoon tea until about 20 minutes before we left. Great decor and vibe, it feels like you're in a British grandmother's house. Highly recommend the Afternoon Tea ($25 per person or $35 pp including champagne).  The food was surprisingly filling, given the portions, and delicious.  We received assorted sandwiches & savory bites (cucumber, egg salad, chicken salad, salmon, and a goat cheese mango nibbler that was fantastic).  Some of the best scones I've ever had (and excellent accompanying cream and jam), in addition to sweet bites (chocolate cupcake, lemon bar, shortbread cookie, etc), and chocolate-covered strawberries. Service was impeccable, extremely attentive, and not at all rushed.  Our teapots were refilled many times.  I will definitely be back, as this is one of the more affordable teas in Manhattan.",1,1,1
13,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",554,554,1772,4.0,1/9/2017,"This place was perfect for a bridal shower because I attended a beautful one here.Ladies who do tea are always on the look out for the next great place to do tea time. I have enjoyed Lady Mendel, Alice's Tea cup and a couple of other establishments but this was my first time at King's Carriage House and I absolutely loved it. Driving up to the location you almost feel like you got transported back in time because of the antique fixtures and carriage style townhouse. As you walk in there is a welcoming foyer area. Our private room was tucked away upstairs. Our party was completely catered to the whole time. It was nice to have the privacy and freedom run our own program. We occasionally had the team check in to bring out the courses but besides that we are in a world of our own. Having this priavte dining area definitley made the experiences so much more intimate and meaningful. We were able to have our own decorations which made our experience more personalized. The decor was quite beautiful already so that was a plus.Our personal menu had warm brie puff lingonberrt compote in chive oil to start. I chose the pan seared filet of salmon pistachio nut crust with baby lettuces, purple potatoes and mango papaya salsa. Loved my app and the salmon so there were no issues there. Did pass on the purple potatoes though, the purple was a turn off for me.To top it off for dessert we had the belgian chocolate truffle cake. It was mosit and perfectly chocolatey. I would say this establishment was a great place to host a bridal shower and cant wait to go back another time.",4,1,1
14,Abbas B.,"Rockville, MD",92,300,106,4.0,1/4/2018,"For the price ($25), it was a nice tea time experience.  The atmosphere and building is awesome!  The best reason to come here.  Like a little cottage in Britain.  Lots of little decorations inside and the tea pots are really cool.  The tea was excellent.  The service was great too.  A very nice older gentleman greeted us at the door.  He was so nice and took our coats.  Very friendly and welcoming.  Like what you would expect from a nice man from a small town in England.  We got a decent amount of food on one of the 3 tier tower plates.  The sandwiches were ok.  Some of the sandwich bread was a bit stale but that might of been the type of bread.   The scones were excellent and the best part of all the food.  Would come back here again for the service, ambiance and price!!",4,,

16,Narinder K.,"Pelham Gardens, Bronx, NY",0,21,7,1.0,4/17/2018,"I was interested in hosting a baby shower here and popped in after speaking to Paul several times on the phone. When I walked in, no one was at the front desk. I had to call them to get their attention. Paul came out and reeked of alcohol. I was looking to host the event in their Mandalay Room which was smaller than I expected, despite that I was still interested. On the same floor is their willow room, he stated that there would ""hopefully be three events occurring at the same time"" so guests for the willow party would have have to go though the Mandalay Room (so much for ""private). Also you would have to share one bathroom that is on that floor. When I asked him if that always ran smooth he stated ""we've been in business for 25 years"". Ok fine, so I continue asking my questions all the soft drinks, coffee, tea alcohol are not included in the room fee, service fee or luncheon menu. The reason that I am writing his review is because if you book a room at this tea room you get Free linen and flowers, when I questioned what color/type of flowers Paul could not provide me with a definite answer and when I expressed my concerns of the flowers not matching my theme he stated you can bring your own. He made it clear as to how lucky I was to get free flowers. For the amount of money I was going to spend their for 25 people I don't think anything was free. If you are thinking of having an event here, you should definitely visit.",4,4,
17,Sydney G.,"Atlanta, GA",54,69,78,5.0,6/19/2017,"King's Carriage was the venue for a baby shower and it was a perfect set up. My one quip is that it was a little cramped where we were, but the food, laughter, and good times more than made up for it. The small sandwiches, ranging from cucumber to smoked salmon with capers, were light and refreshing. Desserts included small cookies, lemon bars, chocolate covered strawberries, and the classic scones with clotted cream and jam. All of the food selections were very good! I think that the tea was the best  part, though. We had Earl Grey and Chamomile teas to choose from. The blends themselves tasted amazing and were very aromatic. Just like most places in New York, parking is street parking or you can take Uber/Lyft, public transportation, and/or walk. If you're planning or are going to event at this space, make sure you go! You won't be disappointed.",,,

Updated review","I'm going to start by saying that if you're looking for a tea place in New York State that's not more than $25 per person, this is the best place to go. I don't know how they do a full high tea for such a great price. I am going to sound negative because I'll compare it to tea places in the UK, Europe, or which charge far more than $25 per person. They do not have sugar tongs, unfortunately. Since they have sugar cubes (as they should), this strikes me as a bit unsanitary. They also served low calorie sweetener, which I thought they should serve only upon request. The place takes cozy too far. You'll get to know the people next to you, whether you want to or not. The tea pots were a bit too homey for my taste. Not a fan of chocolate covered strawberries in general, but they seem out of place at tea. I asked to sit upstairs, and they said that I could not, without giving a reason. My niece was upset that there was a dead deer's head on the wall downstairs, but we were not allowed to sit anywhere else. Our waiter spoke very little English. The dinner menu looks excellent. I will return for dinner when next in the city. Maybe they'll let us sit upstairs this time.The bathroom door handle was missing.",1,1,
19,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,4.0,5/18/2016,"I came here for a bridal shower party, a set up perfect for a group of people enjoying some afternoon tea. I've always wanted to come here as I live a block away and yummy more affordable afternoon tea places are hard to find. I was very satisfied with the food, tea and atmosphere of the restaurant.First off, the décor and feeling of the restaurant is old and wonderful. It gives off a very Victorian vibe. The bridal party was situated on the second floor, with us occupying four big round tables. It was great for a more intimate party. As for the food and tea, it was just as good. We received the earl grey and chamomile tea. Both were hot and fresh tasting. The servers refilled the pots accordingly which was great because we went through the earl grey quickly. We also received multiple finger sandwiches including the oak smoked Scottish salmon pinwheels, cucumber with chive butter, chipped egg and watercress and goat cheese tartelettes with mango and tomato. All were super yummy and filling for afternoon tea sandwiches. I especially liked the goat cheese tartelettes and there was a nice crunch for the tartelettes, countered by the smooth goat cheese and sweet mango. We also were served two scones with delicious cream and jam. It ended with a variation dessert plate. It was great just to sample of a wide variety of desserts.Overall, a very splendid experience. I would definitely recommend it for a bridal shower or just a couple of friends wanting some afternoon tea.",7,4,7
20,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,5.0,4/10/2017,Quaint little restaurant that is easy to miss. Front of the house really looks like someone's home. Lucked out with no reservations for dinner. Was surprised to see the  dining space in the back that reminded me of a cottage setting and was so comfortable. Was even more surprised and pleased with the dishes coming out from the kitchen. Started off with grilled shrimp and enjoyed the wild salmon (over an apricot couscous pilaf) as my main and finished off with the dark belgian chocolate ganache torte.  This just seemed like the perfect meal. Everything was just wonderful and appropriate post-workout. Service was a little odd but not inattentive. Really nice find. Will check them out for brunch or tea on a weekend and will make sure to secure a reservation. What a gem!,2,,
21,HonestAbe R.,"Miami, FL",5,63,42,5.0,5/19/2017,"What an elegant place! The location is great [hard to find parking, but that normal for Manhattan!] The building is beautiful.The atmosphere had me forgetting I was in New York, but instead in a nice forest walking into a cabin, with classic tea ware. The Irish lad our host was a real treat!The inside decor is so quaint. We went here for my grandmother's birthday, she adores tea and teaware.Everyone enjoyed being here with the delicious finger treats and the SWEETS! YUM! nice variety of tea.Go and check it out. It's a great experience, it's nothing I have ever been to",,,
22,Helen L.,"New York, NY",129,131,36,3.0,3/14/2018,"Afternoon tea was extremely average. You get what you pay for. The bread for the finger sandwiches were kind of stale and dry. Scones were decent but not enough cream for 4 pieces. Sweets were unremarkable. Chocolate covered strawberries were average as well. They use teabags rather than loose leaf tea here. I don't think they use Lipton but can't be sure since they threw the whole teabag into the pot and I wasn't about to fish out the tag of the teabag. Temperature of the tea was disappointing - not even the first cup of my english breakfast tea was strong enough to be paired with cream.Overall experience was unremarkable but you get a full tier of food for $27 so what more can you expect? There are better places for afternoon tea in NYC but you also pay more, so it's a trade off.The only real negative that made me take away stars from this review was the waiter who serviced all the tables in the back. He was really rude and didn't seem to know what he was doing, which isn't all that difficult - bring the food to the tables, refill tea when asked? He didn't even have to explain what each of the items in the tea set was, he literally just poured water and refilled teapots and managed to leave a negative impression. Out of nowhere, he approaches my table and starts to take the tea set away - while we still had food on it! He starts to take the plates off the tier and then shoves the plate with one sandwich left on it to me, expecting me to finish off the sandwich on the spot so he could take the places away. We didn't ask him to start clearing our table, nor did we indicate we were done with the service so I don't understand why he just randomly starting clearing our table. After taking our plates away and just dumping the remaining sandwich face down on top of the plate of sweets, I saw another waiter whisper angrily to him so I'm assuming he wasn't supposed to have cleared our place at all. In addition to just disrupting my meal, he also was very eager to continually water down my tea pot with hot water even though I didn't want any more water added. So it was cup after cup of weak luke warm tea. If it wasn't for this waiter, Kings Carriage House would have gotten 4 stars because the rest of the staff was very kind and the food quality was as expected.",2,,
23,Wing C.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",213,1403,9436,4.0,5/13/2016,"I'd been wanting to visit King's Carriage for their afternoon tea wayyyy before I left the city. When I received a bridal shower invite to this venue, I was ecstatic! The bridal party reserved the second floor for the event which consisted of 4 large tables. Everything was beautifully decorated and attended to. Soon after we were seated, two pots of tea were brought to the table and soon followed the towers of goods. The afternoon tea tower of goodies consisted of finger sandwiches (chicken salad on cranberry nut bread and cucumber on white), savory bites (goat cheese salsa tart, smoked salmon roll, egg salad cracker), sweets (chocolate mini cupcakes, lemon tarts, fruit tarts, butter cookies, chocolate covered strawberries), and house made scones (with jam and cream). I could definitely take on a second tower on my own. The foods were delicious but just not enough for a table of 8 girls to share. My personal favs were definitely the chicken salad cranberry nut sandwich and house made scones. I wished they offered a third refill offer on the scones!Although I enjoyed the foods, I didn't think any of items particularly stood out. Would love to return to get a better sense of they have to offer with their brunch or dinner menu!",2,1,2

25,Jainnielyn C.,"Queens, NY",125,199,583,2.0,6/30/2016,"I am so sad to leave a 2-star review on a highly rated place. Ever since having proper (loose leaf) tea a few months ago, I've been wishing to try afternoon tea with a lovely assortment of sandwiches and scones and cakes accompanied by a wonderful pot of tea.So when I was in the area, I excitedly hiked to the shop about 2 hours before closing. Lo and behold, when I came in, I was greeted by, ""Are you here for the party?"" Turns out there was a bridal party upstairs. When I said no, he just stared at me. I was ready to walk out after a few exchanges. I felt like he was sneering at me and didn't want me to come in. Thankfully, the manager (I assume, or owner) with an accommodating voice said ""We can do tea for one""I briefly waited and was shown to a table on the corner. The downstairs is tiny, consisted of 5 tables. I was glad I did not see the grouchy man again after placing my tea order.Food arrived, lots of sandwiches and scones and tea. They were these tiny beautiful things which I bet took time to assemble. The sesame chicken was delish!Scones. Disappointing as they were dry, I didn't finish those. Miniature cakes were the perfect end for the snacks and they were all yummy. I don't remember anything that stood out, but none were bad either.A generous sized chocolate covered strawberry sealed the deal.During the entire time, they were quick to refill water into the pots. You'll never run out of warm tea :) I was slightly disappointed that they use a bag. I was expecting leaves in a steeper. Maybe it's whole leaves in a bag?",1,1,
26,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,5.0,12/11/2016,"Where should you take your out of town guests (in this case, le bf's parents) to make a good impression? And on a gloomy and snowy day at that? I researched several tea shops and bakeries in the area, and ended up at King's Carriage House as it was able to accommodate my party of 3 without a wait around Sunday noon.The ambiance is absolutely darling. It's not frou-frou, but Victorian-raminescent - as if you are dining in one of those small guest rooms in a medieval castle. Think crisp white linen, lush red walls, dark wood, and chandeliers. For the tea set, you get an assortment of savory finger sandwiches and tarts as well as sweet treats. The sandwiches included smoked salmon pinwheels, cucumber and chive butter, egg salad, and mango and tomato tarts. The sweets included poppy seed muffins, chocolate mousse with berries, gingerbread cookies, and chocolate cupcakes. You also get two scones, which were so buttery and crumbly. The chef served this with chantilly cream and jam, and my god was the chantilly cream so airy and delicious. I would come back for these scones and cream alone! Finally, the meal ended with chocolate dipped strawberries. I mean, who can resist?At first, the offering seemed scant as the treats are tiny. However, each bite was substantial in flavor that we had more than enough (and le bf's boyfriend joined an hour later so you can definitely tell the 3-portion was sufficient for even 4 people). For drinks, we started out with champagne (no reason at all, except that we were intrigued when the waiter asked us if we would like wine or champagne). The tea list were your safe bets - ranging from English breakfast to chamomile. What pushed this review to five-stars was the service. I didn't know that afternoon tea starts after 3 pm when I sat down. However, the chef was willing to accommodate us. Additionally, we stayed there for about 3 hours, slowly enjoying each other's company and the food. The waiters constantly checked to refill our waters and teas without being pushy. Even when le boyfriend's brother joined late, the waiter did not push us to order additional food. What a warm Sunday afternoon at King's Carriage, despite the snow and wind outside. Highly recommend it!",6,1,2
27,Dasle K.,"New York, NY",668,275,1667,4.0,6/14/2016,"Love this hidden gem on UES! This review is for Sunday afternoon tea. 4.5 stars for the experience, 3.5 for the food/tea. $25/pp for tea is a total steal compared to all of the other high end, expensive places for tea in Manhattan. The food was decent - sandwiches and desserts were good, but some of the scones were burnt on the bottom and the clotted cream was meh. Tea was excellent! Service was amazing.It was tough getting reservations, only because the place is TINY! There are only 5-7 tables in the room, and the upstairs space is always booked for bridal/baby showers, birthdays, etc. Pro tip: there's no extra fee to book the space, so make sure to call in advance for special occasions.If you're trying to come in on the weekends for tea, you MUST make a reservation. I would call at least 2-3 days before you want to come in. The spots book up fast! Overall, I loved my afternoon here despite the food not being amazing. Highly recommended if you love high tea for great value.",1,,
28,Crystal Y.,"Flushing, NY",194,425,858,5.0,1/20/2016,"Afternoon tea reviewMade a reservation a week ahead. It is such a cute place with very English decor. We were seated at the back immediately. It is a pretty small area but we were comfortable. Decors filled the walls and we were asked for our choice of tea. Honestly the Earl Grey is not great. It does not have the aroma that I like and tasted very bland. But the tea pots saved it. The finger food is the standard ones: cucumber sandwich, egg sandwich, smoked salmon sandwich, seseme chicken sandwich, scones, and dessert. We get chocolate covered strawberries on the side but neither my friend nor I like them. We stayed till they kicked us out (JK! but they do start preparing for dinner around 5~5:30). It was plenty of time to eat and chat. $25 per person is unbeatable in the city when hotels charge $50+. I would highly recommend this place for afternoon tea!!!",4,,
29,Stephanie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",491,452,8,5.0,10/25/2016,"The best deal in afternoon tea, seriously! Kings Carriage Afternoon Tea is $25 for a set! It's fabulously affordable, and it's as delicious as any other more expensive place. The atmosphere at Kings Carriage was something of a early 20th century home. Between their choice in flatware to the wallpaper; the decor was cute and vintage. It definitely screamed ""teleported back to simpler times!"" I love that their teapots were mismatched from each other, and that the little bathroom under the stairs reminded me of Harry Potter's bedroom. To top it all off - the service was so so so attentive!For the tea set, it comes with a predetermined assortment of sandwiches, scones and treats. There's no changing out your sandwiches or selecting them. But that's okay! Because the sandwiches they serve are great and the selection they choose for you is wide. They serve their tea set on a tiered tray! Their scones were served warm, with a healthy side of marmalade, cream and jam. And my god, those mini scones were so good!The tea selection they had was rather larger and I remember the tea itself being quite lovely. I did have to ask for milk myself rather it being served right away, but I didn't fault the service for this. The waiter was an older man, and he was so kind!Between the atmosphere, the price, the tea and the food itself, I think this right up there with some of the more upscale afternoon teas the city has to offer!",6,,

I've never heard of this place before and the website describes the building and the experience to a tee!... It was a private party so we had the second floor room to ourselves, about maybe 6 tables... Well we started off with two pots of tea, mini sandwiches (cucumber, egg salad, chicken salad, goat cheese tartlettes), scones, cookies, and my fave chocolate covered strawberries.  I'm a serious tea drinker and the tea was great, my table even finished someone else's teapot because they were drinking too slow! The setting was cute, it reminded you of the carriage houses back in the day, Very Classic! Even gave you a little flashback down memory lane when you used to have your own tea parties! Overall I really enjoyed the place and thought it was a fitted location for a Bridal Shower. I was even surprised how expansive they're menu was for lunch and dinner. And the service was on point.",,,1
36,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",547,270,1485,4.0,8/4/2015,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon at 4pm for Afternoon Tea and it was fantastic! The restaurant itself reminds you of an old European with a country charm - beautifully decorated with ornates, porcelain artifacts, paintings and mirrors on the walls. The décor was very charming and cozy with a lot of history. We were greeted so warmly by the staff and were quickly seated. The afternoon tea is priced at $24.95 per person and comes with a variety of sandwiches, scones, desserts, and chocolate colored strawberries. The high tea set came our literally 5 minutes after we sat down - it was so efficient. I really enjoyed the high tea - ordered the English Tea and the water was constantly refilled. The pastries and scones were delicious. The sandwiches could have been tastier - but the whole experience was just delightful. I definitely recommend King's Carriage House if you want to do afternoon tea at a great value! There is no hassle with reservations and you feel very welcomed and treated well during the whole experience.",6,1,2
37,Jennifer M.,"Montclair, NJ",787,835,3585,3.0,7/18/2016,"This was probably one of the few times where the average Yelp review is NOT on point. My friend and I try having been trying to visit various afternoon tea places all over NYC and haven't been to King's Carriage House, so decided to go based on the reviews.I had booked a reservation for my friends and I several weeks in advanced and had no trouble cooking upon calling. Now fast forward to the day I was there. Upon arrival, I was greeted kindly enough by the elder gentleman that took my information down making my reservation, then escorted by the server to my table.First off, the tea room was super quirky, like makeshift quirky, and the decor was fairly unique. I sure wasn't expecting taxidermy during tea. Anywhoo, my friends and I were seated a large round table in the corner which I didn't mind, until I tried sitting. Underneath the tablecloth, sadly was a round table with no pedestal footing, but bar footing similar to party chairs. It was super cumbersome for the two of us who were positioned by the weird bar/legs of the table. Then there were the chairs. As I sat down, I nearly slipped! The chair cushion was covered in vinyl which I didn't mind, but it was super wobbly, and I wasn't the only one who noticed. Another lady at a separate table, who was seated roughly around the same time as we were, noticed it, and switched out her chairs. So I had done the same with mine. The room look like it sat 24 people comfortably, but on 10 people were in the tea room, so the chair switch was easily done.Now service and food. If the furniture wasn't a little off, our server and service completely set the tone. Unfortunately I felt like I was talking to a deer who made contact with my car headlights. Our server was neither friendly nor mean, nor anything. He recited the teas available and refilled our teapots like a robot. Our tier of savory and sweets were delivered shortly after, followed by our server reciting the items in which received. At first, the amount of food seemed a little scarce, but it was actually filling. My friend and I were a huge fan of the chicken salad sandwiches so we had asked for more of them. And so they came and they were pleasantly consumed. After all was said and done...and eaten, our server presented out bill. $15 extra for sandwiches, which by the way, he failed to tell us we're an added cost! Disputing the charges seemed like a stretch to our robot server, and at that point we undisputedly paid for the bill.  I guess at the end of the day, it was still a decent price for afternoon tea in NYC ($24.95/person) but definitely not worth the obscure service and the low quality tea. Their only saving grace are the tasteful savory sandwiches, the generous clotted cream, and warm petite scones.",6,3,2

39,Brianna S.,"North Haledon, NJ",989,252,995,4.0,9/21/2015,"King's Carriage house was absolutely terrific. The service was excellent, the food was delicious. The atmosphere is insanely romantic. I loved my time here. I was on edge to give them the full 5 stars but I had to simply pull back on one just because the entree did take a substantial amount of time to get to us. I'm not usually that picky with timing on this, as the longer the food takes to come out the better, more fresh, it is. Only issue was the pork my boyfriend ordered was SEARING hot once we got our entrees and he had to wait for it to cool a bit as my duck breast was ready to eat and if I waited it'd have gotten cold. They were both insanely yummy. Again, this place is certainly 5 star worthy but i'll have to come back before i can jump them to the full 5 stars. We went on a groupon and it's more than worth it. I'd come back without the groupon and have already recommended it to a friend. To summarize our experience we tipped well over 20% against the original total value we would of paid prior to the groupon. Great job King's Carriage house, i'll be back to hopefully bump you up to the 5 stars :)",2,,

The tea was just from a teabag.  They will continue refill your teapot, but not with BOILING water.  None of our tea were hot enough, which bugged all of us.  The food was very below average as well, again you get what you pay for.  The waiter who refilled our water kept spilling the water outside the teapots and then he broke some glasses in the hallway.  Eventually when he took away empty plates/cups from our table, he spilled tea on my friend (*luckily* the water/tea was not hot at all).  His attitude was just oh oops.  We definitely will not come back again.",4,2,

Of course, many of them were fully booked because I waited until Saturday to make reservations :) King's Carriage House was on one of the ""Best of NY Tea"" lists that I was checking . They weren't doing tea, but a 3-course prix fixe menu for the day. Liz was very engaging on the phone so we decided to go for it and it was the BEST choice we could have made! The experience was amazing from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out. We were early and greeted warmly, our wet coats taken to be hung up. We were seated within 20 minutes and the service & attention to detail was phenomenal. The meal itself - I chose the heirloom beet salad, filet mignon, and chocolate torte - was fabulous; and as I said the service was amazing. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.

They gave us three tiers of finger sandwiches, scones with jam and cream, and mini cakes and tarts. It was a very lovely way to spend an afternoon.The only downside was that service was rather lacking. The place is quite small and our server kept bumping into my chair as he was passing by.

When you arrive this place looks like an old English home (confirmed by my British friend who was with me). The man up front took our coats and hung them up in a little closet. We sat in the Willow room which is downstairs. There are all sorts of plates, signs, and paraphernalia hanging on the walls giving it a very old timey feel. The afternoon tea comes with a bunch of little sandwiches, scones, and desserts. It didn't look like much food, but by the end we couldn't move we were so full. The little sandwiches are extremely rich and they give you two of each so everybody gets to taste everything. They give you scones with fresh cream and those were to die for. The tea comes in unique teapots and we had fun looking all over the restaurant at the teapots everybody else got. Dessert includes chocolate dipped strawberries.I loved this place so much that I am doing my bridal shower here :)",2,,

It was delectable! Serving size on the small size though... But it was so so so good! I could have had ordered each entree.

Terrific quaint place featuring old world charm on the UES!Even though we have lived in the neighborhood for many years we had never checked out King's Carriage House. We decided to be a bit fancy one day and partake in their weekend afternoon tea here when I found a Groupon for it that was actually quite a good offer. Yeah, I can clean up a bit and be fancy when it's a good deal!Reservations are a must as this wonderfully adorned townhouse gets crowded fast. Not that large and more on the intimate side they have limited seating. We sat in their back dining room area which had an almost country cottage Victorian feel to it. The decor features many plates, old timey pics, and antiques on the bright yellow walls. It's called the Willow Room, which is named for the collection of antique blue and white china, and is on the ground floor and seats 18-22 guests. I think there are three rooms in total. As you can imagine they also do bridal showers and private events here, and also special holiday dinners.Afternoon tea is only served 3-5pm Tuesday-Sunday so it's a small window to grab a table, but so worth it to indulge in the fanciness of it all. It's $25 a person and includes a lot of nibbles actually! Savory finger sandwiches, warm scones with cream and homemade jam, an assortment of pastries and sweets, along with hot freshly brewed infused tea served in wonderfully ornate ceramic pots. It offers a relaxing atmosphere that looks upscale but feels cozy and down homey at the same time. It's an escape for a few hours where one can play like the richy rich who reside along Park Ave, but is located along 2nd Ave and 82nd street where the normal masses live. Wonderfully attentive and friendly service too. Professional and nice at the same time. Pinkies up, and clotted cream for the win!",18,14,16

I also liked that the owner explained what each little sandwich was. The owner is nice and patient, as I called him a number of times with questions leading up to the event.However, I did have an issue with the bill, which leads me to give fewer stars. We had a sneaky waiter who was VERY pushy with the champagne, refilling glasses constantly even though it was plain to see that many glasses weren't even touched. Waiter also claimed we drank numerous sodas and an entire bottle of wine, which I'm 100% sure was a lie as I did not see anyone drinking wine and confirmed this afterwards with guests.I talked to the owner about this and he respectfully listened to my ""complaint."" However, he said his notes said something different than what I told him.  But you see, I knew what I wanted for my shower - specifically telling him only one champagne per guest and refills ONLY if requested by the guest. I'm really disappointed that he did not believe me. Isn't the customer always right???Clearly there is not much I could do about the situation since I talked to the owner over the phone a day later.

The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is delicious, but the serving sizes are quite small. I always leave still hungry, which is rare for a tea house. I've never walked away from any other tea house feeling like I need more to eat. Alas, the food offering are simply too small and not enough to go around. And for the price (which is pricey, though average for a NYC tea house) I expect to get more for my money. The tea selection for parties tends to be limited and a bit bland. It's not awful, but I do wish there was a bit more variety, and more interesting options.The biggest thing this place has going for it is the staff. Every time I've ever been here the owner and his staff have always been incredibly kind, patient, and accommodating to myself and my companions. I will return if my friends suggest it and wish to go, though this is probably not the first tea house I, personally, would suggest. But it's also not the last one I'd suggest either.",,,
68,Vanessa G.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,12,0,5.0,10/13/2015,"We recently hosted my sister's bridal shower at King's Carriage House.  The entire experience from start to finish was excellent.  Paul, the event coordinator, was wonderful and extremely accommodating of our plans and ideas.  The space where the party took place, while a bit snug, was charming and clean.  The staff was attentive but unobtrusive, and very patient when the party ran a few minutes over time.  Tea - and all of the accompanying treats - was delicious (the clotted cream was fantastic!) and we were allowed to bring in our own ""dessert"" for afterwards (ice cream cup cakes, yum).  The party was a huge success and we were very happy with everything (including the price, which was very reasonable!).  I will absolutely return, perhaps for a more low-key afternoon tea, and would definitely recommend this as a location for an intimate gathering!",3,1,
69,Christina R.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",404,280,169,3.0,2/20/2014,"My sister and I visited King's Carriage House for afternoon tea. This tea room is incredibly cute, but was strangely still decorated for Christmas at the end of January...complete with Christmas music. Despite the large amount of nutcrackers and Christmas decorations, the townhouse still had a wonderfully intimate and warm feeling, so we got in the holiday spirit. I have visited many tea rooms in NYC, and was disappointed by the small selection of tea. However, Tea Service is around $24 per person, which isn't too bad.  Tea is served in adorable tea pots shaped like palaces, crowns, and Big Ben. Additionally, they let you linger over tea unlike many tea rooms in NYC that have a time limitation.The layout seems great for a bridal shower or small party. I would recommend King's Carriage as a nice spot to have a casual cup of tea with a friend.",8,1,2
70,Liz C.,"Manhattan, NY",43,147,0,5.0,9/18/2015,"Such a good deal for afternoon tea! $25 per person is a steal for high tea. Definitely reserve beforehand though, it can get crowded with parties. It's more laidback and homey than The Plaza, but more extensive than Alice's Tea Cup (which isn't really high tea). I would say the food is pretty consistent in quality across all of these tea places (since I'm not really a fan of cold sandwiches and stale mass produced sweets), so I won't judge on the food other than to say that the quantity is good and the scones are warm and flaky. High tea is all about ambiance (5/5 - self explanatory), tea selection (4/5 - slightly small selection, but good enough for anyone that isn't a huge tea connoisseur) and the service (4/5 - a little slow when I went but there was a large party going on upstairs). Overall, would come here all the time!",3,1,

This humble abode by far gives the tourist attraction, and mass manufactured (*Sarabeth), hot spots, a run for the customers money! There were about 12 of us to an upstairs loft room for ourselves to enjoy tea; tea sandwiches; chocolate covered strawberries; & scones with marscapone/jam. Everything was so fresh from the finger foods to the desserts. The service was impeccable. At the end, the waiter even took several pictures for us to capture the memories.We had two types of tea to choose from AND the choice between decaf & regular. It was a beautiful baby shower for ""a baby that's brewing!""",1,,1
72,Sunia T.,"Manhattan, NY",76,162,0,3.0,11/14/2016,"Kings carriage house has always been one of my favorite afternoon teas in the city and has been a favorite amongst friends for baby and bridal showers. However, recently, I went for the first time with girlfriends for their afternoon tea service, since I had such a great experience with food, service, and ambiance during the showers I have attended here. Although the service and ambiance were still great, overall, the food really lacked freshness and flavor this time around. Our scones, which are usually the highlight of afternoon tea, were completely stale. The sandwiches were bland and flavorless and although the mini pastries weren't bad, they weren't particularly great either. All in all, I don't think I would come back here unless another shower is being hosted here. On the plus side, the lower price tag and catching up with friends made up for the mediocre food.",,,
73,Olga I.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,32,9,3.0,12/19/2017,"Disappointment. The King's Carriage House is on all ""NY best tea places"" lists. However, they do not brew their tea! They put two tea bags in each pot and kept adding hot water. The snacks and sweets that came with the tea were ok:  mini finger sandwiches (salmon, chicken, egg salad, cucumber), mini scones with cream and jam, and assortment of sweets. The tea service is pre-fixed, you can only choose which tea to drink, but selection is not very big. Service is ok, I would give them 3 1/2  stars, because waiters were polite. The best part of this place is decor: cute little carriage house decorated with old fashioned china plates. I visited during the Xmas time, so they had a very nice English style holiday decorations and a whole bunch of Nutcrackers. If you want to get more for your money: try Alice's Teacup or Bosie. If you want something fancy: tea service at the Pierre Hotel. I just don't think that paying $54 for 2 was worth it.",,,
74,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,1158,545,5.0,9/23/2013,"I'm a huge fan of tea rooms for its quaint atmosphere and King's Carriage House did not disappoint me. My friend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and we were seated on the first floor in the back of the restaurant. I think we were one of the first few customers so we pretty much had the whole area to ourselves, which was really nice and relaxing. The décor was definitely one of the highlights.  I'm not sure if there's one specific theme they were going for but they had an eclectic of wall decorations from deer antlers to porcelain chinaware hung on the wall. It almost looks like an antique or nostalgia shop. Since we came here for brunch, they didn't offer the afternoon tea menu for us since it wasn't the proper hour.  But we both ordered the French toasted croissants with apple smoked bacon and it was delicious!  Even though they drizzled the entire plate with maple syrup, the croissants did not look or taste soggy at all, which was perfect. Each brunch plate also came with either a choice of plate of mixed fruits or a salad. We both ordered the fruit plate and they were really fresh and sweet. Our server was also really sweet and kind. She kept refilling our coffee without ever having to flag her down.  I hope to come back again and try their afternoon tea!",2,,2
75,Alyssa W.,"East Orange, NJ",6,25,4,4.0,2/8/2015,"This review is not for the food because when  we arrived (two adults, two kids) we had no reservations. We were looking for brunch in the city and both locations had an hour and a half wait. There were two bridal showers booked at this location so they couldn't accommodate us. BUT...the staff was extremely nice. They encouraged us to take the kids to view the bridal shower set up. And when we were walking shyly they told us not to be bashful and insisted that we go look. He then told us of a nearby ""fun"" type of diner that the kids would like. I would definitely return to this establishment with reservations for a quaint brunch. The decor was beautiful. Reminiscent of a well-todo home in the 1800s. It is not a large place so if parties are booked you're out of luck as the staff explained. But they were so kind, friendly and helpful. I will return to try again.",5,,
76,Jeremy W.,"New York, NY",7,32,0,2.0,1/10/2015,"A mediocre experience from start to finish. Watery soup, thin tasting wine, generic menu and a bonus of the waitress repeatedly kicking my foot when she came to the table.Another low point: hearing the kitchen repeatedly upbraid the server and the menu choices. The word ""stupid"" found its way into the dialogue. The waitress shushed him loudly to no avail.The icing on the cake was the soundtrack of awful string quartet covers of popular music that, because our desserts were delayed, we heard cycle back to the beginning. Overall, the word blah fits nicely.",3,5,2
77,K L.,"Flushing, NY",83,42,1,2.0,3/31/2015,"I absolutely have to agree with Jeremy W. This place was absolutely mediocre, from the food right down to the ambiance, which is a shame because it seemed so promising from the outside looking in.What was mediocre about it?- Spotty service: The waiter rushed to get my wine order in before I had even taken off my coat and without even providing me a wine list. Then, I wound up waiting forever during the rest of the meal. At one point, my server disappeared, and I had to walk to the host to ask for my check.- Food: Two-course lunch prix-fixe for $18.95? Sounds amazing! Weak flavors. Stilton blue cheese was anything but rich and pungent. Even their tea was weak. - Music: String quartet covers of songs that were bad enough the first time around. Why someone thought they should be covered by a string quartet was beyond me.However, with bad, there is always some good. Here are the pros:- $18.95 for a 2-course lunch menu that serves meat!- Kind, if inattentive, service- Cute decor, if you're into porcelain and thingsDine at your own risk!",2,1,
78,Chris L.,"New York, NY",5,116,24,2.0,5/16/2016,"There for a shower. Definitely an interesting venue upstairs. Compliments end there.  Very tight quarters for about 40 people and 3 wait staff.  The hostess provided a wine option which many enjoyed.  The finger food were skimpy as was expected (spouse had been there) and smallish (cut into pieces smaller than quarter sandwiches)--choices included cucumber, egg salad, chicken salad, goat cheese tartlettes, scones, cookies, tarts and chocolate covered strawberries. Decent variety, OK as to taste, nothing earth-shaking.  Teas were English Tea and Chamomile Tea--again nothing special.  Service was good overall except for one NON-RANDOM ACT OF ASTOUNDING RUDENESS.  Our table was a hungry group and demolished the offerings relatively quickly; other tables did not finish theirs.  I asked the waiter if we could get just a few more of each--not an entire new plate.  I'm aware this is not a buffet.  I've been to tea at Alice's and at the Plaza; such a request, even if denied, were declined politely and discreetly by ""I'm sorry we can't.""  But not so the hipster waitperson in his vest--he made sure everyone in both rooms knew there were NO seconds!  My request was met with a BOOMING AND ANGRY NO!!!!   I don't think the request was unreasonable.  It turns out the other tables had leftovers, so honoring my request (for our table) would not have led to a big rush by everyone to order more.  I had asked for a soda as I am a teetotaler and that request was honored.  And if there were to be an added charge, so be it--just say so.  No need for such boorishness. I was too shocked to be embarrassed.   Later on another waiter did switch our empty plate for a plate with leftovers from another table.  So, what was the big deal?  I'd love to say I'm not returning but I wasn't going to even without the rudeness.  Just a curious observation:  our servings were on a two tiered carrier with separate dessert; I see pics of three tiered carriers with desserts on the bottom.  Were we getting more?  We were not on a Groupon.  NO mas, my friend.",1,1,

83,Linda W.,"New York, NY",110,491,138,3.0,11/11/2012,"I had my baby shower in the Mandalay Room on Sat. Everything turned out beautifully (decor, presentation, and overall environment). The space felt cramped for 27 guests. The max count should had only 20-23 guests to allow comfort. The food was exceptional and exceed our expectation! All of our guests couldn't stop raving about the event. For the first course, we had the baked brie pastry puff in lingonberry compote. The main entree was a choice of grilled citrus chicken with roasted asparagus and frisee salad orange & dried cranberries or pan-seared salmon with pistachio nut crust and purple potato salad with mango papaya salad. And dessert was dark Belgian chocolate truffle cake with ginger crème anglaise over raspberries. I went with the grilled chicken and it was delicious. The chicken retained its juices and stayed moist. Drinks were ordered separately from the luncheon menu. Be warned of the little gimmick with the events menu.  They make their $$$ by not including drinks. Guests are expected to order beverages separately. It gets billed on top of the food/tax/gratuity. If you opt for tea, it comes in a full pot in assorted designs. I love the one with the English throne (see pic). However, it was extremely disappointing with the overall service! Originally, we want to replace the dessert with a choice of beverage. We had already brought cupcakes on the day of the event in addition to setting up a candy buffet/cookies favor. We felt it was overdone with a variety of sweets. Unfortunately, we never got a chance to discuss any options with the events manager. It took A LOT of phone calls and emails to get a hold him to finalize the guest count.  We didn't get to speak to him until the day of the event. I felt that this was done intentionally to dodge any negotiation or substitution for the luncheon menu. The waitstaff was extremely disorganized with the concept of time management. Not only did they not assist with the set-up of event (as noted by some yelpers) but got in the way of guests moving or getting up during the event. Food and drinks were taken away at their pace whenever the guests got up from their seats. We felt rushed since waitstaff would stand by to make sure time was not lapsing (in case it runs into the next party). By the time luncheon was done, we had approx. 45 mins to wrap up our games/activities planned for our guests. We end up hassling for the extra 15 mins so we would have an hour to finish everything. Sadly, we never even got to open any of the baby gifts. :(At the conclusion of the event, the waitstaff impatiently stood by the stairs to clean up. I couldn't even gather all of the gifts in time to leave! One of their staff reprimanded us for using the only available broken/clogged restroom upstairs. A chair was cleverly placed so that we would get the hint it's out of service. Rather than resolving the issue beforehand, they wait until the end of the event to inform us. She had the audacity to tell everyone to use the downstairs bathroom. Not only did I find this inconvenient to my guests but as mother-to-be (currently in my last trimester), this was difficult and quite a hassle to go up and down a long flight of stairs for 2.5 hrs. Overall, this is a cute venue to host events but limit your party size! Their facility is extremely small. It is simply not big enough to accommodate large parties. Don't bother with the website. It is way smaller than described. We had to request an additional table to set up our candy buffet aside from the cupcake stand/cake pops display (see pics). It was a tight fit for the guests to move around. Their staff requires a good portion of the room to cater and serve the guests. They kept knocking into guests as well as myself a couple of times. The waitstaff definitely needs retraining in customer service. They appear to be overworked, burned, and disgruntled. Honestly, it was not worth the 2 grand spent for the entire event.",8,1,1

Paul, one of the owners of the restaurant, was incredibly helpful; a true party-planning pro. It was obvious that King's Carriage House has hosted a massive number of little parties, so Paul had the process down to a science. It was incredibly convenient and hassle free: the restaurant handled setup, linens, flowers, the full brunch, the birthday cake and an open bar with brunch cocktails. It could not have been easier!When it was time for the event itself, the whole day went smoothly. Guests were able to mingle in a private room, and we had private servers and bartenders. All of my friends raved about the adorable space- so charming, especially in the fall, and the excellent food. The brunch cocktails were flowing (mimosas and Bellinis) and the food was presented beautifully. Guests received extremely fresh melon with yogurt and lavender honey, followed by a choice of croissant french toast or eggs with smoked salmon. I heard that both were excellent options. The restaurant had ordered their standard birthday cake for me (double chocolate fudge) and presented it with a fall theme- beautiful cornucopias and flowers on top.

Upstairs dining area was much more wide open and I would have appreciated being given the option of sitting upstairs but will know to request next time.  The food was plenty for 5 girls (3 sandwiches per person, 2 scones with jam/clotted cream, tea cakes galore to share, and a goat cheese tart and smoked salmon on rye) with large chocolate covered strawberries to end the experience.  Taste-wise, it was not super memorable. The scones were warm and they had brought an extra plate for us. The downside was that the tea selection was limited (peppermint, chamomile, earl grey, english breakfast, etc). Service was great.

Reservations are a must for this former carriage house turned tea house. I had emailed and received confirmation but when I showed up my reservation wasn't there.  With my email proof, we were accommodated most graciously and told to call for reservation instead.  So when you get their voice mail, leave a message because I had tried calling several times.The scones were delicious and served warm with jam and clotted cream.  For tea,  we had choice of about 6 teas to choose from. I went a bit nontraditional route and had green tea which was amazing.  When our tea sandwiches and assorted goodies arrived, it was three-tiered delight.  Small sandwiches, chicken, cucumber etc, then the second tier was more elaborate with egg salad, smoked salmon and goat cheese tartlettes. Simply delicious.  The lowest tier consisted of various sweets.  These were good but not quite as good as those finger sandwiches.   The atmosphere is lovely - there are 3 rooms and we sat on the second floor and had the whole room to ourselves.  British themed knick knacks decorate this cute shop and staff are exceedingly polite.  Highly recommended for afternoon tea.",1,,

100,Bo K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,7,0,4.0,10/14/2013,"I just hosted a bridal shower for a friend this past weekend and I must say, Paul did a fabulous job making sure everything ran smoothly from start to finish. He was extremely easy to work with and it made my job easier as host (who was also traveling from out of state). The staff were great as well as they helped us make the event a surprise for the Bride-To-Be.I booked the Hunt room (meant for 12-16 people) but like other reviewers have noted, it is EXTREMELY cozy with even 12 people. There's a big oval table in the center of the room with one empty table against the wall for gifts, decorations, or whatever you want. For some reason, I thought they would bring out individual trays for each person, but I guess that wouldn't make sense since it is such a small space to begin with. So for the 12 of us, they brought two big tea trays with all of the delectable finger sandwiches and desserts. The tea was great, as usual.Overall, great place to host a cute bridal shower or event with the girls. Pain-free booking process and reasonable prices (no room booking fee, which is initially what sold me!)",7,,2
101,Amber R.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,67,54,5.0,9/28/2011,"I've had the pleasure of working with Mr. Paul for a winter tea party last year December. One day I'll make a more detailed review based on their actual food, but for now I'll stick to their afternoon tea section.First off, I found their customer service to be spectacular. Mr Paul was patient with me because I made a LOT of stops between the time I contacted them and the date of my party. I'm studying event planning and design and he helped me through with room and table measurements and whatnot. Everyone under him was very proper and polite towards me when I came in t-shirt and jeans, and were very amazed at my group of girls and the way we dress during the party, while still staying respectful towards us. (unlike say, staff at Alice's Tea Cup...)The atmosphere is gorgeous, whether you go during the daytime or at night. The little parlor + bar at the door always makes me feel relaxed and right at home whenever I step in, and the lighting is ALWAYS put me in a particular mood. My room of choice was the Mandalay, which is a gorgeous red room with covered with paintings etc. The size is a bit cozy, but its workable and definitely an enjoyable spot to be in. Their rooms have the adjustable dimmer lights so you can light it however you'd like. As for my Mandalay room, at first I wasn't able to have the minimum amount of people attending my party (which ended up being 16 people or so) so I was trying to accommodate with the Willow Room, but at the last minute Mr. Paul switched my party with another's and gave me the Mandalay, at no extra cost. God answered my prayers that day, I was so happy he was kind enough to do that.As far as the tea party itself, the food and tea was made right one time and from what I was able to taste (I personally do not like to eat when hosting and I've never personally eaten there before my party, but my friends were pushing me to eat so I nibbled on a few things = w=;; ).I wasn't able to taste the tea but as far as the food, the favorites were definitely the oak smoked Scottish salmon pinwheels, and the goat cheese, mango and tomato tarts. Goat cheese the goat cheese I think for some would be an acquired taste, but I loved it and my friends loved it. Scones were good, the desserts were good, ESPECIALLY the chocolate covered strawberries and the berry tartelettes. Mr. Paul also allowed me to bring in extra sweets from outside, though I think I might've ruined my guests appetite with all the sweets haha.Overall it was a great experience, would definitely love to go back to sit down and actually eat one day. I'm also planning another tea party this year with a friend, so I'm looking forward to working with King's Carriage House again. :3",4,1,1
102,Anna I.,"Brookline, MA",40,29,0,4.0,8/18/2014,"I am always on the look out for new places for afternoon tea. After discovering this gem on the upper East side (82nd st btw 2nd & 3rd), it can be a bit hard to find without an sign outside. But it stands out to anyone walking by as it is a 2 floor building.RSVP are a must. We were seated on a recent quiet Friday afternoon. Service was prompt after being asked what tea, water and if we wanted champagne or not. The tea was served in cute tea pots with Windsor and Edinburgh Castle on it. The tea was from tea bags. The three tiered tray came out. The scones were warm and not dry with jam and cream. The sandwiches were not dry and hearty from egg salad, cucumber salad, chicken salad as well as a lox pinwheel.The sweets level included but limited to chocolate cupcake, iced lemon poppyseed tea cake, sugar cookies.They serve lunch and dinner too. Such a charming and lovely place with a very reasonable price point for tea.DEFINITELY must go back again!",1,,

106,Claire B.,"South Kensington, London, United Kingdom",1,23,0,1.0,1/6/2015,"If you're looking for a good afternoon tea, you're probably better off going to a child's tea party than going here. A friend and I decided to do afternoon tea rather last minute, so most places were already booked up. We decided to try this place because they had reservations available and seemed to have a good rating here on yelp. Terrible, terrible mistake. We were seated fairly quickly and given no menus. The server then recited five or six teas, which was all they had. We asked if they had earl gray, the waitress looked like we'd asked for unicorn tears and seemed flat out confused by the question. She finally said no, and then recited the available teas again. We both ordered English Breakfast, which seemed very bland but somewhat bitter. Sure enough, there were about six teabags crammed into the teapot. If you're going to use teabags instead of loose leaf tea, at the very least there should be more than six options for tea. When our food arrived, the waitress explained what everything was by saying ""sandwiches, scones, sweets"". Normally this would be fine, but since we hadn't been given menus we had no idea what anything was. Sandwiches were ice cold, clearly served right out of the fridge, the scones could have doubled as hockey pucks (they were difficult to cut with a knife, let alone break apart, and they were dry as anything) and the chocolate covered strawberries were either made with the world's cheapest chocolate, or with sugar free chocolate.It then took about 20 minutes to get the check, since the manager who had spent about 10 minutes pressed against my chair staring off into space had disappeared, and our waitress was chatting with someone by the front. This is a fairly inexpensive tea for manhattan, but the service, tea and food was absolutely horrible. And, since we were never given menus, we had no idea what the price was until the check (finally) arrived. There are plenty of other places in the city where you could get a much better afternoon tea for about the same price, and for $10 or so more you could get a fantastic tea elsewhere.",5,2,

The price was REALLY cheap (stars going up!!!)The ambiance was super cute (stars continuing to soar!)however...... (those rocking high stars and quivering now.... they know whats coming)1) the sandwich bread is atrocious. I felt like I was chewing on two disgusting sponges that had a rather delicious tuna or egg filling. The bread was simply so tasteless, chewy, spongy, hard, and stiff. The great sandwich fillings simply couldnt mask the nasty bread! how on earth do you EVEN SERVE almost stale bread?!?!2) the staff is cheap with the tea. You are given the tea in a beautiful and large tea pot. You are even given a refill of hot water! How lovely! However.... only ONE regular-sized (as in the same lipton size tea bag you get in the grocery store)  was inside the tea pot. Well, that simply leads to diluted, bland, tasteless colored water. 3) the staff is LOUD and ruined the ambiance.  At about 4:30, the staff begins to prepare their dinner service. Thats fine and dandy.... however they did it SO LOUDLY. they were literally SHOUTING at each other to be heard over the BANGING POTS AND PANS. That really killed whatever cute ambiance were were enjoying before....I feel sad to cut down stars, but slash them down, i must do.",4,5,3

I'm sorry entitled sir you must be used to having your customers but kindness goes a long way, customer service goes a long way and you sir are a pompous ass and this is the last time we will attempt dining at your establishment .  As a waitress over seven years at the same restaurant where my customers know my life story, send gifts and generally wish me well as a ""fellow human worthy of respect "" I find your disregard for potential clientele sickening and highly irresponsible, Paul.

117,Jane H.,"Queens, NY",30,1332,12,2.0,11/1/2012,"My afternoon tea was so disappointing.... So bad that we HAD to go to Harney and Sons the next day to feel better! We had originally come on Monday afternoon only to find out that they are closed on Mondays, and you need reservations for tea. They need to put this information on their website! Let's go back to the day we actually had tea.I give them full points for decor -- you feel like you are in a small room of a rich British Colonial who is hosting you for tea. We sat in the small room in the back, and the deer heads were a hilarious touch, and there were great examples of period China decorating the walls. The table was cute too, though the china they used for us to drink from was a little crude, not the delicate type you expect from a real classy place. However ambiance is ruined by the fact that you can hear EVERYTHING in the kitchen -- shouting, pots, pans, dishware, EVERYTHING! Afternoon tea is supposed to be a classy affair of quiet conversation and drinking fine teas with delicate sandwiches. Which brings me to the food. First they brought out warm scones. While I applaud them for properly bringing out warm scones, the scones were just not that great. The cream that came with it completely lacked any kind of taste. Texture was OK, if you like that airy, barely there feel... but then again, that's not really what cream is! Then a three tiered plate display was brought in. On the top tier: The sandwiches had excellent fillings, but as Jean points out, the bread is ATROCIOUS! I ate them because I missed lunch and was hungry, but even when I'm starving I can tell that the bread is terrible -- that's a BAD sign -- when you are hungry, usually everything tastes BETTER. The bread tasted on the STALE side, and it just was not good quality bread. The second tier was mildly better: The salmon tasted great, but once again was marred by poor bread on which it lay on top. The quiche was interesting, but not memorable. Now to the last tier: the sweets. Let's just say quite disappointing. The only thing good on there was the lemon tart. Everything else tasted like from a Betty Crocker mix or maybe even worse. The brownie was dry, and the chocolate was low quality. At least the side plate of chocolate covered strawberries was good -- they didn't use crappy chocolate for dipping those, thank goodness! Perhaps that was the best thing about the food that came out. Now for the main attraction -- the TEA. The tea was a fair quality -- though it was bag tea, not loose leaf. I find it a little distasteful to use bag tea when you are serving in a tea pot, because there is no reason to lower your standards when you use such cute tea pots! Although this was good quality bag tea, they kept it rather dilute. These tea bags should have been one per cup, not one per pot! I'm so sad my tea was diluted. The sugar cubes were cute and rustic, but did not dissolve very easily. Their tea service is priced at 25, which would be a steal, except you get a very poor quality meal. I would gladly pay more for better quality. Kings Carriage House -- you are so disappointing. =(",3,,1

119,Mary M.,"Manhattan, NY",78,165,4,3.0,9/26/2014,"What I've Had: Afternoon Tea with a pot of the English Breakfast Tea - quite a selection in terms of sandwiches, cookies, and scones so i'll describe below Would I go back?: Yes but depending on the type of experience. If I am in the mood for a more reasonably priced casual afternoon tea experience i'll come back here. Story: Brought my friend here for her birthday gift. She had had brunch here before with her family and enjoyed the experience and as we were both afternoon tea lovers i decided it'd be a nice gift and experience for both of us. Came in and we were sat in the back tea room right off the hostess station. We opted for the afternoon tea service that came with a variety of sandwiches, mini scones and a slew of mini desserts as well as of course each a pot of tea. I was disappointed by the lack there of of tea selections all of them were very run of the mill teas - English breakfast, Mint , Darjeeling and 2 others i can't remember. What was very cute though was the pots were inspired by our choice of tea so my english breakfast was a very delicate beautiful tea pot with red jacket soldiers all over it and UK flags. Finger sandwiches were a bit small for my liking but there were 4 total of each type so we each got two of each and they really were delicious despite their size. Salmon is always my favorite but i must say the egg salad was very good along with the cucumber and chive butter and goat cheese mango tartlet. Scones were truly nothing to rave about i've had better at Lady Mendel's and Alices Tea Cup. Sweets were good but nothing again to rave about. Sandwiches were the best part of this meal. It was nice that they kept refilling our pots with hot water because they had the AC blasting so my tea cup kept getting cold and we had to put on our fall jackets. Overall good experience but if you want to have a more extravagant doting service experience go to Lady Mendel's.",2,,2

I walked by it because nothing on the outside says the business name unless you go up to the window and see that a menu is taped up to the glass. The decor is really old fashioned and English, I suppose. We sat on the first floor in the back but I think all the nice decor is on the 2nd floor in case you want to make reservations & ask for the upper floor.My friends and I came here for tea on a Sunday, with reservations for noon (all the late afternoon hours were booked). It's kind of like pre-fixe at $24.95 per person. Each person can get their own pot of tea. We got 1 tower of finger foods to share. I asked our very friendly server about ordering additional food if the tower was not enough for the 3 of us. She said there are additional charges but in her experience, people are pretty satisfied after they finish all the little bites.The finger foods were pretty much all pre- made, perhaps the night before because the sandwich bread was kind of stiff around the corners. Despite the hard bread, they were pretty tasty. The little berry scones were so adorable. It came with whipped cream & berry jam. It was really the scones that made us full. We got 2 each. The sweet treats, like dessert were ok, we had better.The tea might be a disappointment because we were just given tea bags inside a really adorable tea pot- mine was in the shape of Big Ben. I did expect loose tea leaves but that was not the case. This was my first time having high tea so I don't have any other places to compare with.

138,Emily H.,"New York, NY",0,135,1,4.0,10/29/2011,"Wow. What a lovely experience I had here recently. I know that in the grind of the city, I always want to go to new restaurants but this place had always captured my eye. It is indeed a carriage house in on East 82nd Street with a Philadelphia or English appearance on the outside and inside you feel like you are in someone's well appointed home in the UK. The back room is small and the night I went they were not seating the upstairs so we felt cramped at first but the candlelight, hunting room decor makes you relax rather quickly. The meal was amazing and the food was better than expected. Really. My friend thought that I was some kind of sleuth for finding this restaurant which has been here for years. The staff was warm in a different way than most places in the city. The bad side is that the menu for dinner is prix fixe- $49 with supplements of four dollars per star for certain dishes. The steak had two stars. The steak was so delicious as was the salmon. I like Salmon on the drier side so for me, this was great. The portions seem small at first but they are spot on is size and seasoning. The warm roll was very tasty and I wondered if they got it Eli's nearby. There was no wine list for a glass and the choices are odd and not well thought out. $14 for a glass is a bit much if you are not informed of what it is you are drinking. The chocolate cake and the berry crumble were great. Waiting for my guest to arrive, I waited in the parlor and loved it. Come to the Kings Carriage house if you want to feel like you are in an inn outside of the city. It has a prix fixe lunch and brunch which are next on my agenda as they are more affordable and therefore easier to consider.",2,,2

Menu was pre fixed and selections were hard to do because all of them looked great.  Recommend this place for dates, quiet delicious meals and excellent service. Selections were scallops as an appetizer, rack of lamb, and pumpkin creme brûlée (may have been seasonal) in which all were a hit and super delicious. Try it out!",,,

It is a charming place that will delight anyone that has spent time in England, especially the inns of the countryside which specialize in gourmet dinners. I wish the dinner had been gourmet, however. As I discretely tried to SAW through my lamb chop, I was afraid that with the pressure required on the knife that the chop might go flying across the room or that I'd pull a muscle in my wrist. That said, I would go back, just not so much for the food, maybe for tea. It's still a little place in time and hidden treasure and I enjoyed it immensely.",,,

Being from California, I relied heavily on Yelp to help me find a perfect location - within our price range, with a private room or setting, great service and exceptional food. After calling many places up and down Manhattan, we finally settled on King's Carriage and we were SO glad that we did.It was an ideal setting for a group of 13 women. The decor is quaint and charming, with antique clocks, fabric lined walls, tile paintings and framed pictures. It doesn't give off any stuffy or uppity impressions - more like a beloved grand-aunt's living room. The food is pretty delightful. You can get full pretty quickly off scones, tea party sandwiches and deviled eggs. The tea was great too; I loved the brews and thought they went well with the food. The service was very hospitable and accommodating. They let us stay a little longer than we had intended and were very helpful transporting the gifts out to the car. I just enjoyed how friendly they were, especially for things like taking a group picture outside of the building (it took several attempts).My only concern was the bathroom - I think it had a strange smell... but that would be my only complaint.

147,K R.,"Boston, MA",7,8,0,5.0,6/13/2012,"I recently hosted my sister's Baby Shower in the Mandalay Room at King's Carriage House. I live in Boston so it was quite stressful thinking of hosting an event in a restaurant I've never been to before. Paul Farrell was willing to work with me on the details and he helped make sure that everything was discussed so that everything would run smoothly on the day of the event.Most of my guests complimented the food. They enjoyed the variety of savory and sweet snacks offered. Most of the items had egg in it so if you are an eggless vegetarian (like me), you will have to work with them on the menu. They created this tomato asparagus sandwich that my guests loved. The venue was very cozy and set up nicely for high tea. It does not require much decoration for people who want to do a bridal/baby shower.  Although the contract says that the capacity for the Mandalay Room is 32 people, I would suggest that you have a guestlist of about 20-21 max. We had 28 people and it did feel cramped at points especially when people stand up to chat at the beginning and end. I was very impressed with Paul Farrell and his team for their willingness to work with dietary restrictions and other specific requests and for their patience of maneuvering a small place while continuing to take care of my guests. They were very kind when delays occurred and were willing to work with me on making the costs of the event reasonable (which was a HUGE plus point for me). I would definitely think of hosting another event i.e., bridal/baby shower here in the future.I felt very well taken care of and that the staff really dedicated their time and energy to ensure that we had a memorable event!!",4,,2
148,Zulu Q.,"Mountain View, CA",734,869,21,4.0,3/1/2012,"I went here for a baby shower last weekend. They manage to get a lot accomplished in their tiny footprint--but it is a bit claustrophobic for a while. Since I didn't host, I cannot comment on prices. We didn't have an actual tea party, but we had an actual lunch. Our lunch started with these pretty great puff pastry things stuffed with brie. That was certainly the best part. We then had a choice between a chicken and vegetable dish and a salmon dish. I chose the chicken because I liked the vegetables with it. (I was also sitting next to the preggers guest of honor. I know from living with her that the smell of salmon makes her uncomfortable. She actually makes the most hilarious face of disgust when she smells it. However, I tried to honor her dislike of the smell by getting the chicken. Though I don't know from experience, I hear pregnant women have this hypersensitive sense of smell too. Why worsen it?). Oh right, food. The chicken was decent enough. They actually give you a hefty serving of chicken compared to the vegetables. Then we got a small serving of cake. (Though I wanted more, a lot of cake was the last thing I needed). They didn't serve tea (probably not in the package or something), but I was able to get some coffee. I don't know what the upstairs is like, but our shower room was small and kinda cramped. We had three tables for 18 people and another table for the presents. Therefore, this is certainly the place for private, small affairs. Then again, I actually don't like baby or bridal showers because they often waste time playing games that involve passing around diapers containing melted candy bars and making wedding dresses out of wrapping paper. Thankfully, it's too tight of a space for that. Winning! The service was attentive--maybe too attentive. I had to shoo servers away a few times while eating my lunch. (OK, so I was talking a lot too). They also want to be efficient with the service because we only had the room for maybe two and a half hours. It's a very cute place that's a manageable stroll from the 86 St. stop. I don't know if I'd go for anything but a shower since I'm not a tea party kind of person.",5,2,5

Paul was the one who managed my party and he would always take the time to answer my questions and addressed any concerns I had.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan during the planning process was that in order to put my deposit down, I had to fax in my credit card information.  That being said, on the day of the event, every single person that I saw working in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful.  For tea we got an assortment of sandwiches, two scones, and a tray of mini pastries and cakes.  All the food was really good and everyone seemed to enjoy it, the only complaint that I really had was that they only offered two kinds of tea- chamomile and English Breakfast.  For a tea party I was expecting a larger selection.  So to sum up:Service- AmazingFood- Really really goodTea Selection- Could be better Overall Experience- I was very happy with my choice and would definitely come back for another event",,,

Unfortunately for the owners, the weather kept most diners at home and we shared the cozy room with only two other couples. Fortunately for us, it made for excellent service and a laughing camaraderie in the dining room every time thunder struck.The food was quite tasty with well cooked meat dishes served with tasty sauces and accompanied by good wine and a genial atmosphere. Apart from the trickiness of finding the place, it's frustrating that the restaurant's web site gives virtually no information, not even a menu. But what awaits is far better than what was expected.

It does feel like you are dining at someone's English country house. Two decades ago... (Hey, that's a good thing!) The menu is seasonal with so many delicious-sounding dishes, I was having a hard time to choose. The food, however, was sadly bland. I had the velvety cauliflower soup with smoked salmon, the filet mignon with stilton and horseradish mashed potatoes, and some dark chocolate dessert. It was just painfully unremarkable, perhaps I just made some bad choices, I'm not sure. (My companion wasn't impressed with his meal, either.)The service is friendly and well-meaning, but misses here and there. The wine-service, however, was inadequate.

I think a lot of it had to do with the waiter and not necessary the place itself but be warned nevertheless. The restaurant was pretty empty when we were there. Despite this, there were multiple problems - 1)  The food took a really long time to come out, despite the restaurant being empty2) I ordered tea. The waiter didn't ask what kind I wanted and just brought me black tea. This usually wouldn't bother me however for a place that specializes in tea, I should have been asked what kind I wanted. 3) My parents both ordered the omelet with brie cheese - which was on the menu. The dish arrived with goat cheese in it. When we asked the waiter he said that the menu had changed and they hadn't updated it yet. Ok, not a big deal, however we should have been told when we ordered it that the item was no longer available and that the menu had changed.4)Two of us ordered Eggs Benedict. The eggs came out very over cooked. When we told the waiter he gave us attitude and while he did take the eggs back, we overheard him say really nasty things about our table (and we had really been very nice about everything) to the kitchen staff. 5) When we were asked to see the dessert options (which had been on the menu previously given to us)  we were told that the menu was wrong and the waiter just told us what they had. Not a big deal, however shouldn't this place have updated all their menus before sharing them with the customers. I could overlook many of these things if they happened independently of each other but to go to a restaurant -  being given a different dish then what we ordered, without being told, and then hearing the waiter said obnoxious things about us is not only uncalled for but bad customer service is really unacceptable.",3,,

168,ashley m.,"Cambridge, MA",10,10,0,4.0,8/5/2009,"I had to write a review after witnessing the following exchange last night while out to dinner for my parents' 30th wedding anniversary: Owner: And how did you enjoy your meals? Father: Everything was delicious - if I were at home I would lick my plate. Owner: Well sir, I'm glad to hear it, and you're in our home, so please do feel free to enjoy. While my father didn't decide to take back the plate for a good lickin', I absolutely agreed with his impulse. The King's Carriage House combines the charm and elegance of an English country home with the comfort and familiarity of your own home, topping it off with a delicious prix-fixe menu that never fails to impress. Portions of grilled duck breast with sour cherry reduction or cold poached wild salmon with dill sauce have not been downsized, unlike at many finer dining establishments. The menus, which seems to change to reflect the market's freshest ingredients, are balanced and thoughtful - better to come with a party of four or more so you can try more options, but save room for a warm blackberry and pear crumble with irish oatmeal crust ginger creme anglaise, or a plate of stilton (huge wedge) with fruit, berries (beautiful and plentiful) and biscuits, topped with a nightcap of port wine and which comes in a portion large enough to feed everyone at the table. Wonderful, lovely, cozy and charming spot for both a special occasion dinner or just a night when you're willing to splurge a little to not cook, and the proprietors are unfailingly friendly and thoughtful; if you call a couple days in advance they'll note your occasion at the top of that evening's menu.

174,Jay G.,"New York, NY",18,321,359,4.0,2/12/2007,"I'm not sure on the history of this place, but i like it a lot for a quiet meal. It seems most of the locals know its here, but it would be easy to miss it if you weren't looking for it. Because I find myself at Brady's (the bar next door) more often than I feel comfortable admitting, Kings Carriage house only steps away, is like an oasis. The food quality is excellent.",1,1,2
175,B ..,"New York, NY",16,287,0,4.0,5/21/2011,"Celebrated my beautiful bride to be; Athena's, bridal shower here. The service was excellent, the pastries and sandwiches were cute and light, and the privacy they offered in a separate room was perfect for the occasion. Congrats to Jason and Athena! :)",,,
176,Karina W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1,1.0,8/24/2012,"I've lived in New York for several years now, and my husband and I enjoy exploring new restaurants especially in our neighborhood.  Tonight, we found the King's Carriage House which is very close to our apartment, and unfortunately we had our worst food and service experience since we moved to the city.  The food was poorly prepared, my 'medium' steak was 'well done' at best and very chewy, the ingredients could have made a good meal, but the poor preparation made them simply unenjoyable.  In addition, the service was unacceptable, the waitress answered our questions with 'eh' (!) instead of explaining anything. Moreover, we were her only guests (I know, should have been a bad sign), but nevertheless we were waiting for our food and later for our receipt for an unacceptably long time.  In the end my husband and I passed the time trying to recall a worse dining experience in New York... we still haven't remembered one.  There are so many good places in this area, you should seek out one of them.",1,,
177,E T.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,5,0,5.0,4/12/2011,I just held my sister's baby shower here and it was the perfect spot.  The staff was unbelievably accommodating and the service was wonderful.  The food was delicious and the portions were appropriate for a 3pm tea.  We brought our own wine in and they uncorked and served it for $20 per bottle.  We had 25 women upstairs and everyone fit nicely.  I would definitely recommend this place to any looking to host a shower in New York City.  The only thing I would keep in mind is that the 2.5 hour time slot goes by quickly so begin opening gifts sooner rather than later.,,,
178,Mary F.,"Burlington, VT",0,4,0,5.0,3/16/2012,"We stumbled into the Kings' Carriage House with a pile of luggage and big appetites, purely because of its location and its favorable listing in the Michelin Guide.  The staff could not have been more helpful in every way.  The downstairs space is a charming small room in cheerful yellow, bedecked with china and even a couple of deer heads.  The food was outstanding -- duck that could be cut with a fork, subtly flavored dressing on a perfectly fresh salad.  We were so impressed that we returned a few days later for dinner, and once again had an exceptional experience, this time upstairs in the more capacious red dining room, with tall tapers and quiet music.  The duck this time was served with sour cherry sauce, a fine balance of sweet and tart.  The mille crepes cake was to die for -- and I have eaten a lot of pastry in Europe.  A real find.  Totally recommended.  Lunch was $18.95 prix fixe, dinner $49.95, and (unusually for NY) there was decent wine for $35 a bottle.",1,,
179,Hilah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,18,0,5.0,4/1/2012,"Tea here was amazing. We had a groupon, which made it doable in our price range, and was definitely worth it. As everyone says, the atmosphere is amazing, and the adorable different tea pots they give each person is both whimsical and quaint. I thought the food was just incredible--but I was so full at the end that I couldn't finish my little tea cakes and cookies. I don't like eggs or chicken sandwiches--but would have gladly eaten like six more of either their egg or chicken salad sanwiches they were so delicious. Scones were amazing--warm, not too sweet, went so well with the cream and jam. Desserts were my least favorite part (though again I was also super super full) but didn't seem particularly special--but really, just the chocolate covered strawberry was enough to please me in that department. The rest of the food was absolutely amazing--I am actually craving it now all the time. I wish I had the money to go back. Such a perfect, peaceful, calming way to spend an hour or more. Refill tea, gave us an extra scone, the owners are so charming--Just the best way to spend an afternoon in NY.",,,
180,Mightysilly T.,"New York, NY",0,45,0,5.0,3/12/2010,"Had my bridal shower afternoon tea there. They have a few private rooms. We ended up with the beautiful private space as pictured.  Afternoon tea was lovely...with fresh flowers on each table, beautiful place setting. Finger foods were beautiful, fresh and delicious!  This place is definitely a gem under the radar. After researching through all the other places in the city known to do afternoon teas/showers, this place was far and beyond the best choice. Price was also very reasonable compared to the other ""usual"" places. What's great about this place is that there is no attitude or hassel because they are ""too popular"".  Service was so warm and so friendly in a genuine way. They helped us with all our gifts, and chatted with us while we waited for the taxis (since it was raining). I really feel that we've found a hidden gem here. I was thoroughly impressed.  More people should know about this place because they deserve it.",6,,
