0,Julie C.,"Queens, NY",37,94,173,4.0,8/13/2018,"Love how this restaurant is conveniently located in Gramercy. Came around 1:30 in the afternoon on Sunday and lucky for us there was room for two people at the bar. The host was friendly and showed us to our seats and gave us menus.We ordered the following:Bluebell Breakfast- You can't go wrong with this and it is great if you're looking for a little bit of everything. This comes with eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, and a biscuit. Everything tasted great and shout out to how crispy the bacon was! Norwegian Smoked Salmon Benedict- This also came with a side of potatoes. The smoked salmon tasted delicious but sadly, this dish was a little too salty to our liking. Both dishes were very filling and the food was pretty standard. There is a family-like atmosphere and the staffs are attentive. I would definitely come back for brunch!",2,,
1,Hadwing G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,5,4.0,7/6/2018,"Foods are delicious and had A wonderful evening!The desert is strawberry Rhubarb Crumble. Too acid. Maybe try the other desert next time.Waiters are friendly and kind.(Lost my umbrella at there, I don't know I can find it or not when I go there next time.",2,,
2,Vivian C.,"New York, NY",238,80,261,4.0,6/29/2018,"Solid lunch game + absolutely fantastic reservation process/service for our large group!Food: Trio of beef sliders: juicy medium-done beef sliders with bacon, gruyere, blue cheese, arugula. Your pick of salad or fries. Would go with the fries next time.  Wild mushroom toast: a huge mound of lovely garlicky mushrooms (many types) on two large slices of toast. Dessert: did not actually get it but walking out spied a bunch of tarts and pies with ice cream sides that looked amazing. Will have to get next time. Service: spot on and super kind. Made our reservation for 20 happen with no fuss. Split the check individually for all of us too. Space: a large space with bar area and stools alongside a back area big enough for a part of twenty. Plenty of seating in the front of the restaurant too. Price: $20 for my trio of burgers including tax and tip. Still have leftovers for dinner, so portions were decently sized and priced. Definitely will need to come back for brunch. Note, they do not have brunch on Fridays.",1,,
3,Onvara A.,"Cary, NC",30,311,594,4.0,10/19/2018,"Overall great experience at Bluebell Cafe - good food and ambiance, but service is lacking as our waiter never checked up on us during the meal or refilled our water.Really enjoyed their Norwegian Smoked Salmon Benedict though! The side potatoes were also delicious and reminded me of fries. Portions were good. My friend got the Bluebell Breakfast, which consisted of two eggs, sausage, smoked bacon, buttermilk biscuit, and potatoes. They let us substitute fruit for the sausage! The biscuit was also a standout.",1,,
4,Bailey A.,"New York, NY",1,67,3,4.0,11/5/2018,"I went here on a Tuesday night for dinner. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:30pm. There were a few people seated but it wasn't packed by any means. It was easy to walk in without a reservation. I loved the decorations and feel of the place. It made you feel like you are down south and in someone's home. I loved it. Our server was attentive and nice. We both ordered the ahí tuna sandwich. It was really good. The bread the sandwich came with paired very well with the ahí tuna. The sandwich was very good and filling. There was a lot of tuna on the sandwich. It came with fries, which were also good.",1,,
5,Sandy D.,"New York, NY",260,136,496,4.0,12/30/2017,"Bluebell only offers their brunch menu on weekends!! So imagine poor me sitting there on a Friday afternoon excited to order the brunch options that I kept seeing on Yelp photos just to hear this sad news.Luckily, the food on the lunch menu was delicious and made up for it! We got a full course meal of a Wild Mushroom Toast appetizer, a spinach goat cheese omelette main dish, and red velvet cake for dessert! The Wild Mushroom Toast was definitely my favorite! Nothing wild about it but it was definitely delicious! I love the taste of the garlic, buttery mushrooms and the soft toast together! The omelette lunch is spinach eggs with goat cheese served with salad and fries! Spinach and eggs was yum but the goat cheese definitely added that kick of unique flavor to it. The red velvet cake (served with ice cream and coconut flakes!) was homemade I believe. Hence, that was probably why it did not taste like the type of red velvet cake I expected it to be. It has more of a grainy texture instead of the creamy fluffy type. I usually don't take much notice to waiters as I eat but I couldn't help but notice there were a lot of waiters working here! Shoutout to this one worker who reminded me of Ed Sheeran though! Everything about this place would have been perfect. Great food, great workers, great interior. Until I used the restroom at the end. Man, the coldness of that bathroom is too much on these chilly days! Nonetheless, I would definitely go back to Bluebell to actually try the brunch next time!",7,,2
6,Jenni S.,"Flagler Beach, FL",35,35,24,4.0,9/18/2018,"When I have a certain food in mind it's hard for me to want anything else. Oysters weren't on the menu so I settled for mussels. I hate mussels so that probably wasn't the smartest of decisions but ya know you only live once! Anyway, here come my mussels and homemade fries... I ate every single bite. It was incredible. My dinner guests were equally impressed with their salads. My drink was always full. No complaints! Check it out for yourself and order the mussels!",1,,

8,Sneha S.,"Medford, MA",0,10,0,5.0,11/18/2018,"Adorable ambience and good food. I went for an evening tea and bites with my dad and he enjoyed it. We had the apple pie and fries, with peppermint tea and cappuccino. Everything was great, including service.",,,
9,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",223,218,634,5.0,5/11/2018,Consistently great food and good service. Great spot for solo dining as you can get seated right away at the bar. The chicken salad wrap I got was huge I couldn't even finish it. I did however polish off the fries that came with it.,5,,1

11,Maureen W.,"South Pasadena, CA",721,861,9,5.0,4/27/2018,"Came here with friends on my work trip to NYC. I was dubious because it looked like a cafe, low key. And it was. But they made a killer dirty martini to start so kudos. That started my evening off right.  The place was busy but not too loud and the tables are not crammed in so you get to have your dinner in peace without someone directly next to you crowding your space. It was like a cute little homey dining room.The service was top notch. This is a place where you want to become a local because they are all so nice. My dining partner happens to live in the neighborhood so they DID know here and knew her drink too.  Nice touch.We started with the crudo plate with veggies, bread and hummus. Really flavorful and yummy.  I also had a crab cake which was delish. Yummy crab, little filler, good dip.  For dinner I had the salmon which was very good. Well prepared and seasoned. Since my friends love this place, I would say 5 stars and I would come back any time. Very cool, low key and delicious food. Friendly atmosphere and great service.",4,,1
12,Micah S.,"New York, NY",0,73,0,4.0,10/24/2018,"Solid food, enjoyable atmosphere and very good service. In such a stressed out neighborhood food-wise where everyone's addicted to being very special, this place strikes just the right kind of note, at least for me. Does the menu really have to be fancier so I remember the food forever? Um no. The people I met, the fellowship we shared and the fact that the food and service didn't fuck that up is all I need to remember.",1,,
13,Michael R.,"Milford, CT",32,210,246,5.0,5/19/2018,"My girlfriend and I visited for a very nice meal.  I had the hangar steak with mashed potatoes, it was exceptional. My girlfriend ordered the braised short ribs which were cooked perfectly as well.  Our waitress was very nice and the drink menu was fun/unique.",1,,
14,Cat V.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",304,236,85,4.0,4/3/2018,"Bluebell is conveniently located off 3rd Avenue between 23 and 22 streets. It's a charming, country style, cozy restaurant with a bar. They have breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner menu options throughout the day/night/week. It gets quite busy on the weekends past 11am and in the evenings M-F around dinnertime. Staff is nice and service is average except one time when the bartender seemed annoyed at the buser. Everything foodwise has been super yummy, rich in flavor. Some of the dishes I've had so far include the Brioche French Toast (yummy and woah, its huge), Bluebell Breakfast, Country Eggs, Pancakes, Curried Chicken Salad, Asian Style Chicken Wings, Beef Bourguignon, and Salmon. The pricing is average for the area ranging from $5-$28. Definitely a place for flying solo, brunch with friends or family, or a date night. Love my neighborhood cafe, keeps me coming back.",4,1,1
15,Neha K.,"Cambridge, MA",396,94,307,3.0,7/30/2018,"Quaint little brunch spot with a family-like atmosphere and great food+service. I came here on a Saturday for brunch around 12:30pm with 2 other girlfriends and surprisingly only had to wait 15 mins for a table. Our server was very attentive and candid, recommending to my friend that another entree was the same price and same based but served more sides compared to the entree she picked.  I ordered the three-egg omelette with cheddar, onions, and spinach. The omelette was pretty run of the mill (the spinach didn't taste as fresh as I was expecting) but I really enjoyed the warm, moist biscuit and potatoes that came with the meal. Also, I wish they had more vegetarian-friendly brunch  options on the menu -  many of the dishes came with bacon or sausage. (However, it may be possible to substitute these for avocado or fruit or something - I didn't try asking). However, there were barely any vegetarian/vegan lunch options, which was a bit disappointing. But, I still enjoyed my meal and would be willing to give them another chance.",2,,1
16,Ann L.,"Chicago, IL",551,87,136,3.0,11/27/2017,"The Bluebell Café has everything that should bring it hype: calmer vibes in Gramercy, a cozy interior, & attentive staff. However, it's not very memorable, considering I forgot I ate here last week.My friend & I grabbed brunch here on a Sun afternoon, and we didn't have to wait very long before we were seated. The menu itself has a good variety of American selections: I ordered a Norwegian Smoked Salmon Benedict, & my friend grabbed the Tuna Nicoise salad. I'm annoying & ordered the Benedict with modifications (sub fruit for potatoes, hollandoise on the side), & my meal was prepared with all accommodations. Amazing. However, both dishes were standard. Okay. Pretty, but something I could make at home. There really isn't anything captivating about Bluebell Café, with patrons likely returning for the sake of familiarity. Nonetheless, it has potential: just bring more creativity to the menu.",,1,
17,Hia A.,"New York, NY",74,36,16,5.0,10/2/2018,"Amazing crab cake sliders + fries! Great, prompt, and friendly service :). The space is large, comfortable, and there was no wait for a table (weekday around, 11am)",1,,

19,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",1032,172,59,2.0,1/10/2018,"Definitely not a fan of this place unfortunately. It seems like the kind of place that people would just go to over and over again because it's a typical breakfast/brunch place, but it's not a place that I would visit again. I wound up getting a steak item and my friend got an item with eggs and both of ours turned out super inconsistent. I asked for the steak medium rare and some parts were more well-done and others were rare (I'm not even sure how they managed that to be honest). My friend's eggs were also not cooked the way she wanted them so we were pretty disappointed after reading the reviews that people wrote on Yelp.Overall, I personally wouldn't recommend you eat here, but perhaps we just got the wrong items and other items are better.",1,2,
20,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/28/2017,Awesome neighborhood spot with a quaint atmosphere and decent food. I've only been here for breakfast but it was delicious and was decently priced for the area. Their biscuits that come with most dishes are delicious!!,2,,
21,Junga M.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",211,57,21,5.0,12/16/2017,"Went here on a fluke, was glad we did. The crowd was older, but whatever, we were there to eat. Great food, quick service, had a table right by the street so we had a view. Would go back again.",2,,
22,Latha P.,"New York, NY",41,245,11,3.0,9/21/2018,"I walk past this place a lot since I live only a few blocks away. When my friend suggested this place for happy hours, I jumped at it. This is a great neighborhood place, excellent location, nice space, decent service and food. This review is only for drinks and appetizers. They have a decent happy hour wine selection and we shared an order of mac n cheese and hummus, both from the appetizer section. Hummus was passable, and the mac n cheese was good but a little bit liquidy at the bottom. If I lived in a different part of town, would I come searching for this place? Definitely not. It is not that memorable in ambience or food. But it is a really lovely neighborhood place which has quiet happy hours and a nice bar you can sit at if you are solo. I may have given 4 instead of 5 stars but I thought service was a bit lackluster. It may be just that one person or she had an off day. It was like she coudn't hear me or understand me or even sometimes see me. I had to repeat everything I said several times so may be she is not used to foreign accents? I wouldn't mind going back to try a proper brunch or lunch.",,,

Updated review","This place has really charmed me with it's delicious food, reasonable prices and homey country-style decor. I have had weekday sit-down breakfast in the area a few times and this has been my favorite. My three egg omelette with cheddar, onion and bacon was everything I wanted it to be, and the home fries, fruit and homestyle biscuit on the side were delicious. All for $13 ($12 if you only choose 2 omelette fillings).I also had OJ which was the cheap stuff but I still enjoyed it, and a latte. They use Irving Farms brand coffee and espresso which is good quality and flavorful.I highly recommend this place for a classic and tasty breakfast. I'm excited to try their lunch offerings sometime.",1,,
34,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1704,228,4.0,9/5/2017,"Gem of a brunch place in Grammercy. I really like the downhome cafe feel that is so much cozier than Manhattan's many impersonal brunch destinations. Love the L-shaped diner counter where locals come to sip coffee and read the newspaper.We walked in around 10:15 am on Saturday and were immediately seated, with a high-chair for our friends' little one produced lickety-split. Come after 11 and join the waiting line.No major surprises on the brunch menu but they do have 3 types of benedict as well as biscuit and gravy options. I was craving an omelette and it was just about right. Staff was also flex enough to ring me a plate of nova lox even though it wasn't strictly on the sides menu. What more could I ask for?",5,1,2
35,Charles X.,"Hanahan, SC",1,16,13,5.0,3/14/2018,Super charming and delicious. Probably the most American restaurant in all of NYC.  It's very bright and utilizes what it can to help create a sense of being transported to a classic country kitchen.,3,,1
36,Demetra P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/29/2018,"I went for a quick soup and sandwich today. In the 45 minutes that I waited (in the nearly empty place), a friend's table was served their food, cleared, and they paid their bill. The waiter came over after 20 minutes, exclaiming that my order had not been served, and disappeared to sort it out, never to be seen in the restaurant again. By this time, my friend and I also had a chat and set a date to meet. Then, I called over the man clearing, and asked for my waiter, who only appeared from the back several minutes later, while another woman watched this unfold. More exclamations-this never happened to him before! He would take care of my bill and get me my (burnt) grilled cheese sandwich. What a disappointment. My waiter vanished yet again, only to leave to the day unceremoniously. Another waitress told me ""there are good days and bad days."" Seriously!",,,
37,Tina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,33,15,5.0,7/20/2018,This is such a great neighborhood spot! Love the vibe! Lots of character and very homey. Good food and service with a smile.,2,,
38,Jackie O.,"New York, NY",6,54,10,5.0,3/1/2018,"Stumbled across this spot for a late lunch. Super cute with a homey feel and the service was great. Got there around 1:30pm on Thursday and it was empty. The lunch menu had tons of options and we went with the:- Caesar salad with grilled chicken: Big portions and fresh ingredients- Ahi tuna sandwich: Big slices of pickles, the bread was soft and crunchy, and very big with a side of fries or salad- Mussels and fries: Huge portion as well and the sauce was super creamy, definitely ask for a side of bread to dip it in the sauce!Everything was simple and great! I think the prices were reasonable and I'll definitely be going back.",1,,2

40,Maya E.,"Manhattan, NY",287,80,60,3.0,3/30/2018,"Have come to Bluebell a few times for some local brunch. The times I have shown up have been on a Saturday, one time early in the morning and another few times in the early afternoon. I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated (no reservation). Brunch is served all morning and all afternoon pretty much on weekend. I prefer their brunch menu to their regular weekday breakfast menu. I usually order the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict, which is only offered on the brunch menu. This is a pretty decent dish. I have certainly had much better but I like it enough to have ordered it a few times and I would recommend it. I have heard from others that I have been with that the French Toast is very good. Ambiance is cute and the restaurant doesn't get too loud during brunch, which is a plus. Prices are not bad either. For the most part, I have had pretty positive experiences here but the food is quite average.",,,

This place was lovey and quaint. I sat at the bar and was greeted immediately. It wasn't busy since it was 2:15pm but I was given water upon sitting. I ordered the tomato bisque and it was delicious!

Greeted by a friendly host and were seated at a beautiful table by the window. Not much needs to be said about this place. The service was attentive and friendly but not overbearing.

The decor is homely with paraphernalia on the walls and shelves, somewhat untreated wooden tables with some artistic detailing and a slightly slanted wood floor. The service was swift and friendly throughout. The menu had all you brunch classics plus some ""more like lunch"" items. Most (if not all) of the brunch items come with a buttermilk biscuit and (what seemed like) homemade jam, which was nice. The potatoes were home fries but with actual fries instead of potatoes; I appreciated that!On the whole the food was very good, just not amazing.

48,L W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,632,1484,3.0,2/26/2018,"We decided to try this place for a quick dinner on a weeknight. Hubs had been wanting to try this place for a while. The restaurant is long and narrow with a dimly lit atmosphere. The place has a kind of fancy feeling to it, which is something that my daughter personally likes. Chandelier lights hang from the ceiling on the right and the rightmost wall is made entirely of bricks. There is also a bar that's just straight ahead as soon as you walk in. Daughter ordered Seared Ahi Tuna, which had pickled cucumber-onion ginger, and arugula with wasabi -lime mayonnaise on a French baguette. She ordered it rare but it came out medium rare but she liked it anyway. Hubs ordered the Bluebell Brie Cheese-Burger, which had applewood smoked bacon, butter lettuce,beefsteak tomato on an onion brioche roll. He ordered that rare but it was more medium rare. He thought it was ok and thought that the butter lettuce added nothing to the sandwich. Overall, he thought it was better than 5-Napkins and the salad was good. Next time he'll be asking for raw onions. Finally, I ordered Batter Fried Cod Fish and Chips with Tartar Sauce. It came along with sweet pea purée, lemon wedges, fresh herbs, French fries. I thought my order was the best of the 3. It was nicely fried and the batter tasted great. Beer battered fish is awesome! Service was VERY slow. It took us and another couple an hour to get our order. Meanwhile, everyone else who came in after got their orders and were eating already! I think they lost our orders. Our waitress finally realized it and went into the kitchen to ask. Daughter was grumbling, too. Other than the slow service, food was good. Will return again to try other items on the menu and hope for quicker service!",,,
49,Michael V.,"Manhattan, NY",330,99,310,4.0,7/15/2017,"I came here with a great friend for their prix fix dinner special - $34 for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. A great deal for the amount of food we received! I got the salad with blue cheese and cranberries, steak with asparagus, and the brownie. Everything was well portioned and absolutely delicious. Our table had amazing service, and someone was always checking on us, making sure our water glasses were full, asking if we needed anything. The three courses came out relatively quickly and were well paced in between each course. I'd do this again for a special occasion.",,,
50,Liz P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,78,79,3.0,3/31/2018,"Decent for brunch. You walk in and think you're in the Midwest with the decor but then you hear the conversations around you and are brought back to city folk chatter (omg, my kid is on the preschool wait list, no I swiped left, ugh I saw Dear Evan Hansen for the second time, no, I lost out on the apartment, you wanna go to Trader Joe's?)French toast was tasty. The Super Texas toast slice makes it look like cake. Buttermilk biscuit was dry. Steak and eggs. Hangar steak of the lowest quality had me chewing like cattle. Nothing you can screw up with eggs. The potatoes were chopped up fries. Steel cut oatmeal and fruit can't be screwed up and they didn't screw it up. Phew. Great Irving Farms coffee. A decent place, not necessary to go again with all the other options in the area. It would not have been worth it if the wait was longer than 10 minutes.",,,

Yes, as I love trying different brunch restaurants.I was going to go for a typical brunch menu- most likely some sort of an egg dish, but their lunch menu just looked amazing. We ended up ordering the lobster sandwich, avocado toast and a grilled salad.I have to say I absolutely LOVED their grilled salad. The grolled Romain salad was served with shrimp, cheese, dates and a pesto sauce. I knew salad can become very creative, but their salad was beyond what I call the ""norm."" The combination of that all ingredients were speechless. I can definitely plan another visit just for this salad. It was that good.Unfortunately, the avocado toast was bit disappointing. It wasn't cheap, but the serving portion was very small, and I felt like I can make a better avocado toast than they did... the layer of the avocado toast was as thin as a paper... Lobster sandwich was great. Nothing really particular that stood out from other restaurant's lobster sandwich though",2,1,3

Updated review","Notwithstanding the first time I ate here being mediocre, I've retried this place a handful of times and it's actually quite good.  I stand by the short ribs being underwhelming, but everything else I've tried is pretty darn delicious.  I think this place is better for brunch than for dinner overall.  The salmon benedict is a killer breakfast/brunch.  The brioche french toast is absolutely to die for...just note it will likely put you in a pretty harsh food coma (which I personally enjoy you just have you literally structure your whole day around it).  It also has a very quaint vibe that's nice for a casual meal.",,,
53,Min J.,"Westchester County, NY",86,23,36,3.0,1/1/2018,"We got crab-cake eggs Benedict and steak nd eggs. The crab cake eggs Benedict was  fishy. The steak was overlooked. Eggs were bland and not tasteful. The side fried potatoes were crispy and flavorful,  but it's nothing special...comparable to fresh McDonald French fries.Food was large portion . Bloody Mary was small. The guy next to me had a bigger glass of Bloody Mary, the waiter said it was a different size. Mine was 7 dollars tho....smallest Bloody Mary I've had.",,,
54,Lauren R.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,116,356,3.0,12/9/2016,"This was my first time at Bluebell Cafe and I liked it overall, but I didn't find it particularly special. The food was good overall and at reasonable prices, plus their happy hour special offered a $7 glass of Montepulciano wine which I took advantage of. I had the arugula and beet salad, delicious and sizable. Their special was butternut squash soup was also yummy and relatively rich. The other menu options included many sandwiches, burgers and salads.The restaurant was moderately busy and I sat at the bar. I found the server to be friendly but she didn't check in very much and it was difficult to get her attention at times. Overall, I would return to Bluebell Cafe and I would hope to have slightly better service.",,,

The food is filling and a bit like homemade, however nothing out of the ordinary. Prices are quite reasonable. I usually like to get either the salmon eggs benedict or the Bluebell Breakfast (sausage, bacon, eggs any style, and home frites). Every dish always comes with a few pieces of random fruit mixed in, which I find strange.",,,

60,Celena C.,"San Francisco, CA",686,72,98,3.0,2/14/2017,"The buzz around the ""gorgeous menu"" here is like that of Wiz Khalifa or some overrated artist. Really not that worth the hype. However. the server was extremely sweet -- when I found a hair in my eggs benedict, she immediately swapped the thing out faster than I could say ""yuck"". But let's get down to the nitty gritty stuff.Sliders: Devilishly, fabulously overpriced. But each one had a different flavor (arugula + bleu cheese, caramelized onions, cheddar and bacon) which was really neat, and I loved how the bread was soft for once. The flavors were explosive. The onions were in your face and the cheese came off rancidly strong, just like Bumble dudes. I'm a fan. Eggs benedict: As soon as I became the lucky recipient of this dish, I knew that my friend who ordered the sliders had won. Not too big of a fan of cured meats in the first place, I thought the ham seemed like Jewel-- sorry, I hail from Chicago, folks-- uh, Safeway? grade. It didn't seem all that special. It was like a very archetypal eggs benedict. No more, no less. Nothing special. it was classic right up to the bearnaise. Add some other spices to it, maybe? Garnish with some veggies? Restaurants gotta learn better balance sometimes.",2,3,4

I only order the Bluebell breakfast: Soft biscuit, jam, eggs any style (I opted for poached today), and home fries. Oh, and a few fruit as decor and a snack--usually cantaloupe and grapes. Their home fries lean more towards thinly sliced potatoes, borderline fries, but I dig it.Friendly staff, quick service, comfy space, good breakfast. All smiles here.",1,,1

64,Vanessa G.,"Berkeley, CA",22,39,4,3.0,10/8/2017,"Just found this place on Yelp and a couple of review sites scattered around the internet. While the interior is cute, clean, and inviting, the food left something to be desired. I was lured here with images of perfectly poached eggs (my kryptonite) and dark coffee. While the eggs were good, the Benedict ham was so salty I had to forgo it. Also, the potatoes seem to be chopped up French fries (not bad, just unexpected.) That being said, the staff were helpful, efficient, and attentive (y'all were great). Overall, this place may be a solid option for everyday nosh, but if you only have limited time in NYC I wouldn't say this should be your breakfast destination.",,,

67,Sunny S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,380,145,4.0,12/28/2015,"I've walked by this place so many times, but never got a chance to go in and check them out. A friend was visiting this past weekend and I decided Sunday brunch would be a perfect time to finally eat here (and I'm glad we did).When you walk in, there's a long ramp that leads you into the middle of the restaurant, or should I say large inviting nook in a suburban kitchen. It's a very open dining area, with tables all over, but enough room to walk around and not be sharing meals with the people sitting at the table next to you. There's a nice brick wall that runs the entire side of the place and rustic wooden floors, giving it a ""used"" look. The bar looks like a kitchen island, with a tile counter and cabinets behind the bar. This definitely makes you feel as though you're not in the middle of Manhattan, but in some faraway country kitchen, with delicious home cooked meals coming your way. All the waiters/servers were wearing plaid, which I thought was a cool touch.I got a coffee and ordered the the three egg omelette with onions, peppers, and cheddar. Beware, the coffee is super strong! I love coffee but not a big fan of very strong coffee. I added my normal small amount of milk and a Splenda, and it definitely has its strong, tangy aftertaste to it. At first I thought it was just bad, but our waitress informed me that it's super strong.The food came out and it looked great. Another heads up, their brunch portions are huge! I'm a big fan of biscuits and want them to be warm and flaky, however, this one was a bit cold. It was still pretty good, as I don't eat biscuits quite as often as I'd like to, and was even better with their jam. The omelette was decent - nothing special. The cheese was very stringy, and I could've used some more onions and peppers. The potatoes were pretty good - they're diced and mixed with finely chopped peppers and onions too. The service is a tad slow, even though they weren't busy.Overall, a very warm and welcoming restaurant, and definitely a place I'll come back to. Good date spot too.",2,,1
68,Nik K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",168,9,8,4.0,11/10/2017,"Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. The Asian style chicken wings were crispy and well-sauced. The Bluebell burger was delicious and the brioche bun was a good touch. I asked for medium rare and it was actually cooked as such. The red velvet cake was moist as hell and the coconut ice cream it came with was perfect. Inhaled the appetizer and burger, so only remembered to snap a pic of dessert. I'm beyond comatose after that meal but pretty pleased about it. One star taken off for these items being a tad overpriced.",,,
69,Elaine D.,"Manhattan, NY",11,3,1,4.0,6/15/2017,"This was the most delicious breakfast I've had in a long time!  The French toast was scrumptious, with fresh berry compote on top and lemon curd on the bottom, I didn't even need the syrup.  Although, the toast seemed to be soaked in a combination of syrup & butter.  Yummm! We struck up a conversation with the owner, who was from Ireland, and confirmed my sense that this dish had a distinct ""Great Britain"" flavor.  Everything on the menu sounded wonderful. Do try it out!",2,,

And when my brunch babe and I arrived around 11am on a Sunday we were seated immediately... However the wait for parties larger than 2 was long. They serve bottomless Irving farm coffee and a very ranged selection of options, from pancakes, to sandwhiches, salads and then typical brunch egg fare. I got the omlette with spinach and muchrooms, it came with a five star biscuit that I inhaled, super delicious non greasy homefries, and a pretty good omlette. My brunch babe got the bluebell breakfast and definitely looked like a good deal as it came with a generous portion of varied things to brunch on. Overall I would recommend as a great brunch option for the area!",,,1
71,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,99,19,5.0,12/22/2017,"TLDR: JUST GO HERE! Good food, cute country kitchen decor, call for reservations around the holidays or else there's a wait. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. It's one of my favorites and I don't say that very often. I've been coming here off and on for over 5 years and I've personally never had a bad meal here before. I went on Thursday Dec 21 at 6:30pm and they were the busiest I've ever seen them! All the tables filled up at one point! There was even a line of people waiting for seats! I think they're extra busy due to the holidays. Make sure to call for a reservation so they can reserve you a table. Maybe ask if they can seat you away from the door. We got sat right next to the door and it was chilly whenever the door opened, which was often. But other than that it was another exceptional meal.What we all had:-Cornmeal Dusted Crispy Fried Calamari with Sweet Chili Aioli, Cucumber, Lemon Wedges (appetizer)- Fresh and delicious as always! A++-Roasted New Zealand Lamb Chops with Herb Roasted New Potato, Grilled Asparagus, Sweet Pepper ""Soffrito""- Juicy, cooked to perfection. Great flavors without overwhelming the taste of the lamb. So good! A+++-Boneless Beef Short Ribs with Whipped Potato, Sautéed Kale, Red Wine Reduction- Another delicious dish. A+-Pork chop with homemade apple sauce, served with crispy potatoes and sautéed greens- I don't have the exact description since I think it was one of the specials of the day. But it was good and juicy. The apple sauce added an interesting flavor note. Not my favorite but great if that's your thing. B+-Trio of Beef Sliders: Cheddar and Bacon; Gruyère and Fried Shallots; Blue Cheese and Arugula- Perfect for those who want to try a little of everything. My personal favorite is the Gruyère and Fried Shallots slider! Comes with choice of salad or fries. Get the additive crispy fries (just needs a dash of salt)! A+-Mixed berry crisp with crunchy oatmeal topping and caramel ice cream on top- This took a little while to come out. I think it's because the kitchen was backed up from the full dining room and I think they made it fresh. I could taste blueberries, strawberries, and another fruit I couldn't distinguish. The crisp part was a delicious crunchy counterpart to the warm gooey mixed berries below the surface. It wasn't too sweet and paired well with the caramel ice cream. A++-Beverage notes: My friend got the cocktail with Scotch, vermouth, and something else (maybe bitters?) with a cherry on top but it tasted only of scotch and nothing else. Pass on that! Two friends got the Magners pear cider, which is a nice semi sweet version. Very light and refreshing. Great if you don't like the taste of alcohol. I got the prosecco by the glass. Nice and dry. I would recommend that. Overall I had a great time eating good food and catching up with old friends from high school. Only small hitches were one dish came out five minutes later than the other three, my name on the reservation was misspelled so badly I could only recognize it as it was the only 4 letter name!!, and we were seated at not the best table by the door. In NYC there are so many amazing restaurants that I don't waste time returning to mediocre places, but I would come back here in a heartbeat!",1,,
72,Joey R.,"Buffalo, NY",153,118,82,4.0,10/9/2015,"Randomly stopped by Bluebell Cafe because I was hungry and a random lady on the street saw me reading their menu outside the restaurant and swore I ""had"" to try it. I'm glad I took up on her offer!Bluebell Cafe's a cute little place tucked away amongst many restaurants in that area. It's not the biggest place, so if you have a party of 4 or more, it might not be the ideal spot. The decor is homey rustic country, and each table is painted with bluebell flowers.I was greeted right away and their service is on point. They promptly seated me and served me drinks. And like magic, they always knew when I needed something but otherwise, left me to enjoy my meal without much interruptions.I had the Norwegian smoked salmon and Bluebell brie burger. The salmon was a little salty by itself but paired really well with the rest of the dish. Portion was generous and enough to share with 2-3 unless you're hungry. The burger was tasty as well and cooked to my desired temperature. The bun was toasted and initially I thought it the bottom was a little overdone and hard as I'm the type that likes to cut my burger in half. However, it turns out that because the bun was that way, my burger stayed intact every bite! I don't know about you but it is a definite pet peeve when my sandwiches and burgers fall apart mid-consumption. It also came with a pickle wedge that was a tad spicy and delicious.The only reason why they don't get 5 stars from me is because their french fries were in consistent. Some were crunchy and tasty and the other half was soggy. Definitely not ok but I as hungry and didn't think it was worth sending back or complaining. All in all, I would go back!",3,,2

I've been seated in as little as 5 min before. Even groups of 4-6 can usually be seated in as little as 20 minutes. The service is usually pretty good and the food is great. Simple dishes but delicious. Their eggs benny with smoked salmon, omelettes, and brioche french toast are all very good. The french toast is definitely a must try item.

The pancakes were so good which was what I had when I came for breakfast super fluffy and flavorful. You didn't  have to try drown them in syrup like in some places. Another dish that I had that was super good was during lunch and it was the mussels. Wine broths and reductions aren't super hard but they do take time to get right and this reduction was perfect seasoned well and just completed the dish.,1,1,2

Since it was a was a weekday, there was next to nobody in the place at 8:00 am. I walked in, was shown immediately to a table, and ordered fast. I ordered the BlueBell breakfast with bacon. It's a basic breakfast with two eggs any way you like,  breakfast potatoes which are more like miniature fries than the typical breakfast hash browns, tons of thick slab bacon, and a biscuit. Simple, and hearty. I couldn't eat all the bacon, so clearly I got enough food because who leaves bacon on the plate? Nobody. Nobody leaves bacon.I liked the potatoes...they were cooked perfectly with a lovely crispy outer shell, and they're seasoned. They were tasty, the eggs were done right, and the bacon was very good. I wished I could have tried the french toast but honestly I'm not sure where I would have put any more food. If my husband had been with me, we'd have ordered one of each and split them so we both could enjoy the sweet treat. Ah well. Next time.If you're near Gramercy Park, give this place a shot. Then head over to Think Coffee. That's what I did, and it was a great way to fuel up for the museums.",1,1,

I went with a group of 6 and We all enjoyed our meals. Also, this place is very affordable per NY standards. I loved the biscuits( order a side with jam) you will be charmed and very pleased! Definitely will return to this location again as t is great for groups, solo  and couples. My only con was that the advice was a bit slow ( the severe not the food) and they could be a little more enthusiastic but overall the food was 5/5 and the locale is very nice.",,,

Everything is country themed with different dishware, wooden kitchen tables, and lots of hokey decor (but still adorable). We could not be seated unless our entire party was at the restaurant so we had to wait a bit. I ordered the country eggs (two over easy) which came with fruit, home fries, and a biscuit smothered in sausage gravy. Very tasty. The restaurant takes no reservations, so expect to wait on a weekend.",,1,

I usually get the Country special eggs. Today I had a grilled shrimp salad. It was really tasty. Shrimp cooked perfectly; the green dressing made from yogurt my new favorite. Healthy and yummy! We sat at the bar. The bartender/server was friendly and attentive.  I Almost hate to write a 5 star review because more people may find out about their excellence.

Despite the 30 minute wait (it was a Sunday), we were seated quickly by a very hospital waiter. I was very impressed by their menu selection and even more impressed by how delicious everything was.

The staff is awesome. Specially Orlando who is the main reason I keep coming back. The tuna sandwich is by far my favorite to day, but I'd still recommend the Brie burger and the fried calamari. I insist on saying, the main asset of this place, is the staff. Old review: It was five to ten and I got a burgeoneon steak to go that I'm eating right now and it is awesome.

It's one of the few places I've discovered that serves bangers and mash, which I LOVE but the sausages could be a bit better. It could be a slightly heartier dish, especially during winter. I have given it four stars because the menu isn't amazing but it's dependable and I wouldn't let that stop you from visiting a really nice little place on third avenue. The staff are always lovely as well.",1,,

119,Laura P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,342,0,4.0,7/26/2017,"I couldn't be happier that I discovered The Bluebell Cafe. It's so under the radar, but there isn't one thing we tried that wasn't incredibly delicious. I love the food, I love the atmosphere, and if I had any criticism, it would be that perhaps the wait staff could have been a bit friendlier and engaging. Not that there was anything wrong with our server, but it just seems like given how great everything else is, the cherry on the cake would've been fantastic service as well. That's a minor point, though. Once you discover the place, you'll go back again and again. Their menu is quite large and they serve breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. I had had my eye on going there for brunch for a while. I think that's actually the peak time for this place. People love the egg dishes and breakfast foods and from what I've seen and heard, it's all for good reason. But on this occasion we opted for dinner. The place is dimly light (not too dark), really cozy, nice, spacious, and have pleasant ambient lighting. The tables are comfortable and spaced a comfortable distance apart form one another. There's also a large bar in the middle of the dining room. It's really a mix between a nice pub and a nice cafe. We were between several dishes, but in the end, we narrowed it down to the beef bourguignon, grilled chicken Caesar sandwich, lamb shank (special), and crab cakes. Beef Bourguignon - whipped potato, pearl onions, carrots, and celery, slow braised in a red wine sauce. Now I have to say I was quite skeptical of ordering this classic French dish at this cafe. It's a nuanced dish and the sauce is incredibly important. But oh.my.god., they hit a home run here. The beef is so tender, the flavor profile of the sauce was so developed, the vegetables were fantastic. I wanted to literally lick the plate. I took some of the extra bread and soaked up as much sauce as possible, but I really just wanted to lick the plate.Grilled Chicken Caesar Sandwich - grilled chicken breast, Caesar dressing, romaine hearts, parmigiano reggiano, served on a French baguette. I opted for it to be served in a spinach wrap instead. I was also a bit skeptical about ordering this dish. As much as I love Caesar salads and sandwiches, it can just end up being so mediocre. Wow was this one delicious. They put just the right amount of Caesar sauce in the wrap, the chicken was great quality, the romaine hearts were crisp and fresh, and the cheese was the perfect accent. It was such a light sandwich, which is surprising because when you think of a Caesar salad or a Caesar wrap, it's normally anything but light. But the dressing wasn't heavy. It was such a great portion, too. Really stuffed with chicken. I ate every last bite. It's served with your choice of fries or salad and I opted for the salad. The salad is amazing. Normally when a dish is served with a side salad, the salad is really sad. It's lettuce with a few tomatoes on it. This wasn't! This was so legit. Mixed lettuce and spinach with shredded carrots, green beans, tomato, cucumber, pickled onion, and olives. I could've literally ordered the salad on it's own as an entrée. Just great.Griddled Crab Cakes - served with sauce remoulade and tomato-black currant confit. While I didn't try these myself, our table loved it. There were two good sided cakes, served with a side salad. Good for two people to share as an appetizer.And we also ordered the lamb shank special, which I again didn't try, but it seemed to be as well regarded as what I thought of the beef bourguignon. It was served with sautéed greens and whipped potato. There wasn't a single miss and there is still so much on the menu I want to try. To name a few, I had my eye on the oven roasted chicken, but was told that takes at least 20 minutes to prepare, the grilled ahi tuna steak I hear is a great hit, and the hummus-veggie spinach wrap sounds fantastic. I just honestly can't wait to go back, but the tough choice will be whether I try something new or order the same things again. Decisions! And brunch is a must try, too. I highly recommend this place!And going back to try brunch is a must, too.",,,
120,Steve K.,"Manhattan, NY",355,69,87,3.0,1/4/2016,"Lukecold food. Lukewarm would be giving my dish too much credit. There was a suspicious lack of steam rising from my ""Bluebell Breakfast"" as it was placed before me. Half of the dish was acceptably warm, while the other half was not. Sadly the homefries were dry and cold instead of juicy, piping-hot, and lustrous. Fried potatoes should still have that oily sheen intact, fresh from the stove *shine bright like a diamond* but alas.Plus points however, for satisfyingly thick and crunchy slices of bacon and their biscuits, made fresh on the premises. They're flaky and decadent but again, were not hot. At least nuke it in the microwave and fool me?The decor is cute-ish but not enough to rock my socks off, so to speak. The hand-painted bluebell flowers on the wooden tables were a nice touch. Pinocchio's dad's workshop vibes.Given the choice I'd probs rather head to one of the ubiquitous, no-frills diners (Joe Jr's is a solid choice) for cheaper eats of similar quality. OR treat myself and spend a bit more moolah on a more indulgent experience. tl dr The food is mostly fine...even great, but anything is difficult to appreciate at room-temperature. Not quite worth the ~$20 incl/tax+tip, or a wait.",,1,
121,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",5,9,0,1.0,9/24/2016,"This place fell off. The biscuit made me gag. It tasted like straight baking soda and flour. The fries looked like leftover, cut up, re-fried fries from the night before; the eggs were runny; the sausage was gross and stringy. It looked and tasted like whoever prepared the food didn't care. I'm out. This place gets a lot of positive feedback from the neighborhood about their food, ambience and service. However as a neighborhood resident I recommend going to Friend of a Farmer.",2,,

However the pecan cranberry pie desert defiantly made up for this in its richness ( My friend thought it a bit too rich,so beware because it's a lot richer than you'd expect.) I came looking for a warm 'cozy' night cap and I got just that. The bill was a unnecessarily high though for what we had (~$26)However I just may come back to explore the other items on the menu.",,,
123,Marcus E.,"Wimberley, TX",1,7,2,2.0,2/26/2018,"Good food, but not customer oriented.

126,Priscilla C.,"Los Angeles, CA",805,229,67,2.0,8/17/2015,"I came to Bluebell 2 times already, the first time the food was not bad, and I really liked the interior. The interior is a very cute Southern feel, the tables are well spaced out, so it was a very comfortable environment for brunch. The service was good too. This is why I came a second time, but I don't think there would be another time anymore. The second time around, I ordered the Bluebell breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, a few pieces of bacon, a biscuit, a side of a fruits, potatoes, and a sausage. The brunch menu also gives complimentary orange juices. Honestly, this is a simple breakfast kind of dish, so it's not too hard to make...well...or at least I thought that. Everything was okay except the potatoes and sausage. The potatoes were hard and cold, so I barely touched that. Then the sausage was SUPER dry and distasteful that I didn't even take a second bite, and just left it there. Maybe they're just not consistent with their food, but I'm not risking that chance anymore. I also think it depends what you order because my friends have ordered the pancakes before and said it was really good, so just choose wisely. But overall I would not recommend this to my friends because there are better options in the city for brunch.",2,,1

In a city with super expensive brunches (I speak as a recently graduate hoodlum), it's wonderful to find good brunches with appropriate prices! I got the Bluebell Breakfast, solid plate for $7 (not including tax) But why is this place special? It's got a great ""old-timey"" atmosphere! The decor and even the music is more rural, it's very refreshing to almost step out of the city! A close friend of mine went at 10:30am and it was very spacious, good for bigger parties. Staff there was nice and accommodating too! My friend had his poached eggs cooked a little too much, and they immediately replaced them with good runny ones. Thanks! A definite recommend for the good atmosphere.",3,2,1
128,Ina L.,"New York, NY",3948,537,5493,3.0,3/2/2014,"This is a review for their brunch menu/service. I wish I could give this establishment 3.5 stars. I've been to Bluebell a whopping 5 times in the past 1-2 months, granted that I live in a 2 block radius from the restaurant. And every time I've been to Bluebell, I've left content but oddly not thoroughly impressed. Their food, with the exception of their brioche french toast and blueberry muffin, does not blow me out of the water. It's a cute brunch spot that gets packed soon after 10AM and well into the afternoon, but something about Bluebell doesn't click with me. So why do I go so frequently? Because there aren't any cute brunch spots I can rendezvous with my girlfriends on a lazy Sunday afternoon to catch up on the happenings from the night prior. They take dinner reservations but they do not take brunch reservations. One given Sunday morning, my friends and I waited 20-25 minutes to be seated. Firstly and CAUTION, they offer a small glass of juice with any of their brunch entrees. Sooooooo, when the waiter asks you as you are taking a seat, if you'd like a drink, say you'll take a few more minutes as you look through their menu. On the off chance that you did not carefully read my review, the waiter will most likely charge you separately for your juice without even bothering to inform you guys of their free-juice-with-brunch deal. Secondly, try their muffin. It is so buttery and the blueberry muffin comes with the most crumbly muffin top with plenty of blueberry pieces to go around! Third, I highly recommend their brioche french toast. I'm not too fond of diner french toast, brie-filled french toasts, or other fancy schmancy types of french toast for that matter, but theirs is AH-MAZING. It's extremely fluffy and light in the inside but with the perfectly thin coating of crunch on the outside. It does not taste or smell at all egg-ey in any way. It comes with a few cut up pieces of cantaloupes and melon, nothing too out of the extraordinary but the french toast, berry compote, and lemon curd combination is out of this world!Fourth (and second downside), they offer as ""bowl of organic granola"" as one of their sides. And I don't know why but my friends and I found this extremely misleading. My girlfriend ordered it assuming that the granola would be served with a yogurt or a parfait of some sort, which is the norm, no? Well, not at Bluebell. She literally got a bowl of crushed up granola. And to make matters worse, it was $7. But it only goes downhill from here because as she was taking her first bite of dry organic granola, she digs into her bag and pulls out a Nature Valley granola bar, opens up the packaging, and was automatically convinced that they were serving her broken pieces of Nature Valley granola. We thought it'd be entertaining to call our waitress over to ask if the kitchen just served us overpriced Nature Valley granola bars. She pled the fifth. Fifth (and third downside), their Eggs Benedict is decent. Nothing spectacular. 1 out of the 4 times I ordered their Eggs Benedict, they over-cooked the poached eggs so much that the yolk resembled that of a hard-boiled egg. Unbelievable... Sixth (and fourth downside), their Tuna Nicoise salad was an impressionable size with 4 thick pieces of grilled tuna, perfectly pink in the center. But the tuna smelled too fishy. It wreaked, actually. And certain parts of the tuna were warm where other parts were cold.",4,2,1

145,Rod P.,"New York, NY",48,28,8,4.0,8/19/2016,"Overall it deserves 4 stars (my next visit will determine if it remains that way)I ordered the brie burger combination. It worked well. It was moist n' flavorful, bacon is always a great addition. The beef to cheese ratio, in this case, was well balanced.  Burgerseurs or traditionalists may think different. I did not take advantage of the bar, so next time We actually came here believing it was all day brunch with all the majority of the photos on Yelp showing nothing but. We'll be back to take advantage of it then.",,,

150,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",209,93,335,2.0,3/2/2015,"This cafe is nearly always packed! We waited for a table during brunch on a Saturday for more than half an hour because the cafe is really small. Ordered pancakes and my friend has an egg, grits and bacon brunch dish which looked appetizing. My three fluffy pancakes were tasty, sweet and light. With maple syrup, they became way too sweet so I kept drinking water and digesting those three pancakes the whole day. My friend also ordered an appetizer, which was well prepared, but nothing special, just like everything in this place. It's a solid American comfort food menu with nothing to stir the imagination.I was surprised by the noise level--when we entered the door I could not hear what my friend was saying and had to raise my voice to make sure he heard me. It was 11 AM! I was worried that we would have to shout and strain our hearing to have a conversation, but thankfully we sat at a table by the windows and exit, where the noise level was the lowest. Be prepared to pay more attention towards maintaining a legible conversation in such noise than to food.",1,,

152,Adam M.,"White Plains, NY",155,22,38,4.0,12/13/2014,"Went here for dinner with a friend and glad we found this gem.  It is a nice size restaurant with a cozy atmosphere. Great specialty drink selection but we only had the wine. For appetizer we had sauté mushroom on what seemed like a Texas toast. It was mixed with  pignoli nuts, Parmesan cheese and truffle oil. Great choice. For entree I had the lamb shank in a burgundy sauce with sauté kale and asparagus. The flavor was great but the portion of the lamb shank was a bit small (btw the lamb shank was a special). My friend had the roasted chicken served with mashed potatoes and sauté kale. I tried and was very good. Love that roasted flavor. Good size portion. For dessert we shared the creme brûlée which was amazing. Not overly sweet and very creamy. It was almost like a vanilla bean. Overall great dining experience with excellent prices and would surely go back again.",3,1,1

When it's not socially acceptable to have french fries at 10 in the morning, you can go to Bluebell Cafe for an #automaticwin.One of the better brunch spots.

There was a decent amount of space in the restaurant including one large table for a large party if needed. Ambiance was casual.I had the Crab Cake Benedict and it was pretty good. The portion was generous and it had a nice crab flavor. It came with potatoe fries and 3-4 small pieces of fruit. The fruit is a random assortment and feels like an after thought. My girlfriend had the Bluebell Breakfast which includes bacon, sausage, potatoe fries, biscuit, and the random fruit. Portions were generous as well.Overall it had good food, fair prices, and good service.",,,

159,John R.,"Portland, OR",44,157,14,4.0,4/20/2015,"I would love to rate Bluebell higher but for several reasons I'll get to below, I cannot. I've been to Bluebell nearly a dozen times during the past year and only rarely did I leave dissatisfied. Living close-by, I managed to usually get here early enough that we would beat the rush and be seated immediately. They have great food here, I believe, but there is a weak spot somewhere in their customer service. First, the food. The French toast is rich and memorable, as delicious as the dish gets in this iteration. I love their French toast and order it on every visit, smothering it in the berry compote and dipping alternate bites in maple syrup. Every time I've had eggs at Bluebell, they've been cooked with care, the right way. Omelettes are done well, and items are generally cooked to order quite quickly. The brewed coffee, by my beloved Irving Farm, is delicious and supplied in ample quantity. The espresso-based drinks leave a lot to be desired, however. The potatoes supplied with many of the breakfasts as a side is essentially French fries and in my opinion isn't all that good or original. I found them to be bland at best, kind of a filler. The juice and other drinks are good. A bloody mary was great but a bit pricey for the size. They are friendly, just not generously-so. The menu isn't very large and they are not very accommodating when it comes to substitutions or alterations. Also, although they offer the Eggs Benedict (and a few other items) on weekends, they absolutely will not offer it on weekdays, no matter how empty the place is. I've been there and asked questions and been essentially ignored or dismissed, though it was never intentional, just a lack of concern or knowledge. The food and friendliness more than makes up for any of this of course. Recommended!",,,

Waiter was friendly and attentive (though we were at the bar right in front of his face)Negatives: The hostess quoted us ""10 minutes or less."" After ~10-15 minutes we asked again and were told it would be another 15 minutes. We were very hungry and almost walked out to a diner nearby, but decided to stay since the bar was open.

As a plus my cup was also warmed up ( I love the little things) and if you know me I'm a stickler for hot things hot and cold things cold. I ordered two eggs poached with a muffin and everything was pretty tasty, presentation could've been nicer on the egg platter though (i.e. some greens or a couple slices of fruit) and for that I took a star off. It just looked a bit sad, and being that the place is so nice and given attention to detail, for me that stood out.",,,

The food is good (got the French toast and the salmon Benedict), but plenty of brunch places serve similar fare...if anything, they're more stingy on the portions now (the French toast used to have a lot of fruit!) but I guess once you're a popular restaurant, it's about turning out more food for more people huh",1,,

I tried some of my friend's pork tenderloin, and honestly, the lamb was better. the pork was alright, but portion size left a bit to be desired and it could have used a bit more flavor of some sort.the mulled wine, augmented with a liberal dose of brandy, totally hit the spot.service was friendly. it was moderately busy on a Friday night.the menu is diverse, and it's a lot of standard fare - steaks, sandwiches, grilled entrees - so there's something for everyone, plus the prices aren't bad. a solid choice if you're in the area.",4,1,1

Updated review","After the recent Yelp brunch elite event I brought a group of fellow yelpers here for a little after event meal. As there were about ten of us I called ahead to make sure we could get seated. The staff was super accomodating and had a large table all set up for us when we arrived.What more can I say? The service was very friendly and helpful, and the food was terrific. Just such a comfy and homey place to have a Saturday afternoon brunch meal. Southampton Pumpkin Ale on tap made for a wonderful tasting pint. Had three of those! Was pleased that everyone seemed to really like Bluebell.Also, I must comment on the clean and roomy bathrooms. Those stalls can easily fit two or three people if needed. A few in our group really took advantage of them and enjoyed the space they offered. Need to install some sound masking on the walls though since you can hear things through the door if sitting close by. (wink...inside joke)",6,8,8

188,Yusuf W.,"New York, NY",157,46,256,5.0,5/12/2015,"Came here initially for a glass of wine after work with colleagues. The space was warmly lit and my initial reaction to the space reminded me of a mix between a country cottage and a chic saloon. I wasn't planning on eating as I was only going to be there a short while.But when the vino flows somehow an energy of celebratory merriment tends to govern ones psyche and before you know it, plans get pushed back a bit and food is before you waiting to merge with you.So the masterpieces we were so fortunate to have before us were the Asian Style Chicken Wings, the Griddled Crab Cakes, and the Grilled Chicken Thighs. All were amazing!The Asian Style Wings were in a sauce that was out of this world and The Crab Cakes were incredibly tasteful! My favorite of the three was definitely the Grilled Chicken Thighs. Of all the parts of the chicken to eat, the thighs are my least favorite. That should tell you how good these were. They came with caramelized onions, a citrus sauce, and raisins (who knew?). Together the combination was a fantastic medley that makes me have a deep appreciation and respect for the culinary arts. The word mastery comes to mind here.I was told the chef's name is Scott Hawley . . . Thank you Scott, you're the man!Will definitely be back to try the main entrées.

Words cannot express my love and admiration for this dish. It looks just as tasty as it is presented; the meat was so juicy and paired so nicely with the sauce.

The food is not inventive, but the cooking met my standards and is probably better than most similar type establishments. The most interesting menu item is soda from Ireland. The service was adequate. All in all, average, not sure this is our weekly go to, but perhaps we'll add it to the rotation.",,,
199,Shannon E.,"Millbrae, CA",69,127,194,4.0,3/2/2015,"Had a really lovely brunch here...no NYC brunch scene or long wait drama. Friendly staff from start to finish and great (not over-thought) food.I had a 3-egg white omelet with spinach and mushroom....hard to mess up, but others have before so was happy to enjoy their version + great homemade biscuit. Small glass of fresh OJ comes with every meal and never once had to ask for refills on coffee or tea. Very prompt and friendly service.It's a tight space but didn't have to participate in the conversation of others, think the airy atmosphere and bustle of the restaurant provides some sound cover. Great place for a friend or date brunch...and will def be back from a casual/homey dinner.",2,1,1
