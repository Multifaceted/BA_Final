1,Jessica L.,"Farmington, CT",84,145,69,5.0,5/7/2018,"Great, professional staff that were genuinely nice at each interaction. Great price for a weekend night in the city.I was pleased with the cleanliness, spaciousness for an NYC hotel room, and the comfort of the bed. The free breakfast was an additional perk.I took the subway from Grand Central and walked the remainder. I felt very safe in the area. I'd certainly stay here in the future when visiting Brooklyn or the Lower East Side.",2,,1
2,Kristina D.,"Reno, NV",3,33,37,4.0,6/25/2018,"Staff was fantastic! I booked at last minute when late flight out of JFK was cancelled. Great price for city-- easy check in with waters, a snack and toothbrush! Woke up to pretty view of downtown and pedestrians starting across Brooklyn Bridge! Loved room 901- small, but clean, great space!I feel so much better this morning after quick breakfast and easy check out!",1,,
3,Nicole P.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,107,30,2.0,8/13/2018,"The hotel was clean upon arrival and the employees were helpful. The location can't be beat. What was most concerning, and the reason we will never return, is the breakfast. Not so much what was served- your typical overcooked oatmeal, DIY waffles, and soggy fruit- but the space. Oh my goodness someone needs to take the initiative and fix that space. I was unable to walk from one food area to my table without moving several chairs, bumping into numerous people, and then scraping my legs against the table legs. The same experience was had by every other guest. There is not enough space for the furniture they've chosen, in particular an extremely large high rise table. In one day and with under $100, that space could be improved to be a functional breakfast dining area. As is, it is painful to see much less experience. I have never seen such a poorly organized space at a professional establishment. What a shame.",1,,
4,Kristy C.,"Elkin, NC",0,2,0,5.0,7/22/2018,"Our first stay in NYC was very pleasant with our stay at Hampton Inn Manhattan Seaport area. The location was out of the hustle & bustle of the city, close to Brooklyn Bridge & water attractions, and convenient to nearby drug store for any necessities you forgot at home. The hotel was very clean and the staff was great!! Breakfast was great and people at check in / check out were super friendly and accommodating!! Would stay there again!!",1,,1

6,Sherry W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",693,1193,13361,4.0,5/5/2015,"The rooms are clean and a good size.  This is a small hotel with less than 10 rooms per floor.  Beds are comfortable.  The breakfast could use some improvements.  this was the weakest Hampton breakfast I have had throughout all my Hampton Inn stays.  The breakfast area is very tight when there is a full house trying to serve themselves and find a place to sit.  Food options: cereal, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, bagel, waffle maker, canned fruit, fresh apples/bananas.  No juice machine...they have to refill pitchers. Coffee machines are plugged in so the water cools off after a while.  This hotel is next to the Brooklyn Bridge and South Street Seaport.  There is a Duane Reed within walking distance. Overall, it's an acceptable hotel for the price.  Staff was super friendly. They will store your bag for no charge.",7,1,4
7,Aaron T.,"Easton, PA",397,508,123,3.0,6/18/2016,"Hampton Inn Seaport gets the job done.  It's exactly what you'd come to expect of a Hampton Inn property:- a place to sleep (the beds have never left me wondering if I went to sleep or got hit by a bus the night before)- a place to bathe (with hit or miss shower heads with adjustable settings)- wifi for hhonors members (using AT&T wifi - the service has been ""spotty"" and I've switched to tethering devices in the past)- free breakfast (with some warm stuff, not just cold cereal. They also have gluten free cereals available)The staff has always been friendly and helpful when checking in and checking out of the hotel.The location is the most appealing next to the Seaport with a variety of bars and restaurants nearby to visit. As expected, exactly when I need it.  Never my go-to for business in the financial district, but serves as my backup property for business trips.",2,,
8,Lee M.,"Toms River, NJ",0,14,19,4.0,5/4/2018,My husband and I stayed here last Wednesday to attend the Baldor Food show on Maiden Lane. Cannot tell you how friendly and fun your front desk staff/managers were. We promised them cheese from show and they sent a birthday cake to our room with a nice note for my husband's 50th birthday.  I don't really expect this kind of personal service from a chain but they went above and beyond. Only reason not five stars is the noise was crazy between street and doors elevators but it is NYC and loud.,,,

Updated review","First visit to this cute, charming hotel at the seaport.  Diamond, Stephanie, Edward, and there team were great!!! They were professional and very eager to assist us. They made us feel so welcome and appreciated.  Excellent job!!!The hotel is small, but, clean and comfortable.  There's free breakfast and 24/7 beverage access.  Very nice.Drawback: small room with no views.",,,
10,Jane P.,"Silver Spring, MD",563,610,1083,4.0,12/6/2015,"A good hotel with a decent location. We were a walking distance from China Town and right next to the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a beautiful view to see when we stepped put of the hotel. The rooms were clean and up to date. The staff was friendly and accommodating. They were very helpful and never hesitated to give advice when we needed it. There was a computer for guest use and they always had coffee, water, and juice for you in the front lobby. Their breakfast was not bad. They served waffles, eggs, sausages, fruits, pastries, bread, etc. If you're looking for a place to stay in New York, I would recommend this place.",3,,1
11,Diana N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",18,41,24,4.0,2/19/2017,"Stayed at this Hampton Inn last weekend and was so pleasantly surprised!  Nice size room with comfortable beds, good and safe location, very friendly staff and very good hot breakfast!  There were three of us (two adults & one child) and compared to many other NYC hotels we've stayed at, this room was a very good size!  The M15 local bus is right outside of the hotel entrance door, the express bus is just a block away and the subway is a few blocks away.  Chinatown & Financial District are short walking distance away.  There is always hot coffee, hot tea, hot water (they also have cocoa packets) and ice water readily available on the first floor, which is great when we walked in from the cold!  The fitness room is very small, but functional and they provide free ear buds for the guests, which is a nice touch. Our flight was not until 6pm and the staff was nice to hold our luggage for no additional fee until we were ready.  We walked around Times Square and had lunch and when we returned to the hotel, we had some coffee and hung around the dining area.  The dining area has quite a few outlets, so we recharged our phones before heading out to the airport.The only reason why I didn't give five stars: the ice machine on our floor was not working, if you need to use the printer, the ""business center"" is right by the elevator so everyone can see what you are doing, no fridge and no safe to store valuables.I will definitely stay at this hotel again and would definitely recommend!",,,
12,Christine L.,"San Francisco, CA",1139,147,21,1.0,10/8/2015,"The people who work here are so nice so I feel bad writing this, but the room is terrible. I'm in the basement right now room 103. Here are a few of the problems:- It smells terrible - zero reception. Have to go upstairs to make a call - scary door with broken lock, not sure where it goes- room phone doesn't work no dial tone - heater ac is broken the screen is completely whited out - man in hall from 10pm-4am arranging boxes and making loud noises- shower was cold for about 10 minutes - elevator was broken so guests had to carry bags (again a nice call out for the staff, somebody helped carry my heavy bag)I'm stuck in the room. No reception to call, no land line to call and I'm freezing with no heater. It's loud in the hall and I really don't want to have to walk to the lobby in my pjs to report this. So instead I'll sit here and suffer, I'll be cold, watch the scary door with no lock and post this with my spotty wifi. Help.",5,4,1
13,Mrs. D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,47,66,3.0,2/17/2018,"This is tough because the staff was super friendly and helpful. As far as service & staff interaction they get 5stars. The facility however, get 3 stars at best. This building is old and needs a lot of TLC. My first room had no working heater. Staff tried fixing it when I arrived at night but ended up moving rooms. My first room had a view of the city but it was super noisy. The room I was moved to was in the back and had a view of another building but it was quiet and most importantly the heater worked. The bathroom sink stopper was loose & not attached to lever so it would stay down & so had to remove it so could use the sink. Not that big of a deal.-I managed. The shower was tricky. The screw in the handle was missing so in order to turn on you had to push in and turn. The problem is that doing that doesn't allow for small temp changes. If I wanted hotter water it would go to scalding hot & if i wanted to cool a bit it go too cold. But I made it work. Tile and carpets showed signs of wear. There is only one elevator so if you needed when housekeeping is out working you'd be better off using stairs or it will never come. Breakfast is included and was small selection but was good and eating area was clean.",,,

My boyfriend said ok, but she's talking to us on the phone while we are outside of the the DOOR!! She then and goes to tell us we can do it online it's much cheaper.. as if me and my boyfriend asked for the price. So I go and call myself...meanwhile me and my boyfriend are at the bus stop and I asked her it's not letting us book for the same night can we come and booked with you. Finally she say yes so we're waiting to see what rooms are available. She then goes and say the only room we have available is the basement. $150 for a basement room. No way. I felt like everything was sketchy with her from the prices to her name !!!  I will never go there again in my life and I hope she doesn't work there in the future because I feel bad for other customers.",,,
15,Kimberly A.,"Boston, MA",584,451,0,5.0,2/2/2017,This is the hotel that I stayed at during my last visit to NYC and I really enjoyed my stay. My room was ready early when I arrived so they let me check in a couple of hours early. It is located very close to the Brooklyn bridge and many nice stores and eateries. The staff is very friendly and courteous. I did have an issue one of the days with getting my key card to open the door to my room one morning but the staff very quickly had the door serviced and issued me a new key card. They also gave me a $25 gift card to Bath & Body works to make up for the mishap and that was a very nice surprise to find in my room upon my return to the hotel later that day. They serve a very nice continental breakfast each morning and that is included in the price of your stay. The rooms are clean and very well kept up. When I checked out on the day I was to return home they allowed me to store my luggage at the hotel since I still had several hours before my bus trip home and wanted to go off for the day without having to lug my suitcases with me. They even helped me out with getting a car service back to Port Authority when I was ready to leave because I was having trouble getting a cab. I paid $320 per night when I was there which is a little pricey but the staff went above and beyond to make sure I was happy during my stay there so I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again should I ever decide to visit NYC in the future.,5,5,5
16,Bridget T.,"Duluth, GA",8,104,147,5.0,7/1/2015,"I was so impressed before I even got to NYC. I had 2 reservations and wanted to ask about not having to move to 2 different rooms. I called and spoke to ""San"" and he assured me that it would all work out and even said - I will be at the desk tomorrow morning when you get here so I will personally make sure you are set up properly. Wow I was impressed. I arrive in NYC at 8am  - he also told me that they would be highly likely to have rooms in the morning so early check in wouldn't be an issue. I rarely hear this so it was another nice surprise. So I arrived and asked for a quiet room and was assigned room 607. Seemed quiet since it wasn't on the street. I was happy! I left for work and came back at 8pm. Apparently the A/C hadn't been working. I called and a nice lady sent someone right up (I was impressed how quickly) - his name was Darnell, he was super nice and calming. He did the ""fix"" and asked if there was anything else I needed. I said I wish I had a refrigerator to put my left overs (I just assumed all Hamptons had them) but he fixed that problem too by gladly offering to take it to the employee lounge (or somewhere) and labeling it for me which he did. Well as I prepared for bed, I realized the A/C unit will not give you the option to leave the fan on all night long - it's just OFF or AUTO - so needless to say I was awoken all night by it turning on and off... I called the front desk and ask for a bedroom fan. A very polite lady said she would send one up right away. Well it was Darnell again - which made me happy to see a familiar face at 3am... the fan worked perfectly.The next morning I encountered ""Chris"" not sure of name (but a young black man in sharp clothes) - anyway he was so polite and pleasant and even approachable so I teased him about only having the ""pink stuff"" (saccharin) for coffee - I said you know that's the stuff from the 70's- the blue stuff was the 80-90's and now we use the yellow stuff in the 2,000's .. he just laughed but I said I would grab a handful from my office  and bring them back- he said no he would take care of it.. sure enough the next morning there were tons of yellow (splenda packets) and btw all the used packets in the little trash can were yellow which means other customers wanted it too.  breakfast area is small but the lady that does the stocking is very nice and attentive tp the cleanliness of the room. Re-booked for another week Jul;y 6-10",,,
17,Carrie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",248,315,30,5.0,1/3/2016,"The Macy's Day Parade did not bring me to this location for the Thanksgiving Holiday but a deep desire to have a staycation while my twin boys visited with their fathers side on the Upper West Side. I lived in the Bronx and the Upper East Side while attending Fordham University years prior but had never really traveled to lower Manhattan so I was skeptical of ""FIDI""...Pros: Very convenient location to the subway. Let me reiterate-this hotel is super convenient...it took me less than an hour to go from JFK to the front door of the Hampton Inn where I was greeted with an easy EARLY check in by the morning manager that knows the city. Once I put my bags down I still had 30 minutes to get the hot breakfast that was waiting for FREE. No lines, no tourists to step over and turkey sausage for those who do not eat pork. Most of my days were sleeping in late to barely make the 10am breakfast cut off but don't worry habitual late comers-the staff will usually bring you juice and a muffin as they see the look of despair on your face because the clock reads 10:30 am. When I did finally run into the city via Uber, Citi Bike or Subway, I would come back at 1am with a hot chocolate waiting for me in the ultra chic lobby. On the days I did not want to be bothered with the hustle and bustle, I would walk down the street to the Open Door to get a Moscow Mule and watch a basketball game-ask for Shannon(sp?). For those that like to shop you can walk to a bunch of boutique sized name brand stores: Guess, Abercrombie, etc.Cons: None for me...well...housekeeping had to put up with me keeping a Do Not Disturb Sign on the door but that did not hinder me from getting a clean room and turned down bed for the night. For those of you not from New York City, you may have complaints...because...well...you are not a New Yorker...I paid $1600 a month for a closet coupled with a mile hike to the subway from the East End. This hotel is a great deal for great service.Will go back.",3,,

If it were based on the staff alone, I would definitely give it five stars. The staff is really great. I can't state that enough. The room that I had was very small, but I expected that. The part I have issue with is the fact that my bedding was old and worn and dirty looking and my comforter was covered in stains and hair. It truly needed to be replaced. It had long black hair in several places on it. It was pilled and stained. The carpet was very old and my room had a musty smell. My room did not have a view, but I was staying there for work and I visit New York City a lot, so that was not a concern. The heating in the room was very hard to regulate. If I turned it up 1° to 70° it was an absolute sauna within 20 minutes. If I left it at 69° it was very cold and chilly in the room.The bathroom was very clean.

I'm normally a Marriott person but between the insane prices and limited availability here in the financial district - I stayed in this Hampton Inn.  I admit I have avoided Hampton Inns in the past as many of the places I traveled for work - the Hampton Inn was usually the oldest property and in the least desirable part of town but things seem to be changing for the better.  Many of my co-workers use Hampton Inns (Hilton HHonors) and I might be joining them. This property is located just off the Brooklyn Bridge in the financial district so its very convenient for the area.   Its small.  Average by NYC standards I am sure but small from what I am used to.  They still managed to put all you need in the tiny room so I really have no complaints.   It feels newer.  The rooms were clean and honestly they seemed to clean the rooms daily much better than the Marriott service I am used to.  HD Flat screen TV.  Comfy bed.  Clean sheets.  Clean room!  Honestly I can't find anything to complain about.  Breakfast is served at 6am.  Again - standard fare for a hotel.  Its free to all guests - not based off status - so that was nice.  The food was nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad either.  They try to mix it up a little different each morning but still offered the standard continental offerings as well.  Coffee was decent.  And of course the free cookies in the evening.   One thing that was nice - they offer a free breakfast on the go.  It's a brown bag with an apple, muffin, juice and some mixed nuts.  Also free and a very nice touch for someone in a hurry.  The staff was always very friendly and accommodating.   Again if I am totally honest - I was coming into this expecting to not be happy since it wasn't a Marriott but I was pleasantly surprised overall and would be willing to not only stay here again but use Hampton Inns more in the future.",3,1,1

If you leave your room while the rooms are being cleaned you will most likely have to ride in the elevator with the trash and walk around it in the hallways. I really liked the location.

There is a wall-mounted flat-panel TV with a mounted small shelf beneath for storage.  The bathroom is average size and clean.  We had a view of the ""courtyard"" which was really just a hole in the middle of the building.  Some rooms do have balconies.The hotel is very convenient to the Seaport and the Financial District. There are great photo ops of the Brooklyn Bridge from the seaport and just a block away from the hotel. The Staten Island Ferry, which departs from the Southern Tip of Manhattan, is also within walking distance.  (And will get you a fabulous, close view of the Statue of Liberty, for FREE!)   It's also easy walking district to Chinatown and Canal Street as well as Little Italy.It's definitely a bit ""out of the way"" if you're a Midtown person, but it is just a subway ride away.  (One transfer.  Get a MetroCard!)The Seaport is what I've come to expect from a Hampton hotel.  They are owned and operated by Hilton, and this location definitely lives up to that.",2,,

37,Willie L.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,19,1,4.0,10/19/2011,"My wife and I flew into NY from Phoenix to attend the Kidney Walk, Sunday 10/16/11, starting at South Street Seaport.  So very convenient for us, and our purpose there.  I'm originally from NY so we knew our way around.The room was small, but not uncomfortable.  It had exactly what we needed.  A clean comfortable bed, clean PRIVATE bathroom, AC.  The room was modern, with white sheets and comforter, flat screen tv, and nice bathroom with no stains.  My only complaint if I had to make one......NO view.  We had a brick wall.  CLASSIC NY!.  But hey, you want views?  Go out and explore!!!!!The hotel its self is almost at the most southern tip of Manhattan.  A very short walk, maybe a 1/4 mile or less, to the seaport ( a tourist attraction for picture taking and a little NY history), and if you walk a little further you'll be at the Staten Island Ferry, Battery Park (for the ferry to, both, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island), and in the area of the Financial District , World Trade Center and City Hall a little north.  North of the hotel is China Town and Little Italy.  The Hotel is about 3 short blocks from the #6, 5, and 4 train's ""Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall"" station.  The north bound M15 bus stops DIRECTLY in front of the hotel.  You can take it up to midtown, via 1st ave, for a lot of the other major sights, if you want to remain above ground.",2,,

39,Melissa H.,"Washington, DC",0,19,5,2.0,7/22/2016,"I stay at Marriott for a reason. This was a last minute booking and I won't make this mistake again. There's not much to be desired in terms of the lobby, but service is where I'm a stickler. My husband and I came in from the 100* weather and just waited at the desk while two staff finished their conversation in Spanish before finally acknowledging us. Then, while my husband checked in I asked to use the bathroom- it was downstairs in the basement and smelled awful/was dirty. We were put on the 2nd floor but with the heat and luggage tried to take the elevator, but no go. Cleaning staff seemed to have it because it was going from the 9th floor down with long pauses in between. We ended up lugging everything upstairs to a very small room, with a slight smell, rough bed sheets and only 2 pillows on the bed. It was not the cozy, warm feeling I expect when staying at a hotel (over an Airbnb or boutique hotel that have their quirks). There are better, similarly priced hotels in the area so do yourself a favor and opt for those instead.",,1,
40,Amelia Z.,"Bronx, NY",275,403,14,5.0,7/19/2011,"Five stars on merit of service. I came here because I lost my phone and needed a computer to track down its location. My office was unfortunately closed, and I was desperate, so I figured the hotel would have a computer. I stepped inside and asked the man at the desk if an internet cafe was available. The man, who I believe was named Larry, was already in the middle of helping guests find a way home to the Bronx. He took the time to point me toward a computer, completely for free.After I finished pinpointing my phone, he looked to see if I was alright. I wasn't, and my phone is still AWOL, but when you're upset it's nice to have polite people around.Whenever, or if ever I need a hotel in Manhattan, I will return.",2,,
41,amy b.,"Cypress, TX",0,23,0,3.0,8/2/2011,"I stayed here for a M-Th business trip...  mainly because all hotels I checked prior to booking this hotel were full.  The hotel is OK.  Good location if interested in seaport area.  Also very close to the subway (Green line, Brooklyn Bridge/ CIty Hall stop).  Within walking distance to Wall St, financial district, China Town.  Right under the Brooklyn Bridge.My room was clean;  a little small, but standard for NYC.  The fitness center was very small- a tredmill and stationary bike (I did not visit the gym because of this..).  Breakfast was complimentary... pretty standard choices.  My room did not have any view at all (overlooked a roof and other buildings).  Judging from the location, I'm sure that none of the rooms had views.Wifi is available, however, mine did not work.All in all, the hotel is a little below average for a Hampton Inn in other cities...usually I find better fitness centers.  Prices are (of course) exagerated here because of the area.I would not stay here again, simply because I found other hotels online at better rates that had more amenities and better locations than this...I would check any Holiday Inn (Express) and get better rates and similar amenities.",2,,
42,Joyce D.,"Tulsa, OK",240,263,631,4.0,12/1/2008,Hampton Inn's are always solid. I have never had a bad experience.The Hampton is really close to the Brooklyn Bridge.Here are some false facts about the Brooklyn Bridge-Made of CheddarThe first bridge in the worldLongest bridge in the worldSo enough nonsense.  This hotel is located on pearl street which doesn't see a whole lot of traffic.  The breakfast was delicious.  I would stay here anytime.Friendly staff.Recently updated.Clean.Great Location.Reasonably Priced.Comfortable Beds.Big TV's.This is quite street for NYC so there wasn't much noise.,3,1,2
43,Cindy B.,"Coppell, TX",0,105,19,4.0,1/18/2014,"I stayed there while on business in the Financial District.  Great location and value.  Plus, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  Although the hotel is near the Brooklyn Bridge, it was surprisingly quiet at night.  Room was clean.  I had a light bulb burned out, and the front desk sent someone up immediately to fix it.  Note that the fitness center was wiped out during Sandy, but they had free passes to a local fitness club several blocks away.",,,
44,Kelly S.,"Berkeley, CA",27,78,29,4.0,1/6/2011,"I'm staying here on business and for that purpose it is very convenient.  One federal building is just a few blocks away on the same street, the other is right across the Brooklyn Bridge, which I walked across.  That was an amazing experience.  The room was clean and spacious enough for one person. The bed was comfortable though not the comfortablest I've been on.  The bathroom has no shelves to speak of and the room has no drawers.  The ""gym"" consists of a single treadmill and a single recumbant bike.  Not what I would call a gym, but luckily, the hotel was not occupied by any other folks who wanted to work out so I didn't have to wait.  The machines were very new at least but there was no air in the gym so I felt like I was doing some form of bikram running.  The free breakfast, which is available at all Hampton Inns, is decent. I had yogurt, a bagel with cream cheese, an English muffin with peanut butter and jelly and a very ripe banana.  But I do like there use of taterware. Huge brownie points for the endless supply of hot chocolate in the lobby.  Walked to the WTC site and came back with a red nose and a numb face.  Made myself a cup of hot chocolate, got a cup of frosted flakes and was nice and comfy again.All in all, not a bad place and because it's part of the Hilton chain, I got some points.  Can't complain about that.  I'd stay here again if I came this way for work.",1,1,
45,Ciao H.,"San Antonio, TX",15,158,0,4.0,11/15/2010,"Right under the Brooklyn Bridge in the Financial District offering splendid views when you walk the neighborhood and good access to public transport. Parking is $20 a night at a garage across from the hotel and the subway is only 2-3 blocks away. As of this review date the place has been newly renovated and looks very nice. We did a bedbug spot check on the mattresses and came up clean. The lobby is small, but adequate. Our room was long and narrow, but one expects this in New York. The price was quite reasonable. They offer breakfast but I'm afraid we never were up before noon to grab it. Certainly would stay here again. Good for a business traveler or someone on a budget who just wants a nice fresh room.",1,,

Updated review","Found out the next morning, very early, that the street right below our room was being torn up and re paved. Also the building next door was under construction. Neither of these are the hotels fault. It is a very busy area and for a country mouse I will stay somewhere quieter next time in NYC.",,,
47,Neal G.,"Hollywood, CA",31,7,0,1.0,7/11/2014,"Awful rooms, noisy hallways, incompetent staff. I'm writing this review at 2:32am while trying to get some sleep in this sub-par hotel. My wife and I had to change rooms three times in two hours. The first room was on a noisy floor. The lodgers both next door and down the hall were throwing parties while their young kids were running around the hallways (mind you, this was at 11:30pm). I asked the nighttime front desk manager for a room change; my wife and I were moved to the basement floor. The second room was foul smelling, like old fast food, and the room appeared unclean. I asked for another room change, to which we were then moved to a room in the basement floor across from a service entrance. At 1am, after my wife and I were finally able to get to sleep, we were awoken by loud, banging noises. The laundry service were loading linens into a large cart in front of our room and were repeatedly banging the cart into our door. I complained to the manager; he was of no help. It is now 2:44am and the staff seem to have ceased working for the night because whatever loud noises were coming through the paper-thin walls and room door have finally stopped. While this hotel might be a in convenient location, you'd be better off sleeping on a park bench by the Seaport. AVOID THIS HOTEL.",1,1,1
48,Heather S.,"New York, NY",31,11,0,4.0,1/28/2010,"Just had some family in from San Fran who asked me to book them a decent hotel by my Apt. so I picked the closest one for a decent price.Having never stayed at a Hampton Inn, I didn't know what to expect for my guests.  I have to admit for $200-$300 a night I was expecting the alarm clock to be nailed down to the night stand, bed bugs, a view of a brick wall, and a chalk outline on the floor.I was wrong.-Courteous door man-Chilled bottled water upon check-in (or at any time e.g. 4am coming home from the bars and in desperate need of hydration)-Free Wi-Fi-Extremely comfortable beds with great pillows-Nice view of lower Manhattan-Complimentary hot breakfast and breakfast to-go bags-Polite, helpful front desk staffWhen all you need is the basics, this place is perfect.",3,,1
49,AnitaDrink D.,"New York, NY",0,19,10,3.0,11/26/2010,"Very clean hotel located near South Street Seaport with courteous, friendly front desk staff. Double room was small, nicely decorated. No microwave or fridge in room. Small closet, no dresser. Very comfortable bed. Traffic noise was bearable. Nice hot/cold breakfast choices in cramped dining area. Restaurants within a few blocks though walking in sparsely populated streets was bit uncomfotable. Closest subway at Fulton Street was 6-7 blocks away (check maps!). On check-in, was asked for credit card and informed it would only be used for incidentals. When I got home, found a $50 charge on my account, and when I called the hotel to inquire about the extra charge, was told it would be returned to my account within a week. Wish they had told me up front. Otherwise a pleasant stay but nothing special.",,,
50,Deanna H.,"Bradenton, FL",0,3,1,4.0,10/15/2015,"We chose Hampton Inn because it was in close proximity to a Saturday morning wedding we were attending.  We average coming to the city about twice a year, so we're not accustom to the roads, let alone the traffic.  By the time we arrived to were the GPS said at the hotel was, we were frazzled and didn't see it.  We pulled around the corner and called.  Being extremely helpful, Kawanna Phoenix met me outside, showed me where the garage was and offered to hold our luggage until check-in as we arrived before the check-in time, which was nice after all the one finger waves half of NYC welcomed us with:(. There was complimentary coffee, juice and water in the lobby.  The breakfast was a typical continental with a nice selection of choices, it was clean and staff was friendly.  The room was clean and adequate, but we didn't go to NYC to stay in a room, so it was fine.  Once again, it was more the people that would have me staying here again.",,,
51,Toni D.,"Orlando, FL",669,579,1096,5.0,8/14/2009,Located in the Seaport area.  Near the Brooklyn bridge.  I was working in the area for about a month and wanted a hotel in the city. Let me start off by staying that I Love this hotel! the manager was super nice and I was able to get a great rate for a 30 day stay.  He even got me a room on the ground floor with a large patio.  He also negotiated a rate with a garage nearby for my car.  Valet parking across the street.  Kudos to the manager!!! Best customer service I've ever had with a hotel and I've stayed at a lot of hotels.  I would definitely stay here again. Flat screen tv's in all the rooms...the rooms are tiny.  But what can you expect from a Manhattan hotel.  Space is limited and costly in NYC.,1,,
52,i d.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,4.0,3/22/2009,"I was there for work (I wish it was for playyy), anyways. I needed a place near the financial district that would be decently priced in NYC. This place is exactly it, on Pearl ST, very well located if you need to get a cab ride or if you need to find decent food places, you aren't far from the Grocery place ""Zeytouna"" (see one of my other reviews ;)), basically, location wise this was great.The hotel's staff were helpful, it was quiet, the rooms as advertised, decent bed, good TV and what matters more for me decent internet connection. FYI, I paid $185/night for the 3 days I staid there.The breakfast now, the coffee served at the hampton inn is crap, you can't defend that coffee, what bothered me more wasn't that but the size of the room where I am sorry you can't pack more than 20 people at best, it's too small, you feel the need to get the hell out of there before other people try to seat at your table which is fine but if they do you can't get out unless you bother them to move their chair...etc, basically it get easily unwieldy. Other than that, the food served is what you get anywhere else which is fair.I'd definitely come back if I get the chance.",2,,

However, because it is so small, it may not be a good place if you are staying in NYC for 3 or 4 days. But overall, our experience was good, it was just a little small.",,,
56,Russ T.,"Bethlehem, PA",4,124,0,4.0,11/21/2010,"This is a very good hotel.  Rooms were a decent size.  No dressers to put your clothes into so you live out of your suitcase.  Small closet.   Large bathroom.  We had two beds in the room so we only needed one and we tossed the suitcases on the other bed.  Location is good.  Three blocks to the subway (2,3,?,?) at the Fulton St location.  You have a good selection of restaurants - from cheap to really expensive.  It is quiet, well in relation to manhattan it's quiet.The workers at the hotel are really good and try to help people, even when language is an issue.  Lots of people visiting from outside the US so you get to chat with people from all over.Only negative is the breakfast.   Small room with tables on top of each other and the food is not replenished often enough.But the coffee is really good.  If you go early you are all set.  If you go later you run the risk of not eating what you want.Elevators can be a little slow.  Internet seemed okay.  Shower water was hot (yes!!!!).  The room is quiet except for sounds from the hallway.  Amazing for NYC that you don't say traffic is noisy because it isn't.",,,
