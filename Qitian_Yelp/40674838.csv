Updated review","UNOS!!!! Hadn't been here in forever! Got here just  in time for happy hour. Great drinks, yummy and quick food/Service! I have to say, I missed my lovely Unos. It was so quiet, probably because it was a Monday, but it was still an awesome time.",,,
1,Ruby D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,65,3,2.0,9/2/2018,"The pizza wasn't very warm when it came out and the cheese wasn't melted properly. I got a salad with grilled chicken, it was more like boiled chicken, I don't think it was cooked properly or long enough. I'm not sure why our food seemed rushed, we were there at 630pm on a Saturday night and the place was about half full.Won't be going back.",1,,
2,Matthew T.,"New York, NY",144,19,0,4.0,5/24/2018,"Not sure why all the bad reviews for this location. My husband and I have been going here for years and have never had a bad experience and last night was no exception...From the host who greeted us when we came in, to the manager who made sure our Insider Appreciate Night was, once again, an amazing experience. It was worth the trip out of our way to eat here.  If you haven't signed up for UNO's Insider Club, I would recommend it  (FYI - I don't work or are affiliate with UNO's).The only downside was our waiter who seemed like he wanted to somewhere else.  It could just have been a bad day so chalking it up to that.The food came out in a timely manner and was cooked to perfection. The portions where huge - guess what I am also having for lunch today?!?! - So all in all another great experience and we will definitely be back.",2,,1
3,Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",181,272,1415,3.0,3/30/2018,"Lunch Time!When at the office, UNO's is a contender because their lunch combos are reasonably priced for days when you don't feel like splurging. They also offer options that can be mixed and matched. This is a great option because the menu is pretty standard when it comes to chain bar food. Three stars... the food is to be expected and there is nothing necessarily wrong with that sometimes but the service here can definitely use some improvements.  On multiple visits there hasn't been a time where at one point the service was subpar. This a neighbor establishment so it's a little unfortunate that customer service isn't better. Nonetheless. For those who want to brave it. They offer frequent muncher lunch cards. Buy 6 lunches,  get the 7th lunch free!",,,
4,Mei C.,"Brooklyn, NY",503,356,698,5.0,8/17/2018,"Don't knock an establishment down until you know what goes on in the back. Came here for a fun filled pizza making class bright and early. Got there late due to train problems, but instructor Sheila was super nice about it. Premade dough already placed inside the deep dish pan for students to knead. Instructor handed out gloves and plastic aprons before we get our hands into the oil to shape the dough. Sheila gave us a brief history of how Unos all started. This branch is the only location that has limited amount of stovetops and professional ovens due to the small space in the back kitchen. The amount of prep work involved before opening up for business is chaotic and insanely time consuming. Deep dish pizza requires prebaking the kneaded dough, pulling it out of the oven, place toppings customers requested and then placing back into the oven for additional baking time. While we waited for the pizzas to finish baking we were treated to complimentary fountain drinks and salad. Got to meet new people and chatted until the finish products comes out to the table.  I loved my personal deep dish that I've made, its filled with the toppings I preferred and I control the amount of cheese that goes it. My first deep dish pizza was a total foodie dream. Thanks again to Sheila and Uno's for hosting this early cooking class.",13,8,12
5,Mike E.,"Glen Cove, NY",0,8,0,5.0,10/14/2018,"It's exciting to see some real pizza made in New York. I believe if more New Yorkers took the time to eat a stuffed pizza based out of Chicago, they in turn may change their views. It sure beats the hot dripping greasy slice you need to napkin off the thin NY pizza. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed",,,
6,Patricia B.,"Staten Island, NY",305,26,13,5.0,4/22/2018,My chicken pasta and salad was awesome!!! And the special two dishes for 12.99 was worth the money..I had the chicken scampi and the arugula salad with fruit and goat cheese.The Manager was cordial and friendly and the server was very nice. A great meal!!,,,
7,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,95,179,5.0,12/12/2017,"This place was good, me and some co-workers went here after work, we stopped in, we have no complaints. The flavor was there, the atmosphere was good, calm, chilled out. We got the appetizer sample plate, it comes with chicken quesadilla, 3 mini meatball lollipops and bbq wings. And we also got the spaghetti with crab, shrimp and Tomatoes, amazing!  We added a small deep dish pizza, can't remember what it was stuff with but it was great!",2,2,2
8,R M.,"Boulder, CO",0,6,0,1.0,8/28/2018,"I don't know what I ate, but it's not pizza, and it's awful.  There's a bread crust, which is not pizza dough, and it tastes terrible and the texture is even terrible. We ordered two different ""pizzas"".  One has sausage and other things, the other has vegetables.  So, the pizzas arrive, and neither one has sauce on it!  What am I eating, I'm thinking.  This is some stuff thrown into a white bread crust and it's horrible and it's not pizza!  My wife was disappointed and asked, ""Is this what you thought it would be?""  We will never go near this ""theatre of terror"" again.",1,,
9,Jaime P.,"Palm Desert, CA",29,84,113,5.0,8/20/2018,"Se found this place by accident, and let me tell you, we try the Deep Dish, hot wings (half and half) and the triple chocolate cake for dessert. Was awesome experience... we have 2 slices let over and next day still good for next day.",,,
10,Madison B.,"Olympia, WA",2,52,57,4.0,4/3/2018,"Great service- everyone we encountered was friendly. Food was fantastic but not outstanding. By this I mean the food was delicious, but not what I would consider to be a destination place. This is a good place to go for a family as there are many choices. Not to mention the location is nice. I was surprised to see such low ratings for this place. To each their own I guess, but I would recommend giving this a try.",2,,
11,Joon R.,"Wayne, NJ",288,14,23,5.0,8/8/2017,"Even though I'm a big New York style pizza guy, I stopped by for a brew and ended up having a delightful experience. I have been to other UNO restaurants and as usual-- the food was great!What made this restaurant stand out was their phenomenal service and friendly staff. It was my first time in this restaurant but their staff is what separated them from the franchise. Very well trained and organized! If you're feeling deep dish, check this spot out!",2,,1
12,Mykaela R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,3/11/2018,Awful service - long wait time. Rude waiters. Waited 15 minutes for a waiter. 40 for food. Food was ok. DO NOT COME HERE! It's a tourist trap for people coming out of the museum!,1,,
13,Gahee L.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/9/2018,"I never gonna order food again. The food was gross. I ordered Wings and things chicken but I found three hairs in the chicken. Someone who has black hair and works in the kitchen, you better care for sanitation.",1,,

15,Sinful S.,"Bronx, NY",101,6,4,1.0,8/25/2017,"So.... I don't know where to begin. I've been eating at Uno's for a while now, the food used to be great now it's barely even tolerable.My 4 year old agrees, he's the only reason I continued to eat here after experiencing the less than stellar food. He actually refuses to eat pizza from here anymore but still lives the set up. The last time he ate pizza from here he said it was terrible. I thought he was having the usual 4 year old fuss... but I tasted it and it had the same taste of a hot lunchables pizza. Today we went to this location (we usually bounce back and fourth between the east side location and the west side location) and to our horrific surprise, the chicken nuggets he ordered were burnt and crumbling, he complained bout his teeth hurting trying to bite them.My sandwich had hardly any chicken and the breading was falling off and there wasn't any sauce. The chicken tasted like leftover popcorn chicken from KFC.These folks need to get it together, just because the there are good deals here doesn't mean the food should taste cheap and microwaved. Guest services sucks too.",1,,
16,Marcellermo N.,"New York, NY",18,19,32,1.0,7/7/2017,"I took there family visiting the States for first time.They were looking forward to trying different pizza styles.Service wasn't attentive, and I believe because we were speaking in Spanish and server assumed we were tourists.Pizzas were really tasty, however the beer i got wasn't the one I ordered but I drank it, no big deal with that one.Then the bill came with the 20% TIP WRITTEN BY HAND along with the total WRITTEN BY HAND. To charge 20 percent tip (which is ILLEGAL) you need to provide with 100% good service, otherwise you won't get a penny.I worked over two decades in the industry and few years in restaurant with high tourist traffic and I know the sketchy moves and the excuses.Unfortunately won't be back nor ever recommend this place again due to the lack of respect for service.",3,,
17,Alfred N.,"Queens, NY",2707,219,1833,3.0,11/26/2016,Came here after the Thanks Giving Balloon preview because I needed to use the restroom.  We decided to stay and grab dinner.  The place was jammed packed and we waited 25 minutes which wasn't bad but then again we were a smaller group.  The restaurant is tight but the service was attentive and we didn't have much complications.  The food was exactly what I expected.  My burger was tasty and was mildly impressed with the shrimp scampi.  I will be back whenever I'm on the Upper West.,3,3,5
18,Ruth U.,"New York, NY",33,175,227,2.0,3/11/2018,"Ordered food on their website for pickup. A farmers pizza individual size pizza and a Chicago classic pizza (both 7""). Arrived at ""restaurant"" @1pm on Saturday and the hostess stand was packed with people by the door waiting for tables although the restaurant had so many open tables. Hostess (a lanky short haired blonde Caucasian female) was rude and didnt even say hello. Picked up my order and arrived home to see that they'd forgotten the sauces and dips on the side that I'd ordered. The pizzas were so dry and extremely small portions. This was my first time trying deep dish and my last (at least from this place.) Honestly, I blame myself. Out of ALL the pizza locations in NYC, I decided to try a shitty chain. Now granted, I've never eaten at Uno's and also wanted to see what it tasted like so now I know. NEVER AGAIN. You've been warned. Pics below. Situated iron by pizza to show size. Pizza looks about three times bigger in photos than it actually is.",,,
19,Denisse G.,"Manhattan, NY",81,68,39,2.0,7/30/2017,"The reviews here for this restaurant are practically on point. I knew exactly what to expect and I still had hope but shame on me. I'm giving it a two for experience and customer service.The hostess are nice but don't pay attention. They sat us and down and we waited over 10 minutes before I had to gesture, ""what's going on?"" That's when the bartender/waitress came in and asked if everything was ok. She took our order but her personality is so stale.The food is good for your typical chain restaurant. We did the appetizer sampler. Avoid the mozzarella sticks, they're so soggy. Everything else is good.This place is only worth it if you go for happy hour specials otherwise I'm sure you can find better.",,,
20,Jia D.,"Flushing, NY",0,4,0,4.0,7/2/2018,"Don't understand why people give them such a low score. The food there is not bad and the service is acceptable although the waiter might think we will forgot to tip them just because we use the cash to pay for our lunch. But it is understandable since a lot of international tourists do not have the habbit to pay tips. Me and my daugther run there to grab a lunch because we don't want to eat at museum's cafe. It takes us only 5mintune to get there, ordered  deep dish pizza and lobster sandwich. Both of them are pretty good. And we would like a try make your own pizza the next time. Very kids friendly. Strongly recommend to all parents.",,,
21,Victoria T.,"Willingboro, NJ",122,84,58,2.0,4/28/2017,"Ugh. That's about all I can say for this place. If they didn't have the Grade A inspection sign on the window, you wouldn't have been able to tell they didn't fail. The restaurant is so dirty, the floors were sticky and looked like they haven't been mopped in weeks. My friend and I were taken back to our table by the hostess and were very soon after greeted by our waitress who was nice as first but developed an attitude as the meal went on. After placing a drink order, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and was completely grossed out by what I saw. The toilet had not been cleaned to say the least and the bathroom was littered in paper. Our food took a while to arrive which was a little weird seeing as though no one was in the restaurant. And the drinks had a weird taste to them. When my friend asked to switch the lemonade out because of its bad taste, our waitress replied ""Jesus!"". I really have no reason to go back to this place, but if I had the choice, I definitely wouldn't go back again.",1,,
22,Chris L.,"Durham, NC",0,1,0,1.0,6/12/2018,"So disappointed.1. Waited 15 minutes before waiter showed up. It was 8:30pm on Tuesday and the restaurant wasn't even half full2. Waiter gave us ""clean"" plates with mashed potato on them3. Pizza was warm (or cool?), like it had been taken out from oven for half an hour before served. Had to ask for reheat.",,,
23,Stephanie G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,5,3.0,6/22/2018,They have great pizza and very kid friendly but I was very disappointed with the server. He brought out my Cesar salad and when I looked at it the lettuce was brown and wilted. When I showed it to him and asked for another one he treated the situation like nothing was wrong and not understanding why I was complaining so I just told him to take it off my bill. Now please tell me the picture of salad didn't look like there was a problem.....,,,
24,Peipei Y.,"New York, NY",353,163,974,4.0,6/12/2016,"My first time Chicago deep dish pizza. Hooo yay!We got there after natural museum of American history. Between lunch n dinner time, so not many people there, pretty chill. Our waitress is sweet n friendly. I was playing the order pad while waiting for order, pressed game app by accident, she canceled the charge without asking anything. Very kind of her. I had the bourbon peach smash. It's really strong. My bf got mango brew Rita, highly recommended!!! It's so fresh, definitely perfect for summer! We had the wedge salad, taste plain. Try to skip that. The deep dish pizza, I ordered the classic Chicago since it's my first time, good and safe to go with the classic one, right ? ;)The pizza is really really satisfying!!! Absolutely the Sunday guilty meal. Haha but really worth it!",1,,
25,Shiomara G.,"Dumont, NJ",1,11,13,5.0,2/11/2017,"They have a ""Deep Dish Pizza Cooking Class"" which I would definitely recommend for a date. So much fun! Learn to make fresh dough from scratch. Learn how to prep and bake a deep dish pizza with fresh ingredients. The instructors were so nice !Complimentary non-alcoholic drinks and salad included. The cheeeese so good! The dough was so fresh and amazing! Awesome class!! Such a great experience. Classes are from 8:45am - 10:45am before the restaurant opens.",1,1,1
26,Anand J.,"Manhattan, NY",49,2,0,1.0,5/19/2018,"Had a terrible experience here, I use to go here all time when I worked in the area. Stop by today for ole time sakes. Most of staff was unfriendly including managers. Which I'm still  shocked at this.  Then had to ask the host about a  table after standing there  waiting to acknowledge. Still in disbelief. Sad to say I won't ever go back there.",,,
27,Nell W.,"Newark, NJ",0,218,3,3.0,4/6/2018,"I haven't been to Unos in over ten years but my friend wanted to have a ""throwback"" moment so I trekked uptown to this location on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated immediately and someone came promptly to take our order.  I ordered the numero uno which was decent. Not memorable but this is Unos. My friend had the farmers market pizza and said that it didn't have enough sauce for her. She enjoyed her rum drink and I had two vodka tonics which is damn near impossible to mess up so it was fine. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I went into the  single stall bathroom (not sure if there are others) and it smelled kind of pissy for lack of a better word. I definitely didn't like that.Bye Bye Unos! It was nice seeing you again but I can wait another ten years to meet again!",,,

30,Raymond T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,4,1.0,5/1/2018,Their website says that they are open from 11am until midnight. We went there at 4pm for an early dinner and they were closed! Not much in the neighborhood. We wound up in Ray's Pizza. Big disappointment!,,,
31,Sylvia W.,"Plano, TX",0,9,20,5.0,6/10/2017,We joined Uno's for a cooking class today. Sheila and Jessica did an amazing job showing us the ropes on how to make a deep dish pizza. We got caught in traffic on the way and ended being a little late. They were gracious enough to hold our spots and get us caught up with the rest of the class once we arrived. This was a great family event. And to end the class with our own delicious creation was just amazing. We also get a copy of the recipe and a goody bag.,2,,
32,Constance W.,"Annandale, Australia",21,38,67,3.0,6/4/2017,"The meatballs are alright, with BBQ sauce. Then the prawn pasta is salty but on the good side. Mac and cheese deep dish is ok, a bit salty too. They don't have to go cups for drinks--hmm...",1,1,1
33,Alberto G.,"New York, NY",2,3,5,4.0,3/11/2018,"Pizza is good. A little too cheesy for my speed. Order was delivered promptly. I didn't order enough food. Other than that, all good.",,,
34,John F.,"New York, NY",0,29,0,3.0,10/1/2017,"Good deal, you always get a table. Always double check your bill though. They have these iPads on the table that let you pay games - then 1.99 will be added to you bill. Also, they play dumb with Groupon and subtract only what you paid for the groupon from your bill, instead o you actual discount. Lame!!!!",,,
35,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,4.0,11/3/2016,"Came here for the Groupon ""Pizza Making Class"". You walk in, have dough pre-prepared, and an instructor walks you through kneading it, forming it to the pan, then they bake the crust, you top it with toppings, re-bake it, then you get to eat it. This all happens at around 9 - 11am. The class size was 6 people, one instructor, and was really casual. Unfortunately, the group made pizza dough for practice together but we didn't actually get to make our own dough in the kitchen and bake it. The entire class took place in the restaurant not in the kitchen. If you're looking for a class where you get to actually create dough and pizza realistically in a kitchen, this isn't the class. This is more of a ""Pizza-Preparing"" class. Overall, the pizza was great and it was an interesting morning, however if you had visions of rolling dough in a kitchen with four and fun kitchen things around you, this is not that.",1,,1
36,Christal G.,"Whittier, CA",0,14,2,4.0,6/24/2018,"The 4 stars is for our waitress and the food! She was fantastic! She had a smile, was energetic, let us take our time to order, brought our food and beverages out quickly and was all around the only reason we stayed. However, the 2 people up front today were not very friendly. My family and I had just walked around Central Park, we were hot, tired and in need of a cold drink and food. We walked in asking to sit at a table in the bar area, which wasn't full at all.  The female in front stared at me, looked over at the table, realized she would have to clear and clean it before we sat down. She turned to the other greeter, whispered something, he whispered back and then she proceeded to tell me that she didn't want to ""overwhelm the server."" Neither of these greeters smiled it didn't make us feel welcome. In fact, I was trying to finish watching the Mets/Dodger game on the TV and the male greeter just kept staring at me. It was weird and uncomfortable. My family and I are from out of town, so far this has been the worst welcoming ever. And finally, no more than 8 min after we had sat down, the female greeter had already put another family at the table we requested.",,,
37,Debbie F.,"New York, NY",0,17,0,1.0,1/28/2018,"I don't review often and when I do, it's usually with a thumbs up for a great new business.  The cooking class offered (I went with a pal using Groupon) was laughable.  We were given prepared dough to form to pre-bake before adding toppings.  The toppings couldn't have been more mundane.  This felt like going to a low-end make your own pizza bar, not any kind of cooking class.  The instructor didn't seem prepared.  The low point was when 30 different students all had to knead the same ball of dough.  Really? Not even a dough ball per table.  Oh, and don't get me going on the plastic plates our salads were served in.  More appropriate to a child's picnic than a restaurant.  Sorry, thumbs down.  WAY down.",,,
38,Niloy M.,"Queens, NY",84,28,40,5.0,6/15/2017,I usually go to the Uno in Queens near Steinway street. I was around 86th & Columbus saw this uno. The inside of this place is mind blowing. Well I loved it. It got this old fashioned look which I am into. I had meatballs & uno burger which was amazing. I went there during and I was super hungry. Surprisingly it wasn't crowded at all. Overall I had an amazing time over there I wonder why this place got so low rating.,,,
39,Keli P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,6,1.0,10/8/2017,I've been coming to uno's for a while and I came to this location for the first time I was never informed that they don't fry their food here by the server till I ordered the appetizer and the mozzarella sticks were soggy and undercooked and I asked for the wings to be plain and they came with a buffalo taste to them and they said it was the seasoning. The server was rude she didn't even give us her name a blonde chubby girl about it and didn't even let me talk and was like Im gonna go get my manager definitely won't be coming here again stay away!,1,,
40,Deborah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,0,2.0,9/28/2017,"This is about their delivery charges: when you order online, they charge a $2.99 delivery fee, AND THEN add a line for a tip of $5! We ordered two pizzas, total cost of which was $26. So the delivery charge was $8, on a $26 bill.Either have a delivery charge (which is to pay the delivery person), or have free delivery and people can tip. Charging $8 on a $26 delivery is outrageous. We not only won't order delivery again, but I now wouldn't go there either. I don;t like being ripped off.",1,,

I would say it has the same ambience as TGIFridays, Applebees, etc. Very chill and laid back.We got their happy hour margaritas. It was ok. It was more on the weak side and very sweet. We got their nachos. It was great. The chips were really good by itself. It had flavor and didn't break easily. It was nice and crunchy. The toppings were great. I just wish there was more meat. Overall it was good and cheesy. More meat though!The service was good. Our server was quick and came around a few times to check on us.",,1,

45,Amanda H.,"JAMAICA, NY",115,39,105,2.0,8/16/2016,"I honestly just stopped in to Uno's because I was really thirsty and needed a break from the long walk I had just taken in 90+ weather. Once I downed a glass of water I glanced over at a yummy looking drink which so happened to be called the Prickly Pear Margarita. It was a pinkish purple color and frozen so I was kinda sold. Luckily I stumbled in during happy hour and with a nice bartender because he was able to make that typically $10 drink in a slightly smaller glass for $6. Not bad if you ask me!! I watched him pour a good amount of the good stuff into my drink and it was quite yummy from beginning to end. Now I had no intents of eating here but I don't think I ever would for a few reasons. I went to the bathroom and was a bit grossed out. I believe that a restaurant should have a clean bathroom because it depicts how well you clean everything else in the establishment. This was a turn off for me. Then as I came up the stairs, part of the kitchen space was directly next to me and if I wanted to I could touch the carrot sticks, celery sticks and lemon wedges. I am not sure if they were about to move it but it was there at that moment with no employee around me and who knows what I could have done to them. Another turn off. Then the staff. Like I said, the bartender was great and the other employees seemed great as well; however......when a business is operating I don't believe that the staff should use that time to reminisce about things going on in their lives or complain about the rough days there having loud enough for customers to hear during ""happy hour"". There is a time and place for everything, but right by the front door to the left of the bar is not the place. If I am in the area I can not say I would not return for a drink or two or three because I did enjoy mine, but I do hope that when or if I do return these areas of concern are addressed.",,,

We were a group of 7 including a baby and I'm very satisfied with everything. We got a table right away, he gave us time to order & brought food & drinks to the table quickly and checked up a few times to make sure we were well taken care of. Usually restaurants sing happy birthday in groups but this brave man appeared alone with my favorite chocolate cake and sang happy birthday for me. THANK YOU CHARLES!!!

I nade sure and clarified to make sure there was no chicken stock and he again said it was vegetarian.  I decided to look up the ingredients on line and found out it has Chicken Base .  On another note the guarantee their lunch special to be served in 10 minutes and it took more than 20 minutes in reality.,,,

The Chicago deep dish pizza was really bad.. then again, I've never been to Chicago so it might just be that Chicago pizza sucks... I also wasn't impressed by their pastas or their alcoholic beverages which are very watered down.

Kind of annoying that salads were half off if ordered from the regular menu with an entree, but not when you ordered from the gluten free menu - but the salads were the exact same (except his had croutons). Not sure why that was the case. My pizza was good though I would suggest requesting it to be well done if you like it crispy. It was a little soft. Still tasty though. My fiancé absolutely loved his dish and wouldn't have changed a thing! All in all a pretty good visit, just a little more expensive than I would expect a bar and grill type place to be.",3,1,1

We were seated fairly quickly as there wasn't a wait time. sat in our booth and were greeted by our waiter. Everything going fine but then everything went downhill from there. The food took nearly a half hour to come out. All my wife and I ordered was hamburgers and fries. The waiter then offers us to order an appetizer (guac and chips) since the kitchen was backed up...so we did. Now when the burgers came, my wife got the wrong burger plus it wasn't cooked properly. The kicker at the end...we got charged for the appetizer plus the sweet potato fries she didn't get. But the unsweetened mango tea tasted good. Be safe out there beloveds.",,,
64,Kori A.,"Deer Park, NY",9,160,15,1.0,3/15/2016,"I was never really a fan of unos. I used to go to the one in Valley Stream a bunch as a kid & recently I went to the one in Astoria, but this one was by for the worst. I get Manhattan is a very busy place, I do, so I understand how hectic working at a restaurant can be int his area. However, this unos was not as jam packed as most restaurants so I don't see why my waitress never bothered to check in on us once our mundane food was brought out. I came with my sister and we were seated at the most awkward place, right next to a order station thing so there was always someones ass behind me. We moved with no issue, but then our bland food came. I got a regular single deep dish that tasted like the ones served in school & my sister got a burger that was clearly pink inside when she asked for well done. That alone came up to around $35 dollars because she had one alcoholic drink & I drank water. I wish I could talk about my waitress but I only saw her 4x. When she got us our drinks, when she moved us / took our order, when she brought us our food & when she dropped off the check. Nothing in between, no would you like some more water or how is everything, nothing. Thank god we paid in cash. I wonder how long it would have taken if I would have paid via debit / credit. I will never step foot in this establishment again.",2,,
65,Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",896,694,903,2.0,12/27/2014,"A 2.5-star rating that I just cannot bring myself to round up to 3. You're in NYC, people; home to the very best pizza in the world. Why anyone would waste a meal eating at Pizzeria Uno is beyond me. And yet, that is exactly what I was forced into doing today. A trip to meet my in-laws in the City with the kids to go to the Museum of Natural History ended up including a lunch at Uno. It was not up to me, and I have learned in these types of family situations that it's best for me to keep my mouth shut and just roll with the plan. Well, today, the plan was to all meet at Uno and have lunch. And so we did.I have never eaten Chicago-style deep dish pizza anywhere except for Uno, and up until today it had been at least 5 years since I was last dragged into one. Frankly, to even call this pizza is a joke. This isn't pizza. This is some kind of Italian-style cake or pie. And I suppose with the right ingredients and the right oven, you can probably concoct something worth eating. But Uno is your classic chain restaurant, mass marketing low-grade ingredients cooked up via an assembly line, and served up by ornery waitresses who'd rather doing something - anything - else.My wife and I gave it our best shot. Knowing that we'd be eating such calorie-laden junk today, we had a very light breakfast and arrived starving. We ordered a Harvest Garden deep dish pie on 9-grain crust. It's essentially a bunch of roasted veggies, eggplant, caramelized onions, tomatoes and cheese all stuffed into a thick, pie-like crust. Good thing we like our pizza well-done because ours came out close to fossilized. All things told though, under the circumstances, the pie was fine. Nothing special. But nothing particularly egregious. It provided some well-needed sustenance on a day when we'd need it.Would I ever go back voluntarily? HELL NO!",5,5,2
66,ChefLee H.,"New York, NY",20,13,3,1.0,1/31/2016,"Service??? What service. I'm still sitting here waiting for my order after the waitress brought out my wrong order top of which 4 other tables have already eaten and left. Our server is pathetic with an artificial up beat attitude. Don't bother with with the on table tablet to call for a server.  Every worker here doesn't even look or pay attention to it. 14.56 minutes until I got up and asked a server to take our order. as I'm writing this review waiting for my order and my daughters order  two other tables received their orders. One table which we came before them and with the same server has now paid and left. This place sucks !!!!!End result. 2,75hrs later bribed with drinks that showed on our bill which was contested. 40% off entire bill. Financially satisfied with bill but will never recoup from time lost. My evening schedule was completely rescheduled. Tip from a chef to the restaurant. Have your staff communicate more between them selves. I saw the runner, the over worked busier, and to the 2 other waitresses that noticed the blinking red server light at our table to tell their manager or the server that a client is asking for attention. I saw all of you look at the light. FYI after 30 minutes of blinking the tablet automatically shut the light off. After management learned of our issue they did manage to accommodate our concerns and even introduced us to their captain server who tried to rectify the situation to his upmost abilities. Final remark,,,,  role the dice. The gods may be in your favor. ""For want of a nail the horseshoe was lost. Or want of a horseshoe the steed was lost. For want of a steed the message was not delivered. For want of message, the war was lost""A restaurant is only as good as their team. Their is no I in team nor is their an I in restaurant.

67,Andrea Q.,"Clifton, NJ",159,89,258,4.0,2/20/2017,"We came here for the pizza making class with Shiela as our teacher. We arrived around 20 minutes early and were happy that they let us in because we needed to use the bathroom he he. I thought that the class was worth it because you get unlimited beverages (water, soda, hot chocolate - not alcoholic), the recipe, make a delicious deep dish pizza and get to eat it, an uno's drinking glass, pen and salad for the 2 hours that you are there. For some reason, that salad and Caesar dressing were so good, especially the croutons! We felt like we learned things about making pizza, because I have tried it before at home but it never cooked all the way so after learning some new tips, we can't wait to try to make the entire deep dish pizza from scratch at home. A tip if you are going to go to the class it to make sure you don't add too much sauce or else your pizza will get soggy. Shiela was very friendly and answered all of our questions. Lucky that central park is right next to this location because eating a deep dish pizza feels so heavy in your body! I was happy to walk around and digest after a fun class.",,,

We decided to hit up Pizzeria Uno for something to eat.I'm giving it 2 stars for the food,  no stars for their bizarre beer pricing and 5 stars for our server Leah. The food was meh, okay for the mall but not so much for the city,  the beer pricing was ridiculous - the menu listed 20 oz. draft beer for $7. I really didn't want that much so Leah suggested a 14 oz. pour.  That was exactly what I wanted but for $6.50 (I could have gotten almost another half for .50) it was pretty silly. Leah, on the other hand, was wasted on this establishment. Dealt with my procrastinating sister, my niece who doesn't eat anything and my autistic daughter who only eats things she's familiar with. She was a champ and I'd go back if I knew she would be the one to wait on us.",,,1

71,Daniel I.,"London, United Kingdom",0,5,0,1.0,8/31/2017,"We specifically chose this place after a trip to the museum with our 2 yr old and 4 month old because it looked like the kind of place that would welcome families with young, loud kids. The waitress who seated us initially seemed a bit thrown by the site of our offspring, but our table waiter was nice to begin with. It quickly became apparent that he too would rather we had just left our kids in a box outside, and when they inevitably started crying his colleague became incredibly rude and made us so uncomfortable we decided to finish up and leave. Don't get me wrong - I get it, loud babies are annoying. But you know who they're most annoying for? The parents who are laying out $100 to and feel mortified that everyone in there hates their guts. The truth is that parents gotta eat out too sometimes and frankly it's not like we took em to Nobu on a Saturday night. This place should recognise that one of the things genuine Italian places are known for is being family friendly, and if they're going to treat families like that they should just go the whole hog and put a sign up in the window.Oh also the food sucks.

I live in NYC, and I have several places available to me.  However, I have always managed to have a good experience here, and usually have not had a problem with common courtesy before.  From the general manager to the host(s) all the way down to the bartender (props to Micki, if she is still working there...she was by far the best), rude and inconsiderate, blaming the customer for their woes.I am a stickler for customer service. Do yourself a favor...walk the extra block to Amsterdam for better and more unique restaurants.  You'll thank me later.",2,1,

74,Haneul S.,"Flushing, NY",124,48,5,1.0,7/13/2015,"Dropped in after a visit to the Museum of Natural History, and pretty shocked by the terrible customer service. I've always been a fan of the Uno chain, and I will continue visiting Uno -- just not this particular branch. When my friends and I entered, we didn't even get a word's greeting. The hostess just glanced at us, didn't speak to us for about ten minutes, and then finally someone came to seat us. If that was the worst of it, I wouldn't have given it a second thought, since they were likely busy. But after we were seated -- note, they seated US -- while we were waiting for our food, one of the passing servers looked at me, SHOVED my chair in, and told me nastily not to get in the way. Excuse me? My chair was not even jutting out from the table, I was seated as close to the table as I could get without being uncomfortable. If my seat gets in the way, then don't seat me there.That's not even the end of it. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen after taking our order, and when I asked for a check, the passing server sighed and gave us this look as if we were personally offending her by asking to pay for our food.The food was quite good -- more so than usual even, which helped take some of the irritation away -- but it also took quite a long time to get out.Overall, a very very horrible experience. I wouldn't have tipped at all if I wasn't sure I'd be physically assaulted if I didn't do so.Avoid this place like the plague.",7,,

78,Christen W.,"Wildomar, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/2/2017,"I was a bit hesitant to try this place because of the reviews and I really should have listened to them. My husband and I ate here after visiting the Museum. We were greeted and seated right away. The service was below average at best. Our server could not take our order without getting distracted with another customer or employee. We had to order our food probably 3 different times as well because he would either 1)assume what we wanted, 2)walk away as we were ordering, or 3)not write anything down and forget. This wasn't even the worst part. As my husband and I finished eating, we went to pay using the kiosk on the table. After we swiped our card, it (the machine) requested we enter a tip amount/percentage. Our server comes over and immediately demands that we do not tip him on the machine or with a card in general because it will be heavily taxed. It an effort to cancel our transaction, our server charges our card, freaks out, and removes the battery from the kiosk in an attempt to void the transaction. It didn't. The general manager had to manually delete the transaction and rerun our card with the main POS system. As for the food...nothing special. The wedge salad was good, but average. My husband and I split the cheesy garlic bread appetizer and were disappointed by the lack of cheese. We felt we were just eating dough. Our deep dish pizza was also just okay. We ordered the Chicago Classic. The prices here were decent as we got everything for around $30, however, we won't be returning here.",,,

The one we picked included unlimited soft drinks, an appetizer, choice of entree, and choice of dessert. Super great value, and our server was fantastic - refilling drinks before we even quite finished, and kept the meal moving along, without hurrying us.  Feeling like I failed both her & all of the yelp community by not remembering her name, sorry!The only reason I can't give a full five stars is because the food is really just good/ok.",1,1,1

Our appetizer platter was a lot of stuff that was reheated rather than freshly fried and our deep dish was relatively flat and flavorless.We all went the pasta route this past time around and though that was an improvement for sure, our dishes overall were pretty bland and, again, overpriced.Not worth the money for a very sub par experience in an area with so many other great options.",3,,

Be careful though, it's $7.99 for Sam Adams Seasonal. Why? NOBODY KNOWS! It's not THAT good. They don't gouge you the pizza though! a 2-3 service deep dish for $19.99??? I'll take that any day!Our waiter really hated his job. And I understand... You move to NYC, try to make a living while attempting to persue your dreams as an actor/model/prostitute, and you end up working at UNO's to pay the rent. It sucks! But hey, at least you got a job!

90,Art K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,2.0,12/1/2016,"Was greeted and seated rather quickly which was nice. The hostess accommodated our request for a booth and cleaned it out immediately (plates from the last customer). After this, it went downhill from there. Our server never came. After approximately 10 minutes we had asked another server (who had been back and forth near our table several times) where our server was. This sever did not know, but he kindly and quickly took our order of the classic Chicago style pizza. This server was quite good with refilling our drinks and checked up on us regularly, even though he seemed extremely busy. The food was sub-par. Their interpretation of the Chicago style pizza was just that. Not very authentic (having sampled pizza from Chicago on several occasions), but what you would expect for the amount you are paying. Having checked the dough under the cheese, the pizza was well cooked through. The amount of toppings were scant. The tomato sauce seemed a bit diluted and tasteless, as evidenced by the pool of tomato juice at the bottom of the pan. Finally, the restaurant itself was really in a state of disarray. The manager just looked unhappy to be there, the bathrooms were disgusting with urine all over the floor under the urinals. It had seemed it wasn't cleaned all day. The general impression I got was that this was a place that had just given up. If I were asked to return, I'd consider it just to see if things had improved. I wouldn't really recommend it to any of my friends. There is a potential for this place to serve really good food. Overall I would rate the service 3/5, the food 2/5, and the restaurant itself a 1/5. Thanks for reading.",,,

92,Sam S.,"Watchung, NJ",0,11,1,1.0,3/5/2017,"I have eaten at my fair share of restaurants during my time in NYC, but the service at this restaurant was astoundingly horrific. Honestly, it was the worst I've seen and I've had a few other bad encounters. It started off poorly when we walked into a crowded situation at the front desk where the hostesses looked completely confused. It got worse with our waiter. When we had a few questions about the menu, he was rude and walked away before we even had the chance to ask a second question. Then, when our pizzas came out and one was supposed to have light sauce, he had no clue which one it was and just shrugged. He came over to fill my water during the meal and knocked the pitcher right into my hand. To add to it all, the pizza had a layer of oil just sitting on top and was not appetizing. Because of the terrible service, we tipped only 13% instead of our usual 20%. As we stood up to put our coats on, our waiter started hastily cleaning our table before we even had the chance to walk out and said loudly under his breath ""Thanks for the terrible tip.""  Needless to say, because of the atrocious service and very low quality food, I will never be going back or recommending this place to anyone I know.",,,1

A week later I followed up on my email, no response. Finally I called back again and was told that for private parties not only is it impossible to do an open bar or pitchers of beer or have a party longer than two hours but that the room was already booked for the date I was asking about. Of course when I first called the date was free. I am very frustrated to have been given the run around by the management. Plus, its New York, there is better pizza on every other corner.

I tried a slice of pizza and I have to give credit to the restaurant and chef that the pizza was OMG super delicious. We had wine and a glass of sangria .The dishes were well prepared and served on time to us to enjoy them..  The desserts were delicious. we had the mini sizes first because we did not feel like eating a lot and then because the regular size and giant are too big for our likings or nutrition habits, but they were super good. I would go just for that.   The waiter was very friendly, and the wait was not long at all!! Maybe because it was Wednesday. Anyways, I would try it again and definitely recommend it.!",,,1

We got a promotional gift card in the mail and its on my block so I thought I'd go for almost-free lunch. Not worth it. Spent 5 minutes by the host station being ignored. Was finally seated with no words exchanged.Later, the couple next to me asked if they could switch to a booth and the waiter pointed out one behind them. As they were sitting down another person came over yelling ""no no no you can't sit there! That's reserved for our COO - one of the most important people in the whole company!""

102,Mili M.,"Greenvale, NY",3,29,2,3.0,12/6/2015,"First things first: you might as well get a single shot instead of getting the full cocktail because it's really just one shot and you pay eight dollars for it. Or go with a beer. Although they have a large selection of cocktails, they were very weak and diluted for everyone in my party.However, the reason you should come here is the pizza. We got a few individual-sized deep dish pizzas, and they definitely hit the spot. I especially recommend the Farmer's Market pizza, which has a hint of pesto along with eggplant and peppers. The goat cheese salad with raspberry vinaigrette that comes for an additional $2.99 was also pretty good.Unfortunately, the desserts seem to go the same way as the drinks -- lots of options with mediocre quality. There are a number of ""mini"" portions for $2.99 that look good, but we got the mini Oreo brownie sundae, and this may the driest brownie I've ever had. In fact, I took one bite and had to stop because not even the ice cream could save it. I always say there's a small pocket in your stomach that's ready for dessert no matter how full you are. Let's just say it closed right up as soon as I took one bite of that horrid brownie made of Sahara Desert sand.I will say that I think that they have really taken to heart some of the previous comments on this website about the service -- they were noticeably attentive. I asked for a small addition to my drink and they gave me an entirely new one free of charge.",1,,

Updated review","Went here awhile back with about 5 people and we all completely hated the place.Our waitress left without telling us, leaving us waiting to get our orders taken for 30 minutes, before a new waiter came to tell us our waitress clocked out.After getting our food, our new waiter gave me the wrong pizza, and I didn't realize he actually gave me their ""large"" pizza, which was just about 6""-8"" in diameter. While I'm still eating the first slice, he walks up behind me, grabs the pizza dish from right under me and angrily says ""you said you ordered the bigger pizza!"" and then hands me the correct pizza -- which happened to just be a 4"" deep dish pizza that was literally the size of my hand. Had he told me of HIS mistake, I would have gladly paid for the larger pizza since it would have been a way better deal, but instead, our waiter decided to not only snatch food away from me that I've already started eating, but even blame me for his mistake. I wonder if these people even expect to be tipped",,,

We ordered mozzarella sticks as our appetizers and the breading was soggy; you could tell they were frozen. I ordered a black bean veggie burger for my main course and it was dry and tasteless.

The space is huge though they still have a short wait staff (we did wander in at 10:40pm).  The pizza was good and the menu had a good selection, nothing mind blowing.

It's just not cool that they lied, just tell us that you dont accept gift cards at this location.I refuse to come back to this location. Also the bread on their burger was a bit stale.

Good god.Luckily, I hadn't eaten breakfast, so I splurged and ordered and ate and enjoyed and was happy. Seriously. This pizza is DELICIOUS. But I couldn't eat anything the rest of the day.

139,Brandon S.,"New York, NY",27,14,0,4.0,8/20/2014,"Well worth a visit for the price.  This Uno's seems to forget that they are located in Manhattan.  They have incredible drink and dinner specials.  The food tastes great for what it is.  Understandably you aren't going to a top chef restaurant and it's not going to be ""designer cuisine""  but you get what you paid for, and a little bit more.The service does tend to be a little slow, but everyone that works here is exceptionally nice.  If you have a little extra time and aren't in a rush it's a wonderful place to stop by and grab a bit to eat and a beer.  The interior has a nice rustic Italian/Chicago feel about it and if you get sat in the back there's a quiet glassed in ""courtyard"" like area where you can dine indoors but feel as though you are outdoors.All in all i like Uno's even though you might wait a little too long for your food or can't find a server for a refill on your coke.Side note:  I think that the owners don't have enough staff working during the rush hours which might be why the servers tend to be a little slow.  Sometimes I feel that there is only one server working the entire floor with something around 12 to 15 tables.",1,,

The server was friendly and nice, but the service was poor and so was the food. My wife requested a guacamole hamburger; the hamburger was served without guacamole. The manager gave us two poor options, take a $1 dollar off the hamburger or we would have to wait 15-20mins for the guacamole to be made.  After walking throughout central park, we just wanted to eat and get out of Uno.  I should have read the Yelp reviews before eating  we ate Uno",,,

144,Toya M.,"New York, NY",66,20,5,2.0,12/31/2011,"This does NOT taste like the one in Chicago. I had just got back from Chicago and was craving some deep dish pizza. My first time trying Uno's was in Chicago the week prior.  I have always ate at Gino's East (Yummy) or Giordanos (Yuck). I ordered the individual from the Chicago location and it tasted like a heated frozen pizza.  The rest of the family ordered a custom pizza and it tasted delicious.  So I thought I would do the same at the NYC location.I was quickly seated when I arrived. I got to the Uno Chicago thinking I would order a small size instead of an individual.  But I thought the small would be too large for me and I don't eat leftovers so I opted for the individual.It didn't appear to be reheated frozen pizza, but it tasted like it.  The crust was hard and difficult to cut into.  The sauce tasted like a bottle of Ragu pizza sauce.  The Chicago Uno's sauce tasted great.  I was very disappointed in the pizza at the NYC location. I could have made the same pizza at home with a jar of Ragu.I would like to point out that they have a huge menu. Pizza isn't the only option. But as a Midwesterner who is not a fan of NYC pizza and love deep dish, that's all I wanted to order.  I looked around the room and most of the patrons were NOT eating pizza. That says a lot.The service was ok.  The waitress took all day to give me the bill.  I put my coat, hat and gloves on and practically stood up so she would know I was ready to go.  The only highlight of the night was the busboy making goo goo eyes at me. He flirted with me all night. (I guess I still got it.)",2,,

151,Ayami S.,"SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, NY",11,29,1,1.0,8/3/2014,"If I had a chance to redo this afternoon I would not eat here. The management was fairly rude (hostess and I'm assuming manager) when our waiter moved us to another table away from a hysterical child. Both came to our table asking us to get up after we were already placed there by our waiter, who apparently didn't have the 'authority' to move us, as if it was our fault we were seated there. They didn't offer us another table or said ""I'm sorry this table was reserved"" they both angrily just came to our table after we got silverware and told us we can't sit here because it was for another group. The manager then guilted us about not waiting to sit next to a screaming child saying this is a family restaurant after the other group was already seated. Hostess was pretty cold before anything happened and then gave us angry glares for a mistake that wasn't even our fault (we didn't pick the table!) and when I thanked the manager for accommodating us he ignored me and walked away. Mood was already set for us. Our waiters were nice but the food reminded me why I don't like chain restaurants. I haven't eaten at Uno in around 6 years so I was surprised to eat pizza that tasted like it was microwaved, no exaggeration. I've had frozen pizza that tasted just like this, I couldn't believe it. It was very cheap which was good so at least we didn't feel ripped off. Great for families with young children, not a good option for anyone else.",,,

153,Lucien D.,"New York, NY",3,179,2,2.0,6/9/2011,I am a fan of Uno's Corporation so I was rather disappointed with this restaurant. It's a hit or miss with service. We've been here a total of 5 times. Usually the service is great and the food it very good. Uno has a fairly inventive menu and good drinks. Our last experience was that the hostess wasn't around for 10 minutes at the door and when she did arrive she indicated we should eat at the bar instead (despite it being a slow night). All of which we were confused and left. I blame the management of the restaurant.,2,,1
154,Samuel C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,28,0,1.0,8/22/2014,"After walking around for hours at the museum, me and my friends were starving. Uno was the first place we saw, I suggested we look up some reviews, sadly my pleas fell on deaf ears. We were seated father fast, and the server was nice, although he forgot a pizza. Usually when I eat out I expect the food to taste better than mines, and I'm a mediocre cook.The food was bad, and way, WAY, to expensive. I had the Chicken Parm, and french onion soup. The chicken was flavorless and smothered in cheese and sauce. The noodles were fine, however the sauce was basically crushed tomatoes. You could go to any store and pick up the cheapest bottle of pasta sauce and it would taste way better. The french onion soup was probably the worst onion soup I ever tasted, in fact it's the worst soup I ever had, period. How they could mess up suck a simple dish is nothing short of amazing. The cheese was placed under the bread, so I had to battle with the soup to get any cheese. The croutons were flavorless and very soft, as if they were soaking for an hour. Now as for the soup, it had very little onion flavor, and lots of beef flavor, (if you don't know this soup is commonly prepared with beef broth or stock). Even the actual onions didn't have any onion flavor. The soup was very salty. If I had to guess they probably haphazardly reheated pre-made soup, evaporating water and concentrating the salt. I might as well have drunk a can of beef broth.I tried some pizza as well, which was just frozen and reheated.Also there's a halal cart near this place. I didn't eat there but anything would be better than this place.",,,

Nothing special, but no complaints. You get what you expect in a chain restaurant. Our food came out quickly, our drinks were refilled, & we were well-attended. Our food was hot & delicious.

Had a bite of one with broccoli and spinach.....it also had tomato sauce. I prefer  my veggies on a white pie..did not really like it with sauce. The service was not too attentive. One of our party asked for a knife, by the time she came back with it  they were just about done with their meal.....they cut the meat with a fork.

The choice for me at the time was either UNO's or Shake Shack, and I had enough Shake Shack for the month.So we sit down, my two friends and I. Staff seemed a little chatty, which wasn't unexpected considering it was rather empty. But when we did get our menu, it didn't take long for the waiter to come ask us for our choices. I guess that's not a problem for most, but we were BARELY in our seats. So we ask him to come back later. Then he comes back an eternity later. /facepalm.We end up ordering mozzarella sticks and created our own deep dish. The mozzarella sticks were good. I don't know how to quite compare degrees of quality of mozzarella sticks. But they tasted good for all I knew.The deep dish pizza came in the pan it was baked in and was awesome. I've never had chicago-style pizza before, so I'm hoping to go to Chicago sometime soon to really appreciate the style. It's really a different sort of meal compared to NY style. Anyways, it went down pretty easily, and was surprisingly filling.

That will make my night better! Yeah, don't ever put all your hopes and dreams into any Uno's you haven't been to before. Super bad idea, and I totally should have known better.This place lacks all the charm of it's east side equivalent (STILL my favorite Uno's in the city) - it looks nice from the outside, but it is very small and condensed once you get inside. The bar area is off to the right, which the more restaurant-y side of it is off to the left. When I entered, the restaurant wasn't too crowded but all the staff seemed busy. I'm sure there's a lot of to-go orders from that place, but it was still a good 10 minutes before anyone even TALKED to me. That? Was not cool. A polite, ""please wait one minute!"" was really all I was looking for.This very cute waiter man named Kevin was the one who noticed me, ended up seating me, and turned out to be my server. He was the only good part of this place. He asked if I wanted to sit at the bar. I said no, but in retrospect probably should have. The bar part of this location was actually kind of cute. The restaurant part? Not so much. It's like the corner of horror. Anyway, I ended up getting a salad, a beer, and muh Rattlesnake Pasta. These horrible people were screaming to my right in spanglish (they kept alternating languages). I found out that one of them worked a night shift at a hotel - more info that I really wanted to know. I asked Kevin to just package up my food- I had to get the hell out of there.It gets two stars because Kevin's presence made me give it an extra star. I gave him a nice tip, because he really tried to make this horrible place better. Probably would have been more okay had I not gone solo, but I can eat at east 86th st. one alone all the time.

The reason this review is two stars versus one, is due to the service. We had a very attentive waitstaff who, within minutes, seated us elsewhere once they noticed the noise. We tried the mozzarella sticks and their traditional deep dish, both of which were less than mediocre, with the mozzarella sticks not being heated all the way through. However, again, the waitstaff was great - deserving of their own star.",,,
181,Jordan L.,"San Diego, CA",10,49,4,3.0,6/8/2013,"If you're ordering pizza, go for the deep dish. Don't get the thin crust. The thin crust tasted a bit like frozen pizza. Not that good at all. You know Jim Gaffigan's lady audience voice? I'm imagining some of you saying ""oh that's not nice"". Just trying to give you a helpful tip! I'd like to point out that I hate to sound negative in online reviews. I don't want to appear to be one of those people that had a tiny bad experience and gives a place one star, or anything like that. It might make me look like one of those unhappy people that go online to let out all their rage and ridiculous emotion, but in reality I hope this place can improve a bit. It is a chain restaurant, so you might be best served going somewhere truly local and original. But if you get a Caesar salad and a deep dish pizza, you'll be golden. Just don't mess it up and go for the thin crust. One good thing about this place is that they actually have big booths, so it's not tight seating for tall people like me like in a lot of New York restaurants.",2,,
182,Bear S.,"New York, NY",6,45,33,1.0,9/7/2009,Drinks were week and poorly made and when they arrived so did annoying little fruit nats. We went especially for the deep dish. Unfortunately what we got was thin crust with high walls. On the plus side our server Art was very prompt and pleasant.,1,,
183,Rusia L.,"Flushing, NY",93,81,88,3.0,1/25/2012,"I arrived +1 and the front desk had many employees all doing other stuff. I.e.) on the phone .I asked a nearby waiter who was the host and she said she would help later. 2 groups of total 7 ppl walked in and 2 staff members finally put us on their ""list"". So far.. not good",,,
184,Emily A.,"South Portland, ME",46,232,7,2.0,9/20/2009,"I'm not a fan of chains but I allowed myself to be dragged here a couple of times by my friend who only eats at places that gives free refills. The food is okay, pretty salty, so the free refills do actually come in handy.However on my third or fourth visit after eating the chicken fingers I got violently ill. NOT fun. Also made me wonder how I could have possibly gotten food poisoning from chicken fingers that were frozen mere minutes before being served to me. I didn't wonder for long, as images of disgustingly dirty kitchens popped into my head.So that was that.",,,
185,Melanie F.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",0,6,0,1.0,5/3/2014,"Today Saturday May 3, 2014 we stopped in at this restaurant and it was not too busy people were eating and there were available tables. We were told it would take a minute or so to get the table ready and we were escorted to our table right passed the bar to the left. It appeared to be a very tight cramped spot under a stairwell. I asked if we could sit at a booth and they said they were reserved for parties of 7 or more so I said okay what about the table to the back or a table on the other side and he replied that they were also reserved. We said thank you and said we would go someplace else and he said okay. Really!?! I would NOT Recommend this place That's the service they give to customers. We had a wonderful brunch at Isabella's with superior service.",,,
186,Sher A.,"Mineola, NY",2,13,0,3.0,3/2/2014,"So, sat down at the bar and ordered food.  The bar tenders are so sweet! However, when ordering, the $6 pizza is SUPER small and don't order their mac&cheese.  It is a macaroni and cheese LET DOWN! Just stick with the pizza, and you'll leave satisfied.  Good luck tryna get a cab out here on the corner tho.",,,
187,Catalina A.,"New York, NY",9,46,0,2.0,12/5/2008,"I'm pregnant, in my first trimester, so the only thing I want or can eat is pizza, pasta and bread. Uno's was the perfect choice for lunch. The pizza did not disappoint, but everything else did. The waitress took 10 minutes to get to our table. Then, bad attitude and all, she took our orders and didn't come back for another 10 minutes with our simple drink order.None of the dirty tables around us were ever cleaned, until our food arrived. Then our absentee waitress decided to break out the smelly cleaner and scrub all around us. Cheese, tomato, crust, and cleaner. Yummy. Next time, I'll get take out. or delivery (A pregnant girl has to have her pizza!)",2,,1

189,Mark T.,Australia,0,52,0,3.0,5/20/2014,"My wife liked the look of this place because of the gluten free option. She had a pizza which was quite tasty apparently. I had a veggie pizza which was also quite okay. Wine by the glass was of reasonable quality and good quality. Our server (Errol) was relatively new, I suspect, but handled things just fine.",,,
190,Sera R.,"South Ozone Park, NY",73,113,21,2.0,7/30/2007,"We went to the American Museum of Natural History and after a few hours of walking around we were STARVING!  Not really familiar with the area the first thing we found was UNO.  I was disappointed.  Now I have been to UNO's before, in Forest Hills, and Bayside.  But we had to wait like 20 minutes for a seat, and the place was virtually empty!  Then on top of that they gave us seats that were soaking wet!  The ceiling was dripping and the seats were drenched!  We asked to be reseated so we got stuck sitting next to 3 noisy families with kids!  The food was good, but that could have been the hunger.  We ordered drinks, and they couldn't make a simple martini.  Not that they were out of the ingredients!  For a martini!  A staple drink of any bar!I was really disappointed in this place.",2,,1
191,Brenda S.,"Campbell, CA",21,55,94,5.0,6/22/2011,"Never Heard of this chain before, but ate here after the museum. I thought it was deeelicious! I had the chicken milanese dish, came with greens and kalamata olives and it was sooo good. It looked more like a salad, but it filled me up. sevice was great.  I would definately eat here again.",,,
192,Jazmine R.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,4/27/2013,"By far the WORST place I EVER had dinner. I took my son to the movies and thought humm Uno's nice friendly place to take him. WORST IDEA EVER!!! Very poor service, looks like management is all over the place. My waiter SUCKED, she never came to check on us, she has no excuse because it wasn't busy, another thing I asked her for napkins after I was sitting there for about an hour and when she came to me she had snot running down her nose. CLEARLY I lost my appetite and asked for my check and went home.",,1,

Updated review","Came for snack hour and enjoyed yummy small dishes for cheap and an alcoholic beverage. Ordered the cheese deep dish- ok, lacking some flavor. Buffalo quesadilla- yum. Gaucamole with chips- ok, also lacking some flavor. Ordered the shaker's choice drink- ended up with a regular margarita on the rocks. Enjoyed it. Would return for snack hour.",2,,2
194,Lucca S.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",4,2,0,4.0,3/18/2014,"Very good food! Ordered the salmon with lemon and loved it! Only thing is that it wasn't very fast for the food to come and I was very hungry! But other than that, excellent!",,,
195,Tempest B.,"Portland, OR",232,369,86,4.0,12/30/2006,"Uno's is one of the few chain restaurants I give my time to.  I love pizza, and NY style pizza is great, but sometimes I need my Chicago-style deep-dish fix.  Though this isn't as good as the stuff I can *actually* get in Chicago, it's pretty great.  They have other good offerings, too; including sliders.  But really, I'm only here for the Prima Pepperoni.This particular location is good.  There are certainly better restaurants in the area.  So, if you're not jonesing for Chicago pizza specifically, I'd skip it.  The neighborhood is pretty well-stocked, you just have to know where to look (Amsterdam...).  As a place to go when visiting the museum, it's way better than the food court there.  It's also an okay place to hit right before going to Shakespeare int he Park.",1,,1
196,Suzanne G.,"New York, NY",98,259,5,2.0,5/19/2008,"Ugh. Why did I go to this place?Oh right. I had been at the Museum of Natural History for so long and was keeling over in pain from starvation... Uno was the first thing we saw leaving the museum so we made a beeline for food. Any food!Their pizza is mediocre and the burgers looked wimpy. The worst thing in the world is a wimpy burger. The only part I loved was their gigantic cups of Diet Coke... although our waiter wasn't attentive enough on the refills. True, we did come at an off-time (4pm) but we had to physically go into a back room to find our waiter shooting the sh*t with other staff members to ask him for our check. I'd like to say I'd never go here again, but it IS the closest thing to the Museum and desperate times call for desperate measures. I wouldn't be surprised to find myself in the same predicament again! I just hope next time we don't have to go through all the back corridors to find our waiter!",1,,1
197,Richard K.,"Milpitas, CA",12,39,4,1.0,10/21/2006,"Just walked out of the Natural History and being tourist looking for some grub, this was the first place we encountered. Can't be that bad right? Wrong. The waitress had the driest, most sarcastic humor and couple that with all of us being a bit hung over from a late night of drinking put everyone in a weird mood. She was fishing for a smile and were weren't having it! We just prayed she wasn't going to spit in our food.  Food was terrible! Clam chowder soup. No clams...watery with lots of potatoes. Beef Stew was basically a tiny bit of stew poured on top of a mound of mash potatoes. Pot pie, top crust of the pie on top of a mound of mash potatoes. I'm beginning to notice a pattern here. Lots of potatoes.",1,1,
198,Andrew A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,5.0,1/18/2014,"Uno is franchise that wins my admiration.  Their deep dish style pizza is a good alternative to the NYC variety and their menu offers much that is tasty at reasonable prices (helpful calorie counts beside each dish on the menu).  Pasta in their Alfredo sauce, like what comes with the chicken cordon bleu, is particularly comforting.  Best, is the staff, from the general managers who make an effort to have you feel at home there to the attentive and friendly wait crew-  a star being the oft-cited Emily who is reason alone to come spend an evening there.",,,
199,Cora D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/4/2015,"The only positive review I can honestly give is for our server , she was great and gave great customer service. She deserves 4 stars...The reason I gave 1 star was the atmosphere and food .Yuck The food is awful. My friend name the dishes we sampled ""A recipe for disaster "" Notice i said sampled.That's all we could do.The food was too gross to complete; only a nut would risk eating here.The atmosphere felt just downright disgusting.I speak of the place feeling and appearing to be nasty.A perfect haven for germs and bacteria. This restaurant should be cleaned,disinfected and mopped.The only reason i ate there was because my friend was treating our party to lunch after our visit to the American Museum Of Natural History.Boy oh boy do we regret dining there.Should of had a slice of pizza, at the local  Ray's Pizza shop,  a few blocks up.Save your money and sprint pass this place.Don't do it.Uno's",,,
