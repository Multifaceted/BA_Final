0,Henrik C.,"San Diego, CA",153,492,5,5.0,10/20/2018,Great service and fantastic rooms. Stayed here for one night. Modern rooms with top quality furniture / decor. Great bathrooms and a well stocked room bar. Really appreciated the service.,,,
1,Charlene H.,"Cypress, TX",148,107,59,4.0,11/19/2018,"The service, rooms, decor, and overall ambience of the hotel are spectacular.  I stayed here for several days during a birthday trip in NYC. The hotel service was top-notch.  I had little surprises from my husband that the hotel accommodated. Waiting for me was chilled champagne,  chocolate covered strawberries and a beautiful birthday cake.  My husband told them what he would like and the hotel made it happen.  The toiletries are lovely.  In my room, the bathroom floors were heated and had a bathtub AND shower, which is so luxurious for such a small hotel in NYC. There was also a steam option in the shower. The lighting is perfect in the bathroom and dimmable.  I took one star away simply because of the mattress, which is absolutely crucial for me when staying at a hotel.  For the price of the rooms here, the mattresses should be better.  They do have a nice topper on them and the linens are a quality thread count, but those two factors still won't mask a poor quality mattress.  Side note - I did NOT complain to management about the mattress.  Perhaps they could have accommodated me with a replacement.  It IS a small hotel with not many rooms. But, with all of the high positives with this hotel, I didn't want to complain and make a huge deal, especially since I wasn't sure if a replacement was even possible.  Overall, I would absolutely stay again at The Lowell.  Every single person employed there was top-notch in their service.",,,
2,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,4.0,11/14/2017,"** afternoon tea review **I came here for a lovely afternoon tea in honor of a friend. There were about 15 or 18 of us to the left side of the team room, which was a little tight, but it definitely set us apart from the main crowd in the small room.The tea included bubbly rosé, a choice of three to four teas, and delectable snacks. The tea sandwiches were classic, though it did include a lobster roll, which was a nice touch but not necessary. As for the pastries, I was really trying to the fruitier bites such as the raspberry and passionfruit ones. The eclairs are also very fluffy and tasty.You definitely felt like you were frozen in another decade. The room is a bit ""done up"" - some might say a bit stuffy and old - but it added to the experience and character of the space.",4,1,4
3,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",13,102,7,5.0,12/11/2017,"This is a beautiful place, low key, mature, really lovely environment. Perfect for pre-dinner drinks or after a show. The house cocktails are delicious and the club room Food is very tasty. Highly recommended!",,,
4,MJ J.,"Harrington Park, NJ",1,16,13,3.0,5/18/2016,"I have fond memories of high tea with my girl friends during our twenties in NYC after shopping. We usually went to the Astor room at the st Regis but the reviews weren't so good so I decided to try the Pembroke room ( the reviews were good).  Back then, mid -late 90's it was unlimited sandwiches until you stopped the waiters and then u went onto the sweets.  It is no longer the case in any of the high tea rooms I believe.  I expected the pembroke room to be fabulous but the recent experience didn't match my nostalgic memories of high tea from many moons ago.  The room was small and intimate but a bit dated.  I liked that silver teapots were used and that the staff were very attentive and accommodating.  We arrived early and we were seated right away even though my gf was not there yet. The tea sandwiches were just ok but the fruit tarts/macaroons/Napoleons were fabulous!  The savory and sweet bites came on the same tray which was weird.  Last came the scones. The scones were not warm and a bit dry but clotted cream and marmalade makes everything nicer.  The clotted cream was more like hard whipped butter which was disappointing.  Also, no lemon slices were given for the tea, just cream.  The special tea was fabulous and my daughter loved the vanilla tea.  I brought my young tween daughter with me to start a mother daughter tradition but I probably will try another tea room (Podunk or the plaza) on our next trip.  Thankfully, my daughter loved the experience and we can't wait to do tea again!!!",,,
5,Cari S.,"Richmond, VA",0,5,0,5.0,3/7/2018,"This is one of the most exquisite places for tea. The service is impeccable, and the tea service is beautiful. The entire staff is friendly and professional.  Next visit to New York, I will definitely stay here.",,,
6,Marianne J.,"Mountainside, NJ",5,3,0,1.0,12/27/2016,"Low grades for high teaI would never recommend the penbrooke room for the High Tea at the Lowell Hotell The service was slow and troublesome. The waiter more than once had a hard time balancing the items on the tray and almost spilled water and champagne on my husband. The food was par at best. There was very little of it. I was comparing it to the high teas of London, where there were unlimited amounts of food and good food. This was no comparison. The scones were hard as bricks. The teapots were so hot you couldn't even hold the handles so you had to try and wrap your napkin around it. The servers were no where to be found if you wanted them to pour. The sandwiches were so small that I'm not sure they were bigger than my fingernail. I would not go back and I want to save you the trouble of going there. Should have gone to the Plaza!",,,
7,Nancy M.,"Glenview, IL",0,38,0,5.0,11/2/2017,"This is a review of the Lowell hotel itself; not the restaurants or the bar area (though I do think all of those were quite nice). My husband and I stayed three nights in late October. The staff is wonderful; the doorman, front desk, bell staff, concierge and housekeepers were extraordinarily nice and quite helpful. Every time we left and returned I felt we were coming home. Our suite was beautiful and well appointed, with an extremely comfortable bed, large bathroom with soaking tub, expansive shower, vanity area and television. The living room was large and comfortable and the kitchen was very nice. Everything was sparkling clean. It was our anniversary, so they brought up very nice 'treats' and flowers for us. The common ""sitting area"" just beyond the lobby is really quite fabulous - the perfect place to relax, visit with friends, enjoy a cocktail, or just read. The flowers are magnificent. I believe the whole hotel was recently redecorated, and it is absolutely beautiful. I love the location - close to shopping, Central Park and walkable to good restaurants and a number of museums. We will return to this hotel when we visit NYC in the future, and definitely recommend it.",2,,1
8,Lilee N.,"Boston, MA",82,346,675,4.0,4/13/2012,"You might miss this hotel if you were walking around in the area. It blends in with the homes and the surroundings very well. If you're like me and prefer to stay out of the limelight without skimping on the luxe, this is your place! The staff is nice, though they don't seem to go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home. Actually, they make you feel a little uncomfortable, which is unfortunate given the price per night. However, if you minimize interaction, your stay will be just fine. Minus the interaction with the staff, staying at The Lowell is great for a quick getaway/retreat. Room is elegant and beautiful. Bed is luxurious and the decor is clean, modern and chic. Fresh flowers and plants in the room really make the place homey and you don't feel like you are in NYC. Amenities like the workout facilities and dining services are very nice. We came and stayed here just for one night. If $ isn't an issue and you want a peaceful and elegant place to stay where you feel like royalty just doing your own thing, this is the place. Privacy is definitely respected here. Just don't expect the staff to be as attentive as they could be for the price you pay.",1,,1
9,Michiyo Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,0,1.0,3/22/2015,"No no no to this hotel!! I had a birthday gathering a week ago at the dining. It was a bit overpriced but good afternoon tea to celebrate my friend. Each of us got charge $66. It was supposed to a good experience even though I never like hanging out on upper east side. I am such a Brooklyner. Well a week later I checked my credit card statement, accidentally the hotel charged me the full amount $530 for a party of 8. I called the hotel immediately and asked the manager ""Megan"". What she told me was unbelievable. She told me to figure out myself with a rest of attendees. I was shocked. Even worse, she was supposed to call me to follow up, she NEVER did. I ended up my credit company deal with this issue!! But don't they have any hospitality or customer service??!! This is not acceptable with japanese standard. I highly recommend not go there, anyone!! Never!! There r so many good hotels out there in New York!!",11,1,2
10,Patricia W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,31,0,4.0,10/4/2016,We stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip.  IMPECCABLE is the only word that comes to mind.  The rooms have been renovated recently and they are cozy and regal all at the same time.  The hotel has a tendency to make the guest feel as if they are part of the neighborhood which is such a nice feeling for travelers.Will be back soon !!!,,,
11,Runyuan W.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",19,12,18,5.0,11/10/2014,"Very good hotel. I went to have the breakfast. Actually I heard that Lowell's afternoon tea is very nice, but I do not have time to go. It's a small door on Madison Ave, I enjoyed this prominent meal so much!",3,,1
12,Kasey R.,"New York, NY",5,39,35,5.0,8/17/2014,"My parents are from NC and aren't necessarily in love with NYC and the hustle of city life, but after staying at the Lowell, they are already planning their next trip to visit me!This is the place that knows you by name when you enter the door, and is happy to address all of your needs. They actually ended up accidentally double billing my parents when the Expedia reservation was entered into the system incorrectly, which they promptly fixed - whike also comping our afternoon tea at The Pembroke Room. The level of service is unbeatable. Also unique for a NYC hotel? No noise. It's a cute residential neighborhood far enough away to be out of the throngs, but close enough to everything to get around via public transportation.",2,,1
13,TinoX T.,"Boston, MA",47,484,125,4.0,4/7/2015,"Nice Place in the heart of Manhatten,Clean rooms and friendly staff.The Brunch is Awesome you Need to Try It",,,
14,Kelly S.,"Atlantic City, NJ",20,13,0,5.0,1/18/2016,"Was unexpectedly invited to afternoon tea in the Lowell's Pembroke Room ... It is comforting to know that this custom is alive and well, and I encourage everyone to experience it at least once.  My only critique is there is nearly TOO much food (between the fat scones and varied desserts, I got overwhelmed:)). The service is extremely attentive and no one made fun of the fact I looked a bit homeless on that particular day.",,,

Updated review","This is the loudest hotel ever.  Its 2am and they are bringing in deliveries!!!  What is wrong with this place?!! Constant 4 AM demolition trucks picking up garbage.  I can't even think in my own home. I just cannot recommend staying here, not that anyone would really care, it is so loud here.",,,
16,Emily H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,9/25/2016,"My family has been staying at the Lowell for the past 20 years. It is an absolutely superb luxury hotel with the best staff in New York. I have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and none of them truly live up to the Lowell's excellence. I just returned from our tenth visit to the hotel and everything was perfect as usual, they even welcomed my dog with a welcome basket! I got married at the hotel last year and look forward to returning for my anniversary. It is such a pleasure to see the staff every time we return! Everything is comfortable, elegant and luxurious in the suites, and if there is a problem or a concern they address it immediately. I love it here and visit often even though I live in NYC!",,,
17,Hanne J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,3,5.0,7/15/2015,"You will not find a better hotel in New York, the service is above excellent. Still not able to believe how great we have been treated from minute one. This is the place to come to in New York if you want to have an experience that warms your heart",,,
18,Alessia E.,"New York, NY",80,154,47,1.0,6/7/2014,"This hotel has no regard for it's neighbors. Demolition of it's Post House has been waking the whole block at 8am for weeks, as well as WEEKENDS. They are rude and don't have any respect for the upper east side. I suggest you don't stay there unless you want to listen to garbage truck honking, demolition dumping, and constant fumes & dust. Absolutely a let-down.",3,2,1
19,William J.,"South Park, Charlotte, NC",5,10,1,4.0,9/19/2014,"A timeless hidden secret in the heart of Manhatten.  The Lowell is an elegant small hotel with every appointment time has forgotten. The staff is sophisticated, discreet, and poised. A brilliant establishment!",1,,
20,Samantha B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,0,5.0,1/26/2015,"The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are all redone and maintained exquisitely. The housekeeping service is beyond wonderful and the staff is really exceptional. It is small - 64 rooms, intimate. They have a fantastic gym. They offer an excellent trainer to come in to work with you, for a fee.",2,1,1
21,Are M.,"New York, NY",155,229,24,5.0,10/9/2012,"My aunt threw me a fancy bridal shower in their Pembroke Room.  The room itself was lovely, just not a lot of natural light.  Besides that, the food was SO good and the service was top notch.  According to my aunt, she couldn't have been happier with the people there who helped her plan it.  It was a really great brunch.",3,1,
22,Rachel G.,"New York, NY",7,32,0,4.0,5/31/2015,"The afternoon tea at the Lowell is lovely. Had 10 girls there for a bridal shower and it worked out very well. They were very accommodating on the phone when I made the reservation. The servers were very helpful, especially Vernon who took great care of us. The tea sandwiches were delicious. The napoleons, pastries and macarons were to die for. The scones with clotted cream were fantastic. The quality of the tea and the ambiance topped it off. Truly a successful event!",,,
23,Jonathan D.,"Beverly, MA",23,480,16,4.0,8/7/2013,"The Lowell is a smaller hotel on the upper east side and a good spot if you want great service in a smaller environment.There isnt a spa here which is about the only downside.  The main restaurant is also under renovation so other than breakfast really you need to look elsewhere, which isnt hard in a city like NY.",,,
24,Nyah C.,"Stamford, CT",62,36,0,5.0,2/16/2011,"It's a beautiful hotel boutique hotel with great staff. The rooms are beautiful and cozy. If I had an apartment, it would be like this place. I stayed here often and my car is always waiting for me from valet. Never had any problems here and the rooms are just very comfortable.The Post House Restaurant is amazing. Location of the hotel is adequate for shopping, sightseeing, and from public transportation.",1,,
25,Paolo B.,"Seal Beach, CA",18,90,9,5.0,8/20/2008,"Thanks to my wife's workplace, we were able to stay at the very expensive ($1200 per night) Lowell for two nights in the Upper East Side.  Very lovely European elegance and charm, and unsurpassed customer service. Great, great location - between Park and Madison Avenues with excellent shopping nearby.   Fifth Avenue is only 5 blocks away, and Central Park is only 2 blocks east.  Our one bedroom suite was wonderful, spacious,  and comfortable. Two TVs (one flatscreen) and a king bed.  Also marbled bathroom with Bulgari bath products.  The suite also came with a kitchenette with china and minibar with the fridge stocked with nice goodies.  Free Fiji water at turndown and free welcome bowl of fresh fruit.Complimentary wireless Internet as well as two excellent restaurants on site.  Must give thanks to Pierre and the staff as they were very attentive to our needs (and also were very friendly to my 16 month old son).  Glad we were able to experience the ultra high end Lowell hotel.",1,,
26,Keith K.,"Sacramento, CA",8,44,1,5.0,7/19/2012,"This is a great little hotel on the upper east side.  The lobby is tiny so I was expecting a small room, but was surprised to have a quite large room with a sitting area/couch, one work area with room for a laptop, and a vanity.  The bathroom was large with a separate tub and shower.  Great bath products, large comfy bed - 2 flat screen TVs.It is expensive.I only had a short stay - one night with an early departure in the morning, but I will be back!",1,,
27,E. S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,14,0,5.0,10/3/2014,"I have had many wonderful stays in NYC, but The Lowell has put my expectations on a whole new level. The location is quaint and somewhat removed from the hustle and bustle, yet in walking (short) distance of 5th Ave., Central Park, etc. The staff was very kind and eager to help make our stay as wonderful as possible. Great room service and wonderful restaurant. Each room has a different design- sophisticated and transitional with an elegant approach. We actually landed on The Lowell after a dreadful night's stay at The London. So happy to have found this gem!",,,
28,Kate F.,"Houston, TX",2,477,17,5.0,7/9/2011,"The staff here did an over-the-top/wonderful/exquisite job handling what could of been a disaster ... best friend booked an afternoon tea for 5 on a sunday afternoon. when we arrive, they tell us an event booked the entire tea room for the day, but instead of showing us the door, they let us have tea in a $3000/night suite! a really great selection of tea (to go with adorable little sandwiches, petifores and the like) and the room was beautiful! Hope to take my mom when she's in town!",1,,
29,Cristine W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,55,777,5.0,5/13/2014,They have Tea & Lemonade & cookies in the gorgeous lobby that has beautiful guilded paintings and the Wall Street Journal to read--a place with these amenities has to be stellar !,,,
30,Howard B.,"Los Gatos, CA",20,293,0,2.0,10/15/2010,"Vastly over-rated!  Rooms are caves and the vaunted service often brain-dead...e.g. On one occasion the room was cleaned but the dirty table and dishes left from breakfast until we returned in the afternoon and called room service to clean up.  We stayed 5 days, sadly, and had several similar challenges.  The mini-bar was poorly stocked and serviced, the doormen challenged in getting cabs and the location convenient only to shopping on Madison Ave.  You can do much better on all fronts staying in the lower to mid-fifties.",1,,2
31,Kelly D.,"Long Grove, IL",10,78,0,5.0,8/24/2010,"I would give this place 4 stars but the service they gave us bumped it up to 5!We stayed in a reg. room, which was very nice but the AC wasn't working well so they moved us to a suite!! Sweet!!Very nice suite!  Next morning, we left for the airport only to have our flight cancelled. Stuck another night we went back to Lowell sure they would just give us a regular room this time but... they put us in the 2nd largest suite in the whole hotel!! At the regular price of course. They in no way had to do that. The only food I ate was breakfast, which was delicious both times and served in the most beautiful little room. The only reason I would have given 4 stars is because the hallways and elevators are so hot and stuffy that on a 90+ degree day, I felt like I needed a shower again just from riding down to the lobby.The location can't be beat and they have a great little French place across the street called Le Bilboquet. This restaurant is amazing itself- look it up.Hotel is highly recommended.",1,,2
32,Andrew S.,"Asheville, NC",0,4,0,5.0,1/1/2013,"Old world charm, new world elegance. Our room was spacious by New York standards. Very comfortable. Updated marble bathrooms. Nothing left to chance. Every detail attended to. The high tea was a great respite from the hustle, bustle of the Big Apple. Scones to die for with all the fixins. A wonderful boutique hotel with first class service. Pampered from the moment you enter the doors. I would live here if I could!",,,
33,Beach H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,0,2.0,2/9/2012,"This is a wonderful hotel with some great old timers working there, but sadly the front desk people and concierges have major attitude.  Stayed there for years until it got so bad I couldn't stand it anymore.  It's a shame because it's really pretty and discreet.  But the aggravation over petty things and the ungracious attitude is just not worth it.",,,
34,ayan g.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",1,39,2,5.0,8/28/2007,"The best service in what must be among the most discreet hotels in America, and perhaps even the Western world.  The feel of a wonderful European boutique hotel: Swiss precision and Iberian warmth.  Few could ever compare.  My perennial first choice among places to stay in Manhattan.",2,,2
