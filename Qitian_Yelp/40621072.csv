1,Eddie C.,"Gretna, LA",248,333,2369,3.0,6/29/2018,"While on a impromptu NYC visit after a grueling work trip, us bumpkins decided to walk around and drink beer at a few establishments.  On our way back to Grand Central Station, we came up on this bar.  Really cool looking mix of English, Irish and surfbort style tiki bar.   We mainly stopped to get some wings and I gotta tell ya, those did not disappoint!!  We got a few rounds of draught and bottles and hung out enjoying the hustle and bustle of the locals in thier suits and skirts wondering what it must be like to have to socialize in such a big city if you are alone. Shudder.    Our server was a spicy abrasive girl but she was cute and that gives her the right to be that way, but she got our drinks and food out right so it is what it is.    It was a nice place with plenty of seating and it was nice and cool.",5,2,2

3,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",153,765,9976,3.0,11/21/2017,Came here for Happy Hour with my colleagues...sadly it's only from 5-7pm. Thank god there was an upstairs because the first level was already packed. My manager grabbed a large table in our own little corner. Wow there was only one server managing the entire upstairs...overwhelmed much! I ordered a Vodka + Cranberry + splash of Pineapple...I had better at my favorite spot Smithfield Hall. One of my colleagues got the Tuesday Special $5 Margaritas but it was too sweet for her. It was probably from a mixed bottle instead of making it from scratch.The service is so slow and you have to order everything wherever she comes back to your table. It was pretty hard to take a advantage of the Happy Hour specials when the server is not around to take down your order.,11,4,9
4,Lou P.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/9/2018,"Good happy hour crowd, we had cash on the bar that I just counted $37, as soon as happy hour ended we turned around and the cash mysteriously disappeared. We questioned the female bartender and she said it was $17 a ten with singles. There weren't any tens, the female bartender is a thief and a liar. If you go here watch your cash. Her name is Tiffany.",,,

6,Chris S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",154,245,9,4.0,1/4/2018,"Awesome after work spot in midtown - a hidden gem if you will.   The happy hour drink prices are outstanding - $8 dollar tito's and soda and $6 dollar beers. The burgers, chicken fingers, fries, and other pub food are really great.  There is also a few upper levels you can book out for work parties, seasonal gatherings, etc.   And yes, it is based/themed on the movie.   Patrick Swayze lovers, brace yourselves.",,,
7,Thalie L.,"Queens, NY",90,302,312,4.0,3/21/2017,Point Break is probably the best dive bar of all midtown.Full of guys having a cheap drink after their cheap jobs.I love it! Big fan!  The food is pretty good for a dive bar. love the hummus and the chicken wings. Always surprise when the tab arrives:- always less than $40.00 . Recommended by the Elite squad!,2,,1
8,Madura L.,"Huntington Station, NY",101,1,0,5.0,8/3/2018,I love point break! It's the best happy hour spot to grab a drink after work! Rosa and Stacey are the bomb! Great service and food,,,
9,Monica T.,"New York, NY",147,72,70,5.0,6/23/2017,"Great happy hour special but get there early if you want a seat at the bar! The place fills up quickly. If you want to sit at a table, you have to order from a waitress.The beach-y surfer vibe is cool when you're in the middle of NYC. Also enjoy all of the framed celebrity mugshots!",1,1,1
10,Whitney M.,"Montclair, NJ",37,17,0,2.0,1/21/2018,"We choose this place because it was right across from our hotel. When we entered, they told us to seat ourselves upstairs. We found a table and began to admire the dive bar decorations. Although it's a little all over the place, we appreciated the ambiance. The upstairs bartender was sweet, but had nothing we ordered. Despite the happy hour specials, we had to walk downstairs to get any of them. This got old fast. We ordered our food--a turkey burger, fries, Mac and cheese, and chicken fingers. The turkey burger was disgusting and got worse with every bite. The Mac and cheese was adequate, along with the fries. The chicken fingers were nasty, it tasted and looked like they had not changed their grease in a very long time--the fingers were a dark brown rather than golden. Despite the friendly bartender, the lack of options upstairs and terrible food made this dive bar a no go. I would NEVER go back, especially with so many other options nearby.",1,,
11,HY K.,"Sunnyside, NY",7,61,0,4.0,1/26/2018,"It gets pretty crowded after work hours. They have a decent happy hour menu where it's $6 for a beer and well drinks. Our musts every time we go are the tater tots...crispy yummy potato goodness and the Jameson wings. Service can be often slow at times because it can get really busy and it can also depend on who your server is but otherwise, this is a solid work happy hour spot. It is based on the og Point Break movie with Swayze and Reeves although I don't really feel like there's a true theme.",,,1
12,Kelly B.,"Huntington, NY",190,176,113,4.0,6/11/2017,"I really like this place. My fiance loves it. They have a reasonable happy hour for midtown and have a pretty laid back vibe. The wings are probably top 5 i've had in NYC area, and I am a wing fiend. They do hot sauce right here. It's usually busy but not overcrowded. Service is attentive and friendly. It's a great spot to hang low key. Definitely recommend.",,,
13,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",208,241,160,4.0,3/31/2017,"Solid dive bar in midtown! Good location, reasonable prices, uber casual vibe, what's not to love? Came during happy hour which is from 5-7p, M-F and grabbed some $4 blue moons. Also had the mac and cheese bites and the dumplings - both were fab, bar food done right!Definitely recommend if you're in need of an easy going spot near the office that doesn't break the bank. Bravo!Yelp Perk - free shot with check-in and a good order.",2,,1
14,Gabby P.,"Marathon, NY",6,1,0,5.0,6/12/2018,"This is the best after-work happy hour. Their food is great, and the perfect selection when drinking. My coworkers and I always come here after work when we need to de-stress, or reconvene on the day. Rosa is the best bartender, she takes care of her customers and makes sure she they are enjoying themselves while here. This place is great!",,,
15,Sen L.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",42,48,62,4.0,5/29/2018,"Just picked up a Meal Pal order of sliders and steak fries. Ambiance is a bit dive bar-ish. Really just leaving a review because I was seriously impressed with the sliders. The patties were really thick and were served medium well. They were juicy and seasoned nicely. (I was expecting a dry and bland patty- not the case!). The fries were lacking though. Bland, no crunch, and no flavor.",,,
16,Lux C.,"San Francisco, CA",134,15,0,5.0,8/30/2018,one of the best spots around grand central to grab a drink or 12 after work. once you get to know the barstaff the pours become heavy AF and you'll be blackout drunk in no time. luckily there are multiple chipotles and a chick-fil-a nearby to help you sober up.,,,
17,Sarah T.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,192,387,4.0,3/29/2017,"This is my go to bar in Midtown. I usually have beer and nachos. The service is friendly. It can get a bit noisy at happy hour, but it is to be expected. They have some space upstairs too with games. A little tip if you want $2 off your next drink is to send a pic of yourself at the bar with their specified hashtags etc. They have some cheap drink options. Cheap fun place. Don't expect to have a deep convo here.",1,,
18,Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",841,876,530,5.0,2/16/2018,Ellie and Rosa are the $h!t Awesome duo. Good appetizers and great drinks. Perfect for running in at lunch time and grabbing some grub with a drink.. or two!,2,,
19,Nolan W.,"Manhattan, NY",141,15,12,1.0,7/22/2017,DO NOT COME HERE. YOU WILL BE OVERCHARGED.I've been here twice and was overcharged both times. The first time I was told to pay full price for happy hour drinks. And the second time a 40% tip was added to my tab after I only gave 20%. I get it. It's a dive bar. But still. The bartenders are shady.,2,2,
20,Joseph S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,17,0,4.0,5/18/2018,"Beer selection is fine and average price for the area. Staff is nice if not super attentive. Packed for lunch and happy hour but clears out later.

21,Camille J.,"Old Bridge, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,8/7/2018,Visited this bar for the first time tonight. I work in the neighborhood and I'll never be back. The bartender was rude and the mixed drinks watered down. No self respecting adult with more than $5 to rub together should find themselves here.,,,
22,Tracy D.,"Boston, MA",280,117,184,5.0,3/13/2016,"I love this place for 2 reasons: the friendly service and the most delicious burger I've ever consumed. I'm not kidding. The best burger. I've had other fantastic things on their menu, so I'm sure everything is also great. You need to order the ZERN BURGER. It has everything you've ever dreamed of that should be on a burger.",1,,
23,Brielle B.,"Manhattan, NY",590,134,26,5.0,5/11/2017,"Quality bar food, $4 draught beers during happy hour, and plenty of seating upstairs - what more can you ask for?

24,Christina T.,"College Station, TX",113,1,0,1.0,12/1/2017,"If you want to get served by the douchiest Joe Rogan sounding bartender, come to this place.  You might as well be on a live taping of the jersey shore. People were getting kicked out and the bartender tried to belittle me for asking what the specials were. I'd call it a tourist trap, but it's more of a who can the bartender bang trap. Never coming to this horrific place again.",1,,
25,Tina S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",61,10,5,5.0,2/23/2018,"Mac and cheese was sooo delicious! Also the calamari! The service was decent, didn't expect much since it was a Friday and maybe busier than normal, it could of been more nice. Yet the food for sure made up for it, after all it is all a team effort.",,,
26,Carolyn G.,"Washington, DC",201,9,0,5.0,10/15/2017,"My coworkers and I come to Point Break relatively often after work on Fridays for happy hour. We always have a good time.

27,Taylor K.,"Riverhead, NY",159,6,0,1.0,6/26/2018,"This place is a joke lol. Currently here for happy hour with two friends and the waitress is so passive and won't even stay at our table for more than 3 seconds because she's busy with the 14 other tables up here. I get it I've waitressed for 5 years but giving a waitress an entire upstairs section during happy hour is ridiculous. Not to mention her entire chest is hanging out and quite obnoxious  while eating if you were just coming to a local bar for happy hour lmfao. Service is horrible and the servers don't care. Wouldn't recommend coming here whatsoever unless you're already so blacked out you can even notice the shitty service...For a place that says ""best happy hour in town"" is not real. There's 1,000 other places to go for happy hour at the same price.",,,

We also tried fried Mac and Cheese balls - those were really nice, Calamaris though were a bit raw and came on the table already cold. However, all in all experience was good!",,,
30,Emily Y.,"New York, NY",284,217,815,3.0,7/27/2015,"I am not sure how this place gives off a beach surfing feeling someone said. To me its more of a drinking party place.The service was nice, food was good, and everything wasn't too expensive at all. Waiter was friendly and bar was fast. Happy hour deals are not bad.However my free shot for checking in on yelp tasted like water. And we decided to leave.",,,1
31,Gui Bin Z.,"New York, NY",60,278,8,4.0,3/4/2016,"Fun divey bar in midtown. This is a great location for your work happy hour.  There's 2.5 floors of fun, the .5 is for the balcony area in the back of the first floor.  On the second floor there are more games, the main floor is great for just grabbing drinks. Happy hour prices are good.  If you're looking for some cheap fun make sure to stop point break.",3,1,1

33,Douglas K.,"Queens, NY",143,545,1,4.0,1/15/2016,"Rare to find a dive bar in midtown, but here's one, and it's pretty solid.  It gets really cramped up after work but drinks are cheap, atmosphere is casual, and food is decent.  They have a 2nd floor for private parties, perfect for work events.If you're looking for something down and dirty this is it, if you're looking to impress, I would suggest elsewhere.",3,,
34,Chantalle U.,"Las Vegas, NV",223,246,106,3.0,3/26/2016,"This is smack dab in the heart of midtown. While there wasn't too much that differentiated it from all of the other nearby dive bars in terms of atmosphere, but the service was awesome and staff was super friendly. As for food I thought it was solidly staple (I had a build your own burger). A safe bet if you want an after work happy hour or to grab a quick lunch.Not a place for you if your not into large evening bar crowds.",1,,
35,Luis T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0,5.0,9/29/2017,"This is by far the best place to grab a beer, some food, watch the game, and hang out with friends.  I feel like I'm a part of the family here considering I'm here three days a week. I love meeting people from other countries.  The food is AMAZING (especially the burgers)!  If your looking for a great place to hang out look no further.  You won't be disappointed.",,,
36,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,988,6100,3.0,10/23/2015,"I recently discovered this bar came across it because I was looking for a something different to try for happy hour.Walking in the place doesn't seem like much what first catches your eye is the funky decorations if u recognize the name u know the movie of course ... Kinda cool it was a great movie. We walked in & found a spot to chill by the bar , not long after we were able to get seats at the bar happy hour specials are pretty decent good time 4-7 they offer mix drinks & draft beer for $4 how can u go wrong? Here's how $4 dollars for a mix drink u probably don't expect much & that was the case with my friends drink she had a Whiskey & ginger ale ahh needless to say it lacked alcohol.I did the smart thing & stuck to beer I had the pumpkin beer on tap think it was Sam Adams but honestly can't remember for sure, beer was good can't go wrong with beer.Don't forget to check in through Yelp u get a free PB shot (only if u order food) this was like drinking liquid candy too sweet but it's alright it was free. After having a few drinks we wanted something to pick on tried the Saucy Fries these are Belgian style fries with truffle mayo, garlic ketchup and chipotle aioli not bad delicious truffle mayo, good garlic ketchup ok chipotle aioli. As for the place itself decent size bar & seating area below the second floor was closed there is additional seating above. Loud music , good prices because of happy hour service at the bar was ok since it does get crowded it's a bit slow bartenders don't seem to pay too much attention but I did noticed a difference after 7 since the place practically empties out then. Over all the place is not bad good enough to spend a few hours close enough to my job where chances are I'll stop by from time to time.",10,,3
37,Kelvin S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,11,3,2.0,3/8/2018,"The food here is fairly decent! But, the table service is lacking. My friend and I visited this location a few nights ago. We were sat at a long table which seats about 10 or 12 people. The waitress explained to us that we would be sitting at a table which more unknown people could possibly join. It wasn't a big deal since it was just the two of us and we sat on the end. Shortly into our first round, we were asked to move to a 4 person table in another section. Again, not a big deal, but if those tables were available from the start of service and attended by the same waitress, why wouldn't you sit a 2 party there initially. Getting past the move, Happy Hour ends as 7, so we were trying to order a second round well before the cutoff, but the waitress continued to service the other tables around us and never came by or looked our way. She was highly attentive to who I assume were her regulars, which were 3 men, since she spent all her time there and even hugged them when they arrived. Again, not a big deal... until I had to ask twice for another round and when it finally arrived it was past the Happy Hour time frame. I kinda figured this would be an issue at the end of the night, but I had already made my mind up that I would challenge the check if we were not honored the HH Prices. I also ordered 1 additional beer, which I knew was not part of HH, but when the check arrived, not only were we not honored the HH for the second round, but I was charged for a round which I never ordered. I politely informed her that I only 1 more beer than my guest, which was 3 total and my guest had 2. My check had 6 beers on it. This would not have been a problem ordinarily as mistakes happen, but paying $7 for a draft and also over paying for a round which I did not have didn't sit to well with me. When I told my waitress about the check she looked at me with the most dishonest look on her face and asked, ""Are you sure?"" At this point, I'm highly disappointed as I know for an absolute fact I only had 3 beers, as opposed to 4. I feel like the service could have been better and of course I would have tipped accordingly. She finally took 2- $7 beers off the tab reducing it from almost $52 to $35 and she ensured I knew that she discounted it. We still tipped her $9 on $35, but the service didn't warrant it! Great Thanks.. but I wasn't given any special favors, we simply paid for what we had. Hope the next time I'll have a better experience, but if not, there's plenty of service driven and reasonable places to visit in this area.",,,
38,Betty L.,"Manhattan, NY",300,124,250,4.0,10/23/2015,"Oh my god, the mac and cheese and the teriyaki chicken wings are amazing!!

39,Alina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,7,0,2.0,8/1/2017,First time here. Interesting pigs and a blanket.

41,Maria W.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,166,25,3.0,12/17/2015,"This bar is adequate. Went here with a medium-sized party and we were directed to the second floor. We shared the space with several other groups. It has a surfer (surprise!) theme that makes it feel like a dive. It was loud and popular on a Wednesday night.The draft selection is basic but fine. We got a couple pitchers for the table. The appetizers are mostly fried but everything was good. Fan favorites were the fried mac and cheese balls, thick cut fries, and nachos. It feels like a fratty happy hour mid-town bar filled with bankers and the like. Not my scene but with good food to snack on and a fun vibe, I'm sure it'll make some very happy.",,,
42,Wesleyan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",416,318,25,4.0,5/11/2015,This place is the go-to spot for myself and a lot of my co-workers. We love the service there and the all-around vibe. The food is great and the portions are SUPER generous. The appetizers are affordable and are fit for two. I've ordered the cheesy tator tots (they effin have tater tots man!)My favorite bartender is Kristy! Her southern hospitality is so welcoming and its one of the main reasons I return again and again.,1,1,1
43,Shaquiera W.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,1,1.0,12/1/2017,"One of my worst bar experiences! It was terrible from start to finish. The bouncers were very friendly, but as soon as I sat down with my friend, the bartender was very nasty. My friend and I were very friendly and enthusiastic about visiting a new bar, but as soon as we sat down, she continuously rolled her eyes at us and ignored us. She even rudely requested we move from our table to accommodate another party. When I expressed how I felt about the experience she walked away and brought my check and slammed it on the table, in the same manner she presented us our drinks with. When I requested the manager, he offered no solution, until I posed one myself. Overall, if you are a minority, do not visit this bar, you will get treated disgustingly!!!",,,
44,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",484,663,591,3.0,8/9/2015,"Great place to drink, not to eat. I came here with a few coworkers for Happy Hour. Their $4 beer offer for HH was enough to get us in the door. We were pretty hungry as well, so we decided to order food. We were seated almost immediately, but after that, our waiter was slow. He didn't come back until 15 minutes later, when we were starving and still waiting on our drink orders. I ordered the mac and cheese wedges to eat. then came another long waiting period. It was about 15 minutes before we received our food. I was really disappointed when I saw the mac and cheese wedges. First, they were balls not wedges, but they were so small. Six little balls with barely any mac and cheese in there. Very disappointing for the $8 I paid. I've had them elsewhere that were bigger and better. Overall, for drinking at the bar, the place is great. Very chill place and have great HH deals. Bartenders at the bar are very attentive. Food though, knocked it down a star. Grab food somewhere else.",,,
45,Liz P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,3/11/2017,"Horrible bartender (the bearded one with the super tight xs shirt). Begging for tips when he didn't even serve us, the Latino bartender attended to us. He then demanded the bouncer to kick us out after closing our tab without our authorization. He proceeded to shout last call at us, it was only 12:30, while continuing to serve the others. Horrible horrible horrible. Bathroom was disgusting as well, I think I even saw rat/mice droppings.",1,,
46,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,4.0,2/21/2016,"They held us the surf-board shaped table upstairs in the back. There was a nice beer selection, though nothing spectacular. The coconut shrimp WAS spectacular. At $12 for half that many shrimp it was a bit pricey... but sooooo good. We also had the ""Storm of the Century"" mixed platter: a nice sampler and great for groups. So far, three stars, right. The fourth star? ROSA, our Dominican waitress. Holy vaca! She was great! Beautiful, on the spot always, terrific sense of humor, ""Give that waitress a raise!"" we say... or at least tip her a whole lot!! Her only fault was her refusal to kill the girl with the squeally voice at the next table.

So we looked on our phones and saw that this place had a really good happy hour. Great happy hour? Hell ya! We were sold. The place wasn't too crowded when we got there. We found a spot upstairs, which was pretty cool. The place was a lot bigger than we expected.We didn't like anything that was on the menu, so we just decided to get drinks. The server was quick and nice. Good thing we sat down because when we went to the bar at the beginning the bartenders were kinda rude. We drank a lot here because it was cheap and we also got the ski shot, which was fun. I kinda expected something more intense from it, but we still had fun.We were here for a little over an hour and the place was packed! It was so packed that we could barely get out of the bar. I have never been in a situation like that before. It kinda made me a little uncomfortable, kinda like sardines in a can. Also it was very disappointing that the wheel of shots was broken. One of there specials, was if you check in there, then you get a free spin on the wheel. However, it was broken, so we didn't get anything.

59,Kathleen N.,"New York, NY",5,34,5,3.0,7/16/2015,"We came for happy hour and then some. The waitress was excellent- attentive, friendly, knew her stuff. We got a free shot for checking in on Yelp. It was a PB shot (vodka, triple sec, and what I think was blue curacao). I can't handle vodka, and she offered to make it with tequila. Overall good customer service. When we couldn't decide on which wings to get, she recommended the Jameson wings, which were sweet and spicy and had just the right amount of sauce. For me, too much sauce can ruin a wing. Really good. They also came with celery AND carrots, which I love. We ordered the chili cheese tots too, which were pretty good. The whole menu looked good. The beers were ok, a thought crossed my mind that they might have been a little watered down, but I can't say for sure. No buybacks.  The crowd...it was a Wednesday, so it was packed with the after work crowd for happy hour and then the crowd started to thin out. We left around 10 and there were just a few people left in the bar. A man who introduced himself as the owner came around and he was sloppy drunk and flirty, which made us kind of uncomfortable. He was nice, it was just weird. I'd come back here to try some other dishes from the menu and for the Jameson wings.",2,1,2

The noontime regulars consisted of guys in suits sharing the bar with construction workers and a mom with her two teenage sons. It seems like a fun place to be after work--there's a shot wheel and it looks like other games go on here too.I thoroughly enjoyed the teriyaki wings. They were big, crispy, and really saucy. Manfriend's steak salad was really dry--I'm also not a fan of gorgonzola and what the salad lacked in dressing, it made up for with a healthy portion of cheese. I got the bull burger. It was not seasoned well, and the egg was overcooked, but the fries were very yummy. It was divey, a little sticky, but surprisingly neat and the bathroom was clean. I'd come back for wings and the nice waitress :)",1,,1

We were comped a few drinks for no reason other than the bartenders were friendly and saw we were having a good time. They play great music too. We had some appetizers which were definitely above average for a dive bar.  I don't really think of this as a come-to-eat bar though. We would go back. In fact, we did.

We stumbled upon this place and decided to go in.Upon walking in, we really loved the atmosphere and vibe it presented. It was a Friday early afternoon and it was pretty crowded downstairs in the bar area so we had to go upstairs where they have more seating but it was nice because we could still see the entire bar area from the balcony. The menu has a lot of bar type snacks and specialty cocktails...there also seemed to be a good amount of different types of beer on tap (but we couldn't really tell and all our waiter said was ""a lot"" when we asked what they had on draft).The main reason I'm giving this place three stars and not four is because of the service and the fact that they didn't have a few things available that were on the menu. We tried to order pigs in blankets and another appetizer and they didn't have either. We ended up getting the mac and cheese balls (might not be the correct name) and they were AMAZING. The sauce they came with was also surprisingly delightful - it had a little kick to it which I normally don't like but this I liked! Our waiter seemed much more concerned with getting to training (which he mentioned multiple times to other tables around us) than actually helping us.Overall, great dive bar and would definitely return!",2,,

The group I was with went up stairs because it was too crowded at the bar downstairs. Upstairs has two beer pong tables which is cool. They have $12 pitcher specials, which is great and affordable, however the staff tried to scam my friends and I. After we ordered our pitchers we gave our credit card to the bartender and we asked to close out the bill. The bartender said he would set up our drinks first and get the pitcher together and take it to our table. We went to the bar twice to close out our bill and get our cards back, but he avoided us. Apparently there is a $20 minimum for credit cards?! Finally after the third try, the bartender decides to tell us. Why couldn't that have just been mentioned from the beginning?!Thats insane!

However, I was looking forward to enjoying them with Honey Mustard sauce, and I was disappointed. I've found that Honey Mustard sauce is made by different restaurants with varying tastes.

82,Timmy L.,"New York, NY",69,1,0,1.0,11/7/2014,"Worst. Bar. EVER.Where to begin? For starters, Point Break is a legitimately great name for a bar. In fact, before I moved back from San Diego I always said that if I ever owned a bar, I would name it after the eponymous movie. Bodhi and Johnny Utah (gimme two!) are classic movie characters and the movie fit the vibe of the type of place I love to hang out at............(SPOILER ALERT) This is not one of those bars. In fact, other than the shitty Corona shortboards hanging from the walls, nothing in this bar gives off a beachy, SoCal feel. I could dissect the absurdity of naming a bar Point Break in the dead center of Manhattan, but in the interest of brevity I won't. This review is focused on the service (or lack thereof). I went there for a few drinks last Friday with a coworker and honestly, I thought it was fine. I was annoyed that we had to practically beg the waitress for each subsequent round of drinks (3 rounds in total), but it was Halloween and they gave us each a small candy bar after we paid.Today was a different story altogether. I wanted to take my team out for a celebratory lunch and figured I would give PB another shot... seeing as its around the corner from my office and eminently convenient. HUGE mistake. In order, here are (some of) the mistakes made:     1) They forgot to put our order in     2) They brought our appetizers up with our main course     3) They actually forgot what I ordered     4) By the time my order was ready, we were ready to leave     5) The waitress and the bus staff each blamed each otherAnd here is where the REAL fuck ups started:     6) They told us ""we hooked you up"" on the bill due to the fuck ups but the only thing comped were the shots. THAT WE DIDNT WANT OR ORDER.     7) They declined my card with a full limit primed and ready to be used     8) They announced it in front of my whole team while I was in the bathroom     9) They declined 2 other team members credit cards   10) They started yelling at us saying that it was our fault   11) The male manager screamed at a female member of my team   12) Rather than take my lead and have a man to man conversation with me after fuck up # 11, he yelled at me DONT FUCKING TOUCH ME BRO! Swear. To. God.   13) They ran 3 more cards, all declined and said SEE! THIS IS ON YOU!Actually, sir, it wasn't. I handed him the initial card of mine and he ran it for half of the bill ($80) and, shockingly, it went through. He then ran it a second time and OH MY GOD it went through again.No apology. No ""wow we fucked this one up"". Just a big ol pile of ""uhhh you want a round of shots?"" NO ASSHOLE I HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK.

Also notable were the coconut shrimp, sliders and a large mixed platter great for sharing. Our waitress, Rosa, was most attentive and had a friendly helpful manner.

Took her order and started to walk away without asking me if I wanted anything . I guess my shocked look and my daughter saying my mother wanted to order got her attention.  I ordered a Blue Moon and when it came I asked for a couple of orange slices, by the time she came back there was one sip left.. she placed the orange by my daughters plate and walked away without apologizing it took so long.. or not even asking me if I wanted another drink... which I actually wanted.  I guess you get more attention if your a guy at the.bar which she seemed more than happy to be serving.  She chose to ignore me the entire time I was there even thoug I was the one paying the bill.  I returned the favor with her tip.  Ladies dining or drinking alone stay away... guys have a great time!!",1,1,1

Understandable. We stood up to gather our stuff but no more than 30 seconds later we're getting screamed at to get the hell out and being called names.  Don't give 20 people 30 seconds to leave a room and proceed to say we're disrespectful.  It's not possible to move that many people in 30 seconds.

We snagged the table right by the window (the only table right by the window) and even managed to rearrange the furniture to be able to put a stroller closest to the window.

Whoever answered the phone said he couldn't find the earrings and that the waitress was leaving, I requested to speak to her, he changes his version and says she left already. Fifteen minutes after the first call, one of my friend calls and speaks to the waitress and she says she didn't find anything on the table (odd).

Anyway, this place is cheap. $4 for beer & a bunch of mixed drinks is pretty good. They didn't have anything special on tap and their list of $4 drinks didn't include anything with whiskey, but you probably wouldn't care if you're coming here for lunch or after work.The other cool thing they had was a Wheel of Shots. You spin it like wheel of fortune and there are different shots or libations that it can land on.

Even went into an Irish pub down the street and walked out because they were so unfriendly. Just had drinks, no food but they didn't mind. Seemed a little odd that it was surfer themed in the middle of Midtown but that was probably because it was December and 19 degrees outside. I would definitely go back.",,,

We got 2 drinks and then my friend ask if he could close out his tab. She looked for about 5 min. and told us that his card (which he just gave to her not even 15 min ago) wasn't there and she can't find it. So obviously we responded with ""what do you mean you can't find it"" and she scrolled through the cards again and my friend thought he saw his card so he said wait wait is that it?! And with a snotty response she looked at us and said ""um...not unless your name is Cynthia"". After that she tried blaming the new guy by saying that ""Maybe he took it or cashed someone else out with it"" and I told her, no we gave it to you and he hasn't cashed anyone out. She then suggested that my friend should just cancel his card because nothing went through to the bank yet or we could sit there for 15 min and maybe it would show up.Frustrated we decided to leave but since the bar wasn't crowded, on a whim we asked a women by the door if her name was Cynthia and she said yes and then we asked if she could look at her card to see if she had my friends card by mistake and she did! We also asked if the women bartender was the one to cash her out and she said yes she was. By the way, my friends name is Matthew, not even close to Cynthia.",3,2,

Are you kidding me?  I then say I will just have a red wine to avoid ambling down the line around other people.  Suddenly she give me a choice, cabernet or merlot.  Nope I didn't tip.And the wine sucked as expected.  Could be a better happy hour option if they clean house and get some friendly help.",4,2,

133,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,2.0,2/15/2013,"I came here for a work event with some people after work in the middle of the week. The setup isn't terribly conducive to having a crowd - it's very narrow, making it difficult to navigate once the after-work crowd is in full swing. Thankfully we had some space in the back that made it a bit easier for a group to hang out in, and we had a nice time trying to figure out whose mug shots were posted in the back. That said, I wasn't impressed with the beer selection - from what I could hear, Captain Lawrence was the only craft brew on tap - and the service was spotty, with orders being forgotten/dropped entirely and drink requests occasionally being few and far between when we first showed up. The appetizers were also nothing to write home about...the dumplings were fried, greasy, and largely flavorless; the pigs in a blanket were very dry; and all the chips in the nachos were buried underneath the beans, sour cream, and everything else. A bar is really not the ideal place to get your hands dirty with soggy nachos...especially when there's not any napkins provided either.In all, it's a different scene than most of the Irish pubs that are a few blocks east, but not one that I'd frequent. I suppose that it's probably a fun place to get sloppy if you get the beer pong table set up, but otherwise you can probably find yourself a better after-work drinks place. Not the worst bar I've been to is about as kindly as I can put it.",2,,

Mixture of people who had just finished work and a few tourists. The server was quick to get us drinks and was friendly. There was happy hour from 5pm with $4 margaritas which went down well. The place cleared out about 7pm.  We ordered some rocket shrimp at the suggestion of our server and they were great. The manager Roland took the effort to have a chat with us which is nice, he is a great guy and gave us tips on where to go as we were in NYC for honeymoon. We left about 8pm a little worse for were which was a sign of the great service we received. Overall a well priced friendly bar right in the middle of things. You can't go wrong!",2,,1

I was on an hour lunch break and it took 30 minutes to come back out.  When it did, the bread was literally burned black to a crisp. Were they messing with me ? Possibly, but for $15 it hurt. Looks like a fun place for happy hour though. Maybe they were just having a bad day. The rating is just for this experience.",,,
171,B C.,"New York, NY",15,53,0,2.0,2/23/2011,"My office used to go to this bar all the time.  It was our ""Cheers"" except no one ever remembered our names.  It was a bit ridiculous.  We always came in a big crowd, ordered plenty of food and drink, tipped appropriate, and was friendly to the waitstaff.  Somehow, they never seemed to remember who we were.  I get that there are a lot of people who do happy hour in midtown.  But, precisely since there are a lot of people who do happy hour in midtown and there are a lot of bars, they really should have worked a little harder to remember the regulars.  While it's hard to turn away from the $4 beers, we've stopped coming here full stop. I was going to give it just 1 star, but for the sake of all the good times there, I'm letting it have 2.",2,2,1
172,Brendan Y.,"Astoria, NY",106,329,5,4.0,6/22/2011,"An unassuming bar tucked into an unnoteworthy end of 45th. Pretty much the biggest sausagefest Ive ever seen, but if getting drunk with insurance auditors is your bag... welcome to shangri-la. They have a wheel of shots where $5 buys you a chance at 1/2 open bar, jello shot or DA DA DAAAA.... WATER. No Whammies! Biiiig money. NO WHAMMIES! Anyway, it's not really ever crowded and the prices are pretty good for midtown. Perfect if you wanna get a drink and dont wanna be asses to elbows with strangers.",1,,1
173,John R.,"Boise, ID",2,10,0,4.0,2/5/2013,"Kristan is the best, checked in and got a free boot, place gets packed right after work with all the commuters but went later and it was dead.  Seemed like a cool spot.....True Story",2,2,1
174,Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,4.0,10/8/2015,"So good - the waitress was really nice and was able to accommodate us in altering the menu. Love the atmosphere and the fact that there's an upstairs for a ""quieter"" dinner. Don't really find places that offer tots so this place definitely at the top of my list- Will definitely come back again! #TOTS #YUM #PBSHOT",,,
175,Monica T.,"New York, NY",88,635,574,3.0,11/12/2011,"Frat bar to the max!! Beer pong and flip cup! And real legit happy hours $4 beer and well drinks until 7pm, hell yeah!!unfortunately, the wheel of shot was not there!!",,,
176,Paul S.,"Quincy, MA",11,26,2,1.0,5/10/2013,The food was okay. The beer on tap was piss warm. The liquor was hot around 90 degrees. Nothing like a nice warm beer after work. The manager was taking shots with the wait staff at the end of the bar and was just hanging out with friends rather than helping out his staff like he should. Haven't these people seen bar rescue? Staff that drink on the job never works. I won't be coming back to this bar again.,1,1,
177,Reyhan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/29/2014,Great place. Good atmosphere. Good music. You can hardly feel that you're in Midtown! The place has a nice seating area upstairs which has tables to sit at and couches.,,,
178,Sajid Z.,"Bronx, NY",142,157,26,4.0,11/15/2011,"A very cool spot tucked away in the heart of midtown. The reason this place is pretty cool- 1) The Food2) The Happy PricesI don't quite like the atmosphere during the after work hours because it seems like a bunch of pretentious people with their suits on and other various travelers but it was a good experience because I was with my friends.  I was reluctant to come here but the Fried Mac  n Cheese, Fried Pickles, Pigs in a Blanket and other snacks were worth it. Add to that the cheap beer you have the potential for a good time. The service was cool too and I guess even though I was reluctant to come here I still had an OK time. 5/5 for Pricing5/5 for Food Selection3/5 for Atmosphere",,,
179,Omi C.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0,5.0,6/3/2014,I love to visit this place after work with coworkers! The hostess is a lot of help and the bartenders are very attentive and nice! Highly recommend,,,
180,Sarah C.,"West Bridgewater, MA",113,195,40,3.0,12/30/2012,"A pretty decent and fairly priced dive in Midtown, who knew. This place is by my work, and I've gone here a few times. They have drink specials outside of happy hour.. $3 Keystone cans and $4 Highlifes. They have a photo booth and a cool/creepy upstairs with additional tables and red velvet couches and a bunch of celeb mugshots on the wall. It reminds me of a tiki bar in someone's basement, but I like it. Haven't tried the food yet, but probably will. Thanks for being you Point Break.",1,1,1
181,Anthony V.,"Cranford, NJ",29,20,1,4.0,3/26/2011,I stopped in here after a post-work bar hop with some friends.  I'm a beach bum so the beach/tropical decor was right up my alley.  The bar was surprisingly slow for a Friday night which actually was a good thing.  The $5 shot wheel was great; I landed on yager-bombs so that wasn't a bad price for that drink.  The beer selection was also decent and they had my favorite beer on tap - Landshark!!  The bartend that evening was very cool.  She talked with us most of the night and was quick with the drinks.  Since I work only a few blocks away I will be visiting this place again and often.,1,,
182,Kristen H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,3/11/2013,"The man who I assume was the manager refused to put on the Knicks game when we asked.   We were in a group of 5 and he looked at us as if we were bothering him when we asked.  Mind you he was just sitting on the end of the bar, texting on his phone and starring at the attractive female bartenders.  Won't be returning to this sham of a bar anytime soon.",1,,
183,Mohammed R.,"Bronx, NY",1,14,0,1.0,11/1/2013,Horrible service. Took 10 mins for someone to acknowledge my party. Place doesn't welcome customers it seems.,,,
184,April Joy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",363,71,163,4.0,6/29/2011,"The bartenders are cute girls who are friendly and the drinks are strong.  What more is needed in a bar? Oh! And if you're a single lady, stop by after work and you're guaranteed to feel like the only girl in the world as the place gets crowded with lots of suits and ties waiting for their train home.   Tiny advice, skip the wheel of shots and just order yourself a shot of root beer instead.",,,
185,Tiffany S.,"Merrick, NY",18,16,20,5.0,1/11/2013,"Great after work, happy hour spot. Fun games, yummy food, cheap drinks, and hot bartenders! The girls that work there are a hoot! Just a really chill and relaxed spot to unwind after a hard days work!",1,,
186,Gene G.,"Valley Falls, RI",49,32,17,3.0,7/29/2011,This local dive is primarily an after work hang out for people in the area. Limited beer selection for beer snobs (as I mostly am). The bartenders are friendly ladies and the music is a blend of modern and classic rock. The place is fairly empty from 8 PM on though worth stopping in if you are in the neighborhood. I wouldn't go out of the way to be here.,,,
187,Danny H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,2,1.0,6/10/2015,"Been here over 10 times in the last year. Usually a great spot for happy hour, however on this occasion the bartender was very rude and dismissive. Not what I expected from someone in the service industry especially point break.",,,
188,Curtis B.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,22,10,2.0,12/17/2014,This place sucks. Flat beer. Disinterested bartenders. Gave me the wrong drink. Food sucked. No marinara sauce with mozzarella sticks? This is why you don't drink in midtown. I'll give it an extra star because I made the mistake not going to a different neighborhood.,,1,
189,Eddie R.,"Belle River, Canada",3,19,27,4.0,5/7/2013,I had a great time. No complaints about the staff. Good selection of draft beer. The bartender gave us a free round because we were there a while. Food was good too.,,,
190,Chrissy C.,"Jersey City, NJ",339,403,17,4.0,2/8/2011,"We spent many a night here during July, because our work orientation was being held at the Sofitel. The food is decent, and the bartenders are attentive. The only issue I have it how cramped it feels sometimes. They do have pong tables upstairs and beet boots if that's your thing. We never stayed much later than 9 (we would go elsewhere) so I'm not sure of the wpost-work happy hour atmosphere. Solid choice for a quick drink though.",,,
191,John H.,"Leonardtown, MD",0,1,0,4.0,4/23/2015,"nice place, up my alley, has a country bar feel.  bartender was nice, had good music too.  i would recommend this place",,,
192,Sam A.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",13,86,0,3.0,1/13/2013,"Point Break is a decent place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood or need a place for a happy hour. Nothing excitingly special, but you should be able to enjoy good conversation with your group of friends over the standard drink offerings whenever you stop by!",,,
193,Patrick B.,"Astoria, NY",577,33,33,3.0,1/18/2015,"Met up with a large group of friends for a birthday party on the second floor.  I would probably rate this two and a half stars, but I'll be generous.  The bouncer was really friendly, and didn't make me feel like I was a criminal as I walked in the door, as most bouncers do.  He asked how my night was, and struck up a conversation with my wife (who met up with us a little later) and made everyone feel really comfortable.  Upstairs bar didn't have any craft beer, so I traversed up and down the stairs because I'm a geek.  Saw that they had an Empire IPA, but they were tapped.  I had a Captain Lawrence Pale Ale, and a Coney Island Lager.  Staff were courteous, clean (to a fault, as soon as I finished my last sip, there was a bar back running around the dance floor taking glasses from people, it was really nice), and friendly.  Good bar.  I'll come back for the staff, not for the beer selection.",,,
194,G P.,"Jamaica, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/11/2015,Great time at a great spot! Definitely worth checking out! Perfect place to hang with friends and have some drinks. Even have beerpong on the 2nd floor to relive the glory days!!!,,,
