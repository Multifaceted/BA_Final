1,Kristin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,276,1,1.0,7/7/2018,"It's NYC and it's 2018 - how are there any racist establishments!!? As a white female, it is pretty rare for me to personally experience what I know a lot of my non-white friends go through. Last night my girl and I were out bar hopping and she wanted to go to The Box. My friend is a beautiful, intelligent, bad ass, couture wearing, lawyer - who is also really high up the corporate food chain at a major int'l bank. She can run circles mentally, physically, and financially around most people I know! Oh, but I shouldn't forget to mention the only detail The Box seems to care about - she's black. When we got there the guy running the door (who was dressed like a bad 80s Beetlejuice), was informing two white dudes it was $700 to come in. The two dudes quickly conferred and said no thanks. My girl stepped up to the rope and waited to be acknowledged. Ugly Beetlejuice looked around and pretended like nobody was waiting to get in. He says a few things quietly to one of the bouncers, who also happened to be black, before he eventually visually acknowledged my friend with a subtle eye roll. He walked over and she tells Poser Beetlejuice it's just the two of us and we'd like to come in. He made the subtle eye roll again and explained he's not the one who decides who can come in and another guy will be out shortly. With that, he took leave and went back inside. We're standing there another several or five minutes when three white people rolled up. They all shake hands with the black bouncer and are quickly shuffled inside. This was the point where I quietly started to suggest to my girl I didn't wanna hang out here. That had just confirmed exactly what I had been thinking - this place is racist and they're ignoring us because my girl is black. My girl still wanted to go inside so I quietly stood behind her and and continued watching. More white people kept rolling up, shaking hands with the black bouncers, and being let inside. Finally, I see a group of females, dressed in the most visually offensive way - and wearing things that honestly made me think ""I wonder how they're getting let into any bar dressed like that?!"" They all had sort of a gutter punk look but one was specifically only wearing a fishnet like top that left nothing to the imagination as her nipples, breasts, gut, and everything in between were on full display. She was also maybe not the most fit lady and I'm not hating, do you - but my thoughts were literally ""who's letting her in anywhere dressed like that?!"" It was then I realized they were also going to The Box. Needless to say, but I'm gonna say it, the gutter punk girls were all white. True to form, a couple smiles, a few handshakes, and boom - they were welcomed with open arms. Meanwhile, the bouncers and the door guy haven't looked in the slightest direction towards my girlfriend who had been quietly and politely waiting. At this point I was so furious - and I knew she had to be too - I told her ""I'm not going in a place like this. I don't wanna be around that kind of energy""! After having watched a dozen or more white people have zero issues entering - I was pissed! I grabbed my girl and walked away.What's also disgusting is this establishment uses black men as bouncers to not allow in other black people! That feels like some oppressive slave owning shit right there! It made me think of that scene in Knocked Up when Leslie Mann is trying to get into the club and is yelling at Craig Robinson. Finally, Craig tells Leslie that he's only allowed to let in a certain amount of black people. Gross. Gross. Gross.Here's how I see it. If you are one of these black bouncers reading these reviews about this racist establishment, it's time for you to respect yourself and get a new job at a place that treats people equally! There is no reason in my mind why you should be subjecting yourself to that sort of environment! If you are a person who has been to The Box and likes going to The Box, maybe you should consider going anywhere else! This also goes for you people reading this review looking to go to The Box for the first time! This is NYC! It's the greatest city on earth! There are hundreds upon hundreds of establishments that support equality and good vibes - who also apparently make better less expensive drinks!! By continuing to be a patron at The Box after reading these reviews about their very clear racist policies - you are supporting inequality and racism yourself! Be the change and spend your hard earned dollars somewhere that respects all people! This post isn't about a crappy bar that charges too much for drinks. This post is about systemic racist issues that continue to plague and stain our country! This post is a PSA that it will not be tolerated! And to the owners of The Box who I'm sure will eventually read this... karma is a mo fo and it's coming for you!",39,2,8

Updated review","If you want to be scammed and mistreated, come here. Miserable, pathetic bouncers who hate their lives will greet you. After you get in there's just overpriced drinks and lots of nudity. Some of the workers here are really nice and there are some good performers. There are many places in Brooklyn (House of Yes, Bizarre Bar) where the atmosphere is relaxed, the prices are reasonable and the people aren't desperate for validation. Would love to see this place close.",2,,
3,Neelam M.,"Washington, DC",0,6,0,1.0,10/20/2018,"The rudest bouncers with the most backwards entrance process, they looked my gay black friend up and down and said ""no"" I am personally offended at the behavior of the staff, unbelievably and sad experience that a club in New York behaves this way.",4,,
4,Sha'velle D.,"Queens, NY",467,83,490,4.0,5/26/2018,To describe The Box I would just have to say it's a different experience very eclectic. I recorded a view videos and I wasn't aware that I wasn't suppose to until I was told I couldn't. My bad! Anywho it's a strange interesting show they have about three throughout the night. A great DJ and a lot of dancers some hanging from the ceiling. The shows were the most interesting of the night. This is definitely a fun place to go for a different experience. Would recommend for a birthday or even a date night. I'm unaware of cover for the place because I have a friend that promotes their so it was free entry. I did have glasses of wine but I didn't enjoy them because it was all warm. That would be my only complaint.,2,,
5,Oumy-Neferti D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,11,1.0,10/26/2018,Racist establishment from what I read. Don't want to give my money to people that consider that a party is only a party if no blacks are in it. I pass.,1,,
6,Kennedy L.,"New York, NY",409,5,0,1.0,10/20/2018,I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Full of self entitled pricks who become a bouncer and think they are suddenly god. Their process on who they let in is dumb and they think they are the best thing since sliced bread. Beret guy is racist and homophobic.,1,,
7,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,11/4/2018,"If you want to have a miserable night, and be charged up the a** to do so, this is the place for you.I decided to go to the Box for my birthday and book a table for a group of friends.  The ""madam"" informed me of a minimum spend which was fairly pricey, but I figured I'd splurge for what was supposed to be a chic venue with unique performances.  She warned me to arrive early the night of because they can't reserve specific tables, as those are allocated on a first come first served basis.After a group dinner for 12, I rushed all my friends to finish up so that we could get to The Box and reserve our table.  Upon arrival, I was told that we were assigned to Table 4, ""which is a great VIP table.""  Table 4 was literally the last seat in the house, and the entire place was empty except for one other table.  I told the hostess that we'd like to move closer to the stage.  She told me that she would check with the manager and when she returned said that all the other tables were already reserved but if I wanted to pay a higher minimum she would see what she could do.  Not wanting to play their bait-and-switch extortion game, I went directly to the door person who seated us and also called the madam who made the original reservation. After they explained to me that I must have ""misunderstood"" because the tables are allocated on minimum spends, and apparently mine wasn't enough so they were reserving ALL other tables in the house for people who hadn't shown yet, they said that other than moving me to some inferior space on the mezzanine, there was nothing else they could do.  With the birthday group there and the Box in possession of my credit card, we tried to fit our 12 people in the ""VIP"" banquette designed for 4-6 people max.  Half of my friends had to stand. A 30 second opening act went on at 1am before we had to wait another hour for any other acts to come on.  In the meantime, waitresses enthusiastic to help us reach our minimum spend came over, letting us know they were out of this bottle, but had a similar bottle that was almost double the price and they'd see if they could do us a favor and get it for just 1.5 times the price. When the bill came, while the service was awful, the totals didn't reflect any of that - full minimum + show fee + tax + gratuity.For the amount I spent, I could have taken a trip to Europe, found the rudest venue possible, and then at least been treated like sh*t with some class.If you're looking for a place with fun shows, go to House Of Yes, Company XIV, the Slipper Room, Bartschland Follies, etc.If you're looking for a classy night where you might pay for it but get anything other than cheap, haggling nightlife, go literally anywhere else.The only thing redeeming about the night was the great friends I was with that I wish I had taken elsewhere.***Save yourself the frustration, money, and disappointment and find another place to have a fun night out or celebrate a special occasion.***",1,2,1
8,Jesse C.,"Staten Island, NY",36,46,15,3.0,2/12/2018,"This is the most New York place you'll go to. Everything about this place is New York City. I would say The Box is a place you go to 4-5x a year and you're never disappointed. It's expensive, but worth it... I mean the show is hilarious, impressive, talented and just WOW. Ashley, the MC, is beyond talented.More importantly, you could be Beyonce with Kim K and probably still wait for more than 5 minutes outside, it's tough and quite aggravating. Most people rate this place below 3 stars because they can't get in. The staff behavior is sketchy and the staff, themselves, are not the most friendly.  I think there is something to be noted that if you have a table during show time there is a show fee.. especially if it's what a gratuity costs aka 20% -- ridiculous. They don't care about their patrons.This place gets three stars because it's super New York... you love it, you hate it but why do you go back? Because it's a spot to not miss out on... it is worth the hype.",2,1,3
9,Alex E.,"Northampton, MA",283,2,0,1.0,9/29/2018,Horrible service. The bouncers has us waiting outside for a long time for no reason. They told me I was an asshole because I said there was an issue with letting everyone else in before us. Don't go here if you don't know someone there.,,,
10,Esther G.,"New York, NY",1,5,0,2.0,5/10/2018,Reason for the rating is not for the decor which is very cool or the performance by Fractured Atlas of Anecdoche which was amazing !!It was for the lack of communication of the pricing for cocktails purchased from the bar vs table service.  To be charged $15 per drink at the bar to $24 at a table including a tip on each for a glass of Prosecco? No reasoning just each person acting clueless.,3,,

12,Amanda A.,"New York, NY",562,153,14,2.0,6/19/2017,"I have been coming to the box for years now, and I used to enjoy coming here. But I find the behavior of the staff to be very sketchy. This review is not based on me coming here once by the way, but easily over a dozen times in the last few years. This review has nothing to do with the performers. I think the MC, Ashley is amazing, and so are the other people who take to the stage here. Also no complaints about any bartenders here either. The bathroom attendants have always been lovely too. It's the waitresses and bus staff that are my biggest complaint. 1. They never ask if you would like sparklers with your bottles and they just bring it out. They charge you ""a show fee"" which I would be fine with if they a) told you about it b) actually did some kind of ""show"". It at least used to be more theatrical or exciting. This last time she had the sparkler and just put it inside one of the glasses while she started opening the bottle while the sparkler was still going. 2. Meanwhile, the busser is jamming someone else's purse at me that was on the table he is setting up. But I don't know whose purse it is, and simply being polite and asking would have sufficed. 3. Later, I caught the busser grabbing full glasses of champagne and trying to walk away with them. I stopped him and took them back because I knew who they belonged to, and they were completely full and had just been poured. He also spilled champagne on me before I caught him with the glasses and he could have cared less.4. Beware, the waitresses will sometimes just start drinking without being invited to, and one of the other times, she invited 4 of her friends over to start taking shots without asking anyone if we would mind. My advice if coming here is to be wary of the staff, pay attention to them handling your bottles and glasses. Also specify if you want sparklers.",23,7,10

Its burlesque meets circus with clubbing in between shows. They often give out popcorn at the beginning of each event which is fitting.

If you want a table you're looking at a grand per person with hidden show fee tucked away - all to watch some girl flap her pussy lips to sing a song - it's really cheap thrills. Real fucking cool.

Do not waste your time nor your money.  There are much better places to go to.I was really looking forward to our night at The Box to celebrate my sisters birthday.  I reserved a table; expensive, but I thought it would be worth it.  It wasn't.  One guest in our party was not drinking the champagne that we had ordered via the table service.  The server brought one drink to her at the start of the evening.  After that she had to go to the bar and get her own drinks.We had a private table upstairs but constantly all night had to ask random people who kept appearing and sitting down in our seats to leave and stop drinking our drinks.The bathrooms are dilapidated.The intervals between the show were extended boredom.  The ""dancing"" bear became ridiculous.  The acts were good for the very short time they were on but did not make up for the dreadful service.If I could write this review with no stars I would.  We spoke to a manager while we were there.  Not what you want to be doing whilst celebrating a birthday.  He offered to reduce the bill.  To be honest though monetary compensation couldn't fix the disappointment in finding that The Box was so very far below my expectations. At point one guest was getting her own drink at the bar the server was on her phone and another guest was once again chasing random people away. I refused to pay the tip for obvious reasons and was met with shouts of ""Yeah thanks for a great Memorial Day weekend"" from one of the people working there.  Well right back at you because you didn't do your job and you didn't make ours great either",2,,

Went to go see the free Sza show and arrived at 11am for a call time of 6pm. The bouncers and security guards had no idea how to form a waiting crowd and persisted to cause confusion and anger as they changed the starting point of the line and rules on how to get in. The box needs to work on organization and customer service before trying anything else. Disappointed and unamused by the whole experience. I will never attempt to go back here.,4,,

They force you to stand in a line for standing in a line's sake (""look how popular we are!""), and while I (needlessly) waited to get in, I watched a bouncer in a tux (how fancy!) repeatedly manhandle both men and women for no reason.

The show was unimpressive and our bottle service girl sat down and asked if it was okay to pour herself a glass of champagne. I did bottle service in college and none of our girls would have EVER asked that. If a party offers it, that's another story. Long story short- it was an absolute awful, ridiculously expensive experience for a shit time and shit show. We spent over $2300 for crap. Will never recommend to friends or family.",14,1,
34,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,3.0,5/18/2016,"The Box...hmm, where do I start.First of all, The Box is not ""Club"" and to say so would be a disservice to the place and to it's patrons as well.  Nor is it a restaurant or cocktail lounge.  But rather, it's a combination of burlesque, cabaret, circus/carnival acts, along with dance music, cocktails and food.  I include the term ""circus/carnival acts"" because I think that's what disturbs people the most and creates such negative reviews...not to mention the velvet rope/door person, which truly is one of the hardest to get through in the city.  Mainly because, like I said, it's not a club, so they don't care about having lots of girls or having promoters work the club or selling bottle service.  You really do need reservations for a table or need to know someone there.  The owners of the club, Simon Hammerstein and the other partial owners, have made it known they don't want this to turn into a Vegas-style club, but rather a theater of Vaudeville acts.So, back to the ""Acts""...a few of them are pretty tame and mundane - burlesque dancers, female impersonator singers, raunchy comedians, etc., but a few are, well, hard to explain, and frankly grotesque to some.  I personally found it amusing, but others at my table couldn't watch, and one of the girls actually left and went home cause she couldn't handle it, haha.To give you some perspective, and only to prepare those who are coming who have never been, one of the more regular and popular ""entertainers"" here is Miss Rose Wood, a transgender performer known to push the boundaries of her performances in order to shock audiences.  And she did that well the night we were there.  The gist of her act was, she was rolled out while sitting on a toilet completely naked, then stood up, reached down into the toilet and grabbed either fake or real poop and then proceeded to smear it all over her genitals, body, face and hair.  Was so realistic and shocking, that one of the girls at our table almost threw up and left.  Miss Rose Wood is also famous for vomiting on Susan Sarandon (google it) who was sitting in front of the stage, along with many other disturbing acts, just to give you some perspective.Anyway, the reason I point this out is, if you plan on spending $1,500 for a table there, or if you plan to eat while you're there, be aware that some of the acts will be along these lines.  Like I said, it didn't bother me, cause I knew these kinds of things were coming, but for others, they couldn't handle it.So, My Advice is: 1. Make reservations2. Go during the week, when it's less crowded3. Don't get there until 11pm as the show starts late4. Get a table with a group of friends so you have somewhere to sit 5. Request a table in the back/sides so you don't get hit with bodily fluids from the performers6. Don't take pictures of the show as they'll grab your phone/camera7. Don't eat while you're there, you'll regret it8. Drink A LOT so you can handle the show9. Have Fun...if you can, haha10. Shower when you get home, you'll want or need to lolOverall though, I gave The Box 3-stars as we came prepared and we had a lot of fun there.  But it's hard for me to give it a higher rating, as one person from our group left, and there really isn't much room to dance as it's so small, the door is a hassle, it's not cheap, and the acts are pretty good, but not great.  So, if you're not able to get in here, don't worry, you're not missing much, but if you do get the opportunity to go to The Box, you should most definitely go, just to see what all the hype is about.  Just remember, that hype will most likely include a few disturbing acts, haha.",51,15,14
35,Julie A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,38,22,1.0,10/10/2017,"Went there last week. And every time I came, there were major issues, unless my group agreed to pay bouncers asking price(3 times more than you pay for reservation). Whole squad of bouncers needs to be changed as they got too comfortable at their job. They are pretentious and ignore you even if you are at the front of the line and have a reservation, because supposedly if you have a reservation table is not guaranteed and means nothing. I guess it feels great to treat people like shit for someone with inferiority complex.I love the Box shows.

He would go in and then never come back out. We overheard some people saying that he would do that.  He would look at us up and down with an attitude.  I have never felt so disrespected by a doorman in my life.  Someone with that type of attitude should not be working the door.

I've been to the box 3 times and each time I've walked away feeling like this is the kind of place that capitalizes on the feeling of exclusivity without providing a service that is exclusive. Tonight I arrived for a work party and attempted to order a drink. The bartender asked me what I wanted and when I ordered she responded ""the open bar is over"" and walked away and left me waiting for 15 minutes during shift change. I didn't ask for a free drink. When the new bartender arrived I complained and his response was ""if it makes you feel any better she's fired for the evening"" like that was cute. The makers and soda he gave me after was $18 and provided with no apologies. This place expects to stay busy because it makes you feel like you can't get what it offers anywhere else but it offers the same thing you can get 15 minutes into Brooklyn for $10 less per drink and with friendly service that doesn't pretend to be queer but actually is queer.

I explained to this guy named biza we were guest listed and expected as we are a pulse shooting survivor and a pulse shooting first responder and were here invited from orlando specifically for our joint birthday at kayvons table for ostins bday. Biza' s response was fuck no he can't come in. I again explained he survived a mass shooting and cannot be left ALONE outside like that. 2 hours passed by as I tried to get him in for our reservation from the inside. I asked biza do you watch the news? He is a survivor from one of America's worst mass shooting please he doesn't do well with anxiety like this. Again biza payed more attention to the game on his phone then the patrons of the club trying to get in. Thank you biza for the worst welcoming from the NY city I'll make sure to spread the word of your ignorance and unprofessional approach to the guest of your events. As a staff member from the most talked about pulse night club in Orlando I highly recommend not wasting your night trying to get in unless you want to end up like my friend literally in bed sick now from waiting outside for 3 hours for his own birthday reservation. I highly recommend those who hired biza to re-evaluate his approach towards your customers.

As others mentioned I couldn't see the show because of limited views but from the looks and sounds everyone was enjoying themselves. I personally enjoyed the vibes and exclusivity - like others mentioned they are strict with who they let in and who they don't. However for the regulars there it works I like that I didn't have to deal with annoying creeps or 20 year olds. The people there were chill which made a great night for everyone else.

He had his nose in the air, even though he was dressed in baggy jeans and a plain white shirt.  He was not cleanly shaven, he appeared to be homeless. I listened as he told someone next to me the table was ""$2500"" I was confused.  Who was this man and why did the club have a homeless person deciding who can enter?  I spoke to the bouncers who told us to stay in the line and wait.  I watched as he refused the beautiful Hispanic woman to my right.  He was, however, letting all the men in.  ALL the men.  Did not refuse any man. Now I don't know if it was a sex thing, but regardless, we were having none of it and decided to leave after a solid ten minutes in the cold.  Disappointing.  Will never come here again or recommend to anyone ever again.  What a waste of time.  PS: That man definitely should move from NYC, we don't believe in any sex/gender discrimination here.I would be more than happy to speak with the manager if he reads this.",24,7,1

The club was somewhat empty and boring at 1 am, and I felt like the alcohol was FAKE, I lived in China for 3 years and they use spoof replica alcohol there and it tasted the EXACT same.

No one answered any of our questions regarding the show and completely misled and lied to us about whether we'd get in or not. I cannot believe how poorly planned this event was and how inattentive the staff was regarding everyone's questions. By not listening to the artist's demands that people under 21 and over 18 be let onto the list, it cost us from being let in and others were instead.

I'll expand by saying a male stage ""performer"" shaved his genitals on stage and ended his performance by pulling a dildo about two feet long from his rectum smeared in feces. Apparently this is the norm in this place. The crowd was equally revolting but they probably just think they're ""progressive"".

It's nice to know people..However, it's not so nice when these people continue to run a complete hole in the wall. Coming from a person who, unlike many of the sour reviewers below, was not rejected at the door, I still don't quite like this place Sure it's ""cool"" if you're someone who knows someone but do you need attention that bad? Lol, let's hope not. The owner is shitty; from the pretentious way which he carries himself, his bad taste in men, down to his cheap shoes. Unfortunately, his staff has started acting just like him; rather than bubbly bottle girls who should help you enjoy your night, they act like money hungry escorts who have no problem walking around with stank faces.When I first got there, I had the VIP table second from the front on the left. I didn't like it because we were a large party so we asked to be moved.  Being the only group with a billionaire present (yes, I said right)  I am sure it should not have even been a question WHY we wanted to move the table.. but I was asked by a bottle girl because again, that is the attitude of the staff.  Not cool. Again, you're here to accommodate us, darling.. do as we ask and we will gladly pay you.. well.  What you don't do is ask us dumb questions like, ""Why do you want to move your table?"" Umm because I don't like it. And because I said so!! Negatives: (hasn't this whole review been pretty negative thus far?)-- Kept having to ask bouncers to remove drunk girls from my section.-- Staff member asked if it was ok if Dave Chapelle sat with my party.  Really? Im asking for everyone around me to be removed.. and you really think I want to add him... Why? Get out of my face. -- I kept tripping over this shitty old rug underneath the couch and table.Positives:-- I was allowed to smoke cigarettes inside.-- I was able to use the employee stairwell to access the bathroom.--kitchen staff kept feeding me little snacks every time I went ""below."" It was very kind- I appreciate them very much.--kitchen was spotless and very clean!--chocolate covered strawberries are bombI honestly have mixed feelings for this place.  I wish it were owned by different people and they didn't allow such douchebags with hipster haircuts inside.  No one wants to hear about how you're trying to be a model- I live in LA, I hear enough about that, trust me. It's not a good look.Oh! The kitchen crew cooking the food downstairs, they deserve to be tipped better. They are real sweet people who make amazing food, especially hot fries and sauce. I mingled with them for a little when upstairs got too boring and I drew weary of seeing too much trans-gendered penis (not my idea of burlesque) on stage.Overall, The Box seems like a wacky, Moulin Rouge themed madhouse where performances are Coney Island worthy and attitudes of wait staff are quite fitting of New York. Beware when selecting the front VIP (long center-stage facing) couch on the floor. If you don't trip on the carpet while dancing, you may likely be spritzed  from a performers ass or vag secretion by nights end.... Unless you're into that kind of thing. yasssss",14,21,9

The other yelp reviews about the bouncer are 100% accurate. He is literally the rudest human I've ever dealt with. He's tiny, arrogant, and dressed to be cast as an extra for Grease the musical.Eventually after probably an hour of being ignored and treated terribly we left.

It's not really a club and it's not really a bar. The drinks are super over priced and the place is always very packed. When a ""burlesque"" show does go on the whole area is so crowded you can barely see anything. The best option is to buy a table but who would seriously do that without planning for it? The shows last a few minutes and to be honest I've been to far better burlesque shows. The tables are seats are all old, dirty, and sometimes broken. There's also always a line trying to get in! I don't see the appeal at all. I hate waiting in any line and if there's ever a line I honestly just leave. My friends really wanted to check this place out so after 2 minutes of waiting in line and me complaining to go to another place they ended up paying the bouncer to let us in... really?

76,P H.,"Riverside, CA",0,62,2,5.0,4/3/2015,"I have to say, this place sounds like a first class shithole.I have some blockbuster news for you folks, if you like seeing people do things with their assholes and getting pissed on, you are, by definition, a toilet.Except my toilet only cost $200, delivered, and is far less trouble to deal with.Oh, I know, you have a burning desire to be ""trendy"" and see ""Alternative Art"" so you can share the experience with your douchebag, self absorbed out-of-touch friends.Just so you know, ""art"" does require at least some sort of talent.  Peeing and cramming things in your mudwhistle requires no talent.  Doing freaky sexual things to yourself and others rarely requires talent.Another thing, there's no need to spend hundreds/thousands of dollars just to watch freaky shit.  The internet is a bountiful source for all things you wish you could unsee.But it isn't live!  If you absolutely must have a live performance, I suggest you come to Los Angeles, where such things can be seen daily, usually on your way to work.  In fact, one can go to the beach and see all manner of horrible.  Live!  And there are people who are perfectly happy to pee on you for free.Of course, you won't be surrounded by morons who pay through the nose to be treated like shit, so there's that.  You also won't get that fleeting, phoney feeling of being someone special when you get admitted but others don't.  No doubt this will be a huge turn-off for those of you who are shallow enough to think these things matter.I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I wish I could give 500.  Why?  Because in true American fashion, they have found a nitch.  They found a way to empty the wallets of a bunch of pretentious moronic douchebags, treat them like toilets, put on ""exotic"" shows that would make any Californian or German yawn, and have them coming back for more.  Brilliant!Who says there are no jobs in this country?",27,48,14

78,Blake P.,"Brooklyn, NY",113,5,0,1.0,12/15/2017,"I've lived in NYC for 9 years and worked on the lower east side as a bartender for 4 of those. I've been to the box 3 times and each time I've walked away feeling like this is the kind of place that capitalizes on the feeling of exclusivity without providing a service that is exclusive. Tonight I arrived for a work party and attempted to order a drink. The bartender asked me what I wanted and when I ordered she responded ""the open bar is over"" and walked away and left me waiting for 15 minutes during shift change. I didn't ask for a free drink. When the new bartender arrived I complained and his response was ""if it makes you feel any better she's fired for the evening"" like that was cute. The makers and soda he gave me after was $18 and provided with no apologies. This place expects to stay busy because it makes you feel like you can't get what it offers anywhere else but it offers the same thing you can get 15 minutes into Brooklyn for $10 less per drink and with friendly service that doesn't pretend to be queer but actually IS queer. I rarely complain about businesses but I want this place to go under with all of my heart. I've never had a good experience there.",,1,

There was a contortionist who couldn't have been anything less than world class. The tedious bit is all the forced and arbitrary exclusivity. There were people paying thousands to sit at VIP tables who never turned to watch the show,",4,1,1

A host at the door asked what brought us there, so I told him about my friends birthday. He asked  if we had reservations and I said we didn't. He literally turned his back at us saying ""there is nothing to talk about"" and went away. I've been all over the world and lived in several countries, having friends coming to NYC all the time, and I've never had an experience like this before. How can you treat a customer like this especially when one has a birthday?!?!?P.S. We definitely can pass the face control and can afford going to any club.",6,1,
87,Nile N.,"West Hollywood, CA",4,8,0,1.0,2/10/2017,"The absolute worst! No idea about show because we never got in! We are visiting NYC from Los Angeles. We booked a table with a minimum spend of 700.00! When we arrived it was 25 degrees and snowing. We went to front and informed them we had a table reservation. They ignored us for the first 10 minutes. Finally the door man with the biggest attitude I have ever seen looked up our name in his IPhone. I saw that our name was in his list of reservation. He then disappeared back inside. 10 minutes later he came back out and acted like we were not there. When I said whats going on we should not have to wait we have a reservation he answered THATS NICE and let everyone else in line into club. He would not look at us and acted like we were not there. Floored and aggravated we left. We are now going to have to fight the charge for the table. Makes no sense to me. Maybe that's how they are in NY, no idea but this was one of the most frustrating and strangest things that have ever happened. It's sad in NY for two days and this is how first night ended up. I am speechless. I guess in NY having a table reservation and leaving a credit card means your ignored made to wait in the snow for 40 minutes and never even get in. Really shameful.",6,,

89,Lilly S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/7/2016,"This place is simply terrible in so many ways.The Show: Now, I sat in the front row of the stage and the last act is literally this tranny taking a shit on stage for like 5 minutes.  I am not exaggerating.  This ""performer"" took a giant poop like ten feet away from my face and then smeared it all over himself.  There was even poop left on the stage floor (which people then proceeded to dance over after the performance ended).  And when he was finally done taking a giant shit, they led him off stage straight past me covered in shit.  It was seriously one of the least pleasant experiences of my life.  I had to cower behind my date because I was afraid the performer would like reach out and smear some on me because this place is unpredictable and disrespectful of its patrons.You Might Get a Disease: I honestly think they need to be shut down for health concerns. Besides this poop incident, there have been other times when people ejaculate on to the audience and spray all types of bodily fluids.  I seriously think that you should not sit in the front unless you are comfortable possibly catching some gross std from its twisted performers.  And if you aren't in the first few rows you can't see anything at all anyway.  So take your pick.It's true that the bouncers are COMPLETE assholes, even to me, who is a super attractive female who gets in everywhere, and even then, the only reason I got in was because my date knew the owner.Anyways, this is not the type of night out you want. There were a few cool performers that did crazy unexpected shit, like twirl around on roller skates while spinning his partner around him just by her feet, and then by her head.Overall, this is an establishment that has no respect for its patrons and relies on shock value for entertainment.  This is literally the club equivalent of a couple that has terrible sex but does tons of taboo shit to make themselves feel avant garde.",12,8,
90,Claudia H.,"Verona, VA",83,226,19,5.0,4/14/2015,"The negative reviews are hilarious! Definetely written by people who didn't get in or by people who didn't get a VIP table. To have a great time you have to get a VIP table, you can't just get in because you are hot or have lots of money, you have to know someone or be someone. That's the point people!I got in by the graces of my friend who had connections. It was my first time there and probably be the last since well I'm nobody. The table was $3,000 plus tip and $2,000 bottle service minimum. If you don't think its worth it then don't go! If you don't have a table you will stand in the back, get ignored by staff, and barely be able to see the show. No you won't get put in VIP because you think you're hot.I felt so incredibly privilaged to be get this opportunity to see such an amazing, magical, creepy, burlesque, freak show! Our cocktail waitress was amazing making sure we never had to pour our own drinks, making us dance, introducing us to the other people in VIP, and getting us involved in the show. She was a gorgeous blond with a sparkly blue dress. I won't give away what makes this place one of a kind as far as the show. But all the performers had more than appealing bodies, extreme talent, some super freaky, and shocking acts. Get there around 1145PM if you have a reservation since you don't sit until 12AM. The show starts around 1AM. Definetely stay until 5AM to dance, mingle, and meet some of the performers. Also saw a few celebrities on the balcony there.They're not kidding when they say anything goes!",3,5,3

You think it's a girl, it's a guy.  You think it's a guy, it's a girl.  Are those people having sex on stage?  Is that guy prescribing copious amounts of substance abuse to the masses?  Love it, very NYC.As others have said, know that it is a difficult place to get into, so be patient, pay, come early or get to know someone.  Enjoy the trip.",10,4,6

The second was a male and female pair of fire eaters who wore little to the imagination. They acted quite naughty towards each other and put on a great show. The third act involved a clown. The clown came out wearing a diaper and a leather jacket. The clown was drinking a bottle of what appeared to be whiskey. The clown then took off the jacket to reveal they had breasts. Then took off the diaper to reveal they had a penis. The transsexual clown then proceeded to urinate on the people in the front. Interesting to say the least. The decor inside was beautiful. Girls swinging from chandeliers. Great time.It's a once in a lifetime experience, I think everyone should do. It's real hard to get in so don't expect to just show up and be allowed in. You either got to drop serious cash, come at the right time or know someone. The drinks are also really expensive. If you think $15 dollar drinks are expensive, you know nothing about this place.",16,6,6

Drinks are insanely expensive, which is fine, but the experience feels cheap and desperate when the bartender circles the 20% suggested gratuity on the receipt.  Show is interesting but not worth the drama if you're not absolutely DYING to see a freak show / something different in NYC.",5,,

98,Heather C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",323,407,165,5.0,12/6/2014,"I think what this place has turned into is another club with a Studio 54 Vibe at the door and the vibe continues on the inside after midnight or so. This was my second time being there, and all I can say is each and every main show on the stage was different each time I went.This is like walking into a David Lynch film and witnessing an American horror story freak show, show. So, of course I LOVED the vibe.  It's out of this world. Think David Bowie, meets Elton John (before Disney) Meets David Lynch ALA Twin Peaks, meets Studio 54.My friend made a joke about how our drinks / bottle ONLY came to about $1, 400.00 but I was not sure if he was serious. He was actually acting like it was a good deal, being a private kind of club scene and all and there, right next to us was Mr. Wolves of Wallstreet.  For his privacy, I won't mention his name, but let's just say that he was laughing and having the best time, right along with everyone else.  You have to go in with an open mind, and expect NOTHING.  This way, everything you see, will be a huge surprise, because each night is completely different. I love Cirque performers and the shows they put on, and this place was a jaw dropping ...Beautiful bends and twists.  There are a few acts where you will hear yourself saying aloud....""OH MY GERD!!!  did they just do THAT?""?  Yes, it's that kind of place.  So of course, I was right in heaven.  I'm not going to give away spoilers of the great performers I saw, the beautiful fun costumes or even how the vibe in this place feels like you would see the owner Steve from Studio 54 peeking out over the DJ booth (I've heard from older friends that, that's what he used to do. Just smile down upon his 'Party'.)So Go. Just Goooooooooooooooo and don't look back. You're life will never be the same and think of all the stories you can tell your friends about this place and the things you saw, and think of all the stories you will be able to tell your grandchildren. I do suggest NOT dressing like a frumpy sow. Ladies, class it up a bit and wear some make-up and maybe some heels and do your hair. Don't expect to be allowed in wearing your yoga pants, your Birkenstock's combined with the infamous NYC faux Pas  ""Sex and the City 'scrunchie' .......that Burger wrote about, in an episode of that show. No no no no.  Also do not expect to be let into a night club wearing a t-shirt and low to your knees baggy ass  jeans. I'm sorry, but the nights I was there, NO ONE was wearing t-shirts, jeans or hats. The crowd was from every walk of life and all races, but they were dressed as if they actually spent some time choosing an outfit to go out on the town. Hair and clothing represented a 'night on the town'.   Because of the high demand to get into this club- the owner has a right to be selective about who he lets in.  There's no excuse for butt-head behavior at the front door, but some people just can not take the word 'NO' for an answer.  What they should do- is simply say ""I'm sorry but we're all booked for this evening""  not 'get lost' with the hand gesture to shoo away.  That's just rude.  Even at 54 there were no verbal insults at the rope, because I know of so many older people who actually went to Studio 54 (not just saw the movie like myself) and they said a simple shake of the head no, with eye contact was all that was needed. Then one was ignored.  There's no place for verbal abuse and degradation. It's just not good for the soul.  However, that being said, if you pay for a bottle and a table, there should be no attitude with you at the door.   Everyone IS the same, but that does not mean one can show up looking like a slob or some baggy jeaned , boxers hanging out hip hop hooray hooligan.  Dress nice and dress classy. That's all this club probably wants.  Inside is where the sloppy begins, not outside in front of the door. Just GO!  You won't regret it.",10,9,4
99,Zoe L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,4.0,9/19/2016,"It's so funny reading all these butthurt reviews about not being able to get in and the place being too pricey. I went with friends and had the BEST GODDAMNED TIME. The acts were varied and ranged from beautiful arial work to pseudo BDSM stuff to wtf-omg-my-jaw-has-dropped-to-the-floor-I-can't-believe-what's-happening-in-front-of-my-eyes. Though the acts change every week of so, keep in mind the show is not for the light of heart. Yeah, there may be bodily fluids, and yeah Ms. Rose Wood's performance is.... unexpected to say the least, but it's a fantastic place to go when you want to see something that would make a suburban Christian mom want to pray for your eternal soul. It's the place to go when you want to chuck the taboos and inhibitions of polite society out the window and over a cliff. If you don't want to see a girl fuck a Donald Trump doll 'till she squirts, that's up to you.Oh and be warned of the ""Splash Zone"" which is the chairs and benches directly in front of the stage. Try sitting in a side table to avoid... fluids.",,,
100,K. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",197,11,3,1.0,12/14/2016,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Whoever runs the door here should be fired. Not only did they let rowdy drunk guys who were obviously his friends in but he made inappropriate comments to the women in front of us stating that they weren't welcome there. They stated multiple times their willingness to spend money on bottle service (like seriously what a fucking idiot, if I was the owner I would be pissed). But this was no good to the pig of a host who even went as far as stating he didn't want their business. What did these women do wrong? Nothing. This was probably the most disgusting way to handle business I've ever witnessed. He made misogynistic comments toward these women as well as refuse them entry. I felt so sick by this display that I left immediately. Who in their right mind hired this person to be on the door. I would never ever set foot in here. Not even if you paid me.

101,Subilak K.,"Little Falls, NJ",27,55,92,1.0,12/31/2016,"Probably the worst experience going out in the city this year. First of all even though despite the fact we had a reservation made at least a week in advance we were still made to wait outside on line for over half an hour. The rude door staff and security were brutish and were letting people in ahead of us who were tipping them what seemed to be at least $100. Very unprofessional. When we finally got inside the place was quite packed and we  had to fight our way to follow the host to a table on the second floor which was very cramped and by the time we sat down and removed our coats, two separate patrons and knocked into the table. We all ordered drinks which came but with a almost nasty request from the waitress to ""purchase some type of bottle or your going to have to go downstairs and stand for the rest of the evening."" Now I dine and go out a lot and don't mind paying the price for decent wine and food but the list she gave us has basically bum juice starting at $490 a bottle with your average champagnes and Liquors that you can buy in a regular club for 40-120 being priced at 600-1800.  Overall it seems this place was likely once a hotspot on the artisan circuit but has become something quite undesirable.",5,,

This place is the epitome of what a NYC club is and should be. Ok, door is strict - - -NYC is notorious for their strict door policies to maintain exclusivity of a venue, especially when it's such a small venue as this one. NYC is not your Vegas with it's ginormous clubs that let anyone in with a prepaid ticket or bottle purchase; it's also not your Cali with dingy little bars and clubs with no face control that shut down at 2 AM; nor is it your Miami with half-naked girls running around. In one word, I would describe this place as ""posh."" The ambiance is perfect, the drinks were strong, and the show was ridiculous. It's everything I had imagined and more. I loved the decor, with tons of mirrors at every angle you turn, chic chandeliers, and swanky lights. The music started off as deep house for more of a lounge feel and then became hip hop --- perfection! And there was something about the smell of matches and the candle lighting that really completed the whole ""feel"" of the place.I strongly recommend getting bottle service though.

I get that I'm in New York, but seriously? Le sigh...Besides that absolutely astronomical cost of libations, The Box is a great little change of pace to the usual bar and restaurant routine in NYC. By no means is this a secret lair, so most anyone in LES knows what to expect when sauntering through their front doors. It's dinner theater with antics that will blow you away, so you sort of have to pretend you're paying for a ticket to Cirque du _____ (insert production). Strangely, the performance I witnessed was almost worth the triple-figure round of rotgut. Certainly a place I'd come back to if the time were right.

112,Dee M.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,22,0,1.0,4/5/2017,"I have never been treated so disrespectfully anywhere else in my life than this place. We were in the area for dinner so decided to Google where to go to drink and dance. I was here on the night of my birthday - a Friday night. The bouncers treated us like dirt on their shoe. We waited at the top of the line for over an hour in the freezing cold, the bouncer knew we were there for my birthday, even still we stood outside for longer, while we watched TONS of people stroll in who either paid the bouncer off or knew them. When I politely asked several times how long it might be, or why other people were let in ahead of us I was greeted with nasty silence and a look up and down. They almost ruined my birthday night until we had an amazing night in a bar down the road. I would literally NEVER recommend this place unless you are in to scene-y bars where the bouncers play God. If you're not going to let people in fairly, then you should have the decency to let them know there is a possibility of that happening. Just the worst.",6,,
113,Laura M.,"ASTORIA, NY",285,107,84,2.0,6/29/2015,Not nearly as exciting as everyone made it out to be.  Drinks are way overpriced.  $19 for a vodka/soda?  Give me a break.  You're not that special.,9,1,1

115,A G.,"Manhattan, NY",32,203,49,4.0,1/5/2014,"Like this place a lot. Ppl need to realize its a show and you have to pay to get in. You don't walk up to a theater and be like ""hey let me in for free"" so this isn't any different. Great crowd. Great acts. Drinks are obviously overpriced $19 for a vodka soda. They should really add a mixology component to the place, I think that would add a lot. My other complaint (not their fault) is that you're usually too f*cked up by the time the acts start (~1:30am) to enjoy them or know what's going on.",5,8,2
116,Paul S.,"New York, NY",31,60,8,3.0,9/2/2013,"So, I want to be much more clear than most of the reviewers of this place that I looked at prior to coming.  There is a very solid chance that during one or more of the 3 shows that go on between 1am and 3:30am you will see penis, breasts (sometimes on the same person),  vaginas and sex between men, women, and genders in between.  Now it is not Caligula at least I did not see any animals on stage... there was an alleged Leonardo DiCaprio sighting however.  Word of warning, do not sit in the front row or what I call the splash zone ;o)For the most part it is all in fun and the vibe is very cool.  The singing and legitimate dancing and rope / pole work are very well done.  There are some things that make you shake your head and seem to be clearly done for shock value.  I won't spoil it for anyone but you'll know those moments when you see them.  When the show is not going on it is a nice spot with good music and drinks.  Bring lots of money or bring someone who has it because these folks are reinventing the words mark-up and with absolutely no remorse about it whatsoever.  I can't say that this will be a regular habit for me but everyone should check this ""Box"" at least once.",16,10,3
117,Wendy V.,"Chicago, IL",11,64,0,2.0,7/1/2013,"We made a reservation for bottle service, one bottle (at a min of $600 btw), and we were told that would get us  reserved ""seats at the bar"". Having never been to the place, I assumed the bar was in view of the stage and that our seats would be looked after should we decide to get up and wander.  Wrong and wrong. We got in the door no problem, the hostess marched us to the bar, handed us the bottle menu and left us. The bartender looked at me like I was speaking in tongues when I asked her where our seats were...she pointed to two seats at the end of the bar with no view of the stage. When I asked her if she would ensure our seats would stay reserved if we got up to walk across the room to see the show, she said ""I'll do my best."" K. So for almost $800, you get barstools that I almost got into a fight over when a lovely gem of a gal told me after I got back from the bathroom that it was now HER stool, no offer of mixers besides cranberry juice and soda for my bottle, no view of the stage, and feeling like I had to genuflect every time I asked the bartender for more booze from OUR BOTTLE.   Oh and let's not forget the added 20% tip. Totally.Lets talk about the ""show"".  One very olde time burlesque erotic act, followed by extended hiatuses where drunk patrons were on the stage dancing. DJ was good, ill give em that. There were a total of about  I dunno, 5 acts over the course of 5 hours, and guess what... I couldn't see any of them, except for the swinging trapeze artist over the bar-- actually, I take that back, I could see about 30% of the stage as reflected in the mirror over the shoulders of some of the pushiest rudest people I've been around. I mean literally shoulder checking each other to get a view of the stage.  Use your words, people. There was one act that is for pure shock value, I won't reveal it, but it certainly was not worth the 5 hours and $$$. Upstairs is off limits. Don't know how you get up there but some of the other reviews made it sound like you could wander up there--wrong. Again, bottle service without a table gets you jack shit. Purported Dress code and cell phone rules: despite the numerous yelp reviews (dubious in nature IMO), there were people using their phones all night, everywhere and even taking pictures with flash. And the rumored dress code...? Uh, high tops, skinny jeans, cut off tanks, baseball hats, tshirts with sleeves cut off, there is no F'ing dress code.Unless you want to drop a min of $1600 and get a table, the barstool reservation is a sham, just go to forever 21, buy the entire look off of a mannequin and buy individual cocktails.

Well, these places actually exsist, and they exsist in The Box nbc.com/saturday-night-l… I hear the box is great on Tuesdays, however I went last night (Thursday) and had an amazing time. Surrounded by an attractive, outgoing and young crowd, The Box possesses a sort of taboo ""naughtiness"" that is only allowed in nightmares- ah I mean dreams.Go here with an open mind, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Think night club lounge meets burlesque show, mixed with a little bit of sideshow circus. Effing unbelievable. It's so weird and messed up that it's genius.Try to get a table down front (there are 2 levels of tables), preferably the ones with the couches. The hostess usually interacts with these tables and will pull you on stage,....or pee on you (....seriously, watch out for urine).There are 4 sets of shows, 1am, 2am 3am and 4am. Each show progressively becomes more and more bizarre, and more and more ""WHAT!? OMG EWWW WHAT!? I CAN'T WATCH! WHY AM I WATCHING!?!? OMG!!!"" Stay for the last show, take the following day off and allow yourself to get wild with all the others dancing on the couches around you. Good music, good fun and absolutely no morality.

120,Dave G.,"New York, NY",55,233,0,2.0,12/20/2014,"The place itself was very unique. Cabaret show was entertaining and a little racy. Found the place to be way to warm and was sweating towards the end. Unfortunately, the reason why I gave this place such a low rating is that they scam you big time for drinks. Ordered 2 vodka sodas for my friend and I from the bar upstairs. Was expecting speed rack liquor since that was what I asked for...wasn't paying attention and noticed she was pouring Belvedere vodka into the 2nd drink...probably the highest premium they sell. I said whatever, how much more could it be...ahhh how wrong I was...19$ per drink! Ok fine, it's NYC and some places can charge these ridiculous amounts. problem was, when I gave my credit card and received the bill, it looked like every other standard check I've ever gotten. Found out the next day, they AUTOMATICALLY add 20% to your drink tab!! And the normal line for tips says, ""additional tip""!! Normally I would see this, but they keep this place so dark, you don't see it! So I ended up tipping an additional 2$ and ended up tipping her almost 10$ and spent 46$ for 2 vodka sodas...total scam!! My advice...buy beer...they were only 7$, and pay cash!! Just went to the website where they post this...A 'show fee' in the amount of 20% of your food & beverage costs will be added to your bill. This Show Fee is NOT a gratuity & is not distributed to the service staff as a gratuity. Rather, all service team members are paid a direct wage that is at least equal to the minimum wage. Tipping is not required or expected. The show fee is used to offset operational costs associated with the performances staged at The Box.What a joke...it says right on the receipt below this bogus charge, ""ADDITIONAL GRATUITY"". Therefore, it IS a gratuity! And they bang you a 23$ ticket fee...wouldn't that offset operational costs??",,,

I always love me some fine entertainment, and this place definitely provides.I will warn you, however, that most of the acts are reminiscent of a raunchy Cirque du Soleil I never saw. All the performers, however, have some real talent. The last time I went, a Jimi Hendrix look-alike in a white LED lit bellbottom pantsuit did a tap number in the dark.

130,Danny S.,"Brooklyn, NY",567,1,0,1.0,1/29/2016,"I hope this place burns to the ground!  As a native New Yorker who frequents many bars and clubs, I was shocked by my experience here.  I came to see a performance by Amanda Lepore and stayed to witness a few other shows, one of which showed a man depicted as Hitler (in full garb) taking over the world, accompanied by dancers wearing bras donning swastikas.  At the shows conclusion, the emcee shouted ""I want to ride Hitler's mustache"" and ""I think Hitler's mustache is sexy and I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks!"" I'm shocked that they would allow such a performance, on the day after Holocaust Remembrance Day no less!  I approached a bartender, expressed my distaste at the performance, and requested to speak to a manager.  He went to look for a manager and returned assuring me that ""Alex"" would be with me shortly.  15 minutes pass, and a second attempt to ask him results in him ignoring me altogether.  I then asked a different bartender, and he said nothing could be done and that I was being a killjoy.  After that I asked the host who was standing by the entrance to speak with a manager and she said something to the affect of ""we offend everyone.""  I was left dissatisfied with the feedback, and not even one employee apologized on behalf of the club.  I was treated as if I was the one with the problem.  How dare I not be ok with the Holocaust being made a mockery of!  Never did I think I would witness such a brazen public display of antisemitism in a New York City club.  While The Box is notorious for it's risque performances, allowing a show that made a mockery of a very real and tragic moment in history was, at best, in poor taste.  There is a fine line between artistic and outright offensive. I will never come here again, and urge you strongly against doing so.  If none of the above offends you, just know that the drinks are overpriced, even by NYC standards ($19 for a mixed drink?!?!?), the staff are rude, the people are awful, and the place is hot and crowded.  I can't think of a more highly overrated venue in NYC.  There are so many other better places to enjoy your night.  You've been warned.",5,,

134,Dan S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,4/25/2014,"I went with a female friend of mine on a Thursday night around midnight. We were both reasonably well dressed, I've heard this is important. We stood behind some people for roughly 10 minutes before the bouncer waived us over and asked for our ID's. We went in, no cover charge. This was without any connections of any sort. So...apparently getting through the front door isn't a tough as you might believe. We didn't even say a word to the bouncer or the doorman. This might have been the key, don't annoy these people. They were even relatively polite.So....the door is probably the most annoying part of The Box, once you're through with that drama, it's pretty much a good time.I mean, I'm giving it 5 stars assuming you are aware that The Box is essentially a night club. If you don't have table service, or a friend with table service, or befriend someone with table service, you are not going to be able to sit down! But...again....if you've been to a club before, you should be well aware this fact.A lot of reviews discuss the prices....the concerns seem somewhat overblown. At the bar, we paid $8 for bottles of Stella and $18 for a Belvedere and soda. Both were a bit steep, but neither outside the realm of reason. There was a suggested 20% gratuity added, but it appeared you could remove it if you wanted. Also, the bartenders were quite responsive, I never really struggled to get a drink and didn't even struggle to get my bill at the end of the night. And that's it for the bar.The crowd, not sure how to say this politely, but the foreign population was heavily represented. Both men and women were relatively attractive and well dressed. They seem to have nearly as many bottle service girls as they do patrons and these girls seem like they spend most of their time hanging out at the bottle service tables. I guess I liked the crowd, save for a few rude members who thought standing directly in front of us while watching the show was a great idea. But every nightclub I've ever been to has its fair share of A-holes.The show, it's outrageous! The hype, however, might be a touch overstated. The acts are raunchy and often inappropriate, but ultimately relatively brief and approach the line of inappropriate with out ever actually crossing it. The show really is pretty close to one of a kind. It is mostly a combination of shock and comedy routines with a sexual component. BTW, it is not the same show 3 times over the night, it is actually three acts. So...if you really want to get the whole Box show, expect to stay up all night.I would definitely return to The Box. I happen to know that bottle service will run close to $700 a bottle all said and done and, for the right occasion, probably worth considering, if you are comparing it versus other night clubs and with a relatively large party.",,,

138,Therran O.,"Manhattan, NY",34,34,1,4.0,8/6/2012,"This place is exactly what you expect, plus more. All of the other reviewers are correct, it is very exclusive and you need to know someone to get in. It's expensive but you get a show and there're no tickets. So, in the end it's not really that horrible. Luckily, someone in my party knew the doorman...or maybe it was my linen outfit? Nah! Anyway, I hadn't even heard of the place until that morning. However, I felt I had a good idea of what to expect.On to the depravity. First, the inside of the place is vaudevillian meets recently abandoned theatre in a horror movie. So put yourself in that mind frame. Once you get in, you're greeted by a bunch of people that have been out all night and are in the mood to party - cue the dancing and general revelry. Then, performers start showing up. These people look crazy in their street clothes. But, they're surprisingly friendly if you engage with them properly.My crew was going to get a table but decided against it. I'm actually glad we did. Being amongst the crowd was awesome. We met people and had an opportunity to cut loose with the masses.  Then, the show began. We saw some wild stuff. Little people having (what I think was) fake sex in a strange act; cirque du soleil over the bar; he/she action; a singer; a little naked blasphemy, strange things with dildos and butt beads...yeah use your imagination or just go!

143,Justin A.,"Brooklyn, NY",469,10,4,3.0,1/16/2014,"I have mixed feelings on this place..  I'll start with what I loved about it: The performances are out of this world. Some very talented (and very sexy) acrobats engaging in a kind of mating ritual / the MC was hysterical and a great singer / aerialist circus performance above the bar / theatrical sadomasochistic lesbian duo etc...All very talented and exciting. Also, the sound system and the lighting are absolutely top notch.  They really do a good job of transporting you to another reality as soon as you walk in the door.The doorman / hard to get in / waiting in line / bad attitude kind of throw the vibe off for me personally though.

The only thing going for this place is the show which is mostly just T & A and a few low end performers spinning around or singing on stage. Tacky and low end.  Is it worth dishing out thousands for bottle service? No way. The show here hasn't changed in years. I would rather go to see Sleep No More and sit at the amazing bar on the roof or inside. The cocktails are professionally made mixology quality and the people aren't rude and snobby.  You could choose any number of places in the city. Why did I stop by here? To show an out of town friend but for locals there are better places.I used to go to The Box back in the day but these days the guys at the front door are extremely rude and all they want are people buying tables. It's constantly a ""Private party"" inside. That is code for ""We want to sell tables."" Last night the door man told me I wasn't getting in and to get lost. He wagged his hand at me in a shoo away gesture which was intensely offensive.  I'm not even an unattractive girl and it seems like all they want inside is money or models.  Enjoy your power hungry ego trips, boys because I'm going home to my Mercedes and your enjoying your minimum wage job ruling a doorway.",15,6,7

I am surprised i got in...being a hippie type person- but i was witht he right people.   It is small with a southern/new orleans style of architecture (though I am no architect- but it reminds me of NOLA).  There are tables and a dance floor, and an upstairs to do whatever you want.  This is a very liberal place...so if you are easily offended by sex,drugs and language...don't go.  The bar is super expensive...i spent $30 for 1 drink...and $100 for 4 shots of decent alcohol.  I like top shelf  ....so get liquored up prior to coming.  And a table cost roughly $3000...so prepare to stand!Now the performances are mostly amazing burlesque style.  The performers the night i went were excellent.  Except one act i was very offended with, but at least i wasnt in the range to get hit by..what appeared to be a she-male peeing.  I would display pictures of the place, but they dont allow cameras.  Even though i have some pics, out of respect for the establishment, i will not post and just keep these private.I enjoyed the clientèle too... a nice cross section of the underbelly and weirdness of the new york city.  I highly recommend going there if you can.  Even just once, you'll understand why this place is a must see place to be.However, I don't think i need to go again, unless I know I am getting in.- MSZ",3,1,2
147,Sarah Rachael W.,"Manhattan, NY",180,100,106,4.0,7/10/2012,"The Box... where do you begin? Similar to other reviews I've read, The Box is the sort of place you have on your Life List. I knew I needed to go, I just don't know if I need to go back. I would never have been able to get in had I not known a promoter. With that being said, I got in past a line and a velvet rope with no problem; major confidence booster. As soon as we entered the club, we had to pass another check-point to get upstairs. We made our way to stage right and were dangling right over the performers.The first act wasn't announced by the MC, so he seemed to have some trouble clearing the stage from drunkards. Once the MC appeared I saw a handful of acts; a woman hanging in a Cirqu-du-soleil type hammock in her panties, a genetic male with implants spurting blood and liquor from his mouth (who later peed on the audience - fake urine I presume), a woman who removed something (a fetus?) from her lady-bits and then bit into it (yes, folks, full frontal), and an impressive magic duo.Honestly, at 25 years old, and someone who thinks of herself as very liberal, I was still shocked at some of the acts. The show doesn't move that quickly, but perhaps if you are drunker than I it does. The venue encourages drugs and drinks, so feel free to do what you wish, carefully.Overall it was a night to remember for sure.The space is small and unique. Go with no expectations and full pockets and you'll have a good time.",4,4,2
148,Ellen C.,"Manhattan, NY",30,103,5,5.0,6/15/2014,"I had an amazing night at The Box for my bachelorette party. The staff was accommodating and two bartenders were so sweet. The show starts around 1am but by then many people (including myself) are too inebriated to realize what's going on, it's as if you're having some sort of strange dream. The crowd is diverse and hip, good looking. I would definitely recommend going to The Box if you're looking for an experience MUCH more exciting than your average nightclub. Good music, good entertainment, and an unforgettable night to remember! It's hard to get in without a rsvp or knowing someone but well worth trying and spending the $$$$$",5,2,4

Which by the way its where you should go if you are looking for a fantastic, sensual experience and great food. While I understand the doorman culture and I am either intimidated or sensitive of their posturing. I was however taken aback by a little dweeb with a Napoleonic syndrome that right off the bat had a chip on his shoulder and a rude condescending attitude even to the people that he was letting in. I was there well dressed, with my wife a fitness queen considered beautiful by most, ready to spend money. instead this microbe approaches us and not only dismisses us entirely but has one of the bouncers remove us from the sidewalk unto the street. We stood there dumbfounded and while we waited for our car, we saw similar action to several good looking well dressed couples.

I came here and was surprised even knowing it was going to be a freak show. Keep in mind that you will need to either A) know someone, B) be a hot girl, or C) be willing to drop A LOT of cash. The space is pretty tight, everything about it seems like it's been around for years. It has a really cool vaudeville/circus vibe inside. There's an aerial hoop artist swinging above the bar between shows. She was super flexible, the guys below definitely enjoyed the show. As you go towards the stage in the main room it gets crowded. I would suggest getting a table when coming here, and getting one upstairs. Of course that will probably mean spending a minimum of $1k though. I watched from below and it was packed and very hard to see the stage. The night I went.... there was a schoolgirl lap dance act, a yodeling little person  puppet duo, a contortionist/silk artist, and a man shaving his balls and flashing the audience with his breasts. Sooo yea. If you want a wild way to cap off an evening, come to The Box.One final note on the negative reviews.... Yes the doormen are assholes, that is a given at any hot spot in Manhattan. Saying management should ""fire them"" is laughable. They would just be happy to hear they're doing the job they hired them to do! The space inside is also very limited so they can't just let anyone in who is not buying a table. And finally, the drink prices are high, but when you factor in that you aren't paying a cover and seeing nudity/acrobatic acts, you are actually getting a pretty good deal for 20 bucks!",17,6,8

I was a bit disappointed after reading all the reviews that we got only the PG version (obviously, it was a work party), but would LOVE to go back and see a full show.  The bit we got involved a little strip tease, a pretty impressive aerialist, tap dancing, a jumprope crew, and a two headed lady. One head was where it should be, and the other head was between her legs... something that doesn't quite make sense until you see it, and then still leaves you wondering what the heck is going on. It's Burlesque meets Moulin Rouge meets Side Show Circus. The venue is small, cozy and intimate with lots of places to pull away and have a private conversation.

They said yes and walked right in.  She saw home dude standing 5'8 all insecure and me and my friend in louboutins and cocktail dresses up to 5'11 and said ""$580 if you want to buy a bottle"".  Ha.  Man she was a bitch too, unnecessarily so.Advice: dress upscale cocktail, but the good shit.....don't leave the Chanel at home, these people know their stuff and they are not friendly about it.So we were in at midnight, and the bottle of champagne was gone in 30 minutes.  We smooshed into the crowd to watch the first show, couldn't see a damn thing, bouncers were always yelling at me to move out of the aisle, girls were stepping on each other, the waitress was barking at everyone and spilling drinks (again unnecessarily) and it was hottttt.  I pressured my friend to ask her date to get us a table, apparently he was already on it.We found MALLORIE, a super cute bottle girl, who was happy to whisk us away to much nicer territory.  I didn't hear the convo but I know she said something to him like ""trust me, you don't want that empty table down here"", so upstairs to the balcony we went.  The table could squeeze 4 in true NYC fashion but in reality was just enough for the 3 of us to lean our heads over and see the whole show.I have no idea how much that table cost, or how much the bottles of champagne we drank cost, or how many we had.  We were there till 5 am, and she paraded bottle after bottle after bottle with sparklers in them (always a good idea to give drunk people fireworks) and our glasses were never empty.The show was absolutely insane.  I've greyed out, but I do remember Michael Jackson, aerial silks, a naked ballerina, a 70's foxy brown pulling dildos out of her fro....then pulling something out of her **** AND her *****, a tranny peeing on the front row, the MC giving a lap dance to the swedish guys in the front row that got peed on.....the rest is kinda fuzzy.The restrooms are just as sketch as the rest of the place, I remember something about a sex bathroom, a faint memory of me jumping on a stripper pole upstairs while my friends sat on the couch and watched, I took my shoes off (but the pearls stayed on) and my feet stuck to the floor, the velvet curtain surrounding us didn't quite hide the bj I'm pretty sure the girl at the table next to us was giving, and I remember having an intense conversation with the assistant director about....something.  I have no idea.Wow what a blast, I wish I could remember more.  And thank god it wasn't on my tab, I'm pretty sure the night set our friend-dude back 3k++.    Thanks man!",13,19,12

We had a private table upstairs on the Mezzanine and paid the price for it, which was a very expensive bottle (well over $500) of relatively standard vodka. The performances were very good - I have seen some that I would call their equal at a Montreal burlesque festival, but without the consistency. The problem came at the end when we, as two people, weren't about to finish the 40 pounder. We wanted to give the rest away, as is a relatively common practice in any Montreal supper club, but we WERE NOT allowed to. That's right, they treated us like we were in the process of shop lifting them, all with a polite smile on the face. So what did I do? I poured the bottle out into the ice bucket.

First the girl said we have to guarantee paying $250 (when it was already 2 am) in order to get in.  So we discussed among ourselfes if it made sense to pay because we were only plannig on going in for a night cap, maybe 2 drinks. While we were standing there thinking about it the doorman was extremely rude and told us to get the *** out of there. Again, no one else was on line. And the girl at the door was ignoring us as if we turned invisible eventhough we were going to pay the amount anyway.

176,Marlene D.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",231,138,113,4.0,1/7/2013,"Where do I begin with my review on The Box???First of all: The Box  is a venue like no other. It is located in such an inconspicuous place,  that you would almost wonder if this is a club when you arrive. There is no name to be seen on the outside, but there is the velvet rope, and the doormen.. You walk in, past the supposed 'hard door', and find yourself in a different world.  The styling is downright amazingly done. You really feel like you're back in the mid 1920's. The floral wallpaper, the lighting, the cabaret girl swinging in a dreamy way in a hoop above the bar, and all the other artists performing their provocative acts: It all makes sense in a bizarre way. Think of the movie Cabaret, but then add a lot of crack to it, or something psychedelic, such as whatever those people were on in Requiem for a Dream, and you figured out how crazy the acts get here. I am from Amsterdam, and even I have been quite shocked by some of the things I saw going on here. Think of people having erotic acts where they end up drinking one anothers' urine. Or a wasted transvestite, performing an abortion with a coat hanger on top of a toilet on stage. You know? 'Stuff like that'. Watching the shows you see here is kind of similar to discovering the porn of your parents. It's disturbing, appalling, disgusting, but yet: You want to see this. I cannot find any other way to describe how I felt watching all of this. I waited till I had been to this place 3 times before I wrote this, because I felt like that would only be fair in terms of my judgment about it. They've really toned down how extreme the acts are. In a way that it almost became morally and ethically okay again. Last time, they 'only' stripped till they were naked at the end of the act. The weird thing that I realized is that now l kind of miss the sick things that people used to do here on stage. Crazy, I know.....  Another thing: Don't be surprised if you're washing your hands next to a transvestite in the restroom, and don't assume that every person that looks like they are part of an act, are actual performers. I found that out in an embarrassing way, by asking a transvestite if (s)he was going to perform and he stated 'no'. (S)he asked me if his dress looked okay on him. I replied, blushing: 'Yes, that polka dot dress looks lovely on you.' The crowd is an inner circle, in vogue kind of New York scene. Enough cool and good looking people to please you, including some models. Not too many tourists, and pretty much zero B&T. The music was really good every time I went. Think house/top 40/ hip hop mixture. Good stuff. Combine all of the above with a good atmosphere, et voila: Le Box.-Key to having fun at The Box: Having a table. That is the ideal situation so you can actually watch the acts without binoculars or standing on your toes, which is what happens if you stick to the bar area. This place gets packed.-Key to getting into The Box: Arrive on time. I suggest 11.30 or midnight. This way you don't have to get into an over packed joint, and you can easily settle down and warm up for the shows which start around 1 or 1.30  AM, enjoy the music, and even dance a little. Nice touch that they hand out complimentary popcorn. Bottom Line:  I am a fan of the Box. Yup. : )",22,10,6

178,Amber K.,"Manhattan, NY",88,121,8,3.0,7/29/2013,"I had never heard of this place until I was called to be an extra in a video shoot, but apparently this place is a fairly popular underground bar/burlesque club where a lot of daring/scandalous avant-garde performances take place. It's got an awesome retro feel but also has no windows, which is harsh after being there a long period of time. I heard so many stories about this place that I'm kind of dying to check it out during its regular hours!",4,1,

Updated review","Haha joke, pretends to be fancy but it's not. I'm a party promoter and know parties in the city.... this is a no go! Do not waist your time going to stupid parties like this! No hurts feelings it's just one of the lamest party in manhattan!",1,1,

181,Iambic H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,1,1.0,11/20/2013,"Maybe this is still fun for tourists, but The Box lost its luster for me a few years ago.  Returned recently to discover their current staff to be far less professional and skilled (in terms of pouring drinks and delivering the proper bill) than they used to be.  Crowd was bad too.  There was a group of tacky, drunken 50 year old women in one booth.  It was like a scene from the Real Housewives of New Jersey.",2,,1
182,Elizabeth H.,"New York, NY",208,249,21,5.0,2/11/2011,"I decided that this is the only place I have ever not written or will ever not write explicitly about. I will say it is an amazing party in every way. But not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. When you go, keep your mind open and your legs closed. (unless you don't want to of course).",7,6,2
183,Jia J.,"New York, NY",2,33,3,2.0,3/3/2013,"Not worth it. $5000 for a booth which was reserved in advance was fumbled at the door, ugh...unprofessional!  When our party of 9 (8 ladies/1 guy) arrived the bouncers announced our group and then left us standing out in the freezing cold for 10 minutes. They actually attempted to check our IDs twice. Really? Once we got inside (at midnight) the place was empty yet we were lead to a cafe table for two, again REALLY? Instead of explaining to our obviously clueless hostess that this wasn't rocket science, we just took the initiative and found someone in charge who then sat us in the booth. Once at the table we order a magnum which was brought to us by three over dressed (not sexy in the least bit) women who were the most unenthusiastic bunch you'd ever lay your eyes on. It was kinda funny so we took photos of them holding sparklers while having faces that clearly say we hate our jobs. Our waitress was overzealous and kept filling extra glasses with liquor for people who already had drinks. I myself was holding a glass of champagne in one hand and my bag in the other hand while the waitress insisted on giving me a shot of patron from our bottle. One of the ladies in our party actually poured the extra drinks back into the bottles when the waitress stepped away. The show was was mediocre. We were looking to be mind blown by the show, but instead we watch former ravers with tacky wardrobes desperately seeking an ovation. The bathroom was gross and I only went once which was in the beginning of the night before the crowd. The crowd was not sexy except at my table and I'm really not just saying that. The crowd blended together and seemed bland, tired and washed-out. No favor, no uniqueness, no hotness, low energy and very few if any people of color, outside of the bouncers. I wanted to show my guests that NYC knows how to have a good time but instead they had an unexceptional time. They actually have seen better shows at Nikki Beach - Miami. Pros: The host of the show/singer was amazing! The bathroom attendant was amazing! The DJ was also pretty darn good!",5,3,4
184,Kate W.,"Danbury, CT",1,17,0,1.0,9/28/2016,"The worst experience I have ever encountered in NYC. We went for a friends birthday and had a group of 5. The bouncer was so incredibly rude and doesn't even treat you as a human being. We got there early to see ""the show"" but by the time performers come out, the stage is so small, and all of the people that get table service are surrounding what there is of a stage. If you get to close bouncers will literally push you until you fall. When I went to the bar to ask if we could purchase table seating I was led to the front where they told me a gentleman would help. The man told me very rudely to wait until he was free. Meanwhile he stands there talking to a friend. After 15 minutes of standing outside waiting to talk to him, I say ""excuse me"" and he turns around and screams ""didn't I tell you to wait!"" After this we left and will never be back! Not to mention girls can't go into the men's room but men are ALLOWED to use the ladies room, very bizarre!",,,
185,Bo C.,"Manhattan, NY",11,6,0,3.0,5/5/2011,"The Box... really? I'm not sure what all the hype was all about - I spent 6 years in Bangkok so I'm used to seeing Transvestite and Freak Shows. I remember one time my ex convinced us to go watch the Ping Pong show in Patpong - now that was some freaky mindf*ck stuff. The Box - I was expecting some really crazy off the wall based on all the huff & puff. The shows were entertaining but nothing super shocking except for the part where Dwight Howard sized Transvestite took a piss on all the expensive tables upfront. Luckily, our table was on the side and avoided the golden shower. Music wasn't anything special. Top 40 - Put it down one me~~ type. The shows start @ 1am and 3am - the door is pretty pretentious. Crowd inside is rather chill - no jersey shore fist pumpers. I give it a 3 stars for average shock factor.",3,4,2
186,Lucia F.,"Shirley, NY",38,251,70,1.0,10/17/2010,"My fiance and I tried this place after me begging/talking about it for months. I really wanted to see what the hype was all about. We were up next to get in by the rope and finally caught someone's attention. Young dude, with a clipboard in hand, and a douchebag mustache that was growing down to his chin, comes up and asks who we are with. I said it's just the two of us -- my fiance and I had just celebrated our anniversary at 21 Club so we were both very dressed up, him in a suit, me beautiful - so I didn't think we'd have a problem getting in. ""You have two options - buy a bottle or pay $100 each to get in"" --- I understand the exclusivity at places in NYC but I couldn't grasp how he was saying all this with a straight face. So we left and I burst out laughin in the middle of the street. I am not sorry we did not go in, but at least I've gotten it out of my system. From what I've read here, the acts are the same you get to see at the $5 cover Slipper Room.",12,9,7
187,Jennifer K.,"Long Beach, NY",125,11,0,5.0,12/30/2012,"Where to begin?? The best way to sum it up is if Tarantino directed a really effed up version on Moulin Rouge.  I came here Saturday, 12/30 for a friend's birthday. I honestly had no idea what to expect. I thought it would be ""clubby"" (not really my scene) and pretentious. I was so wrong. This place was amazing and unlike anywhere I've ever been before. I believe it is difficult to get in, and the drinks are expensive. If you don't have a connection. I was very lucky to have a friend know someone that got us in without waiting on line (no one likes waiting outside in a mini skirt in 30 degree weather). The Box looks like something out of Boardwalk Empire when you walk in. The staff is decked out in vaudevillian garb and the decor is dark and very 1920's. We were taken to the private back room complete with stripper pole (we definitely had too much fun with that) and bottle service. Right outside our room here was a hoop dangling from the ceiling with a girl inside doing acrobatics (very cool). Within a few minutes the burlesque show began. We went to the front balcony to watch it. Be forewarned, it is RAUNCHY! I saw everything from a nude ballerina to nurses covered in ""cocaine"" to a Magic Mike wannabe tumbling around the stage with a chihuahua (every girls dream, right?) to a really disturbing transvestite covering herself in ""excrement"". This place is not for the faint of heart.  If you are given the opportunity to go here, definitely go. It was hands down the best night out I have had in a long time",6,5,4
188,Roxy W.,"San Francisco, CA",207,22,0,3.0,3/4/2012,"Extremely expensive. Be prepared to drop a lot of cash on drinks.Show was good and entertaining, but not as outrageous as I had expected. Do not sit in the front if you don't want to get wet/dirty/sprayed on during the acts. Turns into a dance party during the acts, but the space is not at all conducive to dancing - particularly in heels. You can dance on stairs and in narrow spaces in between tables, but it's nearly impossible not to be tripping everywhere, particularly if you've had a few drinks and are wearing heels. Do not wear your 6-inch heels to this one. That being said, can be a fun night  overall if you go with the right crowd and are prepared for the bill.",1,,

191,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,3/15/2015,"Had some fun times there a few years ago but now feels played out and full of tourists. Also, it's kind of a buzzkill to have to start out the night interacting with the buffoon-like bouncers at the door. They seriously behave like they were raised by a pack of wild animals. No class at all, especially the large one. For the kind of money you end up dropping there, they at least need to get rid of the sleazy trash at the door.",3,,

I ordered a table and when I got there they didn't acknowledge me and pushed us to the side of the line. I'm not being pretentious but we paid for a table!! Then when I got in after they charged my card they created a random couch table for me in the upper level corner. The bouncers and door host were so rude. The manager/door guy have a Napoleon complex. Our table girl was amazing I think her name was Brittany? I get the whole ""exclusive"" thing but when you're treating paying customers with terrible hospitality it's not okay. I've been here 3 times and it gets more douchey by the month.

193,Melissa K.,"Manhattan, NY",19,1,0,1.0,7/18/2012,"I joined Yelp just so I can write a review on The Box.  My girlfriends and I wanted to go to a strip club but landed on The Box instead.  I have heard many crazy things that go on in there but was unimpressed.First off, we called ahead of time and was told it was $500 per person to get a table - that's just insane.  So we decided to go without reservations.  We arrived at 11:30, which I thought would be reasonable considering the show is scheduled to start at 1am.  At the door, we we greeted by a security guy (not the doorman) and we were told to wait for the doorman.  The doorman was this little guy who just so happened to be sitting outside playing with his friends while we were waiting.  A couple came up behind us, without reservations.  The doorman then told us we can only get in if we had reservations or guests with reservations - they weren't even taking a cover from us but then let the couple behind us get in.  I'm sorry, but my girlfriends and I are cute - I have never been told that I can't come in and to let a couple in? That was just out of the ordinary.  We also noticed that everyone going in had a passport, meaning they were far from NYers and solely European tourists who are willing to drop thousands!  We ended up getting in with a guy who had a reservation and you can tell the doorman was annoyed!  On to drinks - bring cash!!! Each drink is $17 and if you pay credit card, they give themselves a 20% tip!! Are you kidding me?? $20 per drink?? I can buy 2 bottles of decent wine for that price!!!And the show - The place was very tiny, there was no room for you to move and if you're short, forget about it, you're not going to see any of it!  I was picturing burlesque that you would find in Vegas but was sorely mistaken.  The EmC was some lunatic druggie.  There were 4 acts, only of which 2 I can remember.  An old couple who did a magic show with their clothes, meaning they just changed them quickly - yawn and then some disgusting chick who got up there, got naked and pulled a freaking chicken or something of that nature out of her vagina and ate it! My friends and I, at that point, were beyond disgusted and got out of there without looking back.I have made a promise with myself that I will never go back!!",20,14,3

195,John N.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,5,0,4.0,4/14/2012,The box is what New York City is all about. It is private and exclusive. The decor is fabulous and the acts may push the envelope but in a good way.

I literally just walked up and I introduced myself, and the host lost his shit... I think there is something wrong with the promoter  or host or manager or whatever he is... Unfortunately, I've Been here a lot over the years...Actually had a great time... Sadly today, Id give no stars if it was an option... I went with a birthday party... Came in a limo... Everyone went inside while I turned to speak with the limo driver, when I turned back no one would let me into the club... Even a friend who worked there got the little promoter/host dude to come let me in... But he managed to be the biggest DICK on the planet... Saying ""I offended him"" when I went to shake his hand to introduce myself, and explain that my party had already entered the premises... I'm sure if I had walked I with them none of this would have happened... Also the host dude or whatever he is... Was not only unfriendly, but aggressive, unnecessarily yelling, and/or screatching, like a chihuahua ... The bouncers had to hold him back because I had decided to open my mouth to begin to explain that my party was already inside and that I was stuck outside... Basically I think this dude is off his rocker... May need help/hospitalization... It was really strange, I've never seen anyone react like that with no catalyst.
