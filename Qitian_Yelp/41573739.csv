1,Brandon D.,"New York, NY",675,55,175,3.0,8/12/2018,"I stopped by here after a night out, and I actually really enjoyed the overall vibe of the shop. My only true complaint was that the Crêpe I had was average. Food: 3/5. I had a lemon and sugar crepe, which in my mind is this is the quintessential crepe that needs to be tasty. The lemon was SUPER heavy, and it looked as if it was just a sugar Crepe (regular granulated sugar inside) with lemon juice sprayed on top instead of like real lemon jelly or zest inside the actual crepe. While I didn't try another crepe, my actual crepe bread was tasty and well prepared / had a good texture and thickness. Overall, disappointing though in terms of wanting a solid lemon and sugar crepe. Even baring that, I'm sure other flavors are probably better, and it was Late when I was there. Service / atmosphere: 5/5. The people working here were so nice! They were friendly, and the place is small and quaint, with a ""order and go,"" vibe at night. During the day, I can imagine this being a good place for a quick bite. Price to experience ratio: 4. Paid $5 for my crepe, which is pretty good, and it came out quickly. Aside from the fact that I didn't like mine, the other Crepes with more premium fillings were priced competitively. Don't get the lemon and sugar, but consider this place if you're craving a crepe or want to stuff it with something that won't disappoint.",,,
2,Matt R.,"Jacksonville, FL",77,29,4,5.0,6/13/2018,This is a small shop but the chef is excellent!  Fast service and the food is very good for a quick lunch or desert.  Great variety of choices with the crepe as the base.,1,,

4,Herline H.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",196,57,85,5.0,6/20/2018,"SO great for late night food. The place is like a crepe Chipotle (with more variety). The person working there was super nice and answered literally every question we had. It is a bit small, but there is seating. I would 100% recommend this place!",1,,
5,Ryan I.,"Acworth, GA",1,73,31,4.0,9/1/2018,"Walked over here after eating dinner at a nearby eatery to grab something sweet.  Ordered a Nutella banana crepe to go so that I could eat it on my way to the airport.  Crepe was great.  It's hard to mess it up so long as you make the crepe correctly because the rest of the ingredients are nearly impossible to get wrong.  Thankfully the crepe itself was made perfectly, however, it was folded like a wide, thin burrito which made it hard to eat with your hands on the go, especially considering they placed it in a deep tin dish.  In Europe the street vendors fold it in half three times so the final product takes the shape of a slice of pizza, and then they slide it into a V-shaped paper pocket with no toppings.  My recommendation would be to serve to-go orders differently. It would save the business money and would make the act of eating the crepe more straightforward.",,,
6,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1168,787,153,4.0,12/18/2017,"Crepes have actually turned out to be the perfect winter food: easy to hold in one mittened hand while toasty enough to power you through one slushy block after the other. I stumbled on Creperie on my way to brunch and mentally bookmarked to come back. I ordered two (don't judge me!): the strawberries/banana/Nutella and the turkey/swiss cheese/mushrooms. Let's just say they definitely don't skimp on the ingredients. Although the strawberries and banana could have been riper, there was so much Nutella, I didn't have a single dry bite. Definitely ask for extra whipped cream. The savory one was solid but I wish I ordered the neighboring table's bacon, egg, and cheese. Or a second dessert crepe. The lady manning the counter and the crepe station was very sweet; she saw that I was clearly struggling to pick and walked around the counter to stand next to me and go through the options. She also treated both regulars and newbies alike with so much warmth. I'm sad that I don't come through this neighborhood more often; otherwise, I would definitely make Creperie a regular haunt.",4,1,4
7,Corinna W.,"Queens, NY",566,236,406,4.0,8/9/2017,"My friend and I were looking for a dessert place to sit and catch up and we found Creperie, which is open until late. We ordered the Famous Crepe which included strawberry, banana, Nutella, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.It wasn't anything too different, but the crepe was made well with a good flavor, along with the fruits to give it the extra oomph and texture - a classic. I would go back to try some of their other concoctions.My only gripe is that it's a super tiny place and there is a $10 minimum for credit cards.",1,,
8,Kelly Y.,"New York, NY",138,139,237,4.0,8/3/2017,"One of few dessert places open at 12am when my friend and I were looking for a place to chill and catch up so we went on Yelp and walked over to this hole in the wall place!It's a pretty tiny place with seatings along the wall as well as a couple seats in the restaurant. Sitting next to the grill was probably not the best idea, especially in the summer but it cooled down after a while when the chef wasn't constantly making the crepes.We ordered the Famous Crepe which came with Nutella, Strawberries, and Banana which was a bit too sweet for me (probably the nutella) but nonetheless really delicious. I liked the fluffy texture and how thin it was and best of all, it wasn't overcooked! I will probably opt for something more savory next time to balance out the sweetness of the nutella but the fruits was definitely a nice touch. I did see the chef make something that looked like philly cheesesteak which looked quite interesting. It'll be on my list of flavors to try next! It was also nice that we were able to sit there for hours without being kicked out. Give this place a try with its many unique flavors. You'll be surprised at how delicious it is. :)PRO TIP: $10 Credit Card Minimum",1,,
9,Alexandra R.,"New York, NY",473,112,78,4.0,2/23/2018,Nutella and Oreos- it was hard to mess this one up.This was exceedingly sweet (thanks to my sweet tooth and hormone induced cravings) and super rich. Nutella spilled out of it and was mixed well with the Oreo topping we chose. The crepe was large (enough for 4) and I shared it between a friend on a girl's night that ended in food coma. I don't think it would've saved well as it did get a bit soggy by the time we were through- but a great treat if you're seriously craving something sweet and different! Or maybe just a tourist who is splurging on breakfast ;),,,
10,Giulia R.,"Downtown, Miami, FL",537,56,236,5.0,6/10/2018,"Loved this place. Late night snack. Small venue, very intimate, you can put WHATEVER YOU WANT in your crepe. I had Nutella, white chocolate, strawberries, and banana. Wonderful. Definitely recommend and coming back :)",1,,
11,Camille M.,"Queens, NY",62,90,458,4.0,4/26/2018,"It's a small store, you just buy your crepe and take it to go. They have 3 seats there if you really do wanna stay and eat it there. My go to crepe is Nutella with Strawberries and Banana, it's simple and you can't really mess it up.I like the actual crepe itself because it wasn't soggy or too thick. Thin enough, but still able to hold everything together.I don't make my way out here, but when I'm in the area I do make sure to grab a crepe to go.There are many options to choose from and I'm sure if you don't see what you like you can ask them if they can make it for you, I don't see it being a problem.",2,,1

I came here for the first time and ordered the famous New York Cheesecake crepe. It's not at all what I had hoped for. It would be a nice touch if they give out free ice water because these crepes are way too sweet. I don't think I'll come back again.",,,

18,Susan C.,"San Jose, CA",15,435,1528,4.0,7/7/2017,Needed a little bit of sweet and stopped in for the sugar and butter crepe.  Traditional crepe batter and it was good.  I think it had a little bit too much powdered sugar on it but overall not a bad snack to have when you're on the Lower East Side.,1,,
19,Helen C.,"New York, NY",25,80,114,5.0,1/16/2017,"These crepes are loaded! I got the Famous Crepe to keep it simple. The crepes are really thin, a perfect balance to the strawberries, bananas, and Nutella on the inside. I don't know how they do it, but it melts in your mouth. I basically inhaled it then and there. The Chocolate Lovers crepe is exactly what you think it is - filled with chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. Honestly a little too much for me. We packed half of it to go.It's a tiny space with limited seating, but thank goodness there was no one around when we went (during a snowstorm). Thought the crepes were a bit pricey, around $10 per crepe.",,,

How can you complain about Nutella?Though priced at around $10-$12 for crepes that I can make back in my apartment, I dont care. I need you for to finish my drunken adventure.Sober Patty probably would go for Creperie, but drunken patty does. Just load the nutella, please!!",5,2,5

They use peanut oil in their crepe batter unfortunately. However, when I went recently with my friend who was craving a crepe, they offered to make me a deconstructed crepe (basically everything is included besides the crepe). It was delicious and very generous of them. My friend also loves coming here and is never disappointed. This place is very tiny though, so don't come with high hopes for seating.",2,1,1

I walked down the street to Katz's, realized they charge $20 for a sandwich and decided to walk back to see if this place was open yet. I walked in at 11:15 and the employee seemed very flustered and annoyed by my presents. He told me I would have to wait about 15 minutes. I said that was fine and he back tracked more by saying he had nothing prepared, basically asking me to leave. I will not be going back to this place.",,,

26,Raymond E.,"Mesquite, TX",314,83,61,4.0,2/7/2017,"Nice dessert place I went to with a group of friends on a late Sunday night following the Super Bowl. First of all, this place is very small so don't be bringing 5-10 people with you. It's meant more for intimate parties. They have a vast selection of crepes so variety is there. I went with the Reese's with strawberries. Big crepe and was made within a few minutes. Also impressive was that they are open late and even deliver.Overall, it's a nice crepe place. I've had many crepes so far and this one holds its own. It's not my favorite dessert place at NY (see Serendipity 3) but it'll do.",1,,

Whether we are craving crepes at 1 in the afternoon  or 3 in the morning this place always comes through!

It always comes out great and as if I was the only one in the store. Overall great crepes!",,,

29,Will L.,"Vancouver, Canada",293,49,26,4.0,7/18/2017,"When people talk about the great ""hole-in-the-walls"" of New York, they are describing the rare breed of desert place. I came here after some brunch and wandering around the area. I had read some great reviews, but would not have thought much of it from the outside.Thankfully, my girlfriend and I went in and ordered a Fudge Crepe to share. It was made without the seemingly artificial showmanship of other Crepe restaurants, which was appreciated. When we first bit into our Crepe, we were really impressed. The decadent, melted fudge was both rich and creamy and the Crepe itself was thin and soft. It was really great, especially for a $8 price point. I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area!",1,,

The bacon egg and cheese is always great, as well as anything with olive or artichoke tapenade.  But the deserts are where it's at. The New York crepe is prob 900 calories but worth it; strawberries, hot fudge and NY cheesecake wrapped in a crepe and topped with whipped cream! Some other favorites are Banana, nutella and Halva or White chocolate with raspberry puree. Even just the simple lemon and sugar is heavenly. This place is great for a quick bite or these crepes also transfer well to bring them home for later.",,,

You can also get the mix packet cup of hot chocolate for $2. There is a total of ~8 seats, so very very small. Literally a hole in the wall. Go check it out!",1,1,1

Despite going in wanting to get a sweet crepe, the description of the Smoked Turkey w/ Mushrooms + Shredded Swiss Cheese ultimately won me over. Even in my drunken state, however, I knew that the crepe I got just wasn't that great. While the crepe itself was delicious, the mushrooms were obviously canned and not fresh and the turkey was more on the cold side. I was not a fan.

I walked in and while the menu is a bit overwhelming, I know what I like so right away I chose the dark chocolate with raspberry purée. The crepe was prepared right before me and was done in no time. Now, I've made crepes before and know damn well that the price of these are wayyy crazy but so is the rent these businesses have to pay and I will happily contribute, because I'm a chocoholic.The crepe was big but didn't stop me from eating the whole thing.

62,Camilla F.,"Manhattan, NY",8,59,48,3.0,11/1/2016,"Mixed feelings about this one...The good: the chocolate and fruit crepes are really good. The bad: service is not very friendly and they are rushing you to order without letting you ask any questions, even if you waited 25 minutes for your turn.Location is cramped, and the savory crepes are really disappointing: they use canned vegetables ( Mushroom etc.) instead of fresh ones (!), the goat cheese had a weird taste and with a very small portion, and yet the charge was+$11 for one crepe + tax.",,1,

I don't think it's much different from any other crepe place tbh but it's not to know there's a decent one in this area.They have both savory and sweet crepes so you can come by for any crepe craving. They even have hot sauce on the table for more flavor! The one thing that gave it some credibility is that the store won against Bobby flays showdown. As a huge fan of Bobby flay, it made me want to try out their famous crepe (Nutella, strawberry, banana, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzle). It's definitely good but I think it's hard to go wrong with that combination. It was definitely better than the smores crepe. The smores was too sweet for my liking and made my teeth hurt a bit. The vanilla ice cream helps cuts the sweetness. I think it's a reliable crepe place for desserts!",,,

The crepe was just a thin vehicle to store Nutella and Banana in a sloppy bag. No depth. Threw it away. If I wanted to eat Sliced bananas dipped in Nutella I could have headed down to Duane Reade. It was like eating a scoop of Nutella with each bite with bananas. How is this even a crepe. How is this place even called Creperia? Please rename is to Craperia.

They have one chef making all the crepes at the time I was there and he was very nice.  He also made delicious crepes for us!  I had their banana and mango crepe with dulce de leche and it could not have been better.  The crepe was thin, yet fluffy and the combination was heavenly.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and dabbed with a large heap of whipped cream made this amazing for me.Looking at their menu, they had a huge selection of crepes from savory to sweet - you can even make your own crepe if you'd like.  They also looked like they had so many fresh ingredients available.  In terms of pricing, not bad at all, ~$10, standard for a crepe.  You can also have tea or coffee - as they brew their coffee fresh and have a huge selection of tea available for you to choose from.As I said, this place is small, not great for groups, but maybe for an intimate setting with a date or friend.  It's a little hidden gem on Ludlow and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",2,,4

What I got was a sugar high that lasted for a few hours. The crepes are all freshly made in front of you on the big crepe pan. It was soft and warm with a touch of color on it. The filling on the other hand, was something entirely different.I don't know if it was a slow day for the guy behind the counter, but he had a huge plastic bottle of what I assume to be their dulche de leche sauce. Safe to say he was rather heavy handed and very generous with it. He was squeezing the bottle for so long and so hard that it started to fart. Yeah, you know what I mean. The Nutella and powdered sugar then elegantly topped the crepe.I thoroughly enjoyed my crepe though I'd dare say I had about 2 tablespoons of mixed dulche de leche and Nutella left on my plate when done. I'm not big on sweets so I didn't do the whole ravenous tongue to plate thing.",1,,1

If you see the female worker you should turn your back and try some other sweets around the neighborhood. She has an attitude, her crepes are sloppy. She acts like the customers are forcing her to work there. I wouldn't give this place not even a star rating when she's working. The man makes the most amazing crepes ever!! He helps you choice a crepe according to what you like. When he's working this place deserves 5 stars. It's truly makes the most amazing crepes ever.

They had so many choices to choose from but my friend and I ended up getting one with strawberries, nutella, and ice cream on it.

My friend ordered the Smores crepe.Our crepes were made right in front of us. I couldn't help but noticing how huge the crepes were. Wow! The portions are hugeeeeee!!! The crepes were super exciting to eat and were delicious during the first few bites. However, the excess amounts of Nutella were too sweet. It was hard to finish the crepes.

There is a small cozy nook by the window, however, with comfy cushions. So that was quite nice. The savory crepes are quite good. If you're into the really large mounds of crepes that spill its contents when you cut into it, you won't get that here. These crepes are on the flatter side, and although it's not as stuffed as it could be, it was much easier to eat.The crepe batter isn't the best I've had- I usually like mine on the milker side.

It's a literal ""hole in the wall."" I feel it's a little expensive, but I just keep coming back o_OI always order the Famous crepe - Nutella, strawberries, bananas with whip cream and ice cream.

93,Ataru N.,"Hesperia, CA",10,373,181,4.0,10/21/2016,"The hype a place got from being on TV is, for once, deserved (though beating Bobby Flay at your own game isn't exactly a fair fight). Soft, perfectly cooked crepes, though they can't hold a candle to my beloved ""crepe nazi"" in LA. The savory crepes are why this place loses a star. The sweet crepes are better, because of the way the savory crepes are made - they make the crepe, then pile on the meat and continue cooking it until the meat is heated, resulting in the crepe ending up hard and crunchy (the ""crepe nazi"" heats the meat separately while the crepe is cooking, then combines the two on a plate when the crepe is finished); savory crepe ingredients are also overly salty. This location is much better than the one in the East Village: friendly, less surly staff, even late at night, IIRC slightly more seating inside, and they don't douse the sweet crepes with extra syrup or whipped cream. Both are open very late: this location until 3am on weeknights and 4am on Fridays and Saturdays, the other until 4am every night. The other one is cash only, but they take card here for orders over $10. Cons for both locations: very little space and no air conditioning.*The Crepe Nazi is/was Crepe To Go, a hole in the wall in West LA's ""Little Osaka"" neighborhood (not to be confused with Little Tokyo in downtown LA), even tinier than Creperie's space. This is one of those places with models of their crepes in the window, with placards with each variant's price, ingredients, and name (female silver screen stars like Rita Hayworth for the sweet crepes, male stars like Bruce Lee for the savory), though you can also create your own. There is only enough space inside for the equipment/ingredients, one employee, and one customer at a time. It makes Creperie look spacious by comparison. A sign outside details the Soup Nazi-level instructions for how to order: only one customer inside at a time; you must already know what you're going to order before stepping inside; step outside after paying and wait to be called to come get your order; etc. The crepes aren't overstuffed like they are at Creperie; they let the crepe shine. There are a few tables outside, but scoring one takes patience and luck. Standard toppings are all available, but they also have Asian ingredients. You haven't lived until you've had green tea ice cream with Nutella and strawberries folded into a thin, soft crepe. RIP, Crepe Nazi, ah luved yoo.",,,

I got a bacon, egg and cheese. The portion was fairly large, and the crepe had itself had the perfect level of buttery goodness. The egg was nicely fried up. I do wonder though if the egg could have been made over easy, which is how I would have preferred the yolk. There was a lot of cheese(!!), much more than I expected.

I don't really care, it was soooo delicious. This is my go-to place for delicious that is french pancakes.They also make savory crepes, which I find just as satisfying.Note:There's a counter to stand at and maybe like 1 table to sit 2 people. This is one of those walk-in, order, walk-out places, but totally worth it. After a night a of drinking the line is a little long, but when you get to the front and order...watching them make it is just as mesmerizing.

I tried the savory veggie crepe. I really like that there are so many vegetarian options. Absolutely delicious and great for sweet dessert crepes too. The classic Nutella banana strawberry is the most popular and she does not skimp on the ingredients.

Just because I was feeling pretty cheap for the day, I got the butter and sugar, and just...wow. The crepe was made really well, and it was just enough to tide me over without making me feel sick.I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because there was a ton of sugar in my crepe...like I could feel the granules of attacking my teeth into cavities. But I might change that soon, because I'll definitely be back for more (esp savory crepes)!",,,

The scent of fresh crepes is futile to resist as you hop to the next bar, so it's entirely likely there'll be a line...but at least it won't take as long as The Meatball Shop. Everyone else seems to salivate over the nutella options, but I'm a savory man myself. Try the one with prosciutto and pesto and sun-dried tomatoes and fresh mozz, if I didn't imagine it in a bourbon-induced haze.The crepes don't taste quite as amazing as they smell, but they're still damn good. And look how drunk you are anyway. After that last shot of tequila, I could feed you some cardboard and you'd tell me you're glad I looked it up on Yelp, because this cardboard is hands down the best in NYC. Get your life together. And make sure to fight your way to the front, because at least half the fun is watching them make it with that windshield wiper. I'm sure it has another name, but I'm calling it the windshield wiper.

I was pleasantly surprised to have one of my favorite crepes in NYC at this tiny shop. The service was quick and efficient, even with so many drunk idiots roaming around outside. Most impressive though were the crepes. The shell was prepared fresh to order and was both moist and fluffy. I sampled both a savory and sweet crepe. The vegetable crepe was stuffed with all fresh veggies and was packed full of flavor. The Nutella, banana, halavah crepe was insane and had just the right amount of every ingredient. There wasn't one crepe I saw made that night that I didn't want to try! Don't let its late night appeal fool you though, these crepes are the real deal. I would definitely return anytime of day for a great crepe. Only negatives would have to be: (1) the price - $10 for a decent sized crepe isn't ridiculous but not great either and (2) the size - while its perfect to pop in and out of, wouldn't not be a good place to eat a meal or bring a date.",1,,

Me and my girlfriend walk in, order two sweet crepes, one with ""dutch apple"" filling and one with caramel. First thing I noticed was the attitude of the lady who made the crepe which was bad for food service. The filling for the crepes was terrible. You cannot pass apple pie filling for ""dutch apple"" or anything like that. The caramel also lacked taste. The crepe itself was also soggy and tasteless.  Once home we noticed that there no whipped cream when infact the menue mentioned thats what it came with. Long stroy short, it SUCKED!

That is how many of our Thursday night conversations go; all of us, very big foodies, can never decide on a place.  Finally, after falling in love with the place in Boston, I suggested Creperie, known as the best crepes in NYC.  Everyone immediately agreed.NYC Creperie is a tiny shop that one can easily pass by without knowing how famous it is, especially after its showdown with Bobby Flay for its famous Crepe of strawberry, banana, nutella, and vanilla ice-cream.  There is almost no place to sit (a few couches and four stools, and the entire size of the place is probably the size of a medium sized bedroom.  Everything is so compact in this little place.  So efficient as well, with the condiments layered neatly on the shelves. We ordered the House special savory crepe for the day (Turkey, brie, basil, and artichokes, which was really good.  While that is a very banal way to describe it, I can't really think of a better explanation.  It was just really good, and the ingredients complemented each other well for a fine-tuned taste.  I'm sure it wasn't the most fresh turkey or the most gourmet artichokes, but the taste just felt right.  Also, I loved how they actually put the crepe on the burner after it is wrapped with fillings, as the cheese was about 75% melted when we received the crepe, so the stringiness of the cheese and the warmth of the turkey and artichokes definitely added to make the crepe even better.We also ordered the tiramisu dessert crepe with Tiramisu, strawberries, and nutella.  The tiramisu had been in the freezer, and after wrapping all the ingredients in the crepe, our cook left it on the burner, just for a little while.  The result was a still cold but melted in all the right places tiramisu that smothered itself within the strawberries, which then decided to become best friends with the chocolates.  Strawberries and chocolates click anyway.  Just like the strawberries and banana and ice-cream that another friend had on the famous crepe.One of my friends asked what the batter to the crepe of made of.  The answer was powder and lots of butter.  That really did ruin the meal for me.  Deep down inside, when I ate the crepe, I could tell it was not made from the freshest ingredients and had an almost artificial, processed feel to it.    This is actually one of the few places I went to for a second time.  This time, we got the chocolate mousse crepe.  That was pretty terrible.  Chocolate overload--this time, it was too much.  Too sweet.  Too pregnant with chocolate.  Not at all the right balance.  And the chocolate mousse had melted to a watery consistency by the time we got the crepe.Its like beginner's luck.  Creperie made such a good impression on me at first.  And then it went downhill...and downhill...just like a pop song that goes out of style.",2,2,

135,Alexandra K.,"London, United Kingdom",47,321,515,5.0,6/26/2013,"I watched the Food Network clip on this place and I have to say I was surprised to walk in and find it to be the size of a walk-in-closet.  I thought it was more of a restaurant--and it is, there are places to sit, however, not very many (I now realize they probably featured the West Village location in the clip).  The guy working here does a great job of putting the crepes together and is in no rush to pop them out as fast as possible.  He knows that it takes time for ingredients to melt or to get warm.  I started off with a savory, and not planning on ordering a sweet, I changed my mind when I saw the expansive menu. -#12 Prosciutto & Mozzarella with Sun-Dried Tomatoes: It tastes like a pepperoni pizza because of the sundried tomatoes and thick piece of prosciutto which is extremely fresh and full of taste. You don't really taste much of the cheese but the tomatoes and prosciutto are so delicious it doesn't really matter--you know it ads flavor somewhere. -Cheesecake, Baked Apples, Halva, Peanut Butter & Nutella Crepe (make-your-own): Wow!  Such an amazing choice. The cheesecake is so creamy and mixes with the sweet cinnamon apples so well. The halva, which actually got crispy from the heat adds an amazing chunkiness and smoky sesame taste. Obviously you can never go wrong with peanut butter and Nutella. It was one of the best crepes I have ever had.  FINAL VERDICT: Now making crepes is very simple so why pay $9-$14 for one?  I don't know.  The cost is unnecessarily high, however, I must say that the crepes are quite delicious, the ingredients are extremely fresh, and you can't find a lot of these fillings at any other creperie.  I guess that's what makes this place so good.  You have so many different options to choose from.",3,,2

Updated review","For whatever reason I have not come back to this place in a while, but I somehow found myself dying for some crepes and Creperie always gets it right.I had the dulce de leche and nutella, but she ""messed"" up my order and gave me strawberries with dulce de leche and nutella. Best mess up ever. One thing that wow's me every time I come is how fresh the fruit is. You would think a small little place like this would have mediocre ingredients, but the strawberries are always sweet, clean and delicious. It was the right blend of sweetness and actually off set the sweetness of the dulce de leche. They crank these crepes out like no tomorrow and even with a huge crowd, you'll never wait long. There's a reason why this place has been around for so long. You can always count on getting a delicious crepe each and every time you visit.",1,,2

It's a bit big for one person, though I guess it should be if they're charging $7 for a crepe. The crepe was lathered and stuffed with gallons of nutella that my teeth starting hurting from basically eating straight nutella. They unfortunately didn't have ripe bananas, so the bananas were a bit bitter.The crepe itself was also a bit too much like a pancake for me.

We stopped in late one night and the Hispanic gentleman told us that we were his last customers.  Instead of giving us the crepes and kicking us out, he locked the door and let us eat calmly inside. We chit chatted about reggaeton (imagine his surprise when a 6'4 black guy sang the lyrics word for word) while he cleaned up and shut down. During the convo, we learned that he was only going to get a few hours sleep because he was opening up the store the next day.  Kudos to you Mr. Reggaeton Man. ...

168,Miah L.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,18,0,1.0,6/16/2015,"I was excited to try some crepes in NYC- and then was so disappointed that I had to throw away my food.  These crepes are greasy, disgusting American versions of the actual things (and not in the good way.)  The filling is low quality lunch meat and the crepe itself is soggy and thick- not like they should be.  The sloppy-ness of the crepe isn't the issue- it's the fact that once you get it in your mouth you want to spit it out because of the strange, sponge-like consistency that is mopping up who knows what.  I can't believe people actually think these are good- they've obviously never had anything near authentic or an actually good non-authentic version.  These are much more like very thin waffles than crepes.  The sweet crepes have some kind of weird, salty taste to them that is not at all appetizing.  Never again!  I wish I hadn't made the mistake of trusting the reviews.",,,

They were good, I give you that. But they weren't amazing. The portion is enough, but not overwhelmingly big. And yes I obviously did not eat both by myself. The place was small and there is barely any seats. The drink selection sucked and I was very thirsty after the meal. For the portion that they give us, the price was a bit overpriced. But then again it's new York. If you're craving for crepe, they will satisfy your craving, but you can get better ones in Philly for a cheaper price and a bigger portion.",,,

There was no wait, and the woman behind the counter was super friendly and nice- she even moved the massive jar of nutella to the front counter so I could take a picture of it. I ordered a reeses pieces/banana/nutella concoction that I can only liken to crack. Seriously, you guys. It was unbelievably good, and only $10. My friend got a savory crepe with lots of cheese and veggies, and was swooning over how nummy it was.

There were two huge tubs of nutella sitting next to the cashier 3. An amazing aroma was floating throughout the air 4. A couple whose faces I barely saw devouring an enormous crepe. The BF and I ordered the house special crepe in the sweet section and their homemade lemonade. We excitedly carried our plastic plate of heaven onto a small table and went to town. This baby was stuffed with tiramisu, nutella, whipped cream and chopped strawberries. It was the BEST foodgasm I have had in a REALLY long time and I was so sad we decided to share one because I wanted this moment all to myself. Even if your not into sweets or nutella (personally I would diagnose you as deranged but whatever) I highly encourage you to check this place out.

She just looked all chill making the crepes one at a time as a group of rowdy guys were making all kinds of stupid comments. My crepe was beautiful. I was too drunk at the time to remember what i had but it did consist of turkey cheese and something else. It was total heaven from what I remember and if you have not experienced crepes you should really come here since the selection is RIGHTEOUS. I totally support and recommend simple little places like this who take a simple idea and make it into something amazing. I won't forget this place!",,1,1

It has strawberry banana nutella on the inside powdered sugar whipped cream more nutella on the outside and topped off with a scoop of ice cream. Heavenly. Sugar bomb but heavenly. I've on occasion put in a slice of chocolate mousse cake as well.. That goes well too!I've also got the smores crepe. It's just melted marshmallows, chocolate and ground up graham crackers. It was a bit underwhelming but then what isnt when you are eating a fully loaded famous crepe next to it. It wouldn't be bad standalone though haha.I like the one here slightly better than the one on the West side. I think they give you more here :P",,1,

Updated review","Owner contacted me about bad review.Not only did they *reformulate* that blueberry sauce bc of me, but I got to do a blind taste test! --the new one won!And I was invited to try both a savory AND sweet crepe... para gratis. My friend and I chose amongst the 55 menu items: chicken pesto mushroom & mango banana caramel lemon brown sugar.And let me tell you, customer service aside, BOTH crepes were AMAZING! 5/5 each! The mangos tasted soft & fresh, and the savory just right. And then, without asking, we were presented a THIRD crepe, the one I previously panned, the blueberry banana, this time with the NEW filling.Result = refined and delicious. And not nearly as sugary-sweet as before.It's great to see a cook as passionate about their food to take critique as seriously they did, and be so kind.Side note: Ariela is one sassy lady who can quip with the best of them. That's an extra star in my book!Call me if you need a permanent crepe tester!! :-)",4,,7

It is one of the best hole in the wall gems out there! The crepes are to die for! The only draw back to this place is the lack of seating but at 1AM after drinks galore... I'm just happy they are open. The crepes here are so good, It's worth standing on your feet to eat it.",,,
184,Sarah M.,"Olean, NY",2,7,0,5.0,1/3/2012,"I have never written a review on yelp before but created an account just now just specifically to write this review, just to give you an idea of where I'm going with this...This is my favorite favorite favorite place in NYC. I first discovered it when my bestfriend and I came here on her birthday, and I went back at least once a week for a month until I moved away. And by at least once I mean that sometimes I went 2 or 3 times in the week. And sometimes I went alone or in the middle of the night (not after a drunken night when people are not in their senses enough to know what tastes good. I'm completely sober every time and so I know what I'm talking about). Anyway, out of all the places I frequented in NY, this is the place I miss the most. The Famous Crepe (strawberries, nutella and bananas with ice cream on top, and the fruit is always fresh) was my thing. I once ordered the cheesecake one and once ordered the brownie one and was disappointed with both of those. But The Famous Crepe NEVER disappoints. Its the kind of thing that you want to eat slowly so you can really savor it. You should go there when you have a bad day. It lifts your spirits right up. And don't be scared away by the reviews of monster lines there. It is a very very tiny place but honestly any time I went I was almost the only one there. I feel like $10 (or something around there, can't remember exactly) is a little expensive for a crepe but I guess that's typical for NYC and anyway its a huge crepe and honestly I would pay double or triple. It's that good. In summary, if I could give this place more than 5 stars I woud!",4,2,4

A crepe is a crepe and I don't really think you can mess it up.It was alright - I liked the bitterness of the chocolate, but there was waaaaaaaaayy to much chocolate compared to fruit. I also got maybe 3 little chunks of banana in the entire crepe.I'll try this place again, but I think I might try something more adventurous like baked pear and caramel or dark chocolate with raspberry puree.",,,

This is NOT the place for large groups or an intimate conversation - it is quite the whole in the wall with only two tables.  Of course, that is not a complaint, just don't want this review to send mass amounts of people to this place all at once!  Just go with one or two good friends and be merry :).",,1,1

I mean, sometimes you order at a counter and just get a piece of crepe. And others are so dark and dingy that they'd give anyone the crepes. But I'll rise above cheap jokes and just tell you, there's a reason these things sell like hotcakes! Running around $7-9 each you'll find a wide array of sweet and savory fillings on their menu. Freshly made to order from this closet-sized shop, better to grab your treat take out and dig in on the street, at the bar or if you're lucky - at home. I can easily recommend the feta and spinach or ham and cheese versions but if you want something a little more fancy, get a little artichoke, provolone or even brie and apple in the mix. Perfect late night eat, snack or lunch option in the LES. And afterward, maybe go catch a late show of Planet of the Crepes at Sunshine.",8,12,8

When I took a bite I didn't know that it would taste that good. The chicken wasn't chewy and the mushrooms were fresh, but I think what really did it was the swiss cheese. The swiss cheese really worked well with the chicken and especially with the fresh mushrooms, although I really didn't taste any pesto which she probably forgot...but it was still delicious.Sweet or savory either one is good. Luckily my boyfriend had a sweet tooth so he ordered a sweet crepe; ""The Famous Crepe"". The famous crepe consisted of FRESH strawberries, bananas, nutella inside and topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. GOOD LORD WAS IT GOOD! What really put it over the top was the fresh strawberries. It was really really fresh, like they have  strawberries growing in the back of their store or something.I've read a lot of reviews about crepes and some people complain about the crepes being too thick, but creperie crepes were just perfect. It was not thick at all so it doesn't overwhelm the stuff inside, but it also wasn't too thin that you couldn't taste the crepe at all. It was also cooked a nice golden brown.I've never had crepes before and creperie opened up a world of sweet magic and wonder to my taste buds.",18,11,18

Plus, they have savory vegetarian crepes which are always a plus for people with way too many vegetarian friends. So cheap, fast, and absolutely delish - a total win.I think I've had almost everything on the menu - perk of living near Creperie. My savory favorites are definitely the one with goat cheese & mushrooms, the one with brie & tomatoes & basil, and the vegetarian house special. My favorite sweet crepes are ""Crepe Suzette,"" the house special crepe, and the Chocolate Lovers crepe. Of course, I only get the chocolate lovers when I'm either ridiculously drunk or ridiculously depressed - but it's absolutely delicious.You can also make your own, so go and have fun!",,,
