Updated review","Update:Rejoice: they got rid of the styrofoam containers!  Now the Cajun rice is in a nice paper container.  They could have filled it to the top though.  And they have seltzer as an option for the soda. Previous review:Five stars for the Cajun rice, minus one star for the styrofoam container.  Why do they still use styrofoam?  The spicy bonafide chicken is juicy and tender, the chicken tenders are not as tender.  This place has a depressing feel to it but it's the only Popeyes around me.  I'm almost sorry I found it because I'm trying to eat healthier.  The BBQ sauce is great, the bayou buffalo sauce, not so much.  Also, why does every combo have to have a drink?  What if I just wanted the chicken and side?",3,2,3
1,Sam W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,0,1.0,10/17/2018,"This is the worst f$@king Popeyes store I ever experienced in the city. All those asshole deserve to be fired!!! I purchased a 13 pieces 2 large side (wedge fries & coleslaw) and 7 biscuits and they gave me wings and  drumsticks combine of 12 piece and one breast. As for sides, I ordered coleslaw and they gave me rices and bean. It's either they're cheap ass hell or they can't F$&king take orders!!!It's partial my fault for going there.... that's why I gave the  on pity star!!!!",,,
2,William H.,"Manhattan, NY",3,6,3,5.0,10/13/2018,"I had been eating here for so many time the chicken is so good but I always order naked chicken, no flower. The location of this Popeyes so close to the train station easy to get my quick brunch or dinner I always avoid 12pm to 2pm cause those are rush hour I like what they did to the rest room, that now their is a pass code on the receipt that you order that is how you get in to use the rest room new update. Also the side pretty good too for my sweet treat, especially biscuit love with honey or gem,  keep it up the good work will be visiting more often.",1,1,1
3,Lilang N.,"Manhattan, NY",234,63,274,4.0,10/24/2017,"There always giving lots of sweet deals like the $5 with 3 tenders, 1 biscuit and drink deal or the $10 10 piece choices of tender or chicken. Which I get very full easily. Their new signature Cajun fries with bacon and gravy.... don't be fool guys the picture looks delicious but in reality the dish nit so much. It was $5 a plate. An okay small average size although not worth it. Basically fries with bacon cheese and a Cajun southern taste. But it wasn't the best. With lots of bacon it's sorta very salty. But I absolutely love Popeyes sauce especially their sweet heat. When I got this $10 for 10 piece tender they give us 4 free sauce +1 other don't know why but it's free so why not LOL",,,
4,Chad F.,"Everett, MA",88,5,0,1.0,6/3/2018,"The worst store ever!!!!! They are charging sauce for $0.25 per sauce!!! I have never been asked for that before! Can you believe?  ?? and my fries is fking cold, I'm so mad now",,2,
5,T.Hawk B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,3.0,3/23/2018,Great customer service everyone is very friendly and nice. Problem: chicken pieces are unbelievably TINY!!! The pieces of chicken are like from a baby pigeon. Never seen chicken this small. So if u get 3 pieces of chicken think of it as 1 piece in real life. A little disappointed but everything tasted fresh.,,,
6,Amy C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",533,372,380,4.0,2/25/2015,"*Chicken Tenders have the perfect crisped skin and very tender meat.*Choose from 6 different sauces! I got Buttermilk Ranch.*Cajun Fries tastes a bit bland.*Biscuits are fresh, buttery, and delicious.*food came out super fast. The cashier takes my order, while another dude puts the meal on a tray, so it is ready the second I got my change back.*lots of seating!",4,2,3
7,Tom C.,"New Milford, NJ",7,6,0,2.0,2/16/2017,"The food is okay, but small place gets crowded fast and they DON'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS! They only accept DEBIT and CASH. Yes, they refused to take my VISA. I couldn't believe it. They flat out said only debit or cash.",1,1,
8,Melissa C.,"Ozone Park, NY",0,5,0,1.0,8/24/2017,This is the Popeyes you come to for them to fuck up your order.I've lost count how many times this place hasn't given me the french fries with my meal. It's ridiculous. Don't eat here..because you won't..eat here since they like not giving you your food.,,,
9,Victor H.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,9,35,3.0,8/23/2016,"The staff was really nice, informative of the menu and how fast the staff worked. The fried leg, thigh and wing chicken were amazing. The biscuit is not the best quality I had for Popeye's. I'm not satisfied there no spicy Cajun fries and the amount of fries I received. The atmosphere there feel depressing the lighting of the restaurant is not very bright. There leftover food on the tables and floor. Not Satisfied. It's a quick grab-and-go Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits near Chinatown, Manhattan.",,,1
10,Christian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,116,0,5.0,6/28/2016,"So often, we forget to thank those in the ""quick-service"" industry for a job well done.  After another pleasant experience with the staff here, I thought it my duty to commend the employees of this location for their always professional and friendly service.  Because the service is so expedient, it's so easy to grab your goodies, return to your office, and gobble down all the deliciousness that fried chicken is without appreciating the wonderful folks who make this happen.  Thank you Walker Street Popeye's for being such lovely people.  I respect the amazing job you all do.No need to really acknowledge the food, because we all know Popeye's, even in a city with $40 fried chicken, is the best.",,,3
11,Vincent C.,"New York, NY",80,76,135,5.0,2/2/2015,"TL;DR Standard Popeyes.I'm just going to tell you that I'm probably going to give every popeyes 5 stars if I go there, unless they defecate on my food and scream at me.  When someone talks to me about fried chicken my first thoughts are Popeyes and korean friend chicken.  I have no idea why this place has such low ratings on yelp, but I guess people don't want to admit that they enjoy corporate fast food joints over 3 star michelin restaurant food unless they are called Shake Shak.You can't beat the crunchy skin that cracks when your teeth penetrates the fried breading.  The sound itself gives the food 1 star.  As the teeth sink deeper and perforates the skin, the juice caught between the fried skin and the chicken meat cascades towards your tongue.  The second it hits your taste buds, your tongue will feel like it went through an entire semester of soul food 101.  The chicken meat itself is just the right amount of salty.  It's also some of the most tender chicken.  It's like each chicken went to a massage parlor and had a happy ending.  Popeyes is the only place I ever enjoyed eating chicken breast.I have not tasted a better traditional fried chicken in my life, and especially not for it's price.  Not at sweet chicks, not at kfc, not at home, point to me where you think the fried chicken is better...I dare you.  Korean fried chicken need not apply, because that's just a different category.  Testimonial:""I've had momofuku fried chicken and I still rather eat popeyes""""[popeyes] more expensive [than kfc] cause you gotta pay for that quality""I'm bout to go on a one man mission to eat and rate each popeyes in NYC.  I bet I would give them all 5 stars.",1,5,4
12,Beauty By Momo A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,1.0,3/22/2017,The service here is horrible. They denied me water when I had to take my blood pressure pill. All in efforts to sell me water.,,,
13,Alice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",108,201,1000,3.0,3/7/2016,"The atmosphere here is pretty depressing. The lighting of the restaurant is not very bright. Sometimes there would be leftover food on the tables and floor. It's gross. The service is pretty quick. The food is alright. If you need a quick grab-and-go, this is great for that.",,,
14,Rob S.,"Point Roberts, WA",0,4,0,1.0,3/10/2017,This was the worst fast food I have ever eaten in my life. The popcorn chicken was rubbery. You could not part the coating from the meat tenders and the side of mash was an insipid puddle of goo. Eat here at your peril,,,
15,Tony R.,"Ellisville, MS",24,72,25,5.0,1/26/2016,As far as Popeyes goes this one was one of the best if not the best I've seen in the country. And I'm from Popeye country (New Orleans) Food was fast and super hot !Service was fast and friendly with a smileVery clean with someone constantly cleaning the dining area.Pricing is on point and not hiked up compared to others in visited Keep up the good work !,,,
16,Keilon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,314,1881,2.0,3/31/2015,"The food here is always just at average. It's never really hot. Typically lukewarm. Sometimes you go to a Popeyes and your food is pretty good; it just never is here. On top of that, this is SoHo/Chinatown/TriBeCa and they keep raising the prices roughly every two months or so. It's kind of just not really worth it unless you just love Popeyes or you're one of the locals that they give free food to often...I'm not one of them so I am admittedly salty about it.",1,,
17,Twinnie X.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,3,5.0,8/7/2016,"Express service and friendly staffs, I love Susan, she's so sweet and know how to take care her customers. Food are okay.",,,
18,Monique R.,"Brooklyn, NY",899,909,538,3.0,2/19/2013,"I don't frequent fast food establishments regularly but sometimes the urge for fried chicken trumps all. Popeyes is near the office and on the way to the train station. I stopped in at 5pm on a friday to see the establishment was nearly empty but  had a good supply of chicken on hand. I am not a fan of the sides so i just ordered a box of chicken and a side of biscuits. Its quick, cheap and tasty. I am a sucker for the crispy skin. I think we all have a weakness for fried chicken. And Popeyes is the only fried chicken chain i will go to.This place is pretty busy at lunch time.",1,1,1
19,Cameron M.,"New York, NY",48,79,195,3.0,2/17/2013,"Chicken is definitely hit or miss at this location.  Sometimes it's great just like elsewhere, but sometimes their chicken is unbelievably greasy and overcooked which tastes nasty.Even though no Popeyes location has green beans on their menu, they all do have it, and it is my favourite side anywhere!!  Get it with gravy and you won't be disappointed!",,2,
20,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",50,141,413,4.0,2/20/2016,"for a popeyes in chinatown, this place is not bad. the staff makes the ordering process fast and smooth. as long as you're ordering chicken, you get your food immediately. there is usually a staffer walking around cleaning, wiping tables. chicken is consistent and good, taste the same as other popeyes. there is a refill soda machine for those who drink a lot. there are also TVs showing NY1 with sound. the bathrooms are not the cleanest and need to be buzzed in but are passable. I like popeyes chicken and think this store is better than the canal st location. on the negative side, there are some sketchy clientele will go to this popeyes.",,,
21,Ron C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1386,1158,1998,2.0,1/31/2012,"Popeye's in Chinatown!? What else is next.... Dallas BBQ? I was really surprised to see that this opened in Chinatown. I have nothing against Popeye's, but Chinatown has A LOT of food to offer. The last place I would go to is Popeye's. Why did I come in here? Honestly I was thirsty and had to take a piss. Thank you Popeye's for your Hawaiian Punch and Flushing Toilets!",4,5,2
22,Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",391,741,425,2.0,9/18/2013,"Popeyes is so disgusting. I just wanted to curb my crave for chicken. I honestly like KFC better. I know what I'm getting up front  and if you can find a KFC selling spicy chicken you hit the jackpot. The spices are packed within the meat, not the skin plus it's actually spicy. My spicy chicken from Popeyes tasted like regular chicken. An old person with a low tolerance for spicy foods could handle what I ordered. Another thing I don't like about Popeyes is the fact that their rice and beans were once rice, hog maw and beans. Back when they actually HAD the actual ingredients online.That's a very important ingredient that should be SPECIFIED. I guess hog maw and beans don't sound as appealing as rice and beans yeah? Well now it's just ham hocks. I have friends who are vegetarians smh. Anyway two starts for the biscuits and honey and how quickly the line moved.",,,
23,Jimmy R.,"New York, NY",26,98,65,4.0,7/21/2014,This Popeyes Chicken is on the money their service is great food is hot and have some hot Asian chicks working here,,,6
24,Samy A.,"Edison, NJ",77,72,27,3.0,6/25/2015,Customer service is okay considering it's a fast food joint. Sometimes the customer service drops when its busy. They make you pay 25 cents for extra sauce which is a little weird or no sauce at all if your meal isn't a combo. Food is good most of the time.,,,
25,Laura P.,"New York, NY",93,144,53,1.0,12/7/2011,"The first time I came here, I was nastily told that they ran out of crawfish after a new batch just came out by their general manager - Jacqueline. So I asked when will a new batch of it come out (I was actually speaking to the cashier that was talking to me while the general manager stood next to him) and she bitched in our faces ""NO NO WE HAVE NO MORE WE RAN OUT I JUST TOLD YOU THAT"". Well excuse me. When popeyes says they ""run out"" of something you assume it's because they have just sold the last of what they just made, not that they had no more in the back.I feel sorry for the guy she screamed at, what a total bitch. Chill the fuck out. I live nearby so this store would be a convenience for me. Because of this incident I rather take my business elsewhere, to the one by the Manhattan bridge or even the other one closer to the Lincoln tunnel. It's inappropriate to be screaming like that, and if she has shit with her fellow employees and coworkers, she should be taking care of that in private - not in front of me.",2,,
26,Mark B.,"Astoria, NY",271,100,355,3.0,2/21/2014,"It's just ok. It's fast food, friend chicken, mash potatoes, etc. It's a little messy, the service was fast. The location is convenient. The food was just ok",,1,
27,Tamanna R.,"New York, NY",41,122,45,3.0,5/20/2014,"Typical fast food joint, but somewhat crowded, probably because it's located in Chinatown. I came in to find the line almost out the door, but was surprised by how fast it moved and how fast the staff worked. They were pretty nice, too. However, the biscuits I ordered were really salty.",,,
28,Deeandra D.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,74,12,1.0,6/28/2013,"At first it was alright, but now its like they put two pounds of salt, they are really not thinking about the people who have high blood pressure, we like to eat, but don't want to have a stroke after or during our meal..Salty, Salty and Salty..",,,
29,J. N.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,6,0,3.0,9/18/2013,"I love Popeyes. I also love most other fast food places in the city. I come to this Popeyes once or twice a month, and the service is very fast, and the employees are always ready to work. Thats 4 stars right there. However, there is one thing that bothers me every single time I come to this Popeyes; the Music.Every time I come in, they are playing a CD/USB/Youtube playlist of an artist who covers other peoples music. I believe its Alex Goot, a youtube star. Whatever that means. This is the reason I am knocking off the star. Sitting there, I just CANT AVOID the music. Its there. Its everlasting. It makes me want to leave Popeyes every single time. I just rush my meal and leave.I dare you to go through 3 songs in one sitting.  It'll put your sanity into question.The saddest part of it all? That I go to Popeyes when I am in the middle of Chinatown. Considering that there are tons of delicious food I can consume, I choose to come here. I mean, how ridiculous am I?",,,
30,John B.,"North Adams, MA",0,30,0,2.0,8/2/2013,I love Popeyes. This one had fair service and stale fries. Popcorn shrimp weren't entirely fresh either.,,,
