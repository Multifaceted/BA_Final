0,Shaun M.,"St. Louis, MO",42,36,14,4.0,11/15/2018,"SoHo Room was a refreshing to find in the middle of the neighborhood after a long/cold walk in New York City. The bartender was very nice, large selection of drinks and classic bar feeling. It has good beer prices and looks like a prefect place to catch a hockey game or college football game. I didn't get the chance to try the food but I couldn't beat the 16 oz beer prices of Budweiser when I stopped through on my way to the airport.",,,
1,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,1.0,7/15/2018,"I eagerly came into the bar to watch the World Cup, but didn't stay long due to the atrocious attitude from the waiter. I don't like to give 1 star reviews, but I think potential patrons should know what to expect from this establishment. I was originally seated in the front and scoped the back to relocate for an open seat with a better view of the game. The waiter followed me and with a very snarky, reprimanding attitude said, ""you can't just go sit at another table. You need to tell me."" There's much nicer ways to communicate this to your patrons. I immediately left because of his rudeness and unprofessionalism.",1,1,
2,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,3.0,11/1/2018,"Following several hours of volunteer work next door, a meetup group and I made our way here for a round of drinks and a bite to eat.

3,Carrie B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,85,1,1.0,11/17/2018,"Bar literally had a string to pull the toilet to flush - yes a string! Im not in college and this is ridiculous. I asked the bartender about it and he said its been like that forever - what? Like most of these reviews that say the bartender is rude he said his name is Mike, at our visit we could see - he looses this bar business. He told this lady not to sit at the bar where she wanted, so that two OPEN seats could remain Open in case there happened ....to be a couple there to come in? Who does that? It was so rude. Let the lady by herself sit where she wants to! He is just obnoxious  . And while you think oh well , i will still go, its not worth hassling with him and his attitude apparently everyone who works in the back hates him too we somehow overheard a lot of complaining after we moved seats. If you go - sit in the back and dont go to the bathroom. We ended up at the broome street dive bar, better dive, sweet bartender and normal toilets.",,,
4,Lissette C.,"New York, NY",842,105,42,5.0,7/19/2018,My favorite neighborhood bar. The food is surprisingly amazing and the staff is so approachable. It's exactly the place you want to go for a reasonably priced drink in SOHO and great food. There's something for everyone! (PS: Great late night bar for just the vibe to have a great conversation and meet some cool people!),,,

Updated review","I stopped in here for a snack and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the wait staff was.  I'm not from NYC but you hear that everybody is rude and after randomly speaking to people on the street and no one speaking back, it was refreshing to get help from Michael.  The turkey burger was really good and the brews were hella cold and sudsy!!",,,
6,Sharlene A.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"The most terrible experience I've had at any bar. The bartender, Cherie, seemed either high or borderline drunk. I waited 10 minutes before changing spots and looking at her, for her to realize consciously I needed her service. Aside from that, she overcharged and couldn't lucidly remember my drinks accurately. NEVER AGAIN!",1,1,

9,Andy G.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,9,4,1.0,1/5/2018,"Bar seemed OK on entry - fairly chilled with an average selection of mainstream beers. However they have - hands down - the rudest bar staff we encountered during our trip to NY. Bad attitude, dirty looks, slow service and staff even started an argument with one of our group. Looking at other reviews, seems this is a regular complaint.Do yourself a solid and avoid this place, there are many, MANY better & more welcoming bars nearby.",1,2,
10,Sabrina S.,"Danbury, CT",0,4,0,3.0,9/30/2018,The bar is cool but seriously don't eat here! The food is awful and actually made me sick. I know that because I came there to eat after work and didn't even drink. But definitely a cool place just for drinks!,,,

I've been a bartender in the city for a while and he is an exemplar. Thank you for your amazing ability to be personable when you have a full bar. Your trainee was on it and amazing because of your ability to differentiate priorities. This is the best stop to go when you're shopping. Local, yet welcoming. Grab a beer and some food yo!!!",,,1
13,Samantha S.,"New York, NY",133,7,0,1.0,2/24/2018,"Not happy. I walked in with a large party, which the bartender should have been excited d for. He was not.

Hospitality: neighborly, witty, engaged and personable.Michael, the Bartender, makes you feel at ease, objective, non-judgmental, and very witty.Quality: comfort food was satisfying (chicken nuggets and spinach artichoke dip was fabulous). The ambiance was the main reason for an enjoyable evening. -Michelle and Jordan ;)",,,
15,Marc S.,"Pelham, Pelham Manor, NY",122,1,0,1.0,8/22/2018,"I can only imagine that the reason the woman who works as a bartender here during the day has her job is because she knows a owner maybe? Because she is so unpleasant. I've been to this bar twice. The first time I overheard her verbally attack a customer after he didn't finish his last slice of pizza. Calling him a ""p***y"". The second time (Walking in I assumed she would have been fired by then) she was EXTREMELY rude as soon as I walked in.",,1,
16,Sydne Y.,"Paxton, IL",0,2,0,2.0,6/28/2018,"Coming into SoHo Room the atmosphere is nice except for my rude waiter! I ordered the bruschetta which was not very good at all. The bread was not very toasted, and it was literally loaded with straight tomatoes. There wasn't much seasoning or flavor there. The Philly Cheese Steak according to my dad was ""alright"". Great atmosphere from the customers, not great food.",,,

I always order the nachos and the chicken tenders. Their house amber ale is good too. I get a Stella every time. Prices are fair. Service is great. Most of all Stacy is awesome.

20,Kelsey A.,"New York, NY",173,18,3,5.0,4/12/2018,"Great spot for happy hour drinks and some appetizers. Mike the bartender is the best! Decent size bar in the front with plenty of additional seating in the back - even for bigger parties.

21,Helen M.,"Rahway, NJ",23,8,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"It doesn't even deserve 1 star.

22,Carolyn A.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,94,123,4.0,5/12/2017,A great place to get a casual drink and a nibble. We had our usual captain and diet and Bruschetta. The food was fresh and tasty. The waiter was a bit aloof but I figured it's the area of town.  A great place for a drink.,,,
23,Devan B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",67,1,0,5.0,7/1/2018,"We were in town for 3 nights and hit this place twice. Wings, fries, and mozzarella sticks were good enough that we had to eat them twice.

24,Rachel D.,"Manhattan, NY",9,4,1,1.0,7/27/2017,A local bar in soho that is located on the corner and has a towny feel to it. Its right near the E train so its a good stop before going back home.The staff and bar staff are not friendly at all. They knew that we weren't from around the area and didnt make us feel welcomed. I wouldn't come here unless you know the staff personally.,,,
25,Allison G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/23/2017,"I was refused entry to this bar because I had a sign from the woman's March that referenced that I was gay. The owner of this bar is a trump supporter. Don't give your money to this bar. There are a lot of nicer bars in the area. Bartender with one earring (in the gay ear lol) had zero respect for me when I confronted him about kicking me out. His reason for refusing me entry was because ""I might be a neo nazi"" and told me it wasn't a gay thing. Also, he's not homophobic because ""he has a niece that's gay and lots of gay friends"". Boycott this bar, boycott that bartender. Go to this bar and start trouble if you want but don't give them your money",10,5,3

27,Shelley P.,"New York, NY",0,31,0,2.0,1/4/2018,"Have been in a few times and want to like it, but it's not good. The table service was unpleasant (as in overtly rude rather than simply standoffish), and the waiter took away our food (twice!) while we were obviously still eating. We had to call after him to get it back. The bar service was much better.Food is below average. I've had the quesadilla, bacon/blue cheese burger, and nachos but wouldn't order any of them again. Cheeseburger was overcooked with one dry, burnt piece of bacon and about a 1/4 tsp of blue cheese. The nachos came with a small side of what looked like microwaved Velveeta and Rotel. Beer selection is fine though limited and standard.I work a block away, and my pick-up is frequently on the corner. I'd rather wait outside in the heat or cold than spend $ inside.",,,
28,Audrey H.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,1.0,10/19/2017,"Same experience with other reviewers, worse service ever , the server gave us attitude when he senses we are not from the area , and the thing pisses me off the most is that he even took away my glasses of water when we are still sitting there talking ,  wtf , stay away from this place !",,,
29,Caroline H.,"Tallahassee, FL",335,290,76,4.0,1/6/2017,"I stayed nearby in Soho and started a few of my evenings having appetizers and drinks.

34,Ali K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/29/2017,"I feel compelled to write this review after being a semi-regular customer of three years. To start with, lets set expectations. This is not a speakeasy, high-end bar with mixologists or a trendsetting spot. It is a bar. An old school bar.That being said - it is actually one of the most welcoming atmospheres. I feel compelled to clarify based on recent reviews that this place is definitely not homophobic nor racist in any sense of the words.I know of at least one bar tender and multiple customers who are minorities and/or gay/lesbian/alternately identifying. Any reviews suggesting bias on such basis are utter nonsense and covering bruised egos or stemming from misunderstandings by people understandably running on high levels of emotions based on recent on all sides.Now lets get to the reality of this bar. The drinks are amazing for the price ($7-8 well happy hours in SoHo? Not really happening else where. Decent $10 lunch specials are basically unheard of in the area as well). The food is good for what it is, which is a solid neighborhood bar. I'm not going to lie and say its a 5 star gourmet because its not, but the flank steak and a few other specific dishes are out of this world, just don't come here expecting to have a Michelin chef in the kitchen.What really gives SoHo Room its amazing environment is the literal diversity of staff and customers. You have people from all walks of life with all different perspectives. What everyone who comes here has in common is respect of each other. We leave politics and drama at the door. Newcomers are constantly welcomed and made to feel at home. I've made numerous friends and acquaintances here.Is it sometimes loud? Definitely. Can it be overly packed? Of course. Is service iffy sometimes? Sure its a bar and like most bars when it hits peak waves of people the staff are scrambling, but if you simply voice your issue they are pretty solid at getting it fixed for you.If you're looking for a 5 Star dining experience and an ultra chic bar, than you most likely would rate this place a 1-2 Star. If you're looking for an amazing bar experience with laid back customers and staff who just like to enjoy life - you'd rate it a 5 and make this place an extension of your living room.",5,1,2
35,Frank L.,"Staten Island, NY",4,29,9,4.0,7/26/2016,"This past Saturday, I was in the neighborhood and had some time to kill.  Being that I like food and drinks, it made sense to kill the time in this nearby watering hole.  I sit at the bar on a hot and balmy Saturday afternoon, and the climate control is blowing beautifully.  The bartender, (I believe his name was Noel) introduces himself.  He quickly pours my drink and cracks a few jokes keeping the mood light.Being that this is a neighborhood bar does not mean it is MY neighborhood bar.  Regardless of that the bartender made me feel welcome.  I can tell he had a great rapport with the customers as he greeted each one by name, sometimes nickname.  The waiter was also a nice guy and they had a great camaraderie. Being that it was lunchtime, I ask for a menu, and for his suggestion.  He tells me to get the flank steak.  I take his advice, and really enjoyed my lunch.  I believe it was like $10 for a nice sized portion.  I would of liked to stay longer, but I needed to stay sober.  Would I go out of my way to eat or drink here again? Being that I live nowhere near here, probably not.  But I will make a point to stop by when I am in this section of town (which is every few months or so).Thanks for the hospitality.",,,

Since we're from the UK this place was particularly endearing, I think it's the decor? I had a brooklyn lager and my girlfriend ordered a shandy. I've never had so much fun explaining what a shandy is (if you order one she may spell it chandy, but that's ok right!?), who knew they don't have shandy over here!! I also had a gin and tonic, here i learnt the lesson ""you don't need a double in new york"", it was 80% gin, and still delicious.  Finally I sampled their (not inconsiderable) whisky selection. Also extremely good (but ask for a double, it'll put you in a good mood ) Definitely visit this place if you're after a few drinks. It's a little gem.",,,

46,Daniel C.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,0,1.0,11/4/2015,"I regret coming here, it seemed like a chill place, but the servers weren't good and the food was even worse.To get to the point: I ordered the Soho Chicken, which looked amazing on the menu: Chicken, olives, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, etc... What it turned out to be was a gristly chicken cutlet with ALL CANNED/JARRED black olives, pickled artichokes, sundried tomates, and sauce. It wouldn't have been so bad, but it was $17. What a waste. I had a few bites and couldn't handle the rest, only disappointment followed.The hostess was nice, but the manager and server/waiter/busser dude seemed to have beef between them. They were both wearing Budweiser polo shirts, the kind distribution companies give out for free, so it gave the impression of a sports dive bar. The waiter even made us feel bad for not eating all the food we ordered. Our tab came to be $200 for about 6 people with tip and I think it would have been better spent anywhere else.Advice to management: Serve a smaller range of food; you have mexican, italian, and many others. Focus on some more simple bar food, don't try to impress everyone because it will only disappoint. Also, be friendly to customers, but don't make them feel bad for not eating food that doesn't taste good. If anything, offer them something else if you can tell they didn't enjoy it. Finally, don't wear free shirts, it cheapens the vibe and makes me question things, especially when I ordered a $17 entree.",1,,

I should really know better than to go for a mojito at a place like this, but all their signs were forcing me to be adventurous. I should have stopped my order when the bar tender mentioned she doesn't like to make mojitos, but I insisted on having my favorite drink only to be hopelessly let down. I should have gone with my gut and headed to Botanica, there was nothing but mediocrity crawling out of SoHo Room.",,,
50,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,4.0,8/23/2015,"I'm usually not one to agree with everyone... but I do. It's a very easy-going, very unpretentious, bar. The back room-- more restaurant than bar-- is large and good for groups. As the night progresses, your server may change (we had three), but they're all friendly, with good smiles and a shared fine sense of humor. The sliders and wings were both nice, if not spectacular. My only complaint is that, in a large plate of sliders (I think there were a half dozen... maybe 10), you could not mix the meat... all beef.. all pork... all whatever. It's a sample plate that you can't sample!     -- Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers, a different bar every week",,,1

Of course I ""Yelped"" this joint before I even stepped foot inside and I have to say, my fellow Yelpers are right on: This place isn't the cream of the crop. The crowd was a mix of young couples on dates, girls gabbing and gossiping, and suits after work. Was I weirded out? No. Would I return? Yeah, if in the area. But this spot isn't a MUST visit. It's a ""if you happen to pass by"" kind joint. I ordered beer on tap and paid cash. The bartender was superficially sweet. She ordered a massive calzone for delivery during her shift and ate it in front of me with the massive box hanging off the bar. Not cute, not appropriate, and not up to my standards.

There are tables and banquettes in the back room for dining, and barstools in the front for drinking. Bass is $5.50 on tap, and at 6PM this past Monday evening the place was ripe for people-watching: a revolving door of weirdo regulars that seem almost out of place for the neighborhood, office-types out to unwind, and tourists galore. The bartender has a great rack (is that OK to say on Yelp?) and the cocktail server has great pipes (boy that girl can sing). A good place to chill and be left alone, but I imagine you'd have no trouble striking up a conversation with one of the aforementioned characters, if you were so inclined.I ate here once (in the back room; I was with picky eaters and this is what we settled on); I don't remember anything we ate, but I don't recall it being terrible.

122,Shaina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,71,17,1.0,12/4/2007,"My friends went to this place on Saturday night under the assumption that it was still 203 Spring Street.  Since we were a large group, we decided to stay as the back room is big and open.  Annnnd that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place.  I had never been to the former 203, so I can't compare, but the ""new"" space is about as lackluster and mediocre as you can get.  Over priced drinks in tiny glasses?  Yep.  Bad jukebox?  Check.  Single-person bathrooms?  Of course!  I have never encountered such horrible bar service...and I'm someone who tries to give the entire service industry a good deal of credit, even when it's not deserved, simply because I know it's not an easy job.There was a young guy working the bar [which wasn't overly busy or crowded].  I ordered a simple well drink.  I paid my $9 for it, left a tip and as I sipped it and came to the realization that there was absolutely no liquor in it, another friend was making her way back to the bar to make the same complaint about her drink.  I politely asked the bartender if he could add a little more vodka - he added about 1/32nd of a shot glass more into it.  When you're paying $9 for a drink with well liquor in it [which probably costs about $2 for the entire bottle] what's the point of chintzing on the liquor?  Are you trying to piss off your customers and make no money?  You're pouring it into a clear, glass cup...I can see exactly how much [or little] booze I'm getting and I certainly didn't turn 21 yesterday.    I figured I couldn't go wrong with a margarita for my second drink - might as well cut to the chase with some tequila.  As I waited for at the bar for my drink, I watched as he slammed the glass down on the bar in front of me, so the drink spilled all over the sides.  No straw.  No napkin.  Not even a lime.  Good thing I don't take salt.  My friend reached across the side of the bar to grab a straw for me to which the bartender nastily replied ""Yea, just help yourself.""  What's the point of working in a service industry when you hate people?  I tipped him because I'm NOT an asshole, but I will never return to this bar again.   Waste of time and money.  Spend your hard-earned [or, if you're one of the lucky ones, inherited] cash elsewhere.  Even if it's on a midget hooker with tiny arms [don't ask], your money would be better spent.",1,,
123,jon c.,"Orinda, CA",10,47,0,1.0,2/5/2008,"I used to come to the previous incarnation of this bar when it was under different ownership and called 203 Spring, which I loved and went to very often. After a three year hiatus (I moved to London), I met some friends here last weekend and was absolutely appalled at what the new ownership has done.This is possibly the worst bar I've been to in Manhattan and one of the worst I've been to anywhere. It's a conflation of posh Manhattan bar (expensive drinks - $15 mojitos if I recall, not that I ordered one) and crapass local pub (multiple TVs playing hockey during prime weekend barhopping hours, terrible dirt rock played in a non ironic way). The service is indifferent and borderline incompetent; the drinks are weak and expensive; the music is crap; the decor is tired; and the crowd is rubbish.Avoid at all costs.",1,,
124,Erin K.,"Dublin, OH",18,96,0,3.0,5/2/2011,"I liked this place.  After having dinner at Kittichai we walked to Soho Room.  The front bar area was pretty crowded but they had a nice back room with a big long couch along the wall, compfy chairs and it wasn't crowded.  We just chilled back there and had a few drinks.  Service was good and music was decent.  Would definitely recommend.",,,
125,Ali S.,"Providence, RI",22,90,22,3.0,3/24/2013,good for a diner. the chicken tenders were crisp and tender. the grilled chicken was surprisingly flavorful. not a fan of the ranch or bbq sauce,,,
126,Robert T.,"New York, NY",112,121,0,3.0,4/12/2009,"Decent neighborhood bar without the attitude that some of its nearby Soho bars possess.They have a good $5 wine and beer happy hour special, with tasty snacks as well.It's a bit on the narrow side, so unless you snag a spot at the bar, or the small bar tables behind, you may be best off  moving on.The bar menu has burgers, quesadillas, etc.",,,
127,Katia X.,"Phoenixville, PA",0,18,0,1.0,3/20/2013,"Stick to drinks.  I got a salad here and it was disgusting - it's pretty hard to screw up a salad, but the tomatoes were mealy, the lettuce was iceberg, and there was no dressing.  They seemed really confused about the dressing, though eventually oil and vinegar was brought.",,,
128,Jason T.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/3/2013,"Ok i get it your not a sports bar, but if 98%(regulars) of your customers is requesting to hear the game just for that 1 night mind you im talking about just the last 5min of a basketball game shouldn't  this be accommodated? Then on top of that you have a bartender CRYSTAL who was just loud rude and probably shouldn't be at the bar. Soho Room is so convenient for me and my staff but after that experience why invest my time and money? Not for me.",,,
129,Lily N.,"New York, NY",94,189,34,3.0,5/11/2009,"Nice ambiance, but I didn't really see any happy hour specials. It's a nice/ quiet enough place to chill and have conversations with people after work.",1,1,1
130,Jim C.,"Yonkers, NY",52,105,18,3.0,3/7/2010,The best salmon burger I ever had. The beer prices are great for the Soho area which in general is way over priced. Good service and a nice crowd.,,,
131,Traci D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",226,717,21,2.0,5/24/2008,I was not impressed with SoHo Room.  The beer was expensive and it was very cold inside and not crowded.  That's all I can remember about the place.  Oh I think there was a boy who was like drinking and doing calculus homework who got annoyed with me because I accidentally took his seat but moved once I realized my error.,2,2,2
132,Adam G.,"San Leandro, CA",7,16,0,1.0,1/20/2009,I work around the corner and have stopped in from time to time. It's a bar- they serve booze- simple. Today our entire office decended upon the bar to grab a drink and watch Obama be sworn in.  The bartender was a complete a-hole threatening to turn off the TV's if people did not continue to order drinks. I've never seen more than 4 drunks at noon in that place let a lone 100+ people. They should have been happy to have the business they had and focused on making an impression to gain repeat business. Most people in my office will never step foot in that place again... and we were probably the only group that spent any money.,1,1,
133,Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",440,973,42,3.0,9/3/2008,"This was a decent little bar in SoHo.  I had long island tea after long island tea and before I knew it, I forgot where the nearest subway station was and had to take a cab back.  The drinks were very good and I liked the environment.  Prices of alcohol in the city are outrageous but it's worth it in my opinion.",1,1,1
134,Austin V.,"New York, NY",46,379,126,2.0,11/3/2007,"At one time, this place was knows as the no name bar or on your CC statement, 203 Spring.  It's now Soho room and well, it sux.  All the flavor, character and life of this place has been sucked out and replaced with cheap, boring and non-eventful space and material.  If you just want a place to go and pass time, its serviceable but I don't recommend going here anymore...",1,,1
135,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7750,14306,2.0,1/31/2010,"Nothing great by any means, but edible and drinkable. Trainee bartender may have coined the term ""you're very welcome"", but wasn't quite as intrusive as her trainer/boss. Not a fan of the non-itemized bill for sit-down ""dining"", but it happens. Wasn't planning to go here by any means and literally Yelped it when we walked in and almost walked out, but it was mediocre enough on a strip of allegedly top-notch gastronomical indulgences.",,,
136,Ron S.,"NY, NY",13,111,0,3.0,4/9/2007,"Used to be a great place to grab a drink or two, particularly late night after a long evening out. The back room was perfect, with dim lighting, good music, low slung seats and decent cocktails for decent prices (by SoHo standards, anyways). Sounds like the perfect spot to get intimate and up-close, and it was, until about 5 or 6 months ago. They re-did the inside, put up TV screens and changed the layout of the back room into a more cookie-cutter restaurant-and-tables environment, which totally kills the cool dive lounge atmosphere it had going for it at first. I'd have rated the original set-up at least 4 stars, but the most it deserves now is 3, and even that might be artificially buoyed by what I remember it as...sad to see a great place go.",1,,1
137,Tiffany D.,"Manhattan, NY",698,331,23,3.0,8/17/2009,"I was waiting on a group of friends for dinner and so we needed a bar that was close by. We stopped by here and I was pleasantly surprised at the decor inside. After you walk past the initial ""bar""-y atmosphere there was a lounge in the back with candles and nice couches/chairs.  My friends huddled in the corner.. had a round of shots and some drinks. Our waitress was super nice and even told me NOT to get the X-Rated Flirtini and recommended the White Cosmo. It was delish!",,,
138,Kortnee B.,"NY, NY",21,47,8,3.0,3/4/2007,"They were able to quickly accommodate our party of 12 with a large corner very oddly decorated back area ('cause the place was pretty dead).  It's Soho for Pete's sake, I don't expect the decor of a tacky banquet hall.  Good drink & wine selection.  A chill, loungy setting, the club music they were playing didn't seem appropriate.",1,,
139,Nick in NY C.,"New York, NY",8,67,6,3.0,11/7/2009,Fun little place.  Local joint.  Nice new waiter started on first day here.  Not a bad place.  Definitely a local joint.,,,
140,Jenny S.,"New York, NY",26,76,1,2.0,2/7/2008,"eh. there's really nothing too special about it. unless you count the fact that they serve pizza late night - but unless you're drunk, this pizza tastes like a microwaved frozen tombstone. my slightly-tipsy amiga thought the pizza was great, but my sober/opinionated tastebuds were not diggin it. blech. the front looks like your normal everyday pub, and the back opens up into more of a lounge area. the drinks are way too expensive for a bar with not much character or ambiance. they do have a couple of cool drink choices though, like the blueberry mojito, but our waitress was kinda non-existant. i did like the fact that the back room was pretty big, so you could go there with a group and sit. but i'd only recommend this place if you're roaming around and need a place to grab a drink quickly and can't find something more suitable. it's a shoe-in for that, considering it was a friday night around 11pm and it was prettttty damn empty. my recommendation, go a couple blocks over to bleecker and hit up some of those random bars, they at least have more character (and live music) than this joint.",,,1
141,B D.,"New York, NY",49,57,3,3.0,6/10/2011,"This is NOT the Soho House...thank God! Or a pretentious Soho lounge. It's just a real nice and comfortable bar in Soho.
