0,Kseniya K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",209,93,335,4.0,10/17/2018,"Been passing by this place on my way to and from work for a year now and always wanted to visit. Finally got the chance one Saturday evening when we were looking for last minute dinner plans before a Broadway show.  Walked in at 6pm without a reservation. Located inside a nice hotel, next to ""Second"" Restaurant. The space was half empty, but apparently everything inside was reserved. The hostess was nice to notify us that we could take a table inside, but have to leave at 7 once guests who reserved it would show up. We said that we'll likely be done by 7:15-7:30. After a minute hesitation, we were seated. (The couple who reserved the table showed up at 6:55, and they were seated at a nearby table. We were never asked or bothered regarding that).There is indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor is fancier, while outdoor is simpler and much more loud, as you'll be dining on one of the busiest, most crowded streets of the city. We chose the cozy, dimly lit, more intimate indoor seating. Definitely felt a bit upscale. Good for a special occasion, a nice date, or a fancy outing with friends & family. The only complaint we had about our experience was the service, which was extremely slow. Before we ordered, our waitress checked in with us around four times [we were having a hard time deciding]. But once we finally ordered, it took around 15 minutes to get our food. Was it the kitchen that had a problem with making one pizza? When we wanted to order more, we had to look for our waitress for a long while. Which was a trend for our entire evening here. Our waitress was busy, the place was filling up, and our entire meal was stretched out beyond reason because we couldn't get a hold of staff to help us. Felt frustrating because we kept looking at the clock, as we had a show to attend afterwards. Not a very relaxing experience.The dinner menu options were surprisingly sparse. My bf and I were at loss for what to get, as we weren't in the mood for pasta dishes [which consisted of a good portion of the menu]. We went with that night's special for pizza (mushroom and sweet sausage), white mushroom pizza ($23), and a side of cauliflower ($11). The special pizza was tasty and fragrant [yaaay for truffle oil]. Had wild mushrooms, sweet sausage, and mozzarella chunks. White pizza--no sauce, which would've been helpful in this case, to make the pizza less dry. Didn't feel like that was worth $24. The white mushroom pizza with sage and fontina was definitely our favorite. White pizza as well, but it was juicier than the special pizza. The truffle paste on top of bountiful mushrooms was a perfect touch. Very fragrant and delicious.The side of cauliflower baked with capers and pecorino cheese was the meal highlight. So simple, yet one of the best cauliflower renditions I've ever had. The cauliflower was tender, not overcooked or too charred. It was baked in pecorino, topped with capers, which gave a perfect salty-golden taste to the typically bland vegetable. Definitely worth a try--you won't find something like it elsewhere. Pretty big portion for a side. Good to share. Will fill you up. Dessert looked amazing, but unfortunately we didn't have time to try it, we were afraid to be late for our show and the services has been very slow the entire evening, so we didn't want to risk it. Definitely would want to return to try the dessert though. Probably during brunch, when the menu seems more extensive. Overall, pleasant ambiance and potentially nice experience, which unfortunately felt rushed due to super slow service. Prices are higher than reasonable for the portions and the food, but you're in midtown Manhattan, smack center touristy spot, so be prepared.",2,1,2
1,Alyssa G.,"Manhattan, NY",32,134,407,1.0,11/14/2018,"I decided to have an intimate birthday dinner here after a successful first visit. I am so disappointed that I chose to do so. I felt extremely uncomfortable from start to finish because one of my guests was running late in the beginning. I did not mind and made it very clear one would be late, but L'Amico was very bothered by it and almost gave my table away and cancel my reservation even tho the rest of the party is here. My waitress gave us an attitude because of it. Super enjoyable. The highlight of the night is when the check is on the table during our first five seconds of our entrees. The manager and waitress decided they were canceling our ability for dessert because they had another table coming in after us. Even when I questioned it they said no. Really? That's horrible customer service. ""This is not a fast food restaurant. The food will be out when it's out."" - waitress exact quote. They run an uptight ship- not relaxed, not enjoyable at all. Restaurants are a place to come together and enjoy your meal and conversation. You've successfully failed. Never again.",2,,
2,Norman K.,"Great Neck, NY",0,6,0,3.0,10/22/2018,"Chose this place to have dinner with a couple we knew over the phone but had never met before. Wanted a place where we could relax and talk. So we chose L'Amico:  I pass it often on my way to work and figured it's in a hotel (Eventi), should be a safe choice for a Saturday night.My bad, in the sense I should have checked. Eventi hotel was, in a word, frenetic, especially on this Saturday evening. To be fair, the food was very good/excellent, service was efficient, friendly, informative and unobtrusive and the prices, while a bit high, did not take advantage of diners as some other touristy places do. Loved that part of it. But the restaurant is small and NOISY. Double-whammy, as even though we were seated far from the bar and entrance (right in front of the open kitchen) it was almost impossible to carry on a decent conversation. To get to the restroom you needed a guide to escort you through the hotel's bar.On a quieter night, definitely four or five star, but this experience was really disappointing from an overall ""enjoyability"" perspective. I guess I'm just too old to appreciate the hip vibe of this location.",2,,
3,Lola G.,"Laguna Beach, CA",2,148,33,1.0,11/16/2018,"I cannot believe how horrible this place is. When you walk in it seems like it's the place to be. We asked for a table and were told it was a two hr wait. Well, we waited. 2 hrs went by and nothing. We walked up just to find two pretty girls asking for a table and were seated immediately. After another 15 min wait, we were seated. Well, we sat right next to the hostess stand. We saw regular people being told the wait was 2 hr and above to attractive people or women dressed for a night out, seated immediately. The horror didn't end there. The menu was bad and the food worse. Our server David was a total dick.  Visited us three times. One time to as what we wanted to drink. My husband asked for a recommendation of a good Cabernet. First, he told us they only had 1 red wine and it was a blend. After trying it and is telling him it was bitter, he said ""well, all wines are bitter. That's all we have.""  Really, because you originally brought me a whole book of wines. He came by a second time to take our order then lastly when we had to flag him down for the bill. He acted as if we should be lucky we were there but to be honest, so did the hostess. She was cold and clearly is picking and choosing who gets to eat there. I've never experienced such pretentious service. We travel to NY often and always heard of this type of stuff  happening at restaurants, bars and clubs but this was our first taste of it. Attached is what's left of the maybe 6 inch pizza that was almost all burned. How do you serve that?  We would never come back here.",1,,
4,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",269,184,372,4.0,9/30/2018,"Solid brunch spot and perfect for the spring/autumn months. I've been here a couple times alone and it's always been really great (service, food, ambience). The main dining room is beautiful on a good weather day (open kitchen and walls/street side seating, light music but nothing loud so conversations still feasible at normal volumes). There's also always just the right amount of people here - enough so I can blend in as a solo diner comfortably and not feel like staff are watching me haha but not so much that it feels crowded or prevents me from being seated immediately. In terms of the food, if you pick the right options it's on par with other super popular and more highly rated brunch spots in the city. The scrambled eggs are on point - perfect texture, on top of bread that's been drizzled with balsamic or some sort of vinaigrette. So so good. And the side salad is super fresh/light. Pancakes are another one of my favs off the brunch menu. Didn't get it this time so no photo to share, but they're light and fluffy. Not too sweet. If you're hungrier and want something more filling - get the pastas.",1,,1
5,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,4.0,9/3/2018,"I enjoyed my experience at L'Amico. The restaurant has a trendy and lively atmosphere. My boyfriend and I shared the mushroom truffle pizza, which I really enjoyed. It is a white pizza which I also prefer to traditional red sauce, but fair warning it does have a lot mushrooms on it, so don't order if you don't really like mushrooms. For my entree I also got the pasta special that was kind of a creamy fettuccine carbonara with corn, which I really enjoyed. Texture of the pasta is important, and L'Amico nailed it. My boyfriend got the chicken for his meal and thought it was just okay. Service was very friendly. You do likely need a reservation, but they aren't hard to come by on open table. Prices are moderate to slightly expensive with pastas $20+.",2,1,2
6,Esther S.,"Manhattan, NY",290,147,387,4.0,9/5/2018,"Really cute place to dine at especially in the summer time when you can either sit outside, or by the window where you get tons of sunlight.The food is definitely on the pricier though even for lunch.For the table we shared the white mushroom pizza which was delicious and came with a chili oil that added the perfect kick.I had the omelette souffle and it was perfectly cooked- very light and fluffy. However, I'm not a fan of blue cheese so although the taste wasn't overwhelming inside the omelette, I would've asked for another cheese instead.My friend had the Pipe Rigate (bolognese) which looked really good and he said it was amazing! When I go back, I will definitely try this dish or another pasta!",2,,1
7,Richard L.,"Queens, NY",825,717,14,3.0,9/4/2018,"This Italian Restaurant inside the Eventi Hotel is good modern italian restaurant specializing in upper class traditional Italian food using techniques not easily duplicated in the home kitchen.  I have to admit the food was tasty, but not my favorites spot and since the portions were kind of small, i was left somewhat hungry.  What was good was the cocktails that we had for happy hour i think we had an Old Fashion and something else both were strong without being harsh and delicious without being overly sweet.  They were just about as perfect as a drink can get. The whole thing had a pretty big price tag, but that's what you get at these kind of places.",1,1,1
8,Dasle K.,"New York, NY",668,275,1667,4.0,5/9/2018,"Lovely dinner here last night with a group of friends! Incredible atmosphere, solid food and cocktails, and great service.First, cocktails. I loved both the non classico spritz and the ""Artichoked""! They were light and refreshing and not too sweet.We did family style and shared everything (as I always do whenever possible):- Pasta: We got the Pipe Rigate (veal shoulder bolognese, parmesan), Tortiglioni (spicy sausage, bitter greens, pignoli, pecorino sardo) and they were so good! I loved the spicy sausage. - The white mushroom pizza was AMAZING. This is a must, along with charred cauliflower! - The branzino and wood oven roasted chicken were both solid. Highly recommended for small group dinners! Note - they don't seat you until your entire party arrives.",5,1,3

There is ""outdoor"" seating when they open the wall/windows on nice weather days.The food is bomb too! We ordered:- Iced coffee - Uova Besciamella - Cotechino Hash- Specialty pizza of the day (4 cheese with peppers and a fried egg)The pizza was to die for! The Uova was very satisfying too. My only wish is that the eggs were cooked less! I love a runny egg and mine were a bit over cooked. However, overall it's a great brunch spot and I will 100% come again.",1,,1

Updated review","I went back for brunch and shared the soft scrambled and the ricotta pancake. Both superb. The ricotta pancake were extraordinary light and fluffy. Great to share. That same night I ordered take out late before close on Sunday, the burrata and the fresh spaghetti pasta. The favours were great. Pasta was fresh. Though I do have to say I ordered a drink, a margarita whilst I waited. It was very disappointing, a bit bland. It didn't have that refreshing kick. But don't let that put you off the fabulous cocktail menu. It was the end the night for my bartender and it may not have been made with the additional love and finesse as usual. I would definitely order again to prove myself wrong. Everything at L'Amico has been delicious. I can't wait to eat there again.",,,1
12,Jocelyn B.,"New York, NY",7,126,58,4.0,3/20/2018,"This exceeded my expectations. The only reason it's not 5 Stars was our waitress. She seemed pretty anxious, and I actually ordered a soda twice and she never brought it out. Thankfully it wasn't on the bill but it's pretty impressive to forget it TWICE. Food wise, I was really happy with our meal. Definitely get the Brussel salad starter, especially if you like hazelnuts. The burrata is good and love that it comes with bread. The agnolotti with truffle are perfect for sharing!",,,
13,Christina B.,"New York, NY",284,257,760,4.0,3/14/2018,"Attached to the Eventi Hotel, L'Amico has a rustic chic interior and serves Italian food. If you're coming for lunch, it's recommended to have reservations as it is located in the center of many businesses. Pricing is a bit high as well - $215 without tip for a 4 person lunch with one app and one drink each. However, it's the perfect place for a business lunch near Herald Square.The pizzas are personal size but perfect to share as an app as well. We tried the truffle mushroom one and it was perfect. For an entree, I got the chicken and kale. The chicken was moist and went well with the kale salad but I would probably try something different next time. My coworkers got the pasta and devoured it (wasn't huge portions but looked good).",,,
14,Felicia Y.,"New York, NY",200,64,20,4.0,3/7/2018,I am a brunch person and am surprised that I didn't come across this place earlier! It's a restaurant attached to a hotel. The atmosphere is nice. We ordered burrata to share for the table and it was delicious. I ordered the wood oven baked eggs - very very good. We finished Tiramisu and Caramel Budino - just yum. They messed up my order first and was super apologetic. The manager ended up serving me and he made sure our food was great. Overall worth the visit!,,,
15,Kati B.,"New York, NY",77,114,49,5.0,9/23/2018,"In a surprising turn of events, the wait or a table outside was much less than the wait for a table insight. We went here on one of the last nice evenings of the summer and enjoyed people watching in the fresh air. We ordered a fresh tomato pizza and rigatoni dish. Both were absolutely amazing and I look forward to having them again in the future. The waiter was very friendly and helpful with recommendations and accommodations. He provided us with information on the wine selection to help us feel confident in what we had ordered and also offered assistance by their sommelier if we wanted to order a bottle. This place is not cheap but the quality of their food and wine was worth it.",,,

It was a nice location with a nice ambiance and the service was friendly, our server tried a little too hard to be friendly, but it was fine, we saw it was coming from a good place. The food itself was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked, but they have very small portions and a very high price tag.

18,Erica H.,"Eustis, FL",128,131,59,4.0,10/27/2017,First time in NYC -- wasn't quite sure what to expect. The food here was so good. Fluffy pancakes and equally fluffy omelettes (I KID YOU NOT).  Service was good. The waitress was very helpful in recommending items that were both delicious and vegetarian. They have a la Colombe coffee shop attached to the restaurant. I ordered hot coffee and it was good. I wish they had brewed iced coffee tho.

The Eventi Hotel is sleek and cool with a trendy lobby bar. Right next door is the restaurant, where you can get well-made cocktails (a great dirty martini-- hard to find!) and delicious food.

20,Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,441,166,4.0,4/27/2018,"I went to L'Amico for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. They take reservations, which is great if you want a guaranteed table. They have daily specials for lunch, which provides diners with options beyond the regular menu. The grilled octopus is great for an appetiser. Not too heavy or filling. The branzino is a good entree. It was richer than expected, prepared with a butter sauce. I would have preferred it on a bed of salad or something. The pistachio gelato that came with the olive oil cake was delicious. Highlight of the entire meal.Service is excellent. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Despite being in a hotel, the restaurant does not feel like a hotel restaurant based on the vibe and the quality of the food. Overall, positive experience.",2,,

The seafood was cooked well and left me happy. Skirt steak: this was delicious!!! I think I loved it more than the pasta. Tiramisu: my from Italy italian friend said it was very good for a tiramisu made in the states. Overall, lovely experience.",2,,

The interior was chic and bright, I appreciated the openness of the kitchen and the general dining area. My expectations for brunch are usually low, and if the ambiance of a place is nice, I don't expect food will be amazing but I was impressed.We started with ""our bread"" and I honestly wish we had ordered two because it was delicious and I did not get enough. Sweet, warm and fresh. My friend and I split the omelette souffle which has a nice bite to it. We also tried the lemon ricotta pancakes, which basically melted in our mouths. I would advise against getting a juice: for $11 you get a bottle of premade juice, not a freshly pressed glass of juice as their menu suggests. Overall, we had a really tasty and enjoyable brunch and ended up lingering for a little bit as well, catching up after the check was paid. The chef graciously sent over a couple desserts (delicious sorbet and ice cream) on the house. Definitely recommend!",1,,

25,J D.,"Bowie, MD",9,86,140,4.0,9/15/2017,"From The Vine in Kimpton Eventi, it was less than 20 paces to walk into the bar area of this establishment, which is nouveau fusion of rustic Italian with an urban flare- all in the same building.  It too is a nice place, good looking interior, populated by a young, vibrant crowd of mixed heritages all gathered for good food and drink.  The bar is short, maybe ten stools in all?  Possibly less.  As the night wore on, the edges grew soft and things get exaggerated in the retelling but suffice it to say I did not spend too much time in here, just long enough to enjoy a Maker's Mark on the rocks, and a new porter that I'd never heard of but turned out to be quite good.  I'll have to see if I can get it elsewhere for private consumption.Though I did not order food, I had ample opportunity to see what was coming out of the kitchens (and to heap piles of scorn on a trio of stick-thin blonds who ordered a signature brick oven pizza only to send it back because it had MEAT in it- don't people read menus these days?  But I digress...) and all of it looked worthy of me putting on my plate but I was still stuffed from Keens and really only wanted to get a little air before bed.  The close proximity to my hotel garners this spot an additional star because convenience.Lest I be remiss, it has a nice sized dining area with an outdoor seating area that borders the interior dining room with an open floor plan, and open kitchen to the rear where you can see their 900 degree brick oven making its magic.  Lots of foot traffic so if you're not willing to share air with passersby, seek seating in the interior.",,,

Located in the Kimpton Hotel near Herald Square, this restaurant is definitely something this neighborhood lacked. The restaurant is beautifully decorated - farm tables, industrial lighting and a beautiful kitchen that opens up into the restaurant and allows for diners to see their meals prepared. Prices are expensive for what it is, but I am guessing that is to catch tourists in their tracks.The restaurant had a great beer and wine list including specialty craft beers we have never seen in NYC.I easily made an OpenTable reservation a week before my party of 4 dined. I ordered the Brussels sprout salad which was delicious - perfectly crispy and dressed.For my main course I ordered the famous mushroom pizza. The flavors from the mushroom pizza were delectable, but the pizza was soggy, so I would not say this was the best pizza I have ever had.

My friends and I had a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night. We arrived on time and were seated promptly. A few minutes after we sat down, the waiter approached us and discussed the wine list and explained a bit about the restaurant. About 15 minutes later he returned to take our orders. We did not see him again the rest of the meal. He did not check on us once, did not refill our waters, etc. It was as if we weren't even dining at the restaurant. Numerous employees were walking around seemingly watching us eat, but never came to see if we needed anything. Not to mention, the guy who brought our food asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese, we said yes, and it was never brought. We sat at the restaurant for about an hour with literally no employee, waiter, manager, or anyone saying anything to us, only the busser gave us any attention. It was such a terrible experience that I informed the manager of the situation, and he wanted to offer us a dessert to make up for the service, which we declined, but was brought anyways. At the end, the waiter came and apologized for his lack of service, but then also said it was our job to flag him down if we needed anything-- not really what I would expect of a fancy restaurant.",4,1,

Did not order dessert.The service was slow, and every time the bus boys came to refill our water glasses they spilled water on the table and in our plates of food.

Atmosphere is wonderful - a contemporary space with a few rustic touches, and the staff very friendly/attentive. Brussels sprout salad was delicious, cappelletti was decent, but an incredibly small portion for $28",,,

40,Dennis B.,"Somerville, MA",0,10,0,2.0,9/2/2018,"I have eaten brunch here several times and today was a huge disappointment.  My friend and I got our cocktails and pastry relatively quickly but it took forever to receive our entrees.  By the time we did get them we had been sitting for over an hour.  The atmosphere is great, and the food was delicious (the special breakfast pizza and the kale salad with rotisserie chicken were REALLY good) but the experience was ruined by the very slow pace. To make things worse, there was no apology for the extreme delay.  Additionally, when the order for the table next to us arrived incorrectly they were offered complimentary mimosas, but no such offer was extended to my friend and me.  We didn't need a free drink, it just would have been nice to have been offered.",,,
41,Nicholas R.,"Harrison, NJ",223,222,36,3.0,10/22/2017,"Came here on a Thursday at 6:00pm due to a suggestion from a colleague and was immediately seated and greeted by a friendly host/wait staff. The atmosphere is something of an 'urban charm'. The server's here are extremely knowledgeable of all their alcohol and dining options, which proves to be useful in getting accurate descriptions. The menu in itself deviates from the Italian-American tradition and offers a more traditional 'Central-Italy' menu.I ordered the burrata and prosciutto as an appetizer which was fairly standard. The cheese had a 'firmer' texture than most burrata's, which I personally enjoyed. The prosciutto while good, is standard imported meat at a premium price (it's a nice restaurant in manhattan...what did we expect?).My main entree was the Cacio e Pepe, which was delicious, yet lacking in the portion department. It was the amount of 'rich cheesy flavor' without being overbearing that many American places end up being. With that said, the portion was laughable. I had a bite of a friend's roasted chicken and immediately spat it out (both of them ended up taking 3-4 bites and leaving their plate's unfinished). It was awfully bitter and when we asked the server if that was normal, he responded that it was. Overall, awesome service, great venue, and a daring menu..but lacks on some of the execution",,,1
42,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",157,260,813,4.0,10/17/2017,"Beautiful place inside a hotel. Nice bar. Nice seating. The service was good; our server was a tad weird though (had a poker face going on LOL). Anyway they seated us inside but the windows/ doors were open so we could see the outside without being outside (which is great). Four of us went for brunch! The coffee is good, and it comes with free refills. We ordered the pear cider (Normandy something) that was delicious. It was $25 for the bottle; extremely reasonable I thought. I ordered the berries and granola and yogurt. You cannot screw this up! Fresh fruits and greek yogurt and granola. I also ordered the French toast. One of the best I have had in the city I must say. It was garnished with toasted almond flakes, brilliant touch. The french toast wasn't sickly sweet and beautifully cooked to perfection.My friend's lemon and ricotta pancakes were too heavy. So either order one for the table or share between two people. We also ordered the brioche bun for the table. It was a tad too sweet for us but cinnamon-y and fresh baked. Their egg souffle was voted the best thing by my friend who ordered it. It was fluffy and nicely seasoned and flavorful.Definitely going back! They take reservations for brunch, which is becoming rare at NYC restaurants. Also, we were eyeing the pizza that other people were ordering. Next time...",,,
43,Jenn K.,"New York, NY",70,87,70,5.0,8/16/2017,"I'm kind of in love with this place! I must say it's probably one of the most perfect brunch spots! This place has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and the windows are nice and big so you get plenty of natural lighting even if you're sitting inside during the day. It was also easy for me to get reservations for a Saturday brunch the day before and I'm sure I could've done a walk in and still get a seat relatively quickly. I feel like this place is underrated because it's in a central location (between Herald Square and Penn Station) and yet, while filled with a good amount of people, this place wasn't packed. Also this place definitely seems like a place that can host large groups which is always a plus for NYC dining. Food wise, I ordered the uova beschiamella which i loved. We also got the French toast and shakshuka which were solid choices. Also the lemon ricotta pancakes were pretty up there. I feel like many brunch spots have a lemon ricotta pancake on the menu, but what I loved about these particular ones was that they would have chunks of ricotta that really balanced out the sweetness of the dish, which still keeping it moist and not soggy. I would 100% come back here for brunch and would also love to come back to try their dinner menu!",1,,2
44,Sean M.,"San Francisco, CA",9,116,0,1.0,1/17/2018,"This was a complete disappointment especially given the price.  The roasted duck breast I got was completely tasteless, but the side served with it was way too overpowering.  The balance of flavors was totally off.  The veal shoulder my husband got could have been from some chain restaurant.  There was absolutely nothing special about it, and couldn't even tell if the pasta was fresh or from a box.  Our waitress seemed out of her depth.  I asked what Budino was as it was on the dessert menu and she had no idea nor did she bother to find out, I just ended up looking it up online.  What arrived was so awful in its texture we didn't even finish it.  Also had the most bizarre tiramisu.  A lump of creamy white served in an all white bowl, looks like a snowman had melted in it.  The cake was under the white mess and fairly tasty but would have been better without the covering.  The sommelier recommended an $85 bottle that was just OK, but certainly not worth the price.  I've ordered wines in restaurants for half the price that were so much better.  Finally, as per the instructions on the menu, we asked our server what flavor the limoncello was that evening.  She looked confused so we showed her on the menu where it said to ask and she went to find out.  It was lemon flavor (go figure) and house made, but was by far the most awful limoncello we've ever tasted.  We had to laugh as it smelled like lemon Pledge, but oddly enough had almost no taste.  Not sure how they pulled that off, but it actually tasted and looked like someone add water to it.    To top it all off the restaurant is FREEZING cold.  Here's a hint to the manager, if you see almost all your patrons sitting in winter coats you may want to do something about the temperature.  Everyone around us was complaining.  The seating we were first offer was so cold we had to move and the folks next to us said the same thing happened to the pair they tried to seat their before.  This is a corner restaurant with several tiny windows which the cold and wind just seep through continually.  I understand putting up heavy drapes or something else may mess with the decor, but it sure beats freezing out your clients.  There were even patrons in the middle of the restaurant still in their heavy winter coats.We were hoping to find something positive about this meal, but were left wanting.  Would never go here again and certainly couldn't recommend it in good conscious.",3,1,1
45,Beau B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,0,2.0,9/23/2018,"The food: crab crostini- great texture and delicious. Yellowtail appetizer- delicious and refreshing. Mafaldine alle vongole was delicious if you're into clams. The aroma of the white mushroom pizza was wonderful but it was kind of bland for us.We have to give props to the bus boys. They were champs of the night, refilling our water nonstop. Unfortunately, we started off the night with our server missing! We had to flag down a different server and had him take our orders. We were also not introduced with any recommendations nor with any specials. We finally met our server mid service when we were served with our pizza and pasta. She was surprising a very nice and knowledgeable lady but she was no where to be found! Throughout dinner, we had a couple of requests like we were missing a dinner napkin from the start and we couldn't flag anyone down to get us one; we ordered a Diet Coke but no one brought us the soda. Towards the end, we wanted to have a look at the dessert menu but because we were sick of waiting for our server for so long, we just asked for the bill. After we were presented with the bill, our server kept circling around us waiting for us to pay. That's pretty pathetic. When we needed you, you're too busy running around helping other guests. When we're about to pay, you're hovering around us.",1,,
46,Ellen Y.,"Chicago, IL",207,248,45,3.0,8/4/2017,"My family and I came here on a Thursday at 2pm without reservations. I've walked by this area just about everyday, and I love the concept of their indoor/outdoor seating. Everyone looks so happy all the time!Not the case for this visit. We were seated outside promptly, but in an area that was separate from the main restaurant. The waiter did not check up on us for 15 min, and I had to go back in to tell the front desk that we were forgotten. Another 5 min goes by, still no waiter. He seems like he's in a rush, and does not take the time to even introduce himself.Unfortunately, this did not live up to my expectations. The pasta dishes were small and mediocre, the salmon salad was average, and the shrimp pizza appeared burnt on the bottom.  Not sure if this would be a place I'd come to again.",1,,1
47,Jonathan C.,"Barcelona, Spain",17,179,36,3.0,9/27/2017,"In short: Undercooked pasta and just a giant blob of cream of tiramisu. Long version: I was brought here by my brother as his ""go-to"" italian place in the area. It started off well, but when the mains came, I discovered my pasta was undercooked, which is not exactly a good sign for an Italian place if they can't cook pasta. I'm a massive tiramisu fan and always feel you can judge a Italian place by it. I was a little disappointed to receive a giant blob of cream with only a hint of everything else. All the individual parts were great, but eating a bowl of cream is not exactly what I wanted when ordering. Everyone else had a nice dinner, I just got all the bad luck.",,,
48,Justin C.,"New York, NY",90,80,74,4.0,7/7/2018,"The ambiance was so great, and the service was awesome. I have never been a fan of almonds, but the ""our bread"" is amazing as it was filled almond paste. It was sweet but not overpowering. The only thing that was kind of tacky is that their juice options are not freshly made, but rather bottled.",1,,
49,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,267,1183,4.0,6/23/2017,"Food: 4Ambience: 4Service: 3.5In an area with brunchy restaurants few and far between, L'Amico is a great option. I went with a large party of 8 and was happy with most of the food, but the service was fairly slow. The room is spacious and lovely to sit in, especially in the warmer months. Burrata - you honestly can't really go wrong with burrata, a great starter to share.Omelette Souffle Cacio e Pepe: a play on cacio e pepe with plenty of black pepper and cheese, it was good but hard to tackle by yourself because it's hefty. Pies: the pizzas were ideal for sharing and they cut them into 8 pieces for us! A thin slightly chewy crust with good quality toppings. Definitely better than an average hotel restaurant, this is one brunch spot to keep in mind if you're in the area with something on the menu for everyone. It's a crowd-pleaser.",2,,2
50,Cas A.,"Manhattan, NY",26,19,33,2.0,3/12/2018,"L'Amico reviewIt took 3 hours to get us seated after the 45 minute proposed wait and staff couldn't care less. We proceeded to wait half an hour for a spicy (overly peppered) spaghetti and a soggy spinach dish. Our waiter was nice and did her best. The decor is also decent. Overall, I found this place pretentious and overpriced; our food was average at best and the lack of service seriously detracts from the meal. I will not go back to this restaurant and do not recommend it.",,,
51,Anna J.,"Delafield, WI",0,4,0,5.0,10/9/2018,We loved everything!  We were visiting in from out of town and had just gotten off of an airplane with our 3 kids.  The staff was so friendly and put us in a nice corner booth near the patio so we could enjoy the lovely weather.  We got the pizza (delicious) and the burrata was to die for!  Oh and the desserts?  I'm drooling just thinking about them now.  I would definitely recommend a visit to L'Amico!,,,
52,Courtney A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,5,3.0,5/12/2018,Went here for lunch during the week. Took a long time to order and place was packed. The service was very pleasant. We started with the burrata which definitely could've been creamier on the inside. The food was all decent but nothing spectacular. I had the truffle pizza for the main which was very generous on the truffle. Giving 3 stars as did not find the food remarkable.,,,
53,Kirsten H.,"Denver, CO",169,910,757,5.0,11/11/2016,"I came here for a birthday date with my boyfriend on a Thursday night. I'm really glad we made reservations in advance, because both the bar and restaurant were packed. I didn't realize it was such a popular place! Though not in the best area, the food is well worth the trip to Midtown West. The atmosphere was great, food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. We requested the help of the sommelier in picking wine, and she led us to the perfect bottle. We started with the Peekytoe crab toasts, the brussels and salsify salad, and the grilled octopus. The salad was phenomenal. It was the perfect size for an appetizer and dressed perfectly, with plenty of toasted hazelnuts and pecorino cheese to compliment the brussels sprouts and salsify. I loved the addition of the grilled cippolini onions; they added a nice sweetness to the salad. The crab toast, which came on a thick cut piece of toasted bread, was a nice light dish to start the meal as well. I didn't try the octopus, but it looked very enticing. I ordered the roasted chicken with broccolini as my entrée with a side of roasted cauliflower, both of which were delicious. The chicken was moist with a nice crispy skin, and the cauliflower was delicious. Overall, it was a great meal! I rarely go to that area for dinner, but I'll be keeping L'Amico in my regular restaurant rotation from now on. Though I was there for a celebratory dinner for two, I saw plenty of larger groups (10+) as well as groups of 3-5 scattered throughout. Whether you're looking for spot for a dinner with friends, a date night, or a bigger party, L'Amico fits the bill.",3,,2
54,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",50,140,439,5.0,12/16/2017,"Absolutely, 10 stars hands down. From apps to the main to the desserts and to the service, all was right on point.

55,Florance W.,"Daly City, CA",13,32,27,5.0,2/20/2018,"I'm very surprised that this place has low reviews on Yelp. Both times I've been here were Sundays for brunch and it was pretty popular. The pancakes are amazing here. It's super fluffy and the center is still steaming. Beware though, the blueberry sauce on top is very tart. I also enjoy their Baked Eggs. It really compliments their bread.",,,

The restaurant is indoor but open air with patio so you feel as though you're right in the action! People watching is great. The meal was fantastic, I started with the Octopus carpaccio which was by far the most beautiful plate I've ever seen. But taste matched presentation and the octopus was so delicate and delicious. For my main I have the Shrimp pizza which was so light - the pesto and shrimp married in flavour and I finished the whole pizza in one sitting.",,,1

That's the downside, but the upside to that is that their amazing gelato are just, 2 FLAVORS FOR $7, toppled with a flat waffle like crunch!

63,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,8/29/2016,"While I admittedly try to avoid jumping on the bandwagon, there's definitely some substance to the fact that a large number of successful new restaurants these days have aligned themselves to large hotels in the city. One of these is L'Amico, the latest addition to NYC's dining scene from Chef Laurent Tourondel, the man behind the BLT restaurants and Arlington Club. The focus here is on the rustic, Italian dishes that the chef grew up eating as a child, with a few adaptations in technique and presentation.The space itself is inviting, with a dimly lit interior comprised of a short bar area and an open kitchen. It's nice - without being too nice - and works as an ideal post-work setting, a date night, or a brunch spot with a few friends. Make your reservations in advance, however, as the space can get quickly packed.The extra effort is worth it, however, as the food is across the board delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Salsify Salad we started with was a crisp and refreshing introduction, featuring an impressive portion of roasted brussels sprouts, cipollini mushrooms, toasted hazelnuts, and crisp pancetta. It covers the range of sweet and savory flavors and incorporates an impressive textural variety as well. The pastas, which can serve as a shared starter or a main dish, also shouldn't be overlooked; the Campanelle was served with a generous portion of braised short rib and finished with a dollop of ricotta infused with horseradish. The short rib ragu is unctuous and tender (thanks to the overnight braising), the pasta cooked to the ideal al dente texture, and the ricotta rounds out the bite with a creamy and slightly zesty edge. As for the mains, I have to commend L'Amico for perfectly cooking the Roasted Duck Breast to my requested medium rare; the skin was evenly crisp with the fat expertly rendered, and the perfect amount of pink was left in the center. Although I was a little thrown off by the accompanying sides, consisting of farro, kale, and red cabbage, as they seemed a little jarring next to the duck, it was still one of the more memorable dishes I can recall having this year. We opted to finish the meal with a simple dessert, their Pistachio and Orange Marmalade Gelato; it was a light and refreshing bite, but it's evident from the dessert menu that sweets are not the focus of the restaurant.I have to say that I left relatively impressed with L'Amico; the food is well-executed across the board and appealing to a number of palates and dietary preferences. It would serve better as a venue for a nicer meal out, as the prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, but if your curiosity leads you here - go for it.",13,3,11
64,James P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,10/3/2018,"I was really surprised and excited to find L'Amico. It is a hidden gem.  The service and wine menu are really good, and the food was delicious. Especially like the burrata, the brussel sprout salad, the white truffle pizza, and the spaghetti. Will be back soon.",,,
65,Paul S.,"Manhattan, NY",19,2,0,1.0,5/20/2018,"Place was empty and they sat me and my girlfriend right next to another couple in a small two person table.  I nicely asked if we can move into a larger table and they said no even though there were at least 30 available.  We then decide to go sit outside.  Every single table was open and they sit us on this obnoxiously small table that kids couldn't even fit in.  Didn't give us a brunch menu even though it was 11:45 AM.   Hostess was smug and unaccommodating.  If the place was crowded with a line out the door then it would make sense to be treated this way but it wasn't even close to crowded.  We got up and left!  Don't waste your time here.  10,000 other options in NYC.",1,,1
66,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,3.0,8/6/2016,"I actually enjoyed my time at L'Amico, but there were just a few major things that would prevent me from coming back here. It's a shame because the space is quite nice, and the food quality is better than that of most Italian joints.When we first arrived, the hostess seemed to immediately direct us to the bar to get a drink, even though we were both present and there were plenty of two-tables open. Very peculiar. After a little coaxing, we were immediately seated near the outside part. The windows were open, which was nice, because the weather was great outside, but the landscape was basically the not-so-pretty SHAPS (S*** Around Penn Station) area, so it was kinda so-so for us.As I mentioned, the food we got was all-around great. We ordered the pipe rigate with veal bolognese, clam pizza, and blackened scallops. The pipe rigate was great, and the veal bolognese it came with was very rich without being too greasy. The blackened scallops were huge, and the beans underneath were cooked just right. I was a little confused by the skewers that the scallops came with, because it seemed to be somewhat superfluous and really wasn't necessary. Finally, the clam pizza was delicious, although I didn't really quite get why the clams were still in their shells. I'd assume you'd want to enjoy the clams on top of the pizza, not separately. Nonetheless, I just kinda picked them out of the shells and placed them on top. With all that said, the service was just also about nowhere to be found throughout the meal. We were constantly asking for water refills, and our waitress didn't check on us at all. It took us a mighty long time to get our check, and it wasn't particularly busy in our section.Quite a few hiccups, but I guess you can have a good time if the conditions are right. The food is at least very well-executed, but I'm reluctant to return because of the service.",44,27,43

68,Marie D.,"Town of North Hempstead, Long Island, NY",18,18,88,5.0,11/12/2017,"A group of us (8) ate here before a Bruno Mars show at MSG. The place was packed. Bobby Flay and his group of friend were seated a couple of tables away. They also have outdoor tables for good weather days. Everything we ordered was delicious. Since there were many of us, we ordered different appetizers and entrees and they were all equally as delicious as the next. My favorite was the truffle pizza. But their pasta with Bolognese, shrimp, steak entrees were also outstanding. My only complaint is the service was Slow. I understand the place was packed on a Saturday night but so are many other places in NYC and it doesn't necessarily affect their service.  That Is my ONLY complaint and it would deter me from coming back. The food was that good. The place is casual to sporty but it is NYC so look your best.",1,,

There's nothing to complain when it comes to the most important thing - the food. The dishes are very tasty and look good. Everything from the wood oven is worth trying. This restaurant losses some stars because of the imperfect service and very weird room management. We were told there are no free tables and we have to sit at the bar, which isn't that strange in NYC on Sunday afternoon. OK, so there were 3-4 free tables - but, again, people make reservations, so nothing strange. Strange was, however, that most of these seats were empty during our whole brunch and after. As to the service itself - with a smile, but with many small mistakes (spilled coffee, forgotten drink, forgotten drink on the bill, etc.). So, with certain regret, just three stars.",,,

To start, the decor and vibe are impressive, rustic but with a modern accent and an open kitchen (which I always enjoy). The coffee cake was hands down one of the best things about this place, lordy! I will be dreaming of it for days. The dishes we ordered were also delicious, with each offering creative and inspired touches. I've often found that restaurants lose their creative edge with regards to brunch - L'Amico does not, if anything they up their game. The service was also outstanding. Lina, our server was knowledgeable, friendly and very eager to share her thoughts on the menu. It's a nice touch when the server clearly loves the food, I felt we were in good hands.Overall, L'Amico is a must if you're looking for an ""upscale"" brunch in Midtown. I will be back!",,,

The Salvatore flight was my fav and each one built I. Intensity.  If you like to hit the ground running with spicy/bold reds then do the spicy red flight.  We enjoyed the goat cheese app- small, but enough for 2.  The steak frites were cooked to perfection with an amazing Bordeaux flavor.  We finished with their berry and pear cobbler.  Expect great customer service and if possible make reservations in advance , bc they are always busy!

Look up & enjoy the wood beams & hundreds of dangling industrial lamps. I had the salmon avocado salad which was pretty good but not memorable. I remember the decor better than the food. Maybe I didn't order the right food but I will return & give this place another shot. Maybe next time I will try the pizza & pastas or the seared tuna. This place was packed during lunch time during the week. Location is not the best neighborhood, its weirdly located near Penn station & K-town.",1,1,
81,Laurie D.,"Carrollton, TX",0,5,1,4.0,12/27/2017,We were visiting NYC for Christmas and my daughter in law made reservations for Christmas morning since it was close to our hotel. The food was really good. I ordered the lemon pancakes and they were so fluffy it felt like slicing through air. They were so tasty everyone at the table tried them. My daughter in law had the French toast and it was awesome too. My son had the egg white omelet and again very good. Our waitress was friendly and the staff was quick to take away the fishes we were done using so we could enjoy visiting. I would recommend this place for sure.,,,

84,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,581,505,3.0,3/17/2016,"My whole family and I went to see Billy Joel at MSG this past Tuesday night, and needed to find a dinner spot nearby. We usually stick to KBBQ in that area, but we were on a time crunch before the concert, so that was out. I had read about L'Amico last year, and they were able to accommodate a table of 6 via opentable, so we headed there.The decor and service were both positives. The atmosphere felt polished and current, and more towards the trendy NoMad dining scene instead of the oddball Penn Station dining scene. The menu leans Italian, and they have a few beautiful pizza ovens in the open kitchen, so I went with pizza of course. The soppressata pizza was good, and I really liked the fresh oregano on top (nobody does fresh oregano on top and they really should). However, I thought the crust was way too charred, and there was not much originality. A standard Neapolitan style soppressata pizza is not that special in 2016 New York City, so you'd better not burn that crust, right?In general, my family shared my sentiments that the food suited our needs, but wasn't anything to write home about. My husband's fish entree came with greens and mushrooms, but no carbs, so he asked for a little bread on the side. The waiter informed him it would be extra, which I thought was kind of tacky. I don't think I would come back unless I had similar location and time constraints like I had this past Tuesday.",3,1,1

86,Allison B.,"Westwood, NJ",386,220,452,3.0,2/9/2016,"If I was judging L'Amico by the food alone, it would undoubtedly be a 4-star experience. More goes into dining than food alone though, which is why I'm giving L'Amico a 3-star review.The positives of L'Amico are many - it's conveniently located near MSG without being a kitschy, tourist filled restaurant; the decor is gorgeous, with huge windows, gorgeous tiled floors, and dimly lit chandeliers, to give a very classy vibe. The menu for both drinks and wine is varied, with the cocktails being beautifully made. I ordered the Non Classico, which is vodka, St. Germain, Prosecco, and grapefruit, while fiance ordered the Sicilian Sol, which consists of Amaretto, bitters, Prosecco, among other delicious blends. Each cocktail was $14, standard for a mixed drink in the area.We began with delicious appetizers of crostini, choosing the eggplant and crab ($8, $12, respectively). These came out on huge pieces of bread cut into two slices, and each of us had an enormous portion for the price. Fiance liked the eggplant the best, while I loved the huge amount of Peekytoe Crab on the crab crostini. We also ordered the burrata, and oh my god, I am in love. It was so absolutely delicious and creamy, I was very reluctant to share, despite the fact that we ordered it to share. Seriously, order the burrata, you will NOT be disappointed.As for entrees, I ordered a margherita pizza (actually I ordered the Soppressa Picante because I am 0% Italian and had no idea that meant pork - luckily our waitress asked if I was okay with pork and I was able to say ""No!"" which resulted in her offering a margherita pizza instead), and fiance ordered the campanelle (with short ribs braised overnight). The pizza was fine. Nothing bad, but nothing great. Fiance said his pasta was also good. I'm not sure if we just ordered the wrong things, entree wise, but dinner as a whole was good, but nothing out of this world.The real issue that we had at L'Amico was not the food, but the service. While our waitress was polite whenever she did come over, we found service on a whole to be extremely slow, with the waitresses, at least. We were left for long periods of time in between taking orders, dropping off the check, etc., feeling semi invisible as we were constantly passed by. The bus boys were actually the stars of the service that we encountered - they were so quick to refill water glasses, take away empty plates, and bring out food, which was extremely appreciated, especially since the waitress seemed very overwhelmed with the amount of tables that had to be served (also, the tables for two are VERY close together, so you get to know your neighbor well considering you have to basically sit on their lap if you need to get up).In summary - appetizers = amazing, drinks = very good, bus boys = fantastic, but service on a whole is just a bit lacking and slow (maybe look somewhere else if you're looking for a pre-theater meal).",4,3,5

For around $13, I got the Farmhouse omelette with a small side salad and some toast. It consisted of egg whites wrapped around chopped veggies including avocado, mushrooms and some others. There might also been some cheese, although I was expecting more. It also came with a a light red (nutty?) sauce which went well with the omelette. It tasted pretty decent, fresh and light, was reasonably priced and we received very nice service.",5,2,4

89,Ray K.,"San Jose, CA",5,116,92,4.0,12/15/2016,"Enjoyed the rustic ambiance with the open-kitchen but be warned if you're sitting across from the kitchen where the oven is located, it gets very toasty. Service was attentive and friendly. The menu selections were varied enough where there's something for everyone. Foooooduh:Margherita pizza was great for sharing, nice and crispy crust. They actually didn't have it on the menu but because we had a child with us they were kind enough to offer it as an option. Burrata was exceptional. Refreshing and mild, anyone that enjoys cheese should order this and even those that aren't big cheese-heads will enjoy IMO.  Spiced Tuna Crudo - didn't stand out very much compared to the other apps. Wasn't a big fan of the tuna paired with the lemon yogurt sauce. Grilled Octopus was very good. Cooked to perfection and seasoned enough to enhance but not overpower the taste of the octopus. Roasted chicken - juicy bird that was tender enough to cut with just a fork, great seasoning as well. Also ordered 2 of the specials, first was a pasta carbonara with Uni and lobster. If you like Uni then you'll love this dish, rich and creamy with perfectly cooked pasta. Second one was a roasted pig that had a very crispy and sweet skin (almost candied) but the meat itself was a bit dry and almost bland which was a bit of a disappointment. I'm surprised they only had 3 stars on Yelp, I think in any other city this place would easily be a 4-4.5 star place. I'd definitely go back.",4,,

To start, I had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated and then was seated at a cramped table, basically on top of the people next to me in a booth. After this, I never once saw a waiter. The hostess took our order because there was not another person in sight. We also had to ask the hostess where the food was. Again, not a waiter in sight. Finally, we stated that we had not seen a waiter and were disappointed, so at last, the waiter came over and delivered our food.  As far as I'm concerned, only bringing the food over to the table, without taking the order, checking in or giving any other type of service after being at a restaurant for over an hour, is HORRIBLE service.

101,Michelin F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,60,92,4.0,4/26/2017,"Surprisingly good Neapolitan pizza, even though I forgot the cheese.Stopped in for dinner after work, but the place was packed. Ended up getting a pizza to go. Quite good. The pizza was a San Marzano pie. I actually intended to eat a pizza with cheese. But I didn't want any toppings. This is what I thought I ordered but in an all time epic fail I ended up with pizza sans cheese. Surprisingly it was still quite good. The crust was bubbly and chewy and heavily charred. Maybe a tad too heavily but because of the way the pizza was topped (we'll get to that in a moment) I actually thought such heavy charring worked. The undercarriage was charred as well. The middle of the pizza was thin but unfortunately it wasn't a light or chewy thinness but a denser, harder thinness. Not bad, but enough for a one star demerit. The pizza sauce was neither fresh nor sweet and tasted of cooked tomatoes, just as I like it. The pizza was sprinkled with slices of fresh garlic that smelled wonderful, though the flavor didn't come through in any given bite. Good, solid toppings so far, but the next two really just made this pizza special and salvaged the whole no cheese experience: generous fresh oregano and plentiful, legitimately spicy chili oil. Oregano can be a tough flavor to wield due to its potency. It adds wonderful vegetative herbal notes to many dishes but can easily get out of control. What balanced it out in this pizza was the charring of the crust. The heavy chat went perfectly with the fresh oregano. The spicy chili oil was, surprisingly, actually spicy. I love spicy foods and almost always add chili oil or chili flakes to my pizza. This pizza was perfectly spiced and needed no additional chili oil. And it was a lingering, pleasant heat. Just wonderful.Would eat again. One of NYC's better pies.",2,2,1

The place is modern and rustic, very impressive atmosphere. Restaurants with this decor are often a little stuffy, but L'Amico manages to keep a great vibe with their impressive decor. This type of restaurant is something that the neighborhood has lacked. I usually take a date here before attending any event at MSG. Try as many pastas and pizzas as possible.

But mainly, you need the cacio pepe fritelle on your table then everything else you want go for it because it will be good. I had the omelette souffle that was incredibly fluffy and cheesy. We also shared pancakes for the table that were so good and a great shareable plate. They also had live jazz and all the windows open which made for a fresh and lively brunch experience.I also went for dinner last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. I was worried that this would only be a good brunch spot but wow was it also a good dinner spot. The highlights: pizza! I loved the white mushroom pizza because the truffle didn't totally overpower the mushroom and the cheese flavors but still came through. The side dishes were also a major highlight. Mainly the brussel sprouts and the corn. Get these! Pastas were also good but not as amazing as the pizza. Overall great spot!",,,

I'm confident this place artificially inflates its reviews. We tried L'Amico after reading some reviews and we regret making that decision. We arrived 15 minutes before the reservation and they still made us wait for almost 40 minutes.The place has a young crowd, and the ambience is very nice. However, they will have to review really the service and wait staff. After we sat down near the kitchen and ordered water, San Pellegrino which took another 10 minutes so we had to reorder it again. We had ordered their over priced truffle pasta (Tasted fake and flavorless) and pizza from 2 different waiters assigned to our table. There was a big confusion as to what was ordered and wrong entrees were served to our table. It took another 20 minutes to get the right food and we were finally able to have our dinner. The truffles tasted like knock offs, the $35 truffle pasta was a total of 5-6 bites, the pizza pies were way overpriced for what you get, and there was no bread served. The staff did not seem to care about the situation and told us mistakes happen!! What a pity! we spent almost $140 for two orders, 2 waters and 1 drink.

I may be picky on this one but I ordered a mimosa and a waitress brought the cup to the table and poured/mixed both in, in front of me.

I love that the menu is short and simple, it made it a lot easier to select exactly what to order. The portions are a fair amount and we typically order a few dishes for the table so we can all try out the different menu items. My personal favorite was the Veal and Pork Meatballs and the Omelette Souffle. There were three meatballs per order. The sauce was so flavorful and delicious. I ended up dipping my pizza crust in there since it was so good. The omelette souffle was cooked perfectly. It was extremely fluffy with the right amount of cheese. We also ordered the White Mushroom pie (pizza) which was yummy as well with the truffle paste. The pizza was a bit too chard for me but we just ripped those pieces off. The pie is portioned for an individual but each of us were able to eat a slice (1/4) and it was a good amount to try. We also got a side of charred cauliflower and charred string beans, both were pretty good too. I would recommend the string beans! The service here was really great. Our waters were constantly filled - and I have to point this out because I don't think there was ever a time my cup was empty for over a second.Overall, L'Amico has great food options and a place I would go to again. Their menu is seasonal so I am definitely eager to the other items they create. The price is a bit above average for the portion size but was worth it. Heads up, if you're coming here for a celebration and plan on bringing cake - there's an $8 cutting fee per person. I wish I knew this earlier before surprising my friends with a birthday cake!",2,,

The hostess was very nice and accommodating, and we were able to snag 9:00pm reservations. I loved the instead of this restaurant -the bar area is charming and from several of the tables you could see the cooks hard at work. Cuisine is rustic Italian. Both pastas we tried - the sausage and seafood - were heavenly. Noodles were cooked perfect, and the sauces were complex in flavor.

Throughout the entire meal the servers were rude and non-existent. We called the manager to the table who while he may have had good intentions did not even stay to see that our payment was processed in a timely manner. I ended up having to go up to hostess stand to pay because it took more than 10 minutes at the end of our meal for someone to come over and take our card. Overall, lunch at L'Amico was a terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone, especially if you expect to spend less than 2 hours there during a workday.

124,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",128,190,1032,2.0,1/10/2017,"Three stars for food and one star for service.  We came here for a friend's birthday, the male host was standoffish when I checked-in.  That set the tone for the rest of the evening.  The tables were extremely close to each other, and they seated us (table of six) in the center of the room right by the main walkway.  Our waiter was well meaning, but was not particularly good at his job.  He was carrying a tray of four beers and spilled them all over my friend's back, hair and jacket.  The bottles of beer subsequently crashed down and shattered under my friend's feet.  It was a disaster.  Instead of apologizing, he disappeared while the bus boys came out to sweep up the glasses.  The only helpful person was a sweet hostess who promptly took my friend's coat in order to be hung up to dry.  No one apologized, no one bothered to mop up the spilled beer, they only took away the broken glasses.  We used our own napkins to sop up the beer, and then no one offered to replace our napkins.  We had to flag down a nearby server to bring us replacements napkins.  The icing on the cake?  Our waiter brought over new beers and made an excuse about how the drink tray was wubbly, no apologies, just blamed on the flawed equipment that they shouldn't be using in the first place.  The hits just kept on coming during the rest of the dinner.  The standoff host (remember him?) kept walking by our table and asking my friend (the one who got beer spilled all over) to move in her chair because she was blocking the walkway.  First of all, my friend is a very slim person, she was sitting as close to the table as possible already, I don't know how much closer she could've sat to the table aside from just sitting on top of the table!  You guys placed the table there!  You made us sit there!  What did you expect?! He was incredibly rude and somehow implied that it was my friend's fault she got beer spilled all over her.  I was speechless, it was a horrific display of customer service.  Last but not least, a few servers brought out two extra desserts with no explanation, just dropped them on the table and left.  We were able to flag down our server who explained that the two extra desserts were on the house.  Ok, that was nice of them.  However, when the check came, the server leaned over and whispered conspiratorially ""don't worry, I took the two desserts off the bill"".  WTF, you mean the two desserts that we never ordered?  Of course you should take them off the bill, isn't that common sense?  At this point, no one came over to offer to pay for my friend's dry cleaning.  She went up to speak to the manager, who said that they will take care of it and our server was suppose to offer that to us when it happened.  At this point, we were so fed up with the service and the rude attitude of the host that we were just glad to get out of there.   I should dedicate at least one paragraph to the food, which was average at best.  Out of the six main courses we tried, the only dishes that truly stood out was the skirt steak and the Cappelletti.  The skirt steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, while the cappelletti had a very interesting blend of flavor.  My least favorite dishes included the sea bass, which was overcooked; as well as the white mushroom pizza as it was really salty.  The tiramisu was awful, it was this weird mushy blob that sat on the plate.  Overall, the quality of the food did not justify the price they were charging.  Bottom line, I completely understand that sometimes people make mistakes, drinks get spilled, plates get dropped.  However, the true test is how the restaurant handles their mistakes.  I did not think most of the employees at L'Amico reacted well to the mistakes they made and exhibited extremely poor customer service.",7,,

Doesn't take long before someone makes eye contact. The ambience of the restaurant is classy . Good for a date or a group. It's not loud and no kids running around. I had the roasted chicken with Tuscan Kale and it was perfect. The chicken wasn't too dry or too soft, just the right tenderness. Skirt stake, marble potatoes and the Brussels sprouts were also delicious .",,,
126,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,7/20/2016,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a weeknight. It was around 9:30pm, but the place was still bustling and we were lucky to grab one of the few open tables. We were pretty hungry so we decided to order several dishes and split them:Peekytoe crab crostini (3.5 stars): This was a super refreshing dish on a hot and humid night. The bread was toasted perfectly and had a nice crunch, but I found the crab/avocado/peas to be a bit underwhelming overall.Zucchini salad (4.5 stars): I was not sure what to expect from this dish, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was basically a cold noodle dish, except that the zucchini (in noodle form) took the place of noodles. The combination of the rest of the ingredients is excellent.Pipe rigate (4 stars): This was a very solid dish. The pasta was cooked well and the bolognese was very meaty and rich and had great flavor as well.Blackened scallops (3.5 stars): Though the presentation on this dish was fantastic, I found the dry rub to be a little overpowering for the scallops. The rest of the dish tasted great, but the scallops were just average.Charred green beans (4 stars): I was also not sure what to expect from this dish, but the flavors all came together very well. Not sure what the difference in flavor was from roasting, but the dish successfully paired some unique flavors.There was also a gelato dessert that looked amazing (the table next to us got it), but we didn't have any room left after this meal.Overall, I loved the vibe of this place and most of the food hit high marks. Our waitress seemed to be a bit confused at times, but was friendly nonetheless. Definitely a place worth checking out if you are looking for a cool, hip place that doesn't take itself too seriously.",,,1

We braved the ominous skies and sat outside to avoid a long wait - it's a little crowded on the sidewalk area.The meal started off quite strong with Eggplant Caponata (good) and the fantastic shellfish Agnolotti - we were debating getting another order of this dish. The Black Sea Bass was fine, but not that exciting. For dessert, we choose the Sticky Chocolate-Hazelnut Torrone, which was like an impenetrable chocolate Rice Krispie treat - not only was this hard to consume, it wasn't that tasty.",,,

130,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,1/19/2016,"Ever want to feel sexy and swanky while eating a big bowl of campanelle? If so, L'Amico is the spot to go! Recently, one of my best lady friends and I had a romantic date night at L'Amico (...because who needs a boyfriend?), and I definitely left very full and quite satiated.To start out the evening, we split a plate of Brussels Sprout & Salsify Salad, mixed with pancetta, cipollini onions, and hazelnuts. (We smelled them wafting in the air when we entered; it was on our minds!)There were definitely many flavor elements melding in this dish, from sweet to salty to acidic. It really hit me from all angles! From there, we split a bowl of the aforementioned campenelle (house made) with braised short rib and horseradish ricotta. This was my favorite of all of the courses we ate. My friend, a bit weary from a long work day, took a bite and her head popped up, eyes wide. For her, it was love at first bite! It was a rich and soothing pasta dish, perfect for a cold winter's night.For our main courses, she opted for the roasted spiced duck breast, while I went for the wood oven roasted chicken. Mine was served with charred broccoli rabe and preserved lemon. The chicken was so moist; if chicken could melt in one's mouth, this chicken came damn close! It was seasoned heavily with herbs and lemon, which was both a pro and a con. Despite all of its seasonings, a little bit more salt would have tied it all together. I could not detect any salt at all! The lemon flavor was also omnipresent on the broccoli rabe, which was delicious but a tad overwhelming by the time I was finished with my dish. I had a bite of my friend's duck, which was also delicious and perfectly cooked; an overcooked duck is a sad thing. For dessert, we split a bowl of gelato with two flavors, a pistachio with orange marmalade and an off-menu special of marzipan. The marzipan was a bit rich in both flavor and consistency, and the pistachio was a great palate cleanser for the marzipan, incidentally! A light and crisp pizzelle cookie floated above the top of the scoops, a nice contrast in consistency between bites of gelato.Overall, I had a large and satisfying meal. Coupled with a lovely attentive staff and its sexy atomosphere, I look forward to coming back, likely for a couple more bowls of campanelle, all for myself! (What's wrong with being selfish?)",6,3,4

It's tucked away in a hotel and shares a bathroom with its sister restaurant in the other side of the hotel lobby (you HAVE to check out the bathroom. very modern in my opinion). My boyfriend loved the clam pizza on their older menu (was it the winter one? I'm not sure...). Anyways, we loved the place so much, we went back for a second time. I wasn't a big fan of the burned edges of the pizza crust (my favorite part!), so I ordered a chicken sausage frittata instead. It was on the specials the day we went. Since the menu switched to match the season, the clam pizza was only on the dinner menu and we went for brunch. So we ordered the smoked salmon pizza instead. The frittata was served on an adorable little skillet and tasted oh so very light! I loved how fluffy the egg was! The only complaint I had about it was that it tasted kind of bland but maybe that was the point, who knows?The lox pizza reminded me of a breakfast bagel but much lighter and fresher!The olive oil on each table is also a nice touch - always love dipping any type of bread in olive oil!Looking for the next occasion to go back to try more things on the menu!",,,1

139,Alex S.,"New York, NY",20,91,54,4.0,1/10/2016,"As another reviewer pointed out, it's great that there are quality restaurants opening up near MSG.  I've now been to L'Amico twice, and have enjoyed both meals.  The modern / rustic decor with the open kitchen complements the style of the food well; plates are vibrant but not overly complicated.  During my first visit which was within a week of the opening, the service wasn't particularly great (especially at the bar while waiting to be seated), however, after this latest visit it seems they've worked out the kinks and now have a pretty smooth-running operation.The last time around we went for brunch, and I ordered the cotechino hash and poached eggs (if you have hash and poached eggs on a plate together I will order it every time).  The flavors were great and the poached eggs were cooked nicely, but the texture of the hash was a bit mushy.  If the hash was crispier the texture of the dish would have been much more balanced.  I also tried the fennel sausage and eggs pie which was a flavor bomb, but bear in mind that the slower you eat the more soggy the dough will get (especially once you split the egg open).  Lastly, the wood oven baked eggs were also a solid dish.  It's served in the baking dish with caponata and two slices of L'Amico's delicious, toasted bread.  The crunchy bread is perfect for scooping out the eggs / caponata as you make your way through the dish.  Again, overall we were very pleased with the food.The prices at L'Amico are pretty reasonable despite its chicness, and if you can get a reservation - the restaurant seems to be packed most of the time - I recommend you do. I'm looking forward to trying their dinner menu soon.",2,1,1

141,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,2.0,12/4/2015,"KenScale: 6.5/10At the end of my dinner at L'Amico, a new Italian restaurant at Eventi Hotel led by chef Laurent Tourondel, the hostess was struggling to find our coats and bags even though we were given coat check tags earlier. We had to go to the back of the restaurant at the coat check, and one of the security dudes at the hotel started snapping at us: ""You are not supposed to be here."" We explained how the hostess lost track of all of our belongings, to no avail. The exchanges got pretty heated until the guy said ""Chill the fxxx out, man."" I was so mad so I started yelling back while the hostess desperately explained how the restaurant was running a separate operation from the hotel and they had no control over these security dudes. Well, I had to get this out first. My Yelp reviews don't typically talk about services and KenScale is predominantly based on the quality of food. In other words, I probably would've given an OK score had the food from this bustling restaurant been actually decent notwithstanding this horrific encounter. Alas, that wasn't the case.The menu at L'Amico is just an assortment of so-and-so Italian dishes. Roasted pear and prosciutto that came with gorgonzola toast, endive and walnut was tasty, with nice combination of different ingredients that would make it a nice starter. The sausage pizza with shishito on top, however, felt flat and the crust took too much portion of the entire pie. Fussili pasta that came with spicy sausage, bitter greens, pine nuts, chiles and pecorino was nicely done, but I've had way better pastas in countless Italian places in the city. Black sea bass with olive oil mashed potatoes was simply overcooked; I didn't understand why the fish should be so tough when I've had so many silky smooth bass elsewhere. For dessert, frozen Meyer lemon had the refreshing touch that somewhat lessened my disappointment with the meal, but apple-walnut cake with acacia honey gelato was pedestrian and surprisingly crumbled so easily without the firm texture I was expecting.Despite this subpar experience, the restaurant was overflowing with people on a weekday night (I suspect many of them just coming straight from work in Midtown, and the location of this place certainly help), although getting a reservation wasn't particularly challenging. The restaurant has a full bar with many Italian-centric wine selections. Combine the terrible service and mediocre meal, and I've had one of the worst dining experiences this year. There are other restaurants nearby (try Lupulo for instance) that deserve your patronage way more than this classic tourist/after-work trap. I'm a pretty generous Yelp review who tries to find redeeming qualities in all restaurants no matter how underwhelming my experience is and haven't never given two stars. Go figure.",4,,1
142,Jessica O.,"Indianapolis, IN",52,72,75,4.0,11/19/2016,"It was my last day of my week in NYC (for a work conference), and I finally did not have conference this day. So what do I do on the last day? Eat of course!L'Amico is well decorated. It's casual, chic, cute and so well-lit. I love places that are well-lit and high ceilings. L'Amico is also where we had reunion of college friends for brunch. I was thankful the wait was limited (although they asked us to have the whole party but later say it's okay we can sit). There is a good selection for brunch. The juices... mmm... pricey. Dishes are probably what one would expect to pay for in NYC. But oh my they are so pretty when they come out! We ordered a wide array and shared between the 6 of us and I have to say... the pancakes were my favorite. They come out in a huge stack and they're so fluffy and melt in your mouth. That was me raving, it's unfortunate that typing on the interface loses the fluctuations, intonation and excitement I would have in my voice if I were actually telling you about it. Please, if you come, pancakes won't disappoint. The egg dishes were flavorful but none stood out so much that I would rave about it. Bathroom is slightly far, it's in a different area, and while I was initially slightly confused how to get there.. it's a nice bathroom and rustic and farmy, but modern. I liked this bathroom. Service during our meal was very courteous, no complaints. Overall, I would probably say this was not quite a 4 but more 4 than 3. I would definitely not mind returning but with all the selections out there in NYC, it might be a while before I work my way back here. It is worth checking out and I did enjoy coming here.

146,Judy K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",424,213,764,5.0,5/15/2016,"Spring menu is light, delicious and great for weekend lunch. There are big windows across the wall which brings in a lot of light for a NY location. I was sitting by the window and it was the perfect seating for my mom and daughter date. Unfortunately, bigger tables aren't located by the window, but you still get the warm ambiance of the sun. And the open kitchen makes it more homey. I don't know why, but the ability to turn my head and see the chef cooking up dishes make it more personable. The waiter was friendly and extremely knowledgable. I ended up ordering the mussel special that was cooked with beer instead of white wine - absolutely delicious! Wine usually makes the broth lighter, but I loved the beer substitute, it gave the broth a deeper and more flavorful taste to pair with my garlic bread. And the mussels weren't those puny little ones you get at the other restaurants, they were big, juicy and a mouthful. I also got the crab avocado toast which was just a-okay. You can't go wrong with those ingredients, but compared to the mussels, it was just mediocre.The agnolotti pasta was superb! It was filled with this seafood goodness like lobster, scallops and crab meat. The sauce wasn't too heavy either which probably is the best part. Something about white sauces make pasta dishes a bit heavier, but not this one! My salmon salad with avocado was pretty basic and not amazing. I wouldn't recommend this one since it's literally a salad thrown together with salad and avocado. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but I'm a fan of the pasta dish more.ALSO! I asked for a wine recommendation and it was fabuloso! Not too sweet, not too dry and super refreshing. I wish I remembered what he brought out, but it was the perfect summertime drink.",,,

My glass of wine was $18 and because the server was busy and taking a long time to bring us things, I asked him for a second glass while I still had almost half of my first one left. He came back with the bottle and topped off my glass. It was awkward and I felt funny saying something but the glass of wine was not cheap and to top off a glass and then charge me for a second full one is poor service. My husband mentioned it and he said they don't normally do that but that he's come back and give me more which he never did.

Pastries were world class, but a tad expensive ( $13 for the bread. ) theBread in particular was great, slightly burnt, topped with almonds, served with ricotta and honey. It's the perfect starter. The Burratta is also worth getting and comes peppered and on a bed of prepared figs. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly. French Toast was made with Brioche and could not have been better.the crowd was good looking and fun and the space is great.Unfortunately, NY is a competitive town and you don't get four stars for doing a few things very well. The entrees took over 40 mintues and only came after the waitress asked how I had enjoyed the meal. One of the eggs was so overdone I couldn't eat it and the other one was runny. Clearly they forgot it and then tried to microwave it, adding insult to injury. They did the right thing by taking it off the meal and asked me if I wanted something else, but then added the something else ( Fabulous French Toast) to the bill. The other two entrees were Luke warm to cold.Bottom line is some great food was off set by mediocre service and one mangled dish. The staff is friendly and helpful but didn't make up for the late food or the kitchens failure.I'll come back again. The vibe and hopefully better execution deserve another shot.",1,,

Fruit flies kept falling into my coworker's wine as we were at the end with the stone basket holding some fruit they used for the cocktails. Interesting bowl with crystal in it, I think.The beer selection small, nothing on tap, but they were good about replacing the wine each time critters fell in. The appetizers - the yellowtail tartare was good, but the baked octopus was a bit too grilled and the dish lacked flavor.The pizza - we had a white mushroom pizza that was okay - where it wasn't burnt. Too many pieces I had to eat around or just break off. I'm not a fan of that kind of pizza (I know some are, they'll give this place a better review).The pasta, though, was good. Solid work on the fegato triangoli. Will come back for that one.Service was good, the bartender was attentive, though definitely wanted things his own way.

158,Adrienne Z.,"KEW GARDEN HL, NY",1,14,7,5.0,6/5/2016,"Excellent service.*Highly recommend the Agnlotti pasta with scallops, lobster, shrimp, and lemon-mascarpone. The agnolotti is a small square shaped ravioli-like pasta stuffed with seafood, and it is divine! The sauce is lightly and perfectly lemony. Tasted a friend's bolognese pasta, which we both found to be too salty. The white mushroom pizza with truffle paste, fontina, taleggio and sage was good, though also a little too salty, and way more charred than expected. The yellowtail antipasti with grated like, orange confit, and sea salt is delicious. *Servers and chefs were open and helpful in choosing and ordering off-the-menu pasta noodles.",,,

166,Kyle S.,"Manhattan, NY",18,86,563,4.0,4/1/2016,"I have been to L'Amico a total of three times (for both brunch and dinner). I think the food warrants 5 stars, however the service I received during my last meal there shaves it down to 4, sadly. The menu changes seasonally-- I have tried a few of the pizzas, which were all fantastic-- and the Gnudi I tried last November was delicious. It is relatively large space with good energy. Onto the bad-- I had a reservation the last time I went and showed up on time-- The hostess kept telling us that our table wasn't ready yet and was not apologetic about it at all. Eventually, she realized how frustrated we were--after we bugged her a few more times-- and ultimately offered us a glass of complimentary champagne from the bar. We told her yes-- and never received the complimentary drink. We finally were seated about 25-30 minutes after our reservation time.I'm hoping that they have gotten their act together since then-- Or maybe it was just growing pains or a one-off night. As long as the service improves, I think the food is really solid. If you like beer, they have this DELICIOUS German beer on the menu. It's called SCHNEIDER EDEL WEISS. Get it-- notes of banana, nutty, smooth. It's awesome.",,,

But L'amico is not my amico :(Food is good though nothing really to rave about. I could have given it 3.5 starts if I am feeling generous and because of the beautiful decor. Yet I have to stay honest and for sake of the Yelpers that are reading my posts - service was very very slow: 20 mins wait for our wine, 30 mins for two apps to arrive, another good 30 mins for our entree and 20 mins for the check.

We have dined and drank several time at L'Amico. We sat at the bar as we usually do. The service was outstanding. Food came out in a timely manner and in the order I requested. We started off with a cocktail Non É Acqua. Beautiful prepared tequila cocktail that I could have had several. The food is spot on. On this visit we enjoyed the octopus app. The octopus was cooked correctly. The purée and sauces accompanied were tasty. Next we had the soppresatta pizza, again perfectly sauced, cheese was outstanding and burnt just right. The scallop dish included three scallops on a bed of cauliflower purée, roasted chickpeas with other bits and bites. At $34, a small portion but it was so good I want to order a second.

Terrible service. perhaps the worst ever. OK, past few times service wasnt good, but this was terrible. Waiter instantly approached us, and served water. Came back for drink orders in 20 minutes. Wasn't that busy. Fnally ordered food,however no drinks arrived. Food came out fast, too fast, still no drinks. Drinks arrived when we were half way done. No apology.

Decent place for brunch, though.We stopped by as part of a group of four on a Saturday for brunch, although it was actually lunch (brunch is only on Sundays). For our meal, we split the burrata and meatballs as apps, the white mushroom and Esposito's sausage pizzas, and the agnolotti and fusilli pastas. Of all the dishes, the sausage pizza was the most memorable; while the flavors were generally very good, the mushroom pizza had a bit too much on it given the lack of heft on the crust, making it a bit too soggy. The rest of the dishes were decent, the meatballs in particular maybe a bit better than average, but nothing particularly outstanding. Given the quality of some of the dishes, I'd probably come back and try a few other dishes, although perhaps a bit more focus on the pizzas and the appetizers.",1,,

Updated review","Update: my original review is below, and I gave 5 stars originally. Since writing, the menu and plating of dishes has changed for the worse. The tuna is now carpaccio, so if you like slimy this is gonna work for you. Not my thing.The market greens now have a creamy dressing making it entirely average in every way. Mine had been dressed too early and came to the table somewhat limp.The calamari are still a winner as are the meatballs, but overall I think chef has changed my faves to lesser dishes. Hoping he'll reconsider. ---For a meatball this good, I would travel a long way. Lucky for me, it's on my doorstep. Tender, beautifully spiced and seasoned, with just enough sauce for mopping up with the delicious bread accompaniment, the meatballs are an easy delight. Spiced tuna and the market greens (which was kale based in September) were also terrific. The capers and anchovy based dressing on the salad is flavorful and thankfully tonight, not too much of it, so the salt doesn't overpower. Someone got heavy-handed for a few weeks on that front but they seem to have righted that wrong. But what's new for me is the glowing ambience in the restaurant. I've been sampling this menu for a few months now in The Vine (awesome bar and cocktails by the way), but I love the buzz here in the main restaurant. The wood pizza ovens add a warmth that will kick-ass in winter. And everyone just seemed, well, joyful. I normally pass on dessert, but convince someone to share the black cherry and amaretto ice cream with you and you won't regret it.I can't recommend this place enough. Bring friends - food this lovely is worth sharing.",1,,
176,Tammy L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",33,92,49,4.0,9/9/2016,Came here for a client dinner and was impressed.  The staff and waitress were very attentive.  Asked the waitress to surprise me with a fruity cocktail and it was delicious!  Subtly strong and super tasty!   Can't recall the name of it!For dinner I ordered the skirt steak with a side of eggplant Parmesan. The steak was pretty standard and it was a bit chewy for a medium rare in my opinion. The eggplant Parmesan tasted exactly how I imagined it would!  I would definitely stop by here again!  And I'm surprised their rating would be under a 4 on Yelp.,1,1,

My girls loved the food so much, I had to let them finish off my uni/crab special pasta with just the right amount of lemon added to it.  My husband's Ragu was probably the least favorite; we've had better.  But the rest of the meal was to die for.",1,,1

Had the pizza this time (in addition to our usual favorites).  Best pizza ever!!  The brick oven experience makes the difference between pizza and what the rest of America calls ""pizza"".  Also tried the Tiramisu for the first time.  Wow!!

Definitely wanted to try everything on the menu, especially since their new winter menu had w special white truffle section! But alas would need to work more overtime to afford that. The octopus was quite amazing, super tender and flavorful, one of the best that I've had.  The sausage pizza is also great! Really get the flavored of the oven, thin pizza with a nice chewy crust. Unlike other thin wood oven pizzas like from Vezzos, this crust was nice and chewy still.Pasta was the big let down of the night. Got the short rib pasta, was a little heavy on the vinegar and came out luke warm. Would definitely try another one of their pastas tho!

I went there on the last day of restaurant week. The very well dressed, polite man at the desk said he thought it might be around 45 minutes but it might be longer, and that there was a bar in the adjacent hotel I could wait in with my father. So, we waited. First, from 7:30 to 8:15. I checked in at 8:15 with the host again. He had a lovely ombre bowtie and a plaid shirt. He said it would be a bit longer. I noticed that no one at their bar had turned over. I returned to the hotel bar and waited. Until 9:00pm, when I checkin again with Mr. Bowtie. I said ""I just want to make sure you have my number and that you will call us at some point. I understand it is restaurant week and you seem busy, I just need to know if I should take my dad to another place, I just need to know that you will seat us. It's ok if you can't, just let me know."" He said I was next on the list! Woo. It would be so soon! He tested my phone number to send me a text, which he promptly told me to delete to make sure I would not confuse it with the future text that he would send to tell me that my table was ready. I went back to the hotel bar. To wait again. At 9:54, exactly 2 hours and 26 minutes into our wait, I called another place to make sure they could seat us. I got a cab and left.It has been 5 days, and L'Amico has yet to text me to tell me my table is available. Maybe next week?",3,5,1

It was a $98 per person prix fixe menu.  I did not know that this restaurant was in a hotel, and to me the ambiance seemed like we were in a hotel and not a restaurant. The sommelier was very knowledgeable, and recommended a great bottle of wine (although the most inexpensive wine was $50 a bottle). The first 2 courses were good, however our main course which was a filet mignon was very unsatisfactory. We both requested medium rare, but it was more along the lines of medium to medium well. The outer edges were burnt tasting, and the sides left much to be desired. The dessert was subpar as well. Overall, we spent well over $300 for 2 people, and both of us agreed that our experience was definitely not worth that.",,,

187,Paul B.,"New York, NY",8,8,0,2.0,9/28/2017,"The food here is very good, especially the seafood pasta, which is possibly the best I've ever tasted.  Unfortunately, everything else about the place pretty much sucked the night we went there.  Our table wasn't ready so we had to wait about 30 minutes in the hotel lobby because the bar was so packed.  Despite the fact we told the maitre'd where we were when we checked in he called my cellphone and snippily demanded to know why we weren't there yet.  There was a crush of people hanging around the check-in desk so it was impossible to catch anyone's attention.  The table we were given was a four-top despite the fact we had booked for five.  They added an extra chair which pretty much bumped against the kitchen and had to be moved  every time a waiter pushed by.  The table next to us was so close I could literally bump elbows with the girl next to me.  But honestly the worst thing about this place is the deafening, ear-splitting loudness of the room.  It was like eating in a mosh-pit.  And despite the fact that the front of the house opens up to a particularly noisy and unlovely stretch of Sixth Avenue, for some reason they choose to leave all the doors open to the street, meaning we were constantly being serenaded by sirens and car-horns while we tried to yell at each other.  So in a nutshell:  Quite good pasta, but this place really puts the ""din"" in dinner.",1,,

She kept stuttering and obviously shouldn't be working at a resturant that cost the overpriced fee of $30 dollars a meal. We had to take back the food three times. The first time there was a fly hidden in our seafood pasta. The second time they tried to bring this pasta to us they barely cooked it and put way too much pepper in it, making it un-edible. The Third time they tried to bring us a new dish it was too salty, un-edible, and tasted like I was at McDonald's. On top of that, the manager was rude and didn't have the courage to access the situation and make it a pleasant experience for us. I was really looking forward to trying this resturant and now will never be going back and making sure to tell my friends who live right over the resturant to never go there.",1,,

The server was quite pushy with sides and appetizers and then got rude when we didn't only ordered one side dish. She messed up our drink orders and the (backup?) server had to rescue the order. More rude service ensued, spilled a beer on me, and disappeared for long stretches of the meal. Finally, we charged the meal to the hotel account (upstairs is the Hotel Eventi), the server asks us ""do you know how to fill out a room charge?"" Yes, we write in the room number. TLDR:Yes, the pasta and fish courses were amazing. Yes, the decor is airy and charming, perfect for a summer evening. But the puzzlingly rude service definitely didn't make up for it.",1,2,

We ordered the benedict, lemon ricotta pancakes, french toast, and omelette souffle. Besides the benedict, the kitchen has managed to do something extraordinary here - every dish had exactly the same texture. Fluffy mush. The omelette souffle was probably supposed to taste that way, but it's oddly incredible that they managed to get bread and pancakes to have the outwardly appearance of being bread and pancakes, but inside completely mushy. Not really sure how to describe it and I'm still trying to figure out the physics of it. It's a shame because I thought the flavor was pretty good, but just lacking texture resembling that of food.When I asked the waiter who was refilling water to tell me how the eggs were cooked in one of the dishes, he told me he didn't know so I had to flag down someone else.
