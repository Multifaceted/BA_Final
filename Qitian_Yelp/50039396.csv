0,Tanesha J.,"Bronx, NY",446,46,247,4.0,10/23/2018,"Had a nice time at the Sugar Factory. The drinks are always on point. Was slightly disappointed at the time it took to get my food. After 30 minutes had passed, I had to alert the waiter and ask him about our order. Was really disappointed that it was cold after waiting 40 minutes for it. I do understand that it was really packed but cold food is unacceptable. The garlic butter on the steak made it flavorful so it was still enjoyable. Cold fries suck. I ate a few but wasn't that enthused.Overall the atmosphere, the service, and drinks were good. I would go again and give them another try because there were a few items on the menu I would like to try.I had a good night out...",1,,
1,Lynn V.,"New York, NY",21,82,26,2.0,11/9/2018,"My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my birthday. Much like many other parties here. They bring out a nice dessert and sing a fun cheery song to you. He made a reservation and we still had to wait about 20 minutes before we got seated. This place is packed because of all the hype of the celebration.The food was meh, it was more of the ambiance of the place. The big dragon breath drinks was made for instagram and snapchat, so if that's your thing, then definitely check this place out. The drink itself was definitely cold. It was fun just to try it. We both got a burger and it was meh. I asked for medium and it was rare. Burger was quite disappointing. Price for the food was too much. It really just is a place to go to get the photo and video of the drink when the waiter pours it. Overpriced and just all hype. It was an interesting experience, but probably only worth one visit in your lifetime.",,,
2,Esther Z.,"REGO PARK, NY",0,19,1,1.0,11/1/2018,"Disappointing.Food: will 100% find better quality in the dumpster next door. Over cooked pasta that looked like soup because of the amount of sauce. Salad with unwashed lettuce and tomatoes. ($20 salad resembling McDonald's salad btw) Drinks: $38 bucks for 1 generic alcohol shot in a sugar filled goblet drink. (They charge even more if you want tequila) Service: Slow. Waited about 20 minutes for all of our drinks to come out, kind you at all different times. Impossible to track down your waiter. Manager seems like he's in over his head with all that's going wrong. If you're already expecting to spend this much on a night out, go to STK or literally any other restaurant on the blocks surrounding it.",,,

4,Apephanie P.,"Philadelphia, PA",159,192,890,4.0,10/14/2018,This location is a lot smaller than I imagined. I'm glad we came the time we did because I can tell it will get very loud with screaming children. Service was good and fast. We had reservations and was seated right away. We even ran into a reality tv celebrity which was Awesome! Dreamdoll was super sweet and willing to take a picture with us even though she was in a business meeting (if I would have known that I wouldn't of bothered her)Appetizer came out quick and Hot. Entree's came out not too long after. We were probably only seated about an hour. The smoking drink is definitely just for show & not worth the price. They say it's 64 oz with 8 shots of liquor in it. That's the smallest 64oz I've ever seen and 8shots my butt. All I did taste was sweetness from whatever sugary stuff they put in itWould I return yes to try another dish but I wouldn't get that $40 drink again.,3,1,2

Updated review","My besties 10 year old daughter called me to ask if I could please help organize her birthday dinner at SUGAR FACTORY - I was honored.  I wanted to make her happy. She asked that I make reservations for 11 of her closes friends and family to meet to celebrate around 630pm. I was so excited to do it again. (3rd visit) Yet, there were a great deal of hiccups that had to be brought to mention. 1. Waitress- KIMBERLY spilled waffle syrup all over the birthday girls clothing. Kim was reaching over to place it on the table but rushed and flung it. The plate tipped and both syrups for the chicken and waffles ruined her dress and PINK coat.  She cried when we couldn't get it cleaned.2. When we received the birthday girls ice cream platter it had a hair in the vanilla ice cream. Yuck!3. To make matters worse...while tallying the bill the waitress - Kimberly decided to re-light the candles on the table and the napkin started to go up in flames when we moved a plate to make room for  our left over containers. Chris the manager immediately came to the rescue. He was pissed but I was not at fault. Why would a waitress light candles while we're still seated and getting ready to leave?Now these are too big of hiccups for me to discuss the taste of the food. The kids and adults were no longer excited after the BIRTHDAY girls clothes got ruined and the hair in the ice cream. We felt  the waitress was in to much of a hurry and that caused all the mishaps, well except for the long brown hair in the vanilla ice cream. Chris was very overwhelmed with everything and gave us the birthday cake with hair for free and a lollipop! The bill was $459.00 we paid and left not feeling pleased about the service we received. We came, we ate, WE will not be doing it again. Thanks but NO THANKS!",,,

Updated review","This was deff my first time here!Was it a cool place? Yes.Was it well lit? For sure.Large variety of drinks? DeffLarge variety of food? I would say so.Drinks unique? Yea they are candy themed, so they are sweet. They bring you the big goblet out and then pour the drink in it and it starts bubbling and smoking! That was so cool lol 60oz drink! The food wasn't all that to be honest. I guess you can come here for the specialty drinks!If it's your birthday boooooyyyy to they hype it up! It was actually pretty dam cool lolThe floors tho were very slippery. I had to walk carefully. Even the bathroom the floors were slippery lol Bathrooms are neutral so don't look for a Mans or Woman's door. I also did want to mention that the waiter Earnest was super dope! Really friendly dude! Had a lot of energy! So much so I told him he needed to be around for my birthday hahaha he brought a lot of energy on to the floor which is really great! He deff needs some recognition.",2,2,3
7,Onvara A.,"Cary, NC",30,311,594,2.0,10/10/2018,"I was pretty excited to try out Sugar Factory but left feeling disappointed.Service is really poor and food is pricey and unremarkable.Each goblet is $36. We got the Fuzzy Peach Mango goblet which came with gummy penguins. It was cool seeing the fog effect with the dry ice when they poured the drink, but other than that I would say it's not worth it. We couldn't taste any alcohol in the drink at all, it was really really sugary, and the gummy penguins were so frozen we couldn't even eat them.Service is also very poor. We also ordered a crepe, but our waiter never brought our order out after 45 minutes of waiting. We ended up cancelling our order. He also never checked up on us or gave us cups of water, but we noticed that tables around us had all gotten water.Atmosphere is pretty good if you're looking for a night out or birthday celebration - music is very loud and pregame material.",,1,
8,Lisa C.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",36,224,353,4.0,10/10/2018,"A fun place to go for drinks with friends. They serve food too, but the drinks are the centerpiece of this place. They are fun to look at with the gummy candies mixed in and the dry ice overflowing out of the cup. They are also HUGE, which make them great for sharing. Each giant drink is about $36.My favorite was the ""Hot & Wild Spicey 305 Pineapple"" (designed by Pitbull!) The jalapeno and blended chipotle pineapples helped to balance out the sweetness of the drink. Wasn't super spicy but definitely had a nice kick. Also, those spicy chili pepper gummies that are in the drink are AMAZING! Didn't even know those things existed and I thought I was a gummy expert! They don't sell them in their storefront (meatpacking location), but our waitress hooked us up with quite a few pieces in a to-go bag. Apparently, they don't really sell them because the gummies aren't super popular (not sure why though- seriously, if you're into sweet & spicy things, you MUST try these chili gummies). Note: Many people were celebrating a birthday (except for me and my friend)... so every 10 minutes or so, the servers would come out singing Happy Birthday. If you splurged on a fancier dessert, they would shut off the lights and blast some music (as if you're in a club) before singing you Happy Birthday. Just wanted to point that out since some people might find this annoying.",,,

Updated review","My third review and probably my fifth or sixth visit to Sugar Factory...Like I said the first and second time, cannot complaint about the food or the prices. Servings are still HUGE and food is delicious. We ended up here on Saturday after taking a walk through the High Line, came with my partner as usual, my sister, her boyfriend and the bf's brother.Fifth or sixth visit and still, cannot complain about the service. The waiters are THE BEST. Always accommodating, they suggest drinks and food based on what you tell them you like. This particular time we had an issue and was quickly resolved by the manager, who didn't even have to... but again, they are soooo attentive. I will explain what happened: my partner and my sister's partner ordered the *Berry Bliss Goblet* but they did not like the taste of it, I called the waiter and explained to him what they ordered and the fact that they did not like it and he saw that they had not taken more than one sip, because the goblet was completely full so the attentive Dame (our waiter) spoke to the manager and he came to us and said he would exchange the drink for another one at no cost. Isn't this awesome!!?? They decided for the Lollipop Passion Goblet.Since it was Saturday night, the place was packed. I made a reservation when we were walking on the HL 'cause I already knew how packed it gets, specially on weekend nights. We waited less than 10 minutes, due to we got there before our reservation time and still they seated us in a huge table right after 9 minuted passed.Every time I come to SF, I go home DRUNK af, this was the first time I did not have any alcohol due to health concerns and decided to (FINALLY) try one of their shakes. I ordered their famous and delicious *Tie Dye Milkshake*, which we thought was going to be super sweet due to the ingredients in it but it came as a surprise the fact that although it is decorated with all these sweets, the actual shake is great-not sweet at all, and makes a great balance with the cotton candy and the skittles and the chocolate that decor the glass. It's my boo's birthday tomorrow so Dame was attentive enough to also bring chocolate cake and sing HBD for him. I keep recommending this place, specially if you have kids not too young, or you want to go to a rocking restaurant with crazy drinks and delicious cheap food. The ambiance is great, and the service is even better.",2,2,2
10,Melissa V.,"Westbury, NY",164,44,135,3.0,10/27/2018,"You know I'm sadly not overwhelmed or raving about having finally come here. The things I did enjoy: the vibe / entertainment, the atmosphere, the music, and most importantly the presentation of the drinks. The food- eh. Maybe it was because I got a burger compared to everyone's else dish but it wasn't something I felt was worth coming back for but I am certainly up for at least going back to give it another try. You do have to have all people present if you have a reservation or you will not be seated. We started off with a calamari which probably wasn't enough like the waiter said- but it may be if everyone at your table ate before hand. The calamari is good it comes in a cute red basket with a tarter sauce it tasted like and a marinara. It was crunchy but would have been bland if not dipped in anything. For dinner I ordered the turkey burger, and maybe that's where I went wrong. First the burger did not look appetizing and when I went in to take a bite the whole burger was so toasted the bun eventually crackled and broke. But the burger was tasty despite the bad looks. The fries it came with could have been crunchier or at least salted better which is not something I want to do when I go out to eat. But it happens understandably enough. For the rest of my table sadly due to drinks I don't remember the only other plate I do remember is the chicken and waffles. Now that is something I wish I snapped a picture of! It looked crisp and cooked perfectly. Now the drinks. For the huge fishbowl drink be prepared to spend $32 for a virgin and $34 for alcoholic. I got the Berry Bliss drink, which is great and sweet. BUT leave it sitting for too long all of the sugar from the berries mixed with that alcohol becomes insanely sweet and if your like me, you'll need to carry a tums. If you drink then just get the alcohol if not the virgin is equally as good. The presentation was amazing and the waiters are good because of course they know you want to take that great boomerang or Live Photo. Overall it is a great place to get together, Bill was appropriate at the end of the night, and the food could have been better but it also wasn't something I was overly impressed with.",,,
11,Alyssa G.,"Palisades Park, NJ",1196,431,558,3.0,10/13/2018,"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend the other day. I personally thought it was going to be a little more packed for 5pm on a Thursday, but lucky for us it wasn't. Before coming here, we had a ballpark idea of what the prices were. As I read previous reviews, many complained about it being overpriced, and grant it...it is, but you need to keep in mind you are paying more so for the experience than the food. The staff members from the moment we stepped in were extremely friendly and welcoming. Since it was our first time here we had to get one of those fun Smokey Goblets. We decided to share the peach mango one and the waiter was kind enough to allow me to substitute the penguin gummies for the long lollipop. Prices- $32 for virgin $36 for liquor (of course we got the liquor one). It was tasty, however, we hardly tasted any liquor in. We wound up finishing it and did not even catch a buzz, just a major sugar rush. I must say, even though it was a lot of money for mainly sugar and soda, getting the goblet was fun and made some good instagram/snapchat/yelp profile picture worthy photos. We also decided to pick on some appetizers. The rainbow sliders- they tasted just okay, but I found them to be visually appealing...and it was cool they came  with cute small rubber ducks we got to keep!Tomato soup- This was actually amazing and I love how it came with bread and melted cheese layer right on top of the soup.Mac and cheese pops- Portion was bigger than I thought it would be, but we found them to be very dry. As delicious as the desserts did look, we opted to not get any because after that Goblet, we were not in the mood to have any more sugar. I would be interested in returning again in the future to try it though!",9,4,7
12,Tahima B.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,122,245,2.0,7/7/2018,"Made a reservation here for my niece's graduation celebration. The woman up front was a little rude, and was disinterested helping anyone that came in. We were seated and our waitress had a better attitude. It was really cold in the restaurant. We ordered our food- my niece ordered her goblet which was okay. We ordered our food which was also okay. Some of the plates and glasses were not clean. I got the rainbow sliders- the bun tasted very weird, the meat was okay. We also ordered the shrimp crepe which was very sloppy- because of all the sauce the crepe was very soggy. We also had their veggie omelette- nothing special. Overall, I recommend going here for one drink and maybe a few smaller bites. Wouldn't come back.",3,1,1
13,Aisha N.,"Dix Hills, NY",0,71,31,5.0,9/25/2018,"Excellent customer service! We arrived about 5 minutes before closing and the manager was kind enough let us stay and have us seated. We got the chocolate cookie jar old fashioned milk shake and a bananas foster ice cream sandwich. I made a big mistake I shouldn't have gotten the old fashioned milkshake because quite frankly you can get those at other places. I do however wish I had gotten the insane milkshake because those are one of a kind. One complaint though the macadamia nut cookie that came with the bananas foster ice cream sandwich tasted stale. I think it's because we were the last customers that evening so maybe the cookies were sitting out all day. However, I still give them five stars because of their excellent customer service.",1,,2

Ridiculous how people are standing on staircase and in hall because there's no place to wait except outside. We had reservations and were taken by our time. Waaaaay overpriced goblet drinks at $30 a piece. Let me keep the glass for that price! We had very slow service. Took 20 minutes for a waiter to come to table, another 20 to get our drinks, once we ordered dessert, that took another 30 minutes. We were there almost 3 hours. should have been out in under 2.Food was good but not great. Disappointed with the decor. With a name like sugar factory, I guess I expected different. It's pretty plain with some chandeliers.The retail store, where we thought we would kill our waiting time was the size of a roadside newsstand and had nothing special. There for my daughters birthday with some friends. They enjoyed it, but agreed it's not a place they would ask to come back to.I would try the other location just to see if it's better.",1,,

The food is just okay, nothing really spectacular about it. But I think most people go for the name (celebrities frequent this place), vibe and candy anyway! I would recommend as an impromptu birthday spot (given all the other great options with amazing food in NYC). Reservation was not too difficult (we made the day of), prices are not outrageous and the customer service was very good.

We made reservations online and got seated right away! We ordered the appitizer sampler which came with wings (which were delicious !!!!) mac and cheese bites, onion rings and more and various sauces. Recommend that to anyone who never knows what to order.we put our drinks in and they didn't come out till after we got our dinner which was a little annoyingFor dinner I ordered the sliders which were on the appitizer menu. It came with 5 sliders with multicolored buns just like sponge bobs pretty patties. It's perfect for a dinner entree. I ordered the lollipop passion goblet and it was so yummy ! Very sweet though. A lot of ice and the bottom became a slushee which was really grossThey also have bottomless brunch saturdays and Sundays so I'll definitely be back to try that",3,,

They kept asking me if they really can drink this and whether they were allowed to have them....they never saw such giant goblets of smoking sugar water filled with candy necklaces, unicorn pops, and blow pops. They could not stop giggling...and this continued on through the entire night after the sugar rush.We ordered the lollipop passion goblet, berry bliss goblet, sour apple lolly, hazelnut fondue, sugar factory club and a burger. We really had a great time, my kids enjoyed the visit. I knocked off a star because of the hour long wait, which resulted in my kids filling up their candy by the pound bags...and my youngest toting around a 5 lb gummy bear. I think I spent $50 just in their waiting area aka candy bar before being seated upstairs.",5,4,6
20,Daniela E.,"Willingboro, NJ",154,134,458,3.0,5/14/2018,"To be completely honest I was not really impressed with this place at all. The tables are super close together which they try to fit as much people possible in the space they have which makes the experience not personable at all. We got the lollipop passion, the presentation is pretty cool and I guess that's what why everyone comes here for that. The drink was strong which was good but it did not have much actual flavor. We ordered a goblet drink, if we were to visit again I would try ordering a cocktail or martini next time since it seems those might b better in taste. We really only came for the drink but Yelp check in offers a free appetizer of the Mac & Cheese Pops which came with 3 big cheesy pops and that was pretty good. They had quite a few birthday celebrations which they have quite an impressive birthday sing along. I think this may be a great place for teenagers as they do offer non-alcoholic versions of their drinks and I could see how a place like this might interest them. Overall, I wasn't really impressed.",4,,

It's $36 and equivalent to 3 drinks.  It'll be perfect for your social mediass snapgram tings. The food was surprisingly good. Burgers were juicy. Check in and you get a free appetizer.Music is too loud for my granny ears, but it's a good time if you love mainstream pop dance music while sipping on your goblets and chowing down a burger.

There are a couple of things you need to know.....1 this place is very small, if you look on line or search it up it looks huge but in reality it's small. If your a large fella they have to move the tables out for you so you can sit. 2 the food is simple - simple like cheese burger n fries is $20 3 expect to pay top dollar for your sugar factory drink but can't take the cups home with you. But like I said it's all about the experience and just the fun of seeing the smoke come out and ur gummies bear/worm get cold and fill with liquor because you eat them last.

The major downside of sugar factory is that their drinks are super over priced like what everyone is saying. Despite people's calls to not get a goblet drink, I ordered The Drake. It's whiskey based and really yummy. I really enjoyed the peach rings that were included at the bottom of the drink. It was fun to have the waiter wait for me to get my phone out to record before he started pouring the liquid concoction into the cup. However, I don't think this drink was worth $38 dollars. I didn't really taste the alcohol in it and I got the most minimal buzz. Also, they did not remove the ""Made in Taiwan"" stickers at the bottom of the cup, which is pretty tacky to me. I also had the onion rings. They were just ok. I guess you can't really mess these up. I wasn't really a fan of the chipotle or bbq saucesDespite being overpriced, the staff is really nice and accommodated me and my mom quickly even though we didn't have a Reservation.",5,3,

Plenty of room at the bar once seated we decided on our drinks I had the Energy bear my friend had the Fuzzy peach penguin mango .. say that 3 times fast lolll I do love my gummy bears partial reason for getting this one but needed a small boost of energy this is watermelon vodka along with other spirits & tropical fruits plus some Red Bull drinks itself is not bad in taste but like many of the drinks it's all in the taste with a lack of alcohol. Fuzzy peach was fun to try simply because it's a Pitbull creation why not .. fruity vodka, citrus soda & a lot of candy as u may imagine way too sweet also lacking in alcohol. This location is much bigger than it's previous this is two floors plenty of seating, fun decor, service at the bar was good prices well ... overpriced for sure worth the try at least once just for them cool pics & videos.

To be honest, I personally would have never even looked twice at this place because the name alone sounds like a heart attack, but I was staying optimistic after being invited by a friend with three kids.

I wanted to try the goblet which was very pricey and disappointing. The drink was a big bowl of sugar, you could hardly taste the liquor. I did not want to disappoint my friend since he was paying so I tried my best to finish but did not enjoy it all. The food literally tastes like diner food but costs twice as much.

The place was mostly empty but the celebratory energy was still there, which made us smile as soon as we entered. Within three minutes, there must have been five Happy Birthdays being sung! The food is subpar, definitely not up to New York standards, but it's not what you go for. The service is great, and the ambiance is a blast. Ryan, our server, was SUCH a sweetheart. He takes care of everyone, sings hilarious birthday songs, and helps you decide just what drink you get - and then makes it for you! Spinach and artichoke dip - couldn't stop eating this! A bit greasy, but so damn good. Grilled chicken sandwich - my friend ordered this and said it was dry. She didn't look too happy with it. Comes with thin fries, which weren't bad. Sugar Factory signature salad - MEH. I am not exaggerating when I say I could've gotten better at Olive Garden. For $19?!? Child, please.  Sugar Factory cappuccino - covered with whipped cream, chocolate, and coconut. The decoration was cute, but not sure it's worth $11!!! I was coaxed into splurging, so I figured I'd try it out. Once the cream melts away, it's equivalent to a Dunkin' Donuts cappuccino. Valentine's Day Goblet - my friend ordered this 60 oz drink. She finished about half of it. Ryan made it for her strong. I think she liked it!",7,4,4

35,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,2.0,1/27/2018,"Sugar factory is a novel candy and sweets themed establishment. I only went to the bar upstairs. Most of their drinks ~40$ and are extremely theatrical. I would say Sugar Factory is one of those places where you go to once, enjoy it and have fun, log the experience in your head, and probably never willingly come back. So it's worth coming once.Service is generally pretty nice, I saw 3 birthdays here with a lot of energy and pa-zaz. I went with a group of 5, and they lumped us all into one group without asking us; this is understandable, but when we tried to split the check, the server couldn't split out the bill for some reason and gave us a lot of attitude. It kind of soured the night, I would have given it 3 stars otherwise.Ordered:Water melon drink - Berry drink - Both drinks were giant fish bowls of rum, vodka, berry/watermelon flavoring, berry/watermelon gummy candies, and dry ice. Just imagine a cauldron of pure sugar and alcohol.",6,1,

We were seated upstairs but just didn't get why it took so long because there were a lot of empty tables.Drinks are on pricier side - we shared 3 fish bowl drinks: ocean blue, raspberry watermelon mojito, and passion punch. Homestly, they were all wayyy to sweet for my liking, but i guess that's why they call it sugar factory.For food, we split a large fried seafood platter, I got the grilled chicken mushroom crepes, friends got a few different burgers. Serving size was on the larger end, and all our food tasted good.Overall the service was ok, food was good, drinks were overly sweet. Considering the high price and in NYC there are so many restaurants to try, I dont think I would go back unless the birthday girl insists.",2,,

Updated review","Ahh sugar factory. I swore I would never set foot in here again. For the first time ever I had a seamless experience. No order mix ups, no extreme noises, and my food was pretty darn good. The wait for your food is still quite ridiculous, but it was a busy Saturday night so I understand. Last two times I went it was in the middle of the week so it never made sense to me. I really enjoyed myself and I can say they stepped up their game. I had flashbacks to my early teen days where this was the ""I'm grown now"" dining spot LOL! Aka the cheesecake factory equivalent for suburban 16yr olds on their birthday.",,,

Goblet drinks, my coworkers and I had decided to come here for happy hour and to our surprise, almost every table has a birthday. Our waiter said he has about 20-50 birthdays in one shift. Nonetheless, due to the busyness of this place, it is recommended to make a reservation ahead of time if you want to sit at a table rather than a bar. We made the reservation a day prior, however we still had to wait for at least 15 minutes when we got here and they wouldn't seat us until everyone has arrived. The Goblet drinks were yummy and sweet. We got the lollipop passion infused with coconut and pineapple flavors. The drink has the liquid nitrogen that forms a cool vapor effect... when the vapor is gone, you can form more vapor by stirring the remaining nitrogen at the bottom...but just don't suck the liquid nitrogen. For food, we ordered the sampler platters, the mac & cheese pops, the rainbow sliders that came with a rubber ducky, the veggie burger, and more... the foods seem average however I really like the mac & cheese pops.",7,5,5

We were seated at a table that was no bigger then a 2X4 in the middle of a high traffic area and every time people passed I was basically eye level to their asses which made my meal even more appetizing. The food was one step above McDonalds not to mention the hair I found in my mayonnaise lased BLT. Oh another plus I wasn't charged extra for the hair. The atmosphere was so noisy you couldn't hear yourself think so conversation was out. All in all not worth the buck fifty we spent for the hour we spent there.

Updated review","I've been here once before, and this is my second time going. The first time I reviewed this place, I was not pleased with the service I received. However, I went back again after a manager reached out to me. We had a FABULOUS time the second time around. Our waiter, Jeremiah, was the absolute bomb dot com. He offered to take pictures for us, he checked on us often, and he was all around friendly. Our food came out really quick along with our drink. We got a giant goblet- the drake and it was delicious. I've got to say, Sugar Factory stepped it up and treated us with all kinds of respect. I recommend going here if you're looking for cool drinks and a good time!",,,
55,Maria B.,"Kenilworth, NJ",206,19,3,2.0,7/26/2018,"I really wish I loved this place as much as everyone else does but I just don't. The one time I went, it was overly crowded BUT I guess that's just expected because it IS THE Sugar Factory but it just felt like there was no where to really sit comfortably. I loved the overall location/venue of course. I ordered one of their iconic goblet drinks (virgin) and it was just wayyyyyyy too sweet to the point of not even being able to drink it. I'm guessing maybe the alcohol tones it down a bit, perhaps? I thought $30 was a little pricey for the drink but seems okay if it's being shared amongst 2-3 people!Their food is amazing, BIG fan of their burger and fries! I'm hoping to give this place another try sometime soon, there's lots of raves on it so I definitely wanna give it a second chance :)**update** Manager contacted me about giving the place a second chance with special discount but never followed up. Unprofessional. Very disappointed.",3,,

But as far as the food, where can I begin? Cold, flavorless and unappetizing. Literally took one bite out of my buffalo chicken sandwich and immediately felt a warning that told me not to eat another unless I wanted food poisoning. It was that bad. It's all about the smoking drinks. The $32.00 smoking drinks. $32 for smoking sprite and food coloring. Kind of nuts. The kids were happy and really that's all that matters. But be prepared. You come here for the novelty. Not the quality.",,,

As of 10/17 the Goblets are $36-$39 with liquor. Ours were pretty strong!

The service is very slow and leaves both kids and adults feeling very impatient. The waiting staff is not the friendliest and they're not too on top of things.

My boyfriends was AMAZING, mine was better once I added an Apple slice. We ordered the baked Brie appetizer. It was amazing. Our appetizer came out before our drinks came to us.

Ordered the rainbow slider appetizer as my main course meal and honestly they were some of the best burgers I've ever had. Perfectly cooked & definitely enough to fill you up, not to mention fun to look at! They come with a little rubber duck that you get to keep lol. We did miss out because we noticed every single table in the restaurant had a ""birthday"" or ""anniversary"" when our waiter asked if we were celebrating anything we said no.... I'm guessing we missed the memo on saying yes and trying to get a free dessert LOL. Besides the food our waiter seemed really busy.

67,Tarek E.,"Westbury, NY",10,53,181,3.0,8/6/2017,"It's just for the novelty type of restaurant. Good for a birthday celebration and goblet drinks that appear to smoke when your drink is poured over the dry ice in the Giblet. But if your looking for a quiet place,  this is not it! We sat upstairs for a party of eight thinking that we can have a conversation, but had difficulty hearing ourselves over the music from the loudspeakers. The food choices were ok and everything was edible except for one dish Mediterranean Chicken  pappardelle, that was literally soaking in butter! And although we ordered it without the chicken, we had to pay the same price (not very customer oriented). Our table had steak frites a variety of Hamburgers and pastas. The burgers took the prize! At an average cost of $20 with French Fries, this is your best bet. Don't forget that the average cocktail goblet is about $38 so your burger and drink will run you $58. Honestly, just try it for once for the novelty, but I would not go back there for the food! If it wasn't for the burgers being good, I would have rated them only two stars!",2,,

Upon walking in the waiting area is CROWDED with people waiting for seats, kids running around sampling candy and employees walking back and fourth. It needs an actual waiting area maybe with a couple seats that's a little more spacious.I came here yesterday around 4 for a birthday which the rude woman who was checking in couldn't find. She kept saying I don't see it I don't see it until we showed her an email. She didn't even apologize. Horrible customer service. I've worked in customer service for a while, I know how to treat customers. Even when it's busy and sometimes they aren't being the nicest.  We finally got seated in the downstairs area. Which was freeeeeezing. Even when loads of larger parties kept coming it, the area stayed cold. I believe there was only two servers down there, we had Kimbella who was very nice. She couldn't be very attentive because she had a lot of other people to take care of so I understand. The manager should've stepped in and added an extra bus boy or something to fill everyone's water glasses or something because I never got one refill of my water. I don't know if this man was the manager but he had a suit on and was just standing there giving orders. Too afraid to get your nice suit dirty with some sour sugar? Anyways, the $36 jumbo drinks that taste likeClub soda was a dub. No liquor. I didn't order it but my cousins did, all the other drinks were very watery I heard too. I think the only good thing was the milk shake my cousin had. I had the buffalo sandwich and the Chinese chicken salad. Me and my sister split this. The sandwich wasn't good, tomatoes tasted funny and it was falling apart. The salad was overly over dressed. Horrible.I will repeat, the employees in the downstairs area were not rude and sang a cute happy birthday song. But sadly, I don't even think the experience of this place is worth the crowd and price and hassle.So expensive for no reason. Please no one come here, save your money and go somewhere else.---------------UPDATE: I was asked to come back and change my review/stars in exchange for $100 off my bill. Still not worth it!

Updated review","After reading my review of their restaurant, management reached out to me for another opportunity to provide 5 star service that everyone pays for and deserves.This was not the case once again. Upon arriving the host is not making any eye contact with anyone, greeting you, welcoming you, assisting you...absolutely nothing. While waiting in the line filled candy shop foyer I was skipped in line while standing directly in front of the hostess waiting for her to pick her head up and I didn't want to be rude and inconsiderate and just started talking to her. After excusing the gentlemen I began to tell her about my reservation which was made by a manager that she did not find and said she didn't even know who the person was(the manager). I was seated in front of the foyer and milkshake bar( most unpleasant table in house). Our server however was very charismatic and had a great attitude. He did however forget our drinks initially and we had to re-request them. He also forgot to bring out an order of mashed potatoes. But his great attitude turned the situation around to be honest. When it was time to pay the bill I was offered a discount by the manager who made my reservation and it was not honored initially until I had to explain the situation and show her the correspondence between him and I. Overall, this place is unique, great location next to the high line and the food was good along with their signature drinks and desserts. However it's a one time thing and good for occasions only. My advice is skip it and dine somewhere where hosts at least smile at you. This place(maybe this location) is overrated.",3,,

Updated review","Update: came back last night with my boyfriend and I for dinner reservations at 8PM. My only complaint upon arrival was no immediate acknowledgement. When she found my reservation, she told us to wait for a few minutes. Not too long of a wait. Once the table was ready she walked us to our table.When we were brought to our table, a cute little treat wrapped in a Chinese box with rubber duckies was waiting for us at the table. What an adorable little surprise! We had the same waiter as last time, his name is Gregory... ask for him, great mannerism and attentive towards his customers. We started off with ordering our drinks, Mai Tai goblets, and ordered their appetizer sampler. When our drinks came they poured it into huge bowls and at the bottom is dry ice for the cool effect. Once we tasted our drinks, they were V E R Y strong! Definitely could get you drunk. When the appetizer sampler came it included mac and cheese balls, chicken wings, chicken tenders and onion rings. This was my first time trying their food and I was impressed with how everything tasted! I enjoyed it.For our entrees, we ordered the fettuccine alfredo and the big cheesy burger in medium well. When our orders came out, it was in huge portions so we had some leftovers to take home since we couldn't finish it. When I had my big cheesy burger (mac and cheese burger) it tasted so good. The burger didn't taste dry at all either. I give the burger a thumbs up! To end the night my boyfriend and I ordered their s'mores fondue. I like it better than the hazelnut fondue. Overall, my experience was very good in comparison to my last visit. Great service, the drinks were very strong and the food was delicious!",2,,1

My chicken sandwich tasted and looked like a frozen patty from the dollar store and so did the fries. The best thing on our table was probably the garden salad. I probably wouldn't go back.,,,
74,Chantel M.,"Allentown, PA",114,64,54,2.0,9/29/2018,"This place is very overrated I think people come here in hopes of seeing a celebrity.  First off it's very small and then overly expensive for drinks that aren't that great.  I wanted to go because I hear people talking about it.  The waitress is what gave this 2 stars she was so friendly.  You get this 40$ drink in a plastic cup that you can't keep, unless you pay 20$.  The drinks barely have alcohol in it.  The food is okay, but not great.  I had a great time because of great family and I loved watching my drink smoke, but overall this is not an experience I want to have over and over again!!!!  On top of that in the bathroom there are murals of naked Women, WHY WOMEN, can't we have SOME NAKED MEN TOO",,,
75,Fateha A.,"Queens, NY",79,224,462,3.0,6/30/2017,"I got the Sloppy Joe ($16) which was perfectly juicy. It came with Bell peppers & a somewhat sweet sauce. I had NO IDEA it would come with a whole bunch of fries though!My friend got the Fettuccine Alfredo, which I loved as well! It was very creamy & I don't like Alfredo. However, she didn't think it was worth the money as it was $17 by itself but it cost an extra $8 to add 6 shrimp (which adds up to $25).I also got the Mai Tai goblet which was huge. It tasted like orange & pineapple juice. It was ok, nothing special. My only complaint is that the goblet was somewhere between 80-90% ice. I really don't appreciate paying $30 (yeah, really!) for mostly ice. It also came with gummy cherries but it wasn't worth it. I had no idea the goblets are $30. It doesn't say so on the menu. Otherwise, I never would've gotten it. I honestly feel kind of cheated. Needless to say I won't be coming back.",2,,
76,Anna L.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,23,25,3.0,2/6/2018,"First time I came here, came in a group of 7 for a friend's birthday. We went on a Monday so it wasn't that busy, there were many reviews about how everyone has to be there or else you can't be seated. However, they let us get seated first which was actually pretty nice. The drinks were pretty nice, ordered a milk shake (Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake). Took me a while to get a sip of it, the cheesecake on top was delicious. I also ordered a monster burger ( The Signature Sugar Factory Burger) which was not so good. I ordered it well done and I guess they cooked it way too long because the patty was so burnt. I would have understood if it was a little burned but it was so burned and dark. I thought I was the only one but my friends burgers were also burnt. Didn't really enjoy the burger as much as I thought I would.Would probably come back but I will probably never order a burger here again. Atmosphere is actually quite nice in the evening they dim the lights a bit, just right so it's in a comfortable environment.",,,1
77,Esther L.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",83,148,408,3.0,12/31/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I went a couple of years ago for a birthday and had a great time. I was amazed by the size of the goblets and enjoyed the novelty of this restaurant. Now a couple years later; I wanted to take a good friend of mine for dinner to experience this restaurant because I had fond memories of it. Perhaps because we were older the same kitsch that was fun a couple of years ago wasn't as exciting now. This is a great restaurant for a birthday but not if you're looking for a quiet setting. There were about five birthday songs that went on throughout our meal.When I entered the restaurant, the hostess told me that she could not seat me until my friend arrived. It was a little annoying since the waiting area is small and you end up standing shoulder to shoulder with people. However, I understand that this restaurant gets booked quickly so they need all the tables that are available. When my friend arrived, we were directed to go upstairs and wait for another hostess. We were seated shortly after. I thought with the waiting time and the volume of the restaurant that our meal would progress slowly but the service was surprisingly fast. As we were waiting for our drink and meal, I looked around and noticed that almost everyone in the restaurant were either teenagers or a family with children. I found this a little unsettling as I came to know this restaurant as an establishment that was known for their alcoholic drinks. I think the next time I want to see my friend, I'll choose a more age-appropriate restaurant. My friend and I split a watermelon goblet. They really are huge and could even be enough for three people. I laughed when our waiter was about to pour the drink and told us to get our phones out to post a video and photos to Instagram. He wasn't wrong; this is definitely an Instagram worthy restaurant. The drinks smoke with liquid nitrogen. Ours was filled with watermelon candy and taffy. I enjoyed the club sandwich that I ordered. It was a bit expensive for a club sandwich but it was packed full and came with good French fries. My friend enjoyed her berry crepe. I would still recommend this restaurant for the fun that it can bring for a young crowd. It is expensive but the drinks are fun to show off. I understand why I liked it when I was younger and I also understand why it wasn't the best fit a couple years later.",1,,1
78,Lisa O.,"Bethesda, MD",0,1,0,1.0,11/10/2018,We arrived on time for our reservation and left after 30 minutes without being seated.  We kept being told they would seat us shortly.  We told them we were leaving and then they had the audacity to report us as a no show to open table.  This was meant to be a special birthday dinner for my son and ended up being a total bust.,,,
79,Amanda R.,"Washingtonville, NY",62,3,18,4.0,9/5/2018,The place was really nice. This particular location is in the meat packing district. The food and drinks were really good. We came on a Tuesday during dinner time in the summer and were seat right away. It was busy but not packed.  I didn't give it 5 stars bc we came for my daughters birthday and was looking forward to buying their famous couture pops and they were sold out. I was told I could buy them online but the site doesn't have them at all. Then I wanted to buy one of the goblet cups and they were sold out if those as well. Seeing as it's a very popular place and those are the most popular items they should always be in stock. The goblet glass cup is online for sale but it says Las Vegas and we're from NY and that's the only one they have online.,1,,1
80,Isabelle L.,"Stratford, CT",1,35,8,3.0,9/20/2018,"It was nice to finally try this place. I enjoyed the experience. I ordered a non-alcoholic drink and it was good, nothing to rave about. It was nice to take pictures of my drink though. I also ordered a grill chicken that came with salad and fries. Chicken was okay. Fries are the cut the way I like them, but they just were cold. Service was efficient and server was nice. I would recommend this place if you just want to experience the novelty of the drinks. Food wise...maybe not.",,,
81,Tiffany Nicole B.,"Manhattan, NY",60,30,11,2.0,11/29/2017,"If I told you every single detail of this experience, I'd need to write a few long posts so I'll try and keep this short. Came here on a weekday evening because I had a strong taste for dessert. I asked for something that wasn't on the menu but was prepared for me when I went to the Miami location with no problem. This location (in the Meatpacking District) could not accommodate this request..So I'm like okay fine. How about an item on the menu (as I pointed to one of the cakes)..The server took the order and came back and said ""I'm sorry we are out of that item""I'm like ""wow.. okay, how about this..."" (as I pointed to another-less enticing item)... only for the server to come back again and say that he wasn't able to sell that because they were out of the ice cream. Whaaaaa?? Really??? Huh??? How??They even told my friend the same thing who ordered a milkshake so they had to use a different kind of ice cream to create my friends' shake.So I go on to select the red velvet dessert and guess what? Take a wild guess....You ready?? THEY WERE OUT OF THAT DESSERT TOO!At this point I'm just about over it. The server suggests that I speak with the manager for my troubles. So the manager comes over, very apologetic, and offers to make me his very special ice cream sandwich. Minutes later, that dessert comes back looking like a cookie soup! C'mon!I didn't even receive a spoon to eat with. Smh it was just a mess.The server gets credit for trying and the manager was very nice, but this was very disappointing. Why were they open on this night?! Made no sense.",6,9,1
82,Shianti B.,"Manhattan, NY",208,81,132,1.0,9/22/2018,"The manager on duty is playing trash music. And won't change it. 9/22 she shouldn't be working if she's playing depressing music and won't change it when a customer ask.Update: I'd like to elaborate on this a little bit. We made a reservation here for 8  our table wasn't ready till about 9 .  We had a cake; there was a cake-cutting fee of $7 for everybody at the table .  Our waiter DJ was amazing !  And I want to thank him for the experience because he really was a great waiter .  He was very attentive  checked on us every time he could, very much a team player, very much a great great server. The sampler that we ordered  wasn't really what I expected.  When I saw the portions of the other food I secretly thought the sampler would be bigger and have more options  but it was good nonetheless. The fried calamari was good it wasn't soggy or oily was crispy and very nice.  The spaghetti was also really good the sauce was very rich and fresh  the pasta was cooked just right and the meatballs are really good as well.  The Fried Chicken was also really good season nicely cooked well the mac and cheese was also good but it wasn't to my preference.  Their mac and cheese is very rich and not so much cheesy with hard cheese but cheesy with ricotta. I don't know if they use your that, just the texture and richness that I could compare it to. The food comes with good portions. They are great, is it worth the price point? I personally don't believe so but it's a snazzy restaurant so I guess that's where that price comes from. The drinks were amazing and well worth the price point for the portion so I completely understand that. The atmosphere was nice and my party was having fun the music was great and then all of a sudden it changed. When we asked our waiter if you could go downstairs and speak to management to put back the previous playlist he came back and told us that they had said no. Then one person for my party went downstairs and ask them at admit herself if they can change it and they told her that they would. They never did and then we were told by another person on the wait staff that they won't change it. They said they won't change it and they just told us that so that we would be appeased. That isn't cool and it sets off the whole Ambiance of the situation. It killed the mood right away. Our bill came out to close to $400 with tax included which isn't bad for a party of 7 people including if you count the coldren drinks that were bought a table.It's really unfortunate to because they were so many parties going on and the music was just bad. I'm considering that the music was great before the sudden change I didn't understand why they couldn't change the music back especially if a customer had asked ask. But you just saying you're not going to change it because that's what you want to play that's unacceptable. I really wish that our experience with a little bit better when it came to that situation but all in all our dining experience was really good but the music really killed the mood where we couldn't really enjoy the food that we were eating anymore or the celebration that we were having.Will I be going back? I'm actually not sure about this one just because eating is great and music is everything and when one is off and the other is good it still puts a damper on the entire mood and changes the dynamic of your dining experience. I am curious about their brunch which is from 10 to 4 p.m. it's bottomless which is great because there aren't too many bottomless brunches in New York. I'm not sure the price point for the brunch or the price point for the bottomless but if it's anything like the dining prices I'm not sure if it's worth it.",,,
83,Catherine S.,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, NY",19,104,25,3.0,1/4/2018,"The experience is pretty cool. Our waitress was sweet and genuine. The timing for food and drinks was nice also. The vanilla milkshake was good, not exceedingly so, but it was good. My brother enjoyed his goblet also. In my opinion though, the food was not good. I got a veggie burger and my bro got the chicken and waffles--we were not impressed with either. So I say go, but get desserts only.  The place packs a heavy price tag not to enjoy what you purchase to eat.",,,1
84,Rina S.,"Jersey City, NY",25,43,159,3.0,6/3/2018,"The drinks are expensive. The goblet cocktails are $38 and $32 for non alcoholic. I had the raspberry watermelon mojito with alcohol. It was very sweet and had watermelon candy in it. I didn't taste the raspberry at all and it certainly didn't taste like a traditional mojito, but it was very refreshing. It's huge and I shared it with a friend. I don't thinks it's worth $38, but I enjoyed it very much. I also had the chicken tenders that were a bit over cooked. This place can get extremely noisy whenever the waiters come out and sing happy birthday to customers. It got so loud I literally had to start covering my ears because it seemed like every 5 minutes they sang the bday song. All In all this is a very fun place but I would recommend making a reservation so you don't have a long wait especially on the weekends",1,,

We came with a party of eight. Six of us ordered burgers and three of us received bread with mold on it. I can bypass a lot of things but mold on bread is not acceptable.  When they made the burgers over, they were brick hard and burnt. The appetizer sampler was not fresh and all of the items were cold and/or hard.  One person ordered a steak and it was supposed to be made medium and it was made well-done. The drinks are mediocre. You are basically paying $36 for juice and cheap liquor. I also realized when at the bar they use Homestead Orange Juice in their drinks . That is by far one of the nastiest and  cheapest orange juices I've ever had in my life The only upside to this was the customer service. Our server was server was friendly and they covered our bill for the moldy food.***update*** One of the individuals in my party became sick with diarrhea and vomiting after our visit.",2,2,

Overpriced and not the best quality of food at all.Prior to my visit last night, I've been to the Sugar Factory once before at it's old location literally around the corner. I will say the new place and decor is a lot better and offers a lot more space but nothing else has really changed.This place along with multiple other places throughout NYC are tourist traps and where people go to "" do it for the likes"". No really, make sure to Instagram your magical drink(all sarcasm). As a local, I'm not really a big fan of this place and would only recommend it if you're a first timer and want to try what to me is the only thing to come here for -- the drinks.

If you don't have as large of a part to share the famous King Kong sundae, mention it to your server and they can make a half size for you, which was perfect for our table of 6. I was excited that they brought it in to our table making a bunch of noise! We had so much fun and the sundae was pretty good. I wasn't impressed that the gummy bears were pretty hard because those are usually my favorite! I want to come back in the future to try the food.",1,,

97,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,4/11/2017,"They get 2.5 stars but I will round it off to 3. I came here for a friend's birthday on a Sunday around 1:00pm.Ambiance: Place is super-packed. Decor includes candies and pictures of celebrities. They play top 40 and EDM music making you feel like you are at a party brunch. But you quickly realize this is no party brunch since there are kids everywhere. Yes I know it is a sugar factory, but I do think they should make the downstairs Adults only. The bathroom line downstairs can get extremely long and it was weird for a place that services so many kids to have a bathroom wallpaper with drawings of half-naked people on it. Another reason for why the downstairs should be adults only.Service: We were not allowed to sit until our whole party was there. After standing by the entrance for 15 minutes, they finally took us downstairs to sit by the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. I really think they should invest in designing a waiting area with comfy seats and couches. Our waitress was really nice and friendly.Food and drinks: I had the watermelon martini and for $16 it did not have enough alcohol but it was tasty (it is 90% sugar). Some of the other girls shared a goblet, I tasted the watermelon (it was too sweet) and the long island (was pretty strong but at least you get your money's worth). This drink is huge and should be shared. It was concerning watching children drink a whole goblet by themselves (sugar overload). They should post drinks prices on their menu. So remember, drinks are $16-38!For food I had the turkey burger; it was kind of dry but I did like the mushroom. The fries were delish. Like others mentioned, for the price, the quality of the food is low. The birthday girl ordered the 22 scoop ice cream Sunday which pretty much includes all you think can of (ice cream, rice crispy, gummy bears, pretzels, Oreos). It was pretty yummy but a little too much. They should come up with a system where people can take some of this to go because no one can really finish this. I had a headache after I left, our body is not meant for all this sugar.I had a good time but mainly due to the company.

Updated review","My rating is 2.5 stars.  The reason to come here is the atmosphere.    They have music playing and its really lively. As another diner said, its like being part of a child's birthday party.Tweens and teenagers will like it, they will love it if they have a birthday to celebrate.  They will add a sparkler to any desert you order and the staff will sing happy birthday nice and loud.The goblets are instagram worthy.  The service is also very good.  That is all the pros I have for this place.For appetizer, we tried the Mac & Cheese pops.  It was greasy, lacked seasoning and the pasta was way too over cooked and it was served with what tasted like vodka sauce.  When it got to the table, it was just warm, not hot.For the main course my niece got the Manhattan eggs benedict.  Smoked salmon instead of bacon served with asparagus and potatoes.  First thing we noticed when it got to the table, the toast was not on the bottom but put on top of the potatoes.  We joked maybe they forgot it and just put it on top.  My niece had a hard time getting the smoke salmon and egg on top of the toast.  I tasted the hollandaise sauce and it again lacked seasoning.  The scallop potatoes lacked color and also seasoning also.  Looked like the entire dish was rushed and nothing was cooked right.The only thing decent was the Greek salad with grilled shrimp I ordered.  I was pleasantly surprised the salad was not over dressed.  It was fresh and crunchy and the shrimp was grilled just right.If you are looking for a place to impress your teen so they have something to post on social media, this is your place.",2,,
102,Eva B.,"Queens, NY",129,120,126,3.0,12/1/2017,"Definitely not worth the hype.Came in for a birthday celebration, had reservations and still had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated.  They seated my party of 4 at what I would think is a backyard garden table that's generally used for 2 people or decoration.. When I asked if we could maybe move to a bigger table (which we passed on the way in), they said we could get up from our table and wait for something to be available.  It's a very small reception area and they have one gender neutral bathroom for the whole restaurant.They have a yelp check in offer for a free order of mac and cheese pops, but it's only valid during the work week from like 10 am - 2 pm when literally no one is dining there.  We got the rainbow sliders which were actually very good.  Food was alright, nothing special.  Service was eh during the day but got much better after there was a shift change.Sugar Factory gets three stars for their drink selection of the smoking goblets - probably the only thing that made the whole experience ""worth it.""",,,

We did ask to be moved and they accommodated us quickly After that I can't say much more positive, the food was gross, I had a Mediterranean salad that was $18 and served with some cheap Kraft bottled Italian dressing, it was horrible.

Updated review","I decided to come back here to give it another try. I was here on a Friday around 8pm.Yes this place attracts birthday goers and yes you'll hear the servers sing happy birthday to almost every single table, but get passed all that and you can enjoy their delicious food. Appetizers: Baked brie wrapped in puff pastry is excellent. Do get this dish! It's a deconstructed apricot jam, apple slices, brie puff, & toast. Put it altogether in one bite and it's a well balanced dish. The popcorn shrimp surprisingly was not popcorn sized. The shrimp was large, but the flavor was pretty basic. Entree:The south beach flair burger was tasty. If you love plantains then you'll love this burger (thanks to our server, Jeremiah for the recommendation). Never had such a combination before, but with the angus beef, carmelized onions, chipotle mayo and chimichurri sauce made quite the perfect burger. They have other unique burger toppings such as the pizza burger and the white chocolate burger, which sounded interesting. The 6oz filet was good, but the huge serving of yukon gold mashed potatoes was so creamy & buttery I couldn't stop eating it. By this time I was super stuffed and couldn't enjoy their infamous desserts. The staff is always attentive even with such a hectic and busy environment. Kudos to them.",1,,1

112,Rosita T.,"Markham, Canada",232,56,25,3.0,10/20/2017,"I was super excited to come here on my trip to pretty much eat my way in NYC. My friend visited Sugar Factory is Las Vegas and I was so envious of her photos. Needless to say, I knew I had to get a goblet. Obviously my friend and I didn't know there were 10 shots in a goblet so we both ordered one.We came around 2-3 PM and only had to wait 5-10 minutes without reservations. The server was friendly and attentive. I ordered the watermelon one and my friend got the lollipop passion. I finished 3/4 of mine and then swapped with my friend because she wasn't much of a drinker. The lollipop one was so gross. I hate coconut Malibu and it tasted exactly like that. I asked the server if he could do anything to make it taste less gross and he added pineapple juice. It helped a bit but was still gross.We also ordered a sundae. It was whatever. Should have ordered something savoury though. At that point we were definitely feeling the alcohol and realized why most only finished half of their goblets and left. Then, we ordered a side of fries. They were good to munch on but nothing special. We felt kinda sick from all the sugar and alcohol so decided to leave.One of the bussers was annoying af and kept trying to make moves. Not about that. He kept asking where we were going after, where my phone was so he could give me his number, and trying to invite himself into our plans. No, no, no. You can clear the table for us and make polite conversation, but please, move it along, especially when someone is clearly not interested. I'm still rolling my eyes... definitely made for an uncomfortable, annoying experience. I think he finally got it when my friendly loudly said that he needed to stop trying to talk to us.Pro-tip: sharing is caring. Definitely get one to share between 2 people and it won't make you sleep the rest of the night away haha",1,,
113,Amit J.,"Jersey City, NJ",1601,197,543,2.0,3/14/2017,"Decided to come to the Sugar Factory after hearing about their Goblet drinks. I'd strongly recommend making a reservation -- we came here 15 minutes early for our reservation and still spent 45 minutes waiting for a table. Make a reservation (or sit at the bar) and go only to try their special drinks and milkshakes, food isn't that great. Entire experience was unfortunately underwhelming. - Drinks: It seems that the Sugar Factory is known for their Goblet Drinks. Which is essentially served in a fish bowl like 60-ounce glass with dry ice and decorated with candy alongside or inside the glass. When the server pours the drinks in the glass and it reacts to the dry ice, it forms a cool vapor effect rising out of the glass. They don't list the price anywhere on the menu, but an a Goblet with alcohol is $36. I was torn between the signature Lollipop Passion Goblet or the Watermelon Raspberry Mojito (Fruit Juices, Silver Rum and topped with Watermelon Candy and Fresh Mint Leaves) ($36) and dedicated to go with mojito at the suggestion of the way. It was a cool experience getting the drink and watching the reactions to the dry ice. Aside from that, the drink was mediocre at best -- it tasted ok and it seemed that a quarter of it was just the dried ice. I'd recommend to order the Goblets for the experience and not the drink itself. - Food: We mainly went for drinks and treats, so opted for a couple appetizers instead of a full meal. We ordered the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Pops (Homemade Macaroni and Cheese, Battered and Deep Fried and served with a Creamy Tomato Herb Sauce) ($12), Bruschetta ($9) and a Basket of Fries ($6). The Mac and Cheese Pops were good, especially with the delicious Tomato Herb Sauce they came with, but honestly nothing exceptional. We also ordered the Chocolate Cookie Jar Milkshake (Vanilla Soft Serve Icr Cream blended with Oreo Cookie Crumbles, Chocolate Chips, Caramel Sauce, Pure Melted Chocolate Sauce and Topped with Oreo Cookies and Whipped Cream) ($10). This was absolutely delicious, it was smooth, creamy and a good balance between vanilla and chocolate. - Service:  I had mixed reactions about the service. We ended up coming 15 minutes earlier than our reservation, but ended up having to wait a total of 45 minutes for a table for two even with a reservation which I found to be unfortunate. What troubled me more so was that a couple who came about twenty minutes late for their reservation was able to be seated at the first table that opened over us and another couple who were either on time or early for our reservations. In regards to our waiter, she was absolutey nice, friendly and generally provided good service. She also was great in allowing us to enjoy the experience of the Goblet, and waited to pour the drinks until we were ready. - Overall: I would go here once for the experience or have a friend visiting from out of state but this truly is a tourist trap with underwhelming experience (food and service seem subpar) and overpriced food and drink items. You'd probably be better off sitting at the bar and ordered just drinks and sweets there (advise against food here). I don't think I'll be going back to Sugar Factory.",11,6,8
114,Rachel H.,"Roswell, GA",1,17,32,4.0,6/9/2018,"If you haven't been before, you should check this place out! Unique and fun drinks and a very extensive menu.

115,Gaby K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1,1.0,10/11/2017,"I went to Sugar Factory for my birthday with my closest friends, and the experience was so horrible that I had to apologize for inviting them. My reservation was for Monday night (October 9) for 5:00pm, booked on OpenTable a week or two before the date. When we were asked to wait to be seated, I had no issue as I thought they were simply looking for our table. Imagine my surprise when we had to wait just under an hour to be seated the same time as people who came in without a reservation. Was there a point in changing my birthday plans to make a 5PM reservation work since it was the only available one?I sat down and tried to put the wait behind me, but the same woman who took so long to seat us disappeared after doing so. At busy restaurants you want to order quickly because food may take a while to come - except we didn't have any menus. After 10 minutes of trying to call waiters (who were busy with other tables) we got our menus. There were 9 of us, yet we only got 7 menus, and even though I asked for 2 more we were never given them. Our server DJ had an uplifting personality, so I tried to ignore the events. That turned out to be a disappointment, just like the first time.Once we our goblets came (we ordered 3 and 3 people shared each goblet) they were spilling out contents because they seem to have been overfilled. Within minutes our table was a mess, but thanks to our waiter we had 3 paper napkins to clean it up. Obviously this didn't work, and we had to finish our drinks on a sticky table. I would also like to note that we were not given any silverware, so we had no cloth to wipe the liquid.We ordered our food the same time as our goblets and asked that they all be given at the same time since some were appetizers and others were entrees. Yet, the dishes came separated, with the appetizers coming last. Half of our table was eating while the other half sat awkwardly without anything.My order of chicken strips/fingers (don't remember the exact wording but it was an appetizer for $13) came and it was good - earning Sugar Factory it's one star in this review. I tried to eat it while having a conversation with my guests, but loud EDM music being played repeatedly at full volume distracted us. Every few minutes there would be a beat drop and music that gave us a headache. At one point I could even hear a commercial playing, which was odd to me.When our night finally came to an end, I was embarrassed that I brought my friends to such a place. I apologized to them and even paid the entire $45 ""auto 18% tip"" because I felt that they hadn't been treated well enough to have to pay that. We were also told that this tip did not entirely go to our waiter, who was one of the only highlights of our trip, so on top of that we gave him a tip.All in all, I was excited for my first time at the Sugar Factory and chose it as a special placed to celebrate my birthday. However, I was met with rude staff, ear-piercing music, and a messy atmosphere. I wish I could say your restaurant lived up to the hype, but these factors simply ruined it for me. The picture I have attached shows the drink over bubbling right before it spilled as well as a table with no silverware at all.",1,1,

117,Samantha S.,"Bergen County, NJ",58,44,30,5.0,8/20/2018,"I did a lot of research before coming here with my daughter and her two friends for her 15th bday. Since we were coming in from NJ I really wanted to have a good time. The reviews I read were horrible and I kept telling the girls we are going for the experience- well what an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE IT WAS!!!  We had a reservation at the Meat Packing District store and got there early because of the rain - they were packed downstairs and also when you first walk up the stairs to the 2nd floor they had a table for us all the way in the back- the VIP area apparently which was fine with me it was not as noisy and the girls can hear each other talking. Our server Damion L- (up stairs) he is out of this world if you go to this location request him tell him I sent you you will leave lighter in your wallet but with a great experience. Damion didn't make us wait to order bought us water just as fast and any questions I had he answered. The girls ordered the big blue smoking goblet- with blue gummy whales they loved it so much that they finished one and we got another on the house. I had a watermelon martini delicious and 1/2 the price () I was happy I wasn't driving home because the drink was pretty strong !! Next we ordered appetizers my daughter wanted the burgers with all the different colored buns but they were waiting on the buns so she got the mini cheeseburgers- she loved them, Her friends got the chicken fingers and basket of fries - which were excellent and also the spinach artichoke dip with garlic bread that was amazing. I got wings and they were a little spicy but still the food was very good- the girls ate as much as they could and we took what was left over bc I told them they need to leave room for the Special shakes they are known for. They ordered the Twinkie Dinkie, Tie Dye & Nutella Banana. I didn't partake in any of the drinks but they looked and I was told tasted delicious-  all in all this is a legit review I came In cringing left with a smile on my face. The girls had a great time even got to dance when no one but us were upstairs hey they are 15 that's what they are supposed to do. The check came to about $200 and I left a $50 tip because Damien made it worth while - when your that attentive and you have a bunch of screaming kids you deserve a good tip. Hats off to the manager Jay C keep doing what your doing and you will keep getting great yelp reviews. Thanks for a great time- I think we will be back but not order as much stuff and ask for Damion to be our server.",,,

Did not come to ask everything was ok, if wanted to order drinks??? We asked for dessert menu waited another 25 minutes did not come to take the order. So we asked for our check waited another 15 minutes before asked the manger to please help us out. At the end with the check she comes and says sorry and brings 2 lollipops- seriously 18 year olds are going to eat lollipops- how about would you like to order dessert?

Updated review","I have been to Sugar Factory in the past to celebrate my birthday and previously provided a review. However, I feel the need to share what was experienced yesterday at this establishment. Myself and my guest went there to have some food and drinks. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sugar Factory has moved from their original building to another one a couple of blocks away. When we walked into Sugar Factory it was full of great energy as usual. The decor still has that cool vibe which includes colorful displays and spectacular chandeliers! The candy area is still near the front door and it includes such an awesome selection of delightful sweet treats! Across the street has a lovely view and it is beautifully lit up at night!Because the reservation was made earlier in the day, we waited about 5 minutes before we were seated which was wonderful. Sugar Factory had always been extremely accommodating which is to be commended since this place is very busy with many customers....Che was our server last night. He was kind, patient and constantly ensured that we were ok. He brought us all of our dishes. One of them was the Macaroni + Cheese Pops that you receive when you check in on Yelp which is nice. Boy, did I start feeling like a ate a full meal after comsuming the Macaroni + Cheese Pops!-lol. Everything was enjoyable from the Watermelon Burst Cocktail to the Steak w/ Fries. My guest raved about their sandwich and fries and the Make A Wish Milkshake. Staff came alive as they carried desserts to various tables and sang Hapoy Birthday to patrons with infectious positive energy! It is important to highlight the Managers Corinthian and Samantha as well as mention the server Che once again. We received the bill towards the end of our visit and Corinthian made it his mission to take care of us and fix our bill. Samantha was so lovely and pleasant. Each one of these staff persons, including Che are hardworking professionals. I appreciate them for being warm, friendly and welcoming.Last but not least.....Maro you are the best!",8,2,5

There were plenty of tables around us singing along to loud music and having a good time. And... it is a cool ""location"" for an Instagram photo... if you're into that kind of thing.

Updated review","I came back here after being contacted about my original review. I wasnt really looking forward to it, this place is loud and crazy and the food was eh. Well, after this weekend's experience I have definitely been converted. We came here on Saturday night and it was packed. We were seated about 10 minutes after arriving (which was totally our fault for being late). We were seated with Eddie being our waiter. Eddie came over to take our order promptly and was very friendly and jokey. We decided on two appetizers, the spinach artichoke dip and the baked brie, my friend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and I went with the farmer burger but with turkey.The two appetizers were delicious. The dip came with some cheese bread that we loved. The brie was ok, nothing special but since it's cheese, I would definitely get it again. The buffalo chicken sandwich my friend said was extremely spicy but she enjoyed it. My burger was great. I was a little adventurous, the burger had a fried egg in it, which is something new for me, so I was a little nervous, but wow. It was good. There was something in the burger that just made it all fit well together. I sat facing the mirror and every time Eddie walked past I could see his eyes roaming all his tables checking to see if anyone needed anything. The special shakes looked amazing, but they were so big we opted for no dessert.All that said, I would definitely come back here.",1,1,1

Updated review","My second experience at Sugar Factory was a bit better than the first, but not by much. The owner was actually kind enough to give me a special discount to try it again. Sadly the second time around disappointed me even more but for different reasons. The food was pretty good. The service too was spectacular. Thats where the good ended. They were filming an episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, and my girlfriend and I were seated right next to them as they were filming. The camera pointed near me and I know I was in a few shots. They did not ask if I was comfortable with this, nor did they ask if I preferred to be seated elsewhere. I also did not consent to being on camera. Very unprofessional and ruined the whole experience for me sadly. Next time they ought be more aware!",,,

I didn't expect it to be great but I thought it would be like run of the mill Times Square chain restaurant slop. Only have 1 star for the friendly service and the ""theatrical"" drink.  First of all, I came here and spent over $100 for a meal for 2 and we ordered 1 appetizer (Mac and Cheese Pops, actually good but 3 for $14), 2 entrees which we left uneaten ($18 for a sloppy chicken sandwich and TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS for a ""chicken palliard"" which was the driest, most unseasoned piece of chicken I've ever had the displeasure of paying for. My high school cafeteria served better chicken than this. And of course, we had to get one of their famous smoking drinks, $32 for a sugary watermelon drink that fizzed so hard it hurt our noses and was actually half ice (what a scam!).  The drink wasn't bad but anything with that much sugar and candy can taste good although we had a headache after drinking it.I honestly never paid so much for such disgusting food.

As a customer I felt uncomfortable after a while and here's why: The waitress would look at at us eating every now and then, a little more than she should have. Additionally, I unfortunately couldn't finish my food because I was extremely full and the serving size was 2x bigger than I expected. This was my fault in a sense as I did not ask about the portion size.  After I asked another waiter to take it away, he asked me if I wanted tk wrap it up and as much as I wanted to, i knew holding it all day in the city would make it stale so I politely said no. He was  surprised and kept pushing me to take it. I was starting to feel guilty and to top it off the staff was looking at me (I saw out of the corner of my eye). I felt embarrassed at that point. Eventually, he gave in and took my plate away. But then another server gave me a big brown bag with the food in it. I felt even more embarrassed. The experience was meh for me",,,

The rainbow sliders weren't a disappointment your supposed to get a duck with them but they ran out in Valentine's Day so they gave us little take out containers to get free candy .

The drinks are pretty, but the food is trash. The fries taste like freezer burn. I was here on a Friday evening at 7pm. The servers are inattentive and loiter and FaceTime outside the restroom by the bar. They socialize all night and dance to the music, while patrons are left for fend for themselves and beg the closest employee for silverware.",3,,

Made a reservation prior to attending. Took an Uber over to the restaurant so I didn't have to worry about parking. Was seated promptly. The server was super nice and made food and drink suggestions from the menu for us to try. I had a Mai Tai, fettuccine alfredo, and the mini burger sliders. They're all different colors and so pretty. The food was amazing in my opinion. I can't wait to go back! The manager even let me take a picture with him. Two thumbs up to the management team and staff. Oh! And can't forget the birthday song. The most lit birthday song I've ever heard. ‍",,,

142,Liliana J.,"Woodside, NY",16,54,57,4.0,2/20/2018,"Sugar factory!!  a little scary for me, since i am not a big fan of sugar, except for certain times and things, anyhow,  it was a birthday party so it was not my choice, i debated a lot to give this place between a three or four stars. Lets start by describing the place, very nice, nice decoration, nice ambiance, it was loud but fun, what do you expect ? kids come here,  its the sugar factory!! When we walked in,  we had reservations (months) ahead of time,  it was disorganized, so many people were waiting, it was crowded, kids were grabbing candie with theirs bare hands out the containers around the entrance, when you are supposed to grab them with gloves. I noticed some staff members were trying  theirs best to accomodate everyone but some other ones were just plain rude towards people, Good thing, that was not our experience but some other family. Once we were about to be seated, it was chaotic,  one of the assistant manager  (Angel) wanted to give us a made up table of four and forced it for a party of six, when we questioned this , he said that was the table we were assigned and that the other tables are for reservations, at this point we explained to him,  WE DO have reservations!! After the whole incident, he placed us in a more appropriate corner booth table by the bar, the whole incident with the table was very frustrating, and the reason why i removed the star(s), we ordered food, appetizers and gigantic drinks, we could make the drinks virgin as well. THE FOOD was amazing no complains At ALL!!, We had onion rings,  buffalo wings with sauce and no sauce, spinach artichoke dip, all as appetizers, everything was to die for !!! I mean it, we ordered 2 burgers entrees , 2 steak platters , two pastas dishes, AMAZING!!! Drinks they all have different names, i dont remeber the exact names but their flavor, we ordered the 60 oz, i had their signature, lollipop something, very good, watermelon was awesome, the mango and peach was really good too, the least favorite was the mai thai, No one in my table liked it so i do not recomend it. Our waiter was very good , unfortunately i dont recall his name, he made the whole experience remarkable and unique, thank you so much!! he was attentive and funny, lastly  the bill for six people and gratuity included came out over six hundred dollars and we added extra fifty dollars because the waiter was cool, very nice memory for a  twenty two year old birthday,",1,1,1

145,Christine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,85,75,3.0,8/10/2017,"Ok .... not ok. First off we had a 5:30 reservation for 10 people. We were not seated until 6:10 because the upstairs staff hadn't arrived and was not scheduled to arrive until 6:00. I was almost going to go into Seinfeld's monologue on taking a reservation but not holding it.... decided not to.  Once upstairs it took 10 minutes to get water. The sun was setting and shining through the windows, lovely you say? Nope guess again ...think blazing sun and heat shining in your eyes. They ran out of Heineken and peach flavoring so several drinks were not available. The alcoholic root beer float was delicious! The goblet drink lollipop passion was a coconut rum mixture of sweet sweet sweet but I could see how a 13 year old would get a kick out of the dry ice effect, lol they serve it non-alcoholism too! The food was ok nothing better than your average diner...the fries were delicious. The desserts were good the classic sundae for two was just that. The strawberry cheesecake overload was flipping amazing. However the peanut butter chocolate ice cream  chocolate chip cookie not so good as no one could break the cookie...although we all tried stabbing at it repeatedly with a spoon. Now sadly the wait staff wasn't on point. Two of our drinks sat on the bar for 15 minutes before I got up and brought them to the table. So this is the new trendy place for wicked over the top desserts. I think anyone from 5-15 might get s kick out of it, other than that if I had an urge for ice cream I'd go to Baskin Robbins and have a sundae.",1,1,1

The food is just ok. It's about $5 more than your standard NYC bar for the same exact food ($18 burgers). The candy cocktails are SWEET- as they should be, since it's a candy place, just don't expect them to alter anything to your liking. Finally, it's very kid friendly- which is great for people with kids. Our group of 20 somethings came for a birthday dinner and fun candy inspired cocktails and were sadly disappointed.

We had a reservation for 6:30pm., we were not seated until around 7pm. While we were taken to our table we noticed the lady seating next to our table, accompanied by her family,  mumbling unpleasant things. She was saying "" I can't seat next to these Puerto Rican looking people, I don't like them, among other things"", she got up and asked one of the people in her table to change seats with her. My co-workers and myself were confused as to whether she was referring to us, we paid no attention and decided to take our seats, until we noticed we were given a table for four instead of five. I decided to go to the person in the front desk to ask her for a table that will fit all of us. While I was talking to the person in the front desk the lady who was upset wearing next to us went crazy. All you were able to hear was her screaming and cursing. Her reaction was insane. She came downstairs towards the exit door and was yelling ""every f$&@ing time I go to a place I have to deal with these f$&@ing people"". She left the restaurant but her family stated. The person helping me get a larger table came with me upstairs to try to accommodate my co-workers and myself. She was going to try to fit us in the same table as before, my co-worker explained to the waiter that the lady started acting up when she saw us seating next to her, and requested a different seating section. The guy understood and took us to their ""private seating area"". (Not private at all)!!Anyway, we order our drinks and food. I can't complain on the appetizers nor the drinks but the food OMG!! I order the Pacific Salmon. This plate tasted like a lemonade!! It was probably the worst Salmon I've ever had. One of my co-workers ordered a burger with fries which was eatable. Others ordered Pasta which they said it was ok. If you want to try this place for the fun of it stick with the drinks and appetizers and if you want to eat something go with the burgers.When we were on our way out of the restaurant we noticed that the manager had allowed the ""Crazy lady"" back in the restaurant. We were disappointed when we saw her back in. After all the racial comments this lady said against Puerto Rican's and Hispanics in general, the restaurant should've prohibited her back in.

If you have diabetes or food restrictions, or lack a sweet tooth then make sure to eat beforehand. Sugar reigns supreme here and the quality of it is high. The energy is superb and fun, and the service is jovial but effective. Our waiter was a total professional and earned every dollar over 20%. He accommodated our constantly growing group without a hitch and was always genuinely pleasant.The food was surprisingly better than expected and varied. I had the branzino while others ordered burgers with fries and the chicken alfredo.  However the safest bet is to stick with the insanely, huge, sugary sweet desserts that easily weigh a pound each and are strictly for sharing. (They can provide to-go containers if you are unable to finish the slice of cheesecake/lollipops/etc that comes with your milkshake or other such situations.)Do it to say you did or to see if you survive the sugar high.

Updated review","Amazing place and experience!! First, my bff and I were greeted by  a very nice hostess whom gave us these adorable favors (ducklings). We were seated  in a nice,CLEAN and comfy area then we were treated wonderfully by an amazing,warm, and attentive waitress. She was just wonderful and not only with us but she was amazingly nice and warming with the staff and with the other guests. The food was great! The chef came out and greeted us-- which that was super amazing! Once the fish bowls came to us (my friend and I) they were very,ver, very clean and nicely served.  The location was very nice and clean.  I can only say thank you,thank you,thank you to all the AMAZING staff for making this such and amazing experience. All in all the staff were very warming to just every single guest that walked in through your locations door. I was able to observe how the staff tried their very best in making every individual feel comfortable. HEY ALL!! Take my word for it!! The miles driven from CT into NYC was allllll worth it. Thank YOU (Maro) and to your staff!!",,,
157,Nelly D.,"Haledon, NJ",216,52,21,3.0,3/19/2018,"Pros: very cool/dramatic presentation of drinks (they look like potions), liquid nitrogen and all.  Over-the-top, ridiculous milkshakes and ice cream desserts.  The milkshakes are more than enough for two people - we finished less than half of one.  Our martinis had the appropriate amount of booze in them.  Our waiter was very pleasant/personable.Cons: extremely loud music, felt like a nightclub - our throats were shut by the end of dinner - impossible to have a conversation due to this.  Mediocre food (would expect better for the price, ordered my meat medium well and received well done).  Very tight space as expected in NYC, maybe a foot of space between the tables.  We were on top of another table and felt like we were invading their date, although the couple turned out to be friendly and chatted with us for a while.  I saw the chandeliers in one of the reviews before going there and expected an elegant feel to the place, but the rest of the décor (blackboards, train tiles) clashes with the chandeliers and does not scream elegant at all. Our martinis were tasty but definitely contained more sugar than alcohol, and the ""potion"" drinks are diabetes in a glass, but I guess that goes along with the theme.    The complementary birthday dessert consisted of several Rice Krispy treat cubes in a little bowl, covered with a gigantic pile of whipped cream with sprinkles.  The birthday sparkler was a $5 extra charge, which would be totally worth it but it went out in 5 seconds... not enough time to even get a picture.  Overall the experience was okay.  Would have given 4 stars but for the loud music.  There is really no reason to go to this place more than once.",,,

The thing that attracted me here were the outrageous looking milkshakes. Since we went after dinner I opted for a s'mores hot chocolate. It was really really good. I had about half and then felt a sugar rush lol. The staff brought out a chocolate cake slice with sparklers and all sang happy birthday to me, which was really cute. Nice place if you don't mind ridiculous amounts of sugar and loud music. I'll be back.",,,

Updated review","Yesterday, I went down to Sugar Factory (for the second time) for dinner with my bf :). We arrived about 15 minutes early to our 8 o clock appointment, and were seated right away. This place was PACKED; I mean, what do you expect? It's Sugar Factory... everyone wants to experience it!Anyways... When we were seated, we were greeted with smiles. It was a very welcoming ambience. The place was pumped; so many people in big groups celebrating their birthdays! You know what was one of the things that stood out to me? The fact that my boyfriend and I were only a party of two, and at no point did we feel overshadowed by bigger parties. We received the same attention and amazing service! So now, allow me to tell you all about the food... *Heart Eyes* ... My boyfriend started with the Mai Tai gobbler, which was strong and he loved it. For our meals, my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and I had the bacon cheeseburger sliders. Delicious! Everything cooked just how we asked (well done) and we did not have to wait long for it!  We will definitely be coming back!",1,,2

162,Zelda D.,"Medford, NJ",56,37,2,2.0,1/15/2018,"My daughter heard about this place a while ago and has been begging to go. From the reviews, I figured the food wouldn't be amazing, but the drinks and desserts would be outstanding and also super cute. The food wasn't terrible, and had the desserts been anywhere near what we were expecting, I may have looked the other way. That's not to say that mediocre food at this price is excusable. Really, if you're charging $19 for a burger and $25+ for fettuccine alfredo with a few pieces of chicken, there's really no reason that everything shouldn't be outstanding. My big issue was dessert. We ordered what was supposed to be an adorable shake. The photo showed a cone covered in chocolate and popcorn, and just a great looking arrangement in general. What we got was a pathetic version of it, chocolate dripping down the side (no spoon to eat it with though), a few pieces of popcorn stuck to it, and a plain cone with some sprinkles on top. Thankfully it had the lollipop, otherwise my daughter would've been even more disappointed. Sadly, the taste wasn't much better than the presentation, I've had much better shakes elsewhere, and it felt like a good bit of it was simply whip topping. There's really no reason for us to eat there again. Not the desserts, not the food, not the service (poor, dirty straws, etc.)  and even the decor was only so so.",2,,

We were intrigued with the bubbles and dry ice smoke coming from other people's bowls sitting in the outdoor patio area so thought we'd give it a try. We just had 2 of us so seating was easy at the bar. First impression was this place is really sweet smelling and everything was sticky, especially the menu. Every page was sticky and I had to grab the page on the corners. We ordered this orange passionfruit bowl since it seemed the less sweetest (which is saying a lot considering it's a candy store and sweet drink kind of place). Didn't see any prices but we thought how expensive can it be? Well the bowl was $39 bucks! Holy cow!! I mean I know NY is more expensive for drinks but wow. It was a experience though and our waiter was really sweet (took a bunch of pictures for us after he saw us struggling to get a selfie with the smoking drink too and also gave us nice pour of vokda at the end too and we definitely tipped him well). Would have given more start but given the price and how sticky everything was, that kind of did it. Oh and as we left we saw the wall of fame celebrity pictures.

We didn't have a reservation, but decided to stop by around 5:15 and only had about a twenty minute wait. We ordered one of those overpriced goblet drinks ($36) which was of course, very sweet. However, I have to admit, the dry ice was a very nice touch. We decided to share the fried chicken and Mac and cheese which was delicious! The other dishes on the menu also looked good.

Updated review","Updated review:This is what you call a good customer service.  After my first disaster visit I posted my honest review of the place and then was contacted by one of the managers to see what they can do to rectify the situation.  Over the course of a few month I finally made it back to the joint and give it another try.  This time we went to celebrate my niece's 18th birthday.  From the very beginning I asked the front desk if we can be seated either in the first or second floor floor and not the basement and they were very accommodating.  The waiting area where all the candies are are much more lit up and also the inventory is much more appealing than the last time. Once we were seated upstairs which another big party (about 25 ppl) came up after us.  I was afraid the last scenario would happen again where our orders will be delayed and we will wait forever.  It didn't happen.  We ordered few goblet drinks which is the main reason why anyone is there.  Few appetizers and few main courses.  My server Genesis was wonderful and like the last time I was there as well, never had any problem with their staff, they are ultra accommodating knowing this is a tourist spot. The drinks came 10 mins after we ordered it and the food about the same.  My son even commented that we didn't wait as long as the last time.  I had to convince him to come back with me as well since he didn't like the last visit as well.  My niece loved everything but tbh it is a loud place which is understandable.  It is a party place not a quiet romantic dinner place.  Birthday songs and screams goes off every few mins.  The food was good, we ordered the Mac and Cheese pop, chicken fingers ( which was surprisingly awesome),  Charcuterie plate, calamari, savory crepe, Chicken and waffle, and Salmon salad.  Everything was satisfactory considered it is not the main attraction.  The drinks itself did not disappoint as the whole show is around it.  My mom, the kids loved every min of it and good time was had by all.  Bravo to the customer service department to reach out and ratify the situation which save this client from being an one time client.  Thank you and we had a much better time this time around. *****************************************************It is a one time visit thing.  A place you can say been there done that. We surprised our niece for her 15th birthday, low key family celebration. Made a reservation and I know from other reviews that there's a wait even with the reservation so no big deal, out party didn't fully assembled until 45 mins pass the reservation time so we couldn't check in until everyone was there so not their fault.  While waiting I was ready to drop down some money at the candy store.  What a disappointment.  If you have been to Dylan's Candy Bar then you will be highly disappointed.  Who set up shop? I mean my local bodegas has better display than that place.  I wanted to buy and spent money since I was waiting but I didn't drop a dime.  And the teenagers? They tried hard, and they came away with a small bag of Swedish fish in different  the colors. Ha! The wait for the table was not bad and we were seated in the basement. Our sever was great but we had to remind her of silver wares and they ran out of the spoons ( by desert time) and a gluten free menu for one member of our party. I swipe that off being that it is busy.  While there they were about 15 happy birthday songs sang within the 4 hours ( yes 4) we were there.  So this is the place for that kind of celebration. The good came, the appetizers are no better than your local bar, some ppl in my party orders the burgers and they liked it.  I got a French onion soup and a Chinese chicken salad sent both of them back and didn't get a replacement. The soup was iffy, I had many ( in Paris too) but something was off and I didn't want to take a chance getting sick, the Chinese chicken salad was too salty! Now those who knows me laugh when I said this but after a tasting from everyone they all agreed.  So I ended up eating my little ones sliders.  Talk about a puck in a bun, that is exactly what it was.  I had to lather with ketup and wash it down.  Finally desert time, oh we did order the famous goblet for the kids ( non alcoholic is $30) and they loved it and that's the reason why we were there so they can post pictures of them with the goblet on IG.  Anyway we waited over another hour for the dessert! The kids were getting restless and finally I got the manager's attention and they eventually came. So what's positive? The manager did the right thing by taking the dessert off  the bill and the kids got their IG photo from this place so they can brag and the server was cool.

The only good thing I have to say about this place is that the waiters are friendly and know how to tell a good joke.We ordered 2 goblets for the table, and for the price of them, you would think that there would be some alcohol in them! However none could be tasted. The goblets also have so much ice. Don't waste $40 on a drink that has more ice than anything else. One goblet was the Blood Orange one and the oranges inside(only 2 slices for an entire 60 oz glass) were regular oranges. Don't waste your money on these goblets unless you want a photo and to be ripped off.We proceeded to order appetizers for the table: sampler appetizer, fried calamari, and fried shrimp, all of which were bland. The fried calamari were soggy, the Mac & cheese balls in the appetizer were not even cheesy or hot(only warm inside). The fried shrimp were fine, nothing special.We also ordered the classic ice cream cookie sandwich to share and the Mudslide. The Mudslide looked good, but was so sweet. The coffee ice cream that comes with it was half melted.Now for the classic sandwich, the cookie was so hard that a fork and spoon wouldn't even break a piece off of the cookie. When we tried to do so, the cookie was as hard as a rock and moved with the plate.Don't waste your time coming here. Truly a disappointment.",,,
171,Angel M.,"Quincy, MA",262,207,312,3.0,1/4/2017,"Sugar Factory is great for those just turning 21, or those looking to have some fun and cool drinks. I have eaten here on two separate occasions recently, and on both occasions, the overpriced drinks were way better than the food. This restaurant is almost always packed, so reservations are a must. When you first walk in, there is a wall filled with candy and candy dispensers. What is really cool about this is there are some 'Sugar Factory' unique candies that usually come with the drinks, but area available for purchase there. The restaurant looks really nice, the chandeliers are a very nice touch in both the day and the night time, and at night it has more of a date night feel. Dim lights, chandeliers, candles, and noise. If you are going for brunch, you will still need a reservation, but we were a few minutes late and they had no problem accommodating us. Coming on the weekends in the evening may not be the same case. When I went for brunch, my girls and I shared a drink and some appetizers (chicken tender basket), and I ordered the waffles. The 'chicken and waffles' was a but underwhelming, and the others seemed to feel the same about their entrees. Just a warning that the stuffed Strawberry french toast is not what you would typically see, but a pocket of dough with strawberry filling in the middle. Takes a while to come out but not always completely done.The drinks are fun. Not necessarily strong, but have great flavors, and come with candy ($1.50 extra if the drink of your choice does not come with Candy, but you still want it.When I came for dinner, I skipped the drink and ordered the pasta & Bolognese sauce. Not as flavorful as I would have thought -- I was hoping the meat sauce would be a bit more savory/salty. Maybe its because I skipped the cheese on top but I would not recommend that dish. Super bland. The guy next to me ordered a burger and seemed to really enjoy that.Each time, the waiters were really nice and accommodating, especially when my friend was not pleased by the french toast pocket and gladly switched out her entree. So like I said, go for the fun $36 drinks, but maybe eat somewhere else.",1,,2

The only thing that was good that my table let me try was the veggie burger and salad.The birthday song was amazing by the live and lit waiter. I was very disappointed in the food.

I came here for photos and ambiance. Very close to high line but honestly food and drinks were eh. The service was horrifically slow except when it was time to pay. Upstairs is better seating. Wait time is long if you dont make reservations. Street parking available $7 for each half hour near restaurant. Total bill for 8 people $431.  they have crepes. Pancake and waffles. Chicken and waffles too. And huge milkshakes.,,,

I had a reservation for 3 people at 2 p.m. on a Friday. We didn't get seated until 2:30 p.m. although the hostess were all really kind and kept apologizing, it was still no excuse to have to wait standing up for 1/2 hr despite having a reservation. I thought they would discount something off the bill or give us some free candy but they didn't. They just apologized and sat us down. Despite this, We had a great time. Our waitress was really sweet and helpful. The portions here are really big so go on an empty stomach! They have some cool rainbow sliders that kids love! The spaghetti was good. The ambiance is cool. There were a lot of people celebrating their birthdays so it was nice to watch everyone singing happy birthday.",,,

I love that they sing happy birthday to you and ended with ""you go gurl""my only complain was that even though we had reservations we were plunked down on this small table right outside of the serving area/door.  So every time a waiter came out I feel as though I will be ran over at any moment!  It felt as though they just threw a teeny tiny table in front of the door and add 3 chairs and called it a ""reservation"" for a party of 3!

They have a variety of large fishbowl drinks that have an array of candy inside. They are made with dry ice so they smoke when the beverage is poured into the glass, super fun to watch! They can also make all the drinks in non alcoholic versions too. All the food I have had here so far I have enjoyed. Definitely make a reservation as it gets very busy! Prices are a bit high but it's a fun experience so it's worth it. Will definitely go back!",,,

Updated review","Came back for lunch today at the Sugar Factory. Huge kudos to Stepfanie and Mary for the exceptional customer service. We had a much better experience than We did last time. We got the mac and cheese balls ($14) for free from checking in on Yelp. They were gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside - absolutely delicious. Our waitress, Chanel, was friendly and attentive. The service was still quite slow, but given that the restaurant was packed this is understandable. We skipped the goblets and dessert. I got one last time, and found it too sweet. Full disclaimer: I'm typically not a big fan of sweets, and I also try to eat clean. Yet, today was the ultimate cheat day meal, and I have definitely satisfied my sugar cravings for the rest of the month (ok, maybe the rest of the week). We ordered a monster Nutella banana milkshake ($20), a s'mores latte ($13), red velvet pancakes ($16), and a Big Cheesy burger ($20). The milkshake tasted okay, but I was very impressed by the details, especially the sprinkles on the dark chocolate fondant and the various toppings. It looked too beautiful to eat. The s'mores latte was good, but again, too sweet. The pancakes were yum - loved the white chocolate flakes. The burger was delicious as well.At first I found the loudness of the restaurant disorienting, but I came to appreciate the fun, party-like ambiance. This might not be a good place for a lunch date but would be perfect for celebrating special occasions or for taking friends and family who are in the area. Still recovering from a sugar coma, but it was all worth it. ;)",,,
186,Mia L.,"Rosedale, NY",0,2,1,4.0,7/9/2018,Such a great vibe. Drinks are amazing. Just wish there were more room in between tables. Felt a little squished at times. But otherwise worth the trip. Going back very soon. Been there about three times now lol can't get enough !,,,

188,Francheska R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,10/15/2018,"The absolute worse service ever. Planned a date night with my children- thought the sugar factory would be ideal. I should've taken them to applebees instead. Not only did we feel neglected by our server, the food sucked. How could you mess up french fries?? They weren't even fresh ! The waitress was no where to be found, I had to get up from my table multiple times, to ask for napkins, utensils.. etc . Everything was absolutely horrendous. Definitely not worth it.

I might come back with the kids just because of the hype, but me no likey.(Forgot to mention not hip on the unisex restrooms filthy and trashed out, people walking out with toilet paper on their shoes)",,,

Updated review","I visited sugar factory this past Saturday at 5 pm with my daughter. We were seated promptly and greeted by our friendly and attentive server Cornell. The food was outstanding! We ordered a chicken finger appetizer which was perfect. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and my daughter had the sugar factory sandwich (I think that's what it was called), both were delicious. Usually I hate being loaded up on French fries but we both couldn't get enough of the shoe string fries, they were soooooo good. I wish we had more room for dessert, which disappointed me. I couldn't fit anymore food as I was wobbling out of there with a food baby . Fun spot, great food and can't wait to come back!Ps... Thank you Stepfanie",,,
193,JustSaying C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,33,0,2.0,9/24/2018,"So it's cute for a minute, then you're like ""did I really just pay $32 per fishbowl drink? And $100 for 3?""   And that's before food, dessert and candy.  Wow!  For that price,  we should have been given the bowls to keep. I really don't like that the drink prices are not disclosed on the menu AND I asked 3 different people about the price and they all said something different.  Do they make the drink price up as they see fit for the party?  Food and service were good. Another thing that is wrong is that when they weigh your candy bag ($18/lb and also not posted anywhere), you can't see the scale or the screen that shows the weight and cost of your candy bags.  I said the screen should be facing the customer, especially since it's on the counter holding on with velcro it could easily just be turned around.  I got no response.  The scale is behind the podium and among so much debris, so who knows wtf they're weighing back there with your candy.  I paid by credit card and they asked me if I wanted an itemized receipt or if the cc receipt was enough.  Um, yes I want an itemized receipt.  Maybe it is a tourist trap, but they're seemed to be a lot of locals, including my party.  Just be clear! Post your prices.",,,

That being said, it WAS really good. We had the blue one with the hypnotiq but I don't remember what it was called. They are very big on ""experience"" here so the waiter told us to get our phones ready for snapchat and such before pouring our drinks. Pretty cool, although a bit embarrassing that we were so ready to do that ;) service here is really great and friendly.The food is good too, but not spectacular. Really, this place is about getting drinks with a SIDE of food. The fish bowls and the chocolate martinis are amazing, and they are the experience. If you're from the west coast, you might think of this place as an adult version of Farrell's in socal or Fenton's in norcal. Big dessert-y fun.
