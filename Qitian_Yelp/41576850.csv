0,Paula F.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,305,2218,5.0,10/19/2018,"Fresh in from Los Angeles, this was the first restaurant my bf and I visited in NY.  We arrived in NY late and began our search for dinner at 11: 00 pm. There were a lot of restaurants open in the Times Square area but none had many vegetarian options.  We walked about a mile looking at restaurants until we stumbled upon West End Bar and Grill.  The veggie burger caught my eye when we looked at the menu outside.  When we ventured inside,  I noticed a casual and relaxed bar with the baseball playoffs on.  (Go LA Dodgers!). There were two relatively small areas for dining.  The vibe was social and fun.The menu contained a huge list of alcoholic beverages and a wonderful selection of food options (tacos, burgers, salads, starters, wraps, sandwiches, starters and sides).  My bf ordered the Greek Chicken Pita and I had my burger with rainbow carrots.  The food was brought out quickly and was plated well.  The carrots were amazing and the bean burger was very tasty with a semi-crusted outer layer.  My bf comment this pita was delicious.  Service was outstanding.  Our sever was friendly and helpful.There were three restrooms- unisex, men, and women.  The restrooms, although quite small,  were functional and well designed.  Rounding up from a 4.5, this place rated a 5.",,,1
1,Steven T.,"Riverside, CA",71,110,34,3.0,10/19/2018,"Went in for pre theater drinks; should be simple enough. My niece had wine, no problem and reasonable price. I ordered a double shot espresso. What I got was anything but. Not sure what they're using to make it, but it was thin weak and flavorless. I'm thinking it was some instant add water and stir packaged stuff. Must avoid at all costs.",,,
2,Beenish H.,"Brooklyn, NY",496,259,703,3.0,8/15/2018,"Caters to the tourist masses that ""venture"" out after the evening Broadway showings.  Do not be mistaken, we are locals.  I must state that for the record, for my own sanity, as well.  After watching Wicked and Spongebob, respectively, we were ready to chow down.I happened upon this place, and figured, hey, it's far enough from the theater district, yeah right.  Long story, short, my niece and I ended up here first since Wicked ended an hour earlier than Spongebob.  I ordered the grilled chicken Greek pita samich served with fries.  Niece ordered the salmon main served with jasmine rice and pickled onions.  While the food tasted fine and all, there was absolutely nothing memorable about the food, at all.  It was perty straight forward with small and overpriced portions.  I'm typically not one to point that out unless necessary.  It is necessary.Sis ordered the same as me, and nephew had the burger which seemed very lackluster.  It was fine for what was open and around at 11pm on a weeknight close to the theater district.",6,3,5
3,Christine A.,"Atlanta, GA",349,162,47,4.0,11/20/2018,"A few coworkers and I dropped in here for lunch a few weeks back and were pleasantly surprised by their lunch menu - a complimentary glass of wine or beer is served with the lunch menu. All of us enjoyed a Yuengling lager with our meal. I had a burger and fries and one of my other coworkers had Chicken Parmesan sliders. I believe all of us were satisfied with the meal. They also offer a ""grilled cheese"" of the day which sounded phenomenal. If I'm ever back in the area, I might drop back in here sometime!",,,

6,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",321,454,6450,4.0,4/25/2018,"This is a great after work happy hour hot spot (certain drinks are $7 - see list of the day, from 4PM - 7PM).  This is also a good pre-theater dinner hub if you're seeing a Broadway show nearby as it is steps from a few theaters.  My girlfriend and I met up here for dinner and drinks. The bar area and first dining space you encounter is roomy.  The tables are well spaced. There is a soft dim on the lighting all throughout - even a nice blue glow above the bar.  It is thankfully not so dark where you can't read the menu. This place has a chill /relaxed vibe. Just beyond that first dining area, in the way back, there's a much quieter and intimate back dining area. Great space for a smaller private event or if you want to be in a more intimate setting.Onto the drinks/food:The ""Lush Life Martini"" is highly recommended by myself and the waitress (I didn't get her name but she was very polite and served us well throughout the evening).  Great combo of flavors: pineapple infused vodka, triple sec, lemon and cranberry.  Happy Hour price to boot (as noted above).For dinner, I recommend the braised red wine (beef) short ribs.  Very savory (sauce - red wine demi-glace) and fork tender (no knife necessary).  The side of rainbow carrots and the buttery mashed potatoes were an excellent accompaniment to the beef.  My girlfriend ordered the Glazed Salmon.  The soy chili glaze was what made it great.  (We both love salmon).For dessert, there was no printed menu so the waitress just told us the three choices (carrot cake, cheesecake and a chocolate lava cake).  We opted to share the chocolate lava cake which was sweet but not over the top.  Perfect way to end the meal.   BTW, it wasn't advertised on the Yelp page, but upon check in on Yelp, a window popped up saying 'free glass of wine with any entree'. I totally took advantage of that and ordered a glass of Reisling.  That was a nice surprise!I shall return...next time to try the drool worthy tuna appetizer and maybe the fish tacos.  Looked so good at our neighboring table.",9,3,9
7,Tricia G.,"Turnersville, NJ",230,652,1495,5.0,4/29/2018,"Absolutely delicious food for all four gals visiting NYC for 'Wicked' on this beautiful day.We just happened to go in off the cuff - we had no clue.  I quickly checked Yelp on the way in, and was glad to see the great reviews.  BONUS - a Yelp check in for a glass of wine.  NOICE!Two of us had their AMAZING pumpkin pancakes with maple syrup and pecans.  They were topped with freshly sliced strawberries.  Two others had burgers, which they really enjoyed.We were seated promptly and by floor length windows, which were cracked open, giving us a nice breeze.  I stink with directions, but would seek this out when in the city again.  (when asked, the bartender specially made a 'Blue Hawaiian' for my one friend - quite pretty!). Great place!",1,,1
8,Kelly G.,"Morristown, NJ",133,86,69,4.0,3/17/2018,"My boyfriend and I went here before our show and we were not dissappointed! We both got a hangar steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.The plate may look small but we each had more than enough to fill us up. The steak practically fell apart and melted in our mouths. It was pretty salty but that didnt take away from the rest of its flavor. The green beans were also not cooked as much as I would have liked but the meal was very nice. The only downside was that our reservations started at 5pm and by the time we had finished with our meal ~6:15 they ran out of coffee to go with dessert. We had very attentive service, and the price was very reasonable for midtown west! Will definitely consider going again",1,,
9,Cari S.,"La Plata, MD",2,38,43,4.0,10/19/2018,"We stopped in after the theater dinner crowd had gone through.  The decor is rich with dim lighting, great for a date night! My husband wanted the lasagna which was a special.  When he ordered he was disappointed to find out they were out of this.  He chose fish tacos instead.  They were ok. They were salty so by the time he finished two, he was done with the heavy salt seasoning taste. I had the kale salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp were good.  The salad was topped with an apple cranberry compote. I quickly mixed it in with my salad. A big mistake! I should have only used about half of it. The compote just took over the other flavors in the salad. Overall, the salad was good, fresh and unique.",,,

Updated review","West End is the place to start if you're in the process of hitting up Broadway. Start to finish this joint was just right. We were seated right away for our reservation and our waitress came right for our drink order. She even noticed a speck of dirt if one of the water glasses...she took it back! Very observant. No appetizers, but the drinks were flowing. They have a great selection of beers and wine. Pricing was a little over the top for beer ($8-9), but near Broadway I wouldn't expect any different. Also, the TVs had some excellent entertainment...college football! It just so happen that we were seated perfectly to catch the end of the 3:30 games. On to the food:-Chicken Chipotle Wrap (fresh ingredients, spicy aoli, and a side of fries that were kick a$$)-The soon to be wife got the OG sliders (the beef seemed to be a tad bit dry, but overall not a bad dinner option) -The rest of the table ordered a large American burger and salmon sliders. Overall, great experience. Will be keeping this joint in mind the next time we see a show or want to people watch in Times Square. Update: We came back to our favorite joint that we love to frequent before a show. This time it was great aside from how quickly the food came out. Appetizer (flatbread) was being devoured and as I was finishing up my 2nd slice...BOOM my steak sandwich was in my ear hole. I'm not my father, so I didn't send the food back.",1,1,
11,Phil S.,"Bergen County, NJ",15,121,35,3.0,11/25/2017,"Overall *** I found West End an attractive place with friendly service that I really wanted to love. Although the menu reads well with some interesting sounding dishes most of our meals were a let down due to lack of detailed execution.Setting **** Located just on the edge of the theatre district West End is an attractive bar located on the corner of 49th and 8th. Towering ceilings make it feel more open than the relativity narrow space. There is a long bar on the left, 3 person high tops along the right with dining tables towards the rear.Service **** We were greeted and sat right away and our server, Savanna, was very nice and helpful and took off the ""Waffles"" that you will read about below.Food ** My sons  burger was very good although it was slightly over cooked but the other dishes did not impress. I ordered the Chorizo Grilled Cheese which was a disappointment due to the cold, not melted shredded mozzarella. My daughter was not happy with her ""Waffle"" and I have to agree, it was barely a waffle and closer to a flat, doughy pancake with dents in it. My wife described her salad as just ok.The menu descriptions don't really reflect what you get. For example my wife's salad said it came with Goat Cheese but failed to mention that it was fried. My Grilled Cheese never mentions that it comes with Avocado that I didn't expect.  Value *** $10 for the waffle, $15 Grilled Cheese and $16 for the burger and the salad is a little steep but that is the norm in NYC.",1,1,
12,Erik G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,46,18,4.0,10/30/2018,Only visited once and got takeout.  While waiting I ordered a draft beer and was able to enjoy the atmosphere.  Not real loud and had a good vibe.,,,
13,H S.,"New York, NY",3,164,0,5.0,11/15/2018,"Have had their delicious sliders but I have to say the pulled pork sandwich was the bomb.  Really just fresh, good, tasty yum.  From the meat to the pickles, to the onions to the bread, just yum.  Someone mentions caters to the tourists, but I'm a local and I thought it was good.",,,

We were both starving so I quickly looked up the reviews and as always, Yelp never lets me down! We arrived around 8:45 pm and stood at the ""wait to be seated"" sign for a good 5 minutes waiting for a hostess to come. I made my way into the restaurant to find a server and ask if we could be seated bc we were starting to get hangry. The server was really nice and told us to go wherever we liked. I picked the front window table. I picked the Napa Chicken Sandwich and hubby picked the Fish Tacos. We both really, really enjoyed our meal.

Service was excellent.  I just ordered something I didn't like.  It happens.  A great little cover band was playing which we really enjoyed as well.,,,
17,Frank T.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,11,4,2.0,9/29/2018,"Disappointed. My wife first of all did like her pear martini. Our friend ordered sliders. They came out with a lot of fries that were room temperature. No heat lamp? I ordered tuna tartare after waitress told me she liked the dish. Not very good. I generally eat everything on my plate but could not finish the dish. The tartare was presented nicely on top of a mound of guacamole but the guacamole was the worst I've had. My wife ordered nachos. It was heaping but with lots of chips that were not very good. Staff was nice, bar area was attractive. Hope their food improves.",,,

Finding decent food and vibes in the theatre district is sometimes a challenge because tOuRiStS (!!!) so the ratings here had me hyped but nah. Service was slow but they do ask you when you order if you're seeing a show and if so what time it's at, so they can be mindful of speed. They had a whole menu of drinks, wine and beers so I'm guessing happy hour here is what's the main attraction.",1,,1
20,Christine G.,"New York, NY",2,1,0,5.0,5/31/2018,This is one of my favorite spots in the city! I used to live in NYC and have since moved to Boston but every time I come to town I have to stop in for some delicious food and signature cocktails.  The atmosphere and staff are fantastic. It's an awesome brunch spot but also a great location to catch a pre show drink or dinner because it's steps away from the theater district. Last time I was in was around St Patrick's Day and the whole place was festive. I also have Gluten sensitivity and they were very accommodating. I recommend this place to all my friends visiting the city!,1,,

The restaurant has THE BEST Chorizo-Avocado-Grilled-Cheese Sandwich in all of Manhattan. You will not be able to find a Chorizo Avocado Grilled Cheese anywhere else because I have literally searched for it all over the borough. Unless a restaurant sees this review and adds it to their menu... But anyway, this sandwich is only available for Brunch on weekends. What a shame!!!! I'd eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! And if you check-in, you get a free glass of booze. I got the red wine. Honestly, I miss this restaurant in the loneliest hours of my day, or not the restaurant but definitely the sandwich. I started making it at home because it's such an easy recipe. Also, if you want to make a reservation at this place, definitely call and reserve. Don't reserve on Yelp or Opentable, because for some reason, reserving on Yelp doesn't show up in the restaurant's system. And this place is BIZZYY on weekends.

Once we walked in, we got serve at once, even the bar was quite full. It didn't took long, the waitress got a seat. The bar inside also looked great, it got a really nice atmosphere.So we were in the mood to tried out some local favorite drinks here, we asked the waitress to recommended some to us. which she did. I actually forgot the name of my beer already, but it was great. it tasted a bit like jasmine in it, kinda of interested and refresching. Well, My phubby he didn't like the one he got so much. The food, I was really surprised and glad that actually offered food as well. And most of them did look promising on the menu. I ordered a sandwich with shrimps. It tasted amazing, I really enjoyed it. so did my hubby, he enjoyed his order as well. The price of this place was quite alright, not supre expensive or something.

However when your waitress walks up before you even get water to tell you the kitchen is ""short staffed and a little backed up""... RUN. RUN FOR THE HILLS. I guess 45 min wait after ordering is what they consider a little back up. 45 MIN FOR A BURGER. 45 MIN!!!!!! What a joke. Not even an apology. The least they could have done is send out a comped app or something to munch on. Even just some bread. But no nothing.  This place sucks. It sucks. Never ever going back.

The Lobster tacos were a hit. Chunks of fresh lobster with a delicious berre blanc sauce and three wonderful accompaniments including a delicious guacamole. We also tried the Queso foundillo served with crunch tortillas chips and a wonderful grilled sausage flatbread. Our server, Allison, was attentive and made great suggestions.

With each bite, the juices just dripped all over the plate so make sure to have your napkins ready!I ordered mines w/Gruyere cheese & a portabella mushroom and damn was the perfect combination. looking back, i should have ordered a 2nd one but i didn't want to look like a complete fat ass in front of my friends.

My friend also ordered the French toast and she said it was way too sweet for her liking. She also agreed the portions were really small. It's affordable but I'd order the sides if I were you.

The atmosphere is pretty much what you'd expect at a bar with televisions if you are looking to catch a game.The food was tasty, however I must warn you that the portions are very small. I'm not necessarily a big eater, but I felt that they were small for the price tag. The salmon entree was $26 and the skirt steak salad was $17.

Service was prompt, which we appreciated, since we had to make a show, but we were still able to linger a bit until it was time to go.Food was entirely enjoyable and decently priced: short rib grilled cheese, fish tacos, burger, and a salad with steak.

My companions both had the Chicken Parm sliders and really liked them.They don't have a kids' menu but the kitchen was nice enough to make my picky daughter a plain grilled cheese as opposed to the fancy one with brie and apples on their menu. The best part of the meal were the French fries. I'm kind of a snob when it comes to fries and these were very, very good.I will probably not be in this part of the city very often (we were nearby for a show) so I don't know if I would go out of my way to come back here.",,,
82,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",0,13,3,1.0,5/29/2018,"Usually I wouldn't write a review based on just getting drinks, but there's always an exception to the rule...And here is that exception.Went in here to get a little buzzed before a show, wanted to get two drinks in and with an hour before we had to get to the theater, figured that was enough time. Told the greeter we just wanted drinks but she sat us at a high top. Then we ended up waiting and waiting. When we finally got to place our drink orders, we had to inform them we needed the cheque at the same time. Spoiler alert: it did not come with the drinks. We were sat right across from the register/drinks area and we saw people coming and going with their orders but our waiter was no where to be seen. Finally after chugging down one drink each, we had to book it over to the theater.But the one star isn't for the slow as molasses service alone. It's for the drinks too. Don't get it twisted, not only is this place not caring about pace, it also serves up some mean gross drinks. Two of us got watermelon margaritas and another got a beer. As a non beer drinker, I didn't even try it. As for my friend who had ordered it and was a beer drinker, in their own words: it was disgusting. In regards to my watermelon margarita, petrol probably tastes better. I've had my fair share of gross tasting drinks, but they usually come by getting me buzzed. This one was just gross and a waste of calories. Every sip had me wanting to stop, but I knew there was no time for any other bar stops. I was hoping it'd at the very least give a good tipsy feeling. All I got was a headache.",,,

It seemed like a fancy or small unknown establishment until we entered and met one of their bartenders, Jacob from Galway. I have to admit, he's cute, but fit well with the atmosphere. He was attentive when needed. The music fit more towards the 90s which made my friend and I very happy especially since Jacob was willing to chat when not busy. We were made to feel welcome immediately. This bar and grill served traditional bar food with a large menu of drinks and foods while still maintaining the view of a grill with the sports channels. I was happy to come in with my friend to spend a half hour  chatting while enjoying a drink. I was able to catch up on a few games that were currently playing and she enjoyed the free wifi. All in all Jacob made us feel welcome and completely willing to come back the next time either of us are in the city.

87,Bria T.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",3,31,2,5.0,3/19/2017,"I won a gift certificate from West End Bar & Grille from my job and decided to come here last Sunday. I work around the corner and always saw it in passing but never really thought to go inside assuming its pricy and touristy. I was wrong.Sunday night was pretty empty. We were there for a couple of hours watching the game and saw one big party come in and about 10 people total at the bar at one time. The restaurant has a pretty intimate atmosphere so this was perfect. I can't imagine the place being crowded but there were tons of tables if that were to ever happen. The music was great...a mix of funk, r&b, and classics. I heard about 5 Prince songs and that made me really happy lol.On to the food...we started with the west end wings (half honey siratcha and half sweet chili). I've got to say the honey siratcha is better than the sweet chili but both are really good. My boyfriend had the lobster tacos (3 per order) and he said those were excellent. For our entrees, I started with the chicken & asparagus pasta dish. I didn't really like it (tasted kind of bland) but the waitress was sweet enough to switch it out for the C+BLT which I LOVED I would definitely get that again. He had the trio of sliders (classic, parm & pastrami) which he loved. The fries were delicious as well. I tried to look for a dessert menu (sucker for sweets) but I didn't see one.Despite my bad luck with my first dish I would still give this place 5 stars. Very relaxing, very accommodating and overall a good time.",,,

Updated review",I wanted to follow up after my review.  I received a prompt response from Jillian the Manager and she wanted to make sure that we understood that the West End Grill prides themselves with quality service and food.  She invited us back to the restaurant to make things right.   The fact she reached out right away and offered to show my wife and I that they are a quality establishment gave me encouragement that my experience was the exception and not the rule  If we were not heading out of town to avoid the blizzard we would have gone back to the restaurant for dinner.  Thank you Jillian and your offer was very much appreciated.,,,

The menu mainly consisted of burgers and sandwiches. I chose the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband got the hangover burger. I enjoyed the chicken wrap although it took longer to get our food than I expected. Fries were good. I tried my husbands burger too, and it was good except for the weird hashbrown on the bottom.

94,Jason N.,"New York, NY",91,39,2,2.0,12/8/2017,"I live just across the street from this establishment and have probably frequented it too many times out of pure convenience (and because the food is pretty good when they get it right, which is almost never). Last night, I had A friend in town visiting me. We went to the establishment, and of course, there was a bit of a way to get a non-""high top"" table. We were seated in about 15 minutes, and a waiter who I usually see on a regular basis there came by to take our drink order. We ordered food shortly thereafter, and proceeded to wait over 55 minutes for basic food (minestrone and steak tacos) that never came. Meanwhile, all the patrons sitting around us had received their food, and some had come and gone. I finally was able to flag down a manager, who offered to give me the simple soup that I had ordered nearly an hour ago for free. At that point I decided just to leave, as I was pretty disgusted with their complete disregard for even basic acceptable food service. This isn't the first time that I've had a bad experience with terrible service, surly waiters or waitresses, or items that do not come out correctly. There seems to always be a ""problem in the kitchen,"" or ""some sort of mix up in the kitchen"". I have frequented the place many times for brunch, and I can't think of a *single* time that an order has come out exactly as I ordered it. Want to ask for a side of mayo? Be prepared to wait 15 minutes for a tiny bit of mayo. I am finally done with this place, and I won't be coming back or taking guests there, even though it's literally less than one block from my place. I guess I shouldn't have given them 15+ chances.

The only food we ordered was the caprese appetizer, which was perfect size for an app to share among two people.  We sat in a booth table in the back of the restaurant, and enjoyed our comfy seats. It was early Saturday evening when we went, and there was no wait in line and our server was prompt and friendly.",,,
110,Bruce C.,"San Francisco, CA",16,27,0,4.0,4/14/2018,"posting about West End to tell a little story....about 3 PM we decided to have dinner at this place the same evening.  we had 8 PM theater tickets.  so we went on line and found that West End B&G does not make same-day reservations on line.  fair enough.  we called the place, talked to a nice lady, were promised a table at 6 PM.showing up at 6 PM, we were told no one on staff had ever heard of us.  I showed the hostess my phone, indicating what time I had called and that I had called the right number.""We'll take care of you,"" she said...and so they did.In other words--bad moments, good result.as to the food?  the two of us split a flat bread (sausages, tomatoes, cheese); my better half had asparagus ravioli with grilled shrimp, which she liked; I had glazed/grilled salmon with rice and pickled onions....the onions were certainly different from any vegetable side I'd ever encountered, and I loved 'em. the salmon was great, the rice was great...and the French sauv blanc we had was just fine.so why not five stars?  place got really loud while we were there....but we made the start of our play (""Once on this Island"") in plenty of time, and I'm sure we'd go back to West End Bar & Grill.",,,

We had our 2 daughters with us and although there was no ""kids menu"" they both found something they liked.  Thai Chili wings, pan roasted chicken, chicken blt and steak tacos were delicious!  Everyone was happy. Service and atmosphere were great too.  Giving 4 stars because the chicken only came with one small chicken leg for $20 - she would've eaten a lot more!",1,,
113,Jay L.,"New York, NY",238,40,0,2.0,12/21/2016,We went middle of the day before a show. Service was pleasant and nice but our order had some issues. The wrong wine was brought out and then fixed. We got our fries relatively quick by waiting for our soup and salad. The soup ended up not as hot as I would have liked and the salad a little rubbery.,1,,
114,Vince F.,"New Albany, OH",0,1,0,5.0,10/23/2017,Juliana and Tommy were fantastic and made our trip enjoyable. The band on Saturday night was awesome. They have the coldest beer in NYC too if you are into that,,,
115,Ashley A.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/18/2018,I decided to come here because it was really close to work & looked like a good lunch spot. My mom was visiting from out of state & we got here at 12:00 PM. From the very beginning our service was not acceptable.  We were both served the wrong drinks and the waitress never came back to check on us so we could tell her this was NOT what we ordered. We ordered food at the same time as we ordered our drinks at 12:05.  When we still hadn't seen our waitress at 12:40 I  went and found her and told her that we need our food wrapped at this point because I will have no time to eat.  She said she will do it right away.  I waited until 12:55 and at that point we still didn't have our food and she acted as though she didn't even know what we ordered.  I had to leave my mom at the restaurant to wait for the food because I was going to be late back to work.... I got a call from my mom at 1:20 saying that they STILL DID NOT BRING OUR FOOD. We had to go find our waitress every time she did not come check on us once! There were only about 10 other people total in the restaurant when we showed up.  NOT ACCEPTABLE. I will never come here again and I do not recommend this place to anyone looking for food in the area.,,,
116,Audra S.,"Colchester, CT",145,23,0,4.0,2/1/2017,"Nice little bistro lunch spot, my burger was very good. The menu is small, so you don't have many options, the wait staff was nice and even answered questions about the city.",,,
117,Nick C.,"Manhattan, NY",67,526,235,5.0,10/29/2015,"I stopped in for a quick lunch with some friends from out of town who had just seen Wicked. The three of us were seated immediately and after our drinks arrived, we ordered. We all ordered the Pat LaFrieda hand packed burger with fries. It was an awesome tasting burger-we all agreed. Our waitress, Joanna F. was most accommodating and came by several times to see if everything was alright and if we needed anything else. The decor is publike and is a very comfortable setting. The burgers came with lettuce, tomato and onion and each of us got a different choice of cheese [I got American, they both got Monterey Jack] It was an excellent meat and a wonderful night out. I would recommend and return.",2,,
118,David S.,"Hoboken, NJ",183,180,15,4.0,11/5/2015,"Had some time to kill before a show and this was one of the first places that wasn't insanely crowded.  We were sat immediately and began looking over the menu.  Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive without being overbearing.  We ordered a couple of sandwiches and the cheese plate.  The cheese plate was a bit of a throw away for me, but seems to be a trend that is here to stay.  Don't get me wrong I really enjoy a well thought out cheese plate but when you can't explain to me what the differences are or don't identify the cheese when it's placed in front of me you might as well just have brought me queso.  The sandwiches were really good.  We had a cheesesteak and a chicken sandwich and both were cooked well and tasted just fine.  Prices were reasonable for the area and for NYC.  Be warned that as we were leaving the place got VERY crowded and the minute we stood up our table was taken, so either make a reservation or come in a bit earlier.",1,,2

I ordered the French Toast with Chicken Apple Sausage on the side, while my wife ordered the steak and eggs. The flavor of the French toast was pretty good, as were the sausages (though they did taste quite similar to the Applegate ones from the supermarket). My wife's steak was pretty average, nothing to write home about. Was going to give it 4 stars, but service was a little lacking. Had to ask for water/coffee refills multiple times, and they forgot our sides when the courses were brought out. Overall, not a bad place, just needs a little work on service.",,,
121,Jeff V.,"Fontana, CA",9,15,2,5.0,4/17/2016,"Cool bar, atmosphere was good since it wasn't crowded. Definitely a place you can sit and talk. The Sriracha Honey wings are really bomb!

126,Karen X.,"New York, NY",216,189,172,2.0,6/17/2015,"Not the cheapest or most superb food you'll find, but this is a great place to get some drinks after work or if you're in the area. The food overall is pretty standard and not out of this world, and the drinks are a little on the high end but still reasonably priced. The only thing that makes this place stand out is its proximity to Times Square (which undoubtedly attracts a good amount of tourists). Overall was a good experience, but probably not jumping up and down to recommend to others.",1,1,

I had the chicken and it was amazing, but my boyfriend had the steak salad and the steak was cold- not sure if this was intentional or not but I had expected it to be warm. The food also took about 45 minutes, but if you're not in a rush it's a cool spot.",,,

Everything can up very fast but they were also putting too much pressure for us to consume everything fast. We were still drinking our beer and they were already asking if we wanted another one. I didn't even put my silver wear down and they were already taking the plates. It got really annoying and they brought the check when we had just ordered a new beer. It came off as impolite they should change that.",1,,

We also had some brunch cocktails that were also very tasty :) Due to the weather being warm, they had their large windows open and we sat right at the high table that faces 8th Ave. We found the ambiance to be very chill with both regulars and tourist coming in to eat and/or drink. They are conveniently located on the corner with a subway stop right there for those travelling on  the subway and for myself (drove from NJ) I was able to find 2 hour metered parking between 8th & 9th.",1,,2
133,Jean B.,"Sea Cliff, NY",0,3,0,2.0,1/6/2018,"I am starting with the temperature outside is 7 degrees. Arrived for our reservation and walked in the restaurant which felt very cold. We were seated and thinking since the place had just opened it would warm up. Then noticing there were space heaters in several spots one of which was behind us started to question the cold. About 15 minutes later an employee took the space heater behind us and brought it up front,where there already was one,and left the back of the restaurant  without one. I asked twice if we could have another heater and was told twice they were working on it. Nothing was ever said about the lack of heat from the time we came in until about 20 minutes of being there when I asked. The table next to us had to send their pancakes back because they were not cooked.The food was good and staff was friendly but the lack of heat on a 7 degree day, no info given when we came in and the employee taking the space heater away to put up front where there was one already is enough of a reason for me not to return.",,,

My friends and I took a gamble and stopped by West End, which seemed approachable but still fun for a bunch of twenty-somethings to stop by for dinner and drinks. Their cocktail menu seemed to showcase some very creative drinks, which made it fun to pick and choose. I eventually ordered the Toasted Coconut cocktail, made me feel (briefly) like I was on vacation.I shared some tasty appetizers with the group, including short rib spring rolls and yucca fries. For myself, I ordered the Lobster Club - this I was less inclined to share because I liked it so much! Nothing beats the combination of lobster and bacon flavored with a garlic aioli. I'm going to keep this place in mind the next time I need to stop by a place to eat before a show - in addition to the friendly and attentive staff, this place is worth another visit.",,,

145,Courtney B.,"Monroe, NY",180,5,0,4.0,11/20/2016,"Picked this place based on location near the Gershwin theatre for dinner after seeing wicked. Made a reservation, and arrived about 30 minutes earlier then the reservation. Our table was already ready, and we were immediately seated. Wasn't that busy and this is the reason they're not receiving 5 stars. Took quite a while for our waitress to greet us. There were 6 of us who were all torn on what to order, and by the time we were initially greeted we had already selected drinks, apps and dinner.  It's not a big place, and they were not fully packed, so waiting 15 min for the waitress to greet us, in my eyes is unacceptable.  Then there after our drinks took at least another 8-10 minutes. So overall we were there for almost 20-25 minutes before even getting a water let alone bar drinks. The food was great. The wings, both styles so much flavor. My friends ordered the queso dip which they thought was awesome. Food came out very fast!  The manager, and what even appeared to be the owners presence was very apparent (which is a good thing). 4 of us ordered the steak which was served with mashed potatoes, they were amazing!  One of the girls ordered the fish tacos on the waitresses recommendation, she hates sending food back as she's a waitress herself, but they were awful so she sent them back, got the ravioli instead which she said was great!  Disappointment during dinner was after apps they took out utensils which is great, but they didn't replace before our meals got there. Had to wait about 3 min after getting food for utensils to arrive. Overall good place. Small but most of the staff is pleasant.  Despite a few small hiccups which every place has it was enjoyable.  It was nice that what appeared to be the owner checked on us multiple times.  Overall I recommend this place.",,,

Both were super delicious and just enough for late night. Love the decor and laid back yet sexy atmosphere. I can't wait to bring some friends back for cocktails and more great food!,,,
168,Kilgore T.,"WYNNEWOOD, PA",0,20,0,2.0,4/8/2016,"I have never written a bad review before, but this place was such a bust.  I came here a few weeks ago for some drinks and something to eat with some friends.  Service was slow.  Really slow.  We felt lucky anytime the server felt that it was time to look up from her phone and help us out.  One round of drinks and a snack turned into an hour and a half ordeal.  This place just isn't worth it.",,,
169,Erik J.,"Superior, CO",0,12,2,4.0,4/4/2016,"I was staying in the area with my daughter, and we decided to stop in for dinner. We didn't have a reservation, but they got us right in. The food was really good, and the service was pleasant. We also like the warm atmosphere. My daughter had the Greek sandwich, and I had the mesclun salad with chicken (and a tasty IPA!). I would definitely come back here.",,,
170,Nancy A.,"Riverview, FL",61,5,1,5.0,10/9/2016,I saw a couple reviews and needed a place late Sunday evening. This place met all my needs and then the food came out and my mind was extremely happy. I ordered the pan fried chicken and my girl ordered Sriracha honey wings. Both were to die for. Just what we needed to end our day.  Highly recommend.,1,,
171,Ian P.,"Manhattan, NY",10,2,0,1.0,2/11/2016,"Pretty bad experience, especially when I was hoping to do something quick and easy for a work lunch. Went with my girlfriend and we were seated at a greasy table that clearly needed to be cleaned. Asked for soda water and our waitress brought out a Voss bottle, I guess trying to up-charge us like this place is a fancy restaurant. We asked for just plain soda water from the gun, and she told us that they charge for it, which is pretty lame. I was so frustrated that I just asked for my late-arriving burger and fries to go (which I angrily ate in my office). The service was beyond poor and clueless, and there was a lot of idleness by the staff. Never going back.",,,
172,Rich P.,"Port Jefferson Station, NY",3,20,13,4.0,1/31/2016,"So here we sit. The ambience is awesome in this very NY Pub setting. The beer selection is great and the meal was awesome as well. Cool menu with a pretty wide selection.  The staff served it up well,  and service was right on point. It is so comfortable here,  I wanted to stay longer! I would recommend the bar or the restaurant. Enjoyable",,,
173,Ed W.,"Duluth, GA",0,14,11,3.0,1/30/2016,"Location is great. Drinks were good, music good. Bartender needs a personality adjustment. Not friendly at all.  Just to be clear, I was with my wife so I wasn't trying to make time, she just wasn't friendly at all.",,,
174,Victor G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,2/19/2017,"Came in for dessert and a beverage,waited 10 minutes just to be greeted, another 10 just for our drinks. When we received our drinks, there was no napkins at our table, since the waitress wAs no where to be seen, we went to the bar to grab napkins.. we went to the bar to get a refill of our drinks, and the waitress still had not come by. Terrible experience, will not comeback again",,,
175,Heidi Z.,"Azusa, CA",3,30,1,4.0,6/30/2014,"Good drinks, great service, great location (next to subway, near Times Square).  All they need is a few more appetizer selections.  Good selection of draft beer and the prices are reasonable.",1,,

181,John G.,"Winchester, VA",0,6,0,4.0,1/6/2016,"Dropped in for lunch, as they are so near the theaters and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Distinctive sandwiches (apples In the grilled cheese!), excellent chowder, good service. A great find down here where there are so many dull tourist traps.",,,
182,Chris N.,"Sacramento, CA",212,440,120,4.0,10/28/2013,"After growing tired of the chaos in Times Square, we needed to find some food... preferably somewhere that wasn't a chain restaurant or packed with people. This place worked out well. Nice atmosphere and decent prices. Fairly quiet compared to the rest of the area. The grilled cheese caught my eye, and it was solid. Several TVs had baseball going, and there was a pretty good sized bar, though it seemed like more  of a restaurant. Overall it was a good local restaurant that was worth the 1 block walk away from the chaos of Broadway.",2,,1
183,Drew S.,"New York, NY",40,89,73,4.0,7/24/2015,"This place is so good!! I came here with a coworker for lunch because we were looking for a casual place close to the office where we could sit outside. They don't have outdoor seating but they have those open floor length windows where you are pretty much outside. I expected the food to be nothing more than decent bar food. But it was actually so delicious. I ordered the plain organic green salad - it came with these large fried balls of goat cheese - YUM. Then they put these sautéed pears in it along with some nuts for crunch and i ordered mine with shrimp which was cooked perfectly and really soft. The dressing on the salad was a citrusy vinaigrette that was strong enough to add a perfect tang, but light enough that it didn't distract any of the other flavors. I definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner.",,,1
184,Joanne L.,"Douglassville, PA",0,60,1,3.0,11/11/2015,Were here for Sunday brunch before a show. Good beer and fries. Sandwiches okay. Disappointed with omelettes and Bloody Mary. Will try somewhere else next time in the city.,,,

No big deal. Then we sat waiting for waters and someone to take our order for 25 minutes. The food did come out quickly though, and was decently good (and relatively cheap for NYC, ~$12 per entree). I doubt I'll be back -- West End was nothing special.",,,
192,Alex N.,"Red Bank, NJ",3,23,126,2.0,10/1/2015,"The staff was super accommodating. We got stuck in traffic coming in and when we finally made it there we were able to be seated right away.If you go on Sundays, please note that they will only give you the Brunch menu. We started with the Executive Bloody Mary. They had a new bartender and that meant we had no old bay on the rim nor did we have any Blue Cheese in our Blue Cheese olive. It does come with a very nice slice of bacon. Just beware, if you like your Bloody with a lot of flavor, this is NOT the Bloody for you, though it they make it with Sriracha, which gave it a nice little kick.I had the burger which was actually quite good; juicy, with thick bacon on a soft bread which wasn't sweet (always a plus). The fries were meh... My boyfriend had the french omelet which in his own words was ""OK"" and a side of BBQ pulled pork hash, which was very sweet. He did have flank steak which was excellent.The staff was nice, but the food was just meh...",,,
193,Joanna C.,"ASTORIA, NY",463,706,277,3.0,1/23/2012,"It was a super cold winter day, and my sister and I were looking for a place to grab a quick bite before going to watch Wicked only a block or two away! We were headed towards a random Yelp app choice, but it got way too cold to hold my phone with my bare hands, so we ducked into the first acceptable looking place, which ended up being the West End Bar!We got seated pretty quickly, and we soon had drinks in front of us. We both ordered the crab BLT(? Or was it the crab club?) I forget, it was a sandwich with bacon and crab meat in it, which was really good!!Stay away from desserts here (because we really should have known better than to order it here), as our ""lava cake"" came out ice cold and lava-less.Service was attentive at first, but it took some time for us to find her to get the check near the end. It also took a good 15 minutes for our cold lava cake to come out of the kitchen (I think they were trying to defrost the poor sad mound of dry cake).",,,
194,Jay B.,"New York, NY",0,31,46,4.0,5/29/2012,"Great value for brunch and some of the best french toast I've ever had.  I usually don't get french toast, but I ordered it at West End and it was great.  It comes with two giant slices of bread and more than enough apple-butter-syrup on the side.  At only $11 it's a solid value.  The only part of the meal that wasn't worth it was the orange juice.  It tasted like OJ from the carton, or even from frozen concentrate.  But the great meal, the good service, and the nice decor made up for it.",,,

196,John S.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",41,37,62,2.0,3/26/2016,"Came for brunch - it looked nice and the reviews are good but maybe brunch is a mistake. The menu looks interesting - I ordered an omelette with chorizo, bacon and avocado and coffee - I sat at the bar. One waitress who was pouring drinks, taking orders. The coffee took ten minutes to arrive. The omelette was cooked plain and was wrapped around the bacon, chorizo and avacado. It was a bit cold and the fillings didn't taste fresh and felt like they'd be in the refrigerator for a few days. There was a side of chipotle hash which sounds but looked and tasted like dog food. I couldn't eat it. The bartender never asked if everything was ok and didn't enquirer why half my meal was uneaten. Toast was excellent and the coffee delicious when it eventually came. The menu really looks great and maybe I had one bad experience- it was my last brunch in New York before going home and it was memorable for all the wrong reasons",1,,
197,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,3.0,3/4/2013,"I normally don't expect much from the cookie-cutter pubs/sports bars in and around the bustling, touristy Times Square area, but West End Bar & Grill is a surprising and new recent discovery. I came here after work with my husband and his friend to grab some drinks and catch sports games on TV, and the experience was overall very pleasant and positive from the moment we stepped in to the moment we stepped out. Prior to coming to West End, we went to a bar a few blocks away, but it was much too loud to hold a conversation. This place was perfect in terms of the noise level; no crazy dance music blaring or an overflow of rowdy crazy people.  A bit generic in appearance on the inside, it's still a somewhat new and spacious bar that provides plenty of bar and table seating.First, the bad thing about West End is that like most bars around this part of town, the happy hour is limited, but they do have a good selection of drinks/beers. Their service and their food was a pleasant surprise. Our waiters were very nice, sociable and friendly and asked if we needed anything without us having to wave for them constantly. They supplied us with extra napkins, refilled our cups of water, asked if we needed more drinks, etc. without making it a hassle. It got a bit more crowded around 9pm and after, but this place was still much more quiet and roomy than most other bars nearby. The food was unexpectedly really good. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, and it was more than enough to share amongst three people. We had the Short Rib Spring Roll, Steak Tacos, Veggie Quesadilla, and Greek Flatbread. It was all presented nicely and came rather quickly post ordering. The Steak Tacos and Spring Roll were my favorites. The taco came with a ton of tender meat inside. The Spring Roll was extra crispy on the outside and came packed with tasty shredded short rib meat. They were all great appetizers, so it makes me wonder how their entrees are. The menu for entrees though is quite small and limited.Overall, a very positive experience at the West End Bar in terms of both food and service. It's a great place to stop by after work if you are looking for a venue that is a little less noisy/crowded than your typical midtown pub. If you are hungry, definitely give the appetizers a try.",3,,
