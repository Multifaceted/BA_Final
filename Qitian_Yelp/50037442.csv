0,Melissa V.,"New York, NY",693,138,516,4.0,10/26/2018,Perfect place for drinks with a big group! I came down here with some of my friends from Columbia and I really appreciated how conducive this environment was to large gatherings. They had a lot of indoor picnic style tables and cheap happy hour drinks. You get the perks of affordability in a really upscale looking place. I would recommend the grapefruit IPA ($5 during HH) and the pretzels - the cheese sauce was pretty bomb.,,,
1,Randy C.,"Woodinville, WA",60,418,62,1.0,11/9/2018,"Worst service I've ever had! As a matter of fact, we coined a new phrase, ""west ended"" as in, boy that service was bad, but at least we weren't ""west ended""! Sunday night, after waiting 20 minutes for our ""server"" to saunter by we ordered, sliders, pretzel, and tots. Tots came out 1st, quick and hot. 20 minutes later the pretzel comes out, not so hot but whatever. After another 20 minutes our server tells us the sliders are on the way. 10 minutes later, from my table, I order a pizza from Mama's too, we cancel the sliders, ask Mr Happy for the tab and go get our pizza.Walking by 2 days later in the morning, I see a 1/2 open box of ""fresh"" pretzels sitting outside the door. SEE PHOTO!Hard pass!!",,,
2,Steve A.,"Hilliard, OH",852,1390,1959,3.0,10/15/2018,West End Hall has an excellent selection of beer. It probably has the best selection on the Upper West Side. There's lots of local breweries on tap. Prices aren't too outrageous. The craft beers are priced comparatively well. I had a Five Boroughs Hoppy Ale. It's not overwhelmingly hoppy. This is about $7 for a pint. It's pretty crisp and tastes clean. There are also local selections from around the city including Brooklyn Brewery and Coney Island. As for the food it's just typical stuff you can get from a bar. Skip it. It might be the best bar in this area of Broadway. It has the biggest beer selection. The bar also has lots of TVs.,,,
3,Danny H.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,3.0,9/7/2018,"I've been to the West End Hall maybe 3 or 4 times. They have a good selection of beer on tap and a limited menu consisting mostly of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers. Burgers are juicy and tasty, but there's no information about where the meat comes from so my guess is it's industrially grown feedlot beef.On most occasions, I've found the music and overall sound level to be oppressively loud, making it hard to talk. At least in the evening in the summer, this place is very much a party scene.I saw the Mexico-Germany game of the 2018 World Cup at this sports bar and was very disappointed. The TVs are big and numerous but relatively low quality. All the indoor seating is on benches at long tables, which means there's not much you can do to adjust your seat if you don't happen to be directly facing a screen. That means that the odds of having to watch in a twisted position are pretty high.The staff is hit or miss.",2,,
4,Scott B.,"New York, NY",8,171,204,5.0,3/8/2018,"Beer garden style picnic table seating with lots of beers to choose from. The food was really good. They have an outdoor area but it wasn't​ open when I​ went in the winter.Tried the wings and nachos. Wings were nice and big and had a great flavor. We did half of the two current flavor available, buffalo and bbq. Came with a giant boat of ranch which is worth a star all on its own in NYC.The nachos we more than enough for 4 people and held their own with all the toppings. Served on a sheet pan so you know there's​ a lot.19 taps of beer and 10+ bottles​ and cans so there is a brew for anyone.Can't wait to roll through​ during the summer and check out the outside. Tons of TV's for sports viewing. A must stop for beer gardens in NYC.",,,
5,Mar R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,49,3,2.0,11/18/2018,"Food was ok. Service was bad. We were one of the only tables in there and the waiter was not attentive. We had 4 empty water pitchers and it took several minutes to get his attention. They charged a 20%tip because we were a large group, least they could do was come by.",,,
6,Holly S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",110,160,116,4.0,6/20/2018,"My boyfriend and I went for happy hour and early dinner and we had a good time. The burgers are super cheap ($9-11 plus $2 for fries, sweet potato fries, or tots) and the veggie burger I had was actually the best I've ever tasted. It fell apart easily but was so delicious I didn't even mind. The sweet potato fries were awesome too.They have a rotating selection of about 20 beers on tap and the variety is great... everything from IPAs to stouts to sour beer. There is a selection of beers available for $5 during happy hour (3-7pm weekdays) plus some house wine and well drink specials as well. Service at the tables could have been better but I'll be back nonetheless.",,,
7,Michele B.,"San Antonio, TX",305,128,372,3.0,1/13/2018,"Location: West End is located off of 106th and Broadway. It has a large open area suitable for many people and has a pretty chill, laid back vibe. They've got board games to play at request, so my friends and I had a connect four tournament. There are tons of flat screens, so we were able to watch the football games anywhere we were located in West End. Service: When we first sat down, no one came to greet or acknowledge any of the tables we were at. We did come in a fairly large group, but we sat waiting for someone to come by for well over 20 minutes. Many of the people I came with ended up going to the bar to order their drinks. We didn't get water until we had been there for 30-45 minutes. We were there to socialize with one another so we took care of what we needed at the bar. Because I was quite hungry, I asked a waiter if he could come and take our order. He said we needed to go to the bar because he can't split checks, which is fine but I would have loved to know that way beforehand. The service took this place down a notch, but I was still really excited to try the food. Food: We ordered the American burger with fries, cauliflower buffalo wings, a quesadilla, and nachos. Unfortunately, I was only able to get pictures of the quesadilla and cauliflower wings (pictured below). The nachos were a huge portion and was tasty. The portion could definitely serve 2 for a light meal. The nachos are topped with melted cheese, black beans, guacamole, and jalapeños. The burger definitely left something to be desired. It was overdone, overly charred, and had zero flavor. I was only able to eat a few bites. Which is really unfortunate because burgers are my jam. The fries were fantastic, though. As for the cauliflower wings, they were tasty. They didn't have any distinguishing features or anything of that sort. The quesadilla also was standard. It didn't have anything to remember. It was bland, but it did its job. All in all, I gave West End 3 stars for the overall experience.",,,
8,James C.,"New York, NY",0,16,11,2.0,9/23/2018,"One of my favorite places to go because of atmosphere and the wait staff.  However, management has let this place go with the quality of the televisions and projectors. Hard to call yourself a sports bar when every tv is a different color. Hope to see improvement.",,,
9,Justin R.,"New York, NY",308,17,1,3.0,8/23/2018,"I've always wanted to go here cause it's fairly new, there's not a lot of great food around, and looks like a nice hang from the outside.  Here are my thoughts.  Food- I got fish tacos.  BANGIN!   My gf got a burger.  GREAT!Drinks- a beer place.  Good selection.  If you like beer you'll like it.  Service.l-  they were super nice and the hostess even let me put my bike inside.   But..... took too long to take order and bring it out.  Ambiance- here's the bad news.   Music is god awful and LOUD!  Like the worst pop song put to a loud techno remix.  Everyone in the place is yelling over the music.  I literally won't go here cause of loud BS in my ear.   I'm not asking for Mozart.   Just sayin.  Pick something a little ummmm. Better.  Or at least keep it down.",,,
10,Lamarr H.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",1,61,52,3.0,8/25/2017,"I give them a B-, what saved them was the outlets hidden behind the seats against the wall, the really cool ambience, childhood games(battleship, connect four etc) and the music and crowd was really nice..Food: was great!! I ordered Buffalo cauliflower, angus sliders, dynamite tots. The best thing was the Buffalo cauliflower, everything was good but nothing out the ordinary. Tip: 3-7 weekdays these items are $5 and they have select Beer/Wine and all well drinks for $5. Awesome deal!! Service: the time was about 5pm, it was slow and picked up a little on the outdoor area, but they are slow to acknowledge people and come to tables. The food came out fast though :-) also, overall I feel the staff need more training and better awareness as servers and bar staff-- there should never be a person sitting with a empty beer class at your bar while you chat up what seemed like regulars, you should always have your bar on lock; especially when you're not having any type of rush. Speaking of said behavior, the Dominican looking guy basically stayed planted at this one couples bar slot and passively ignored other patrons til he couldn't lol it's so unprofessional. The staff wandered around and you couldn't seem to get their attention forever and didn't know what their role was-- It was so frustrating. You also should never have time to text and chuckle by the register while you have folks seated and at the door looking for service. -_-  I understand being a laidback bar, but service and sales is what keeps you open, right?",2,,1
11,Claire B.,"Manhattan, NY",34,103,18,3.0,10/17/2018,"No WiFi and TVs were too loud to have a conversation inside. Points for serving food late night but the food is very typical sports bar fare (heavy and lacking in flavor...I had the fried buffalo cauliflower which was drenched in the buffalo sauce, I could barely taste anything but spice).",,,
12,Jen N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",254,9,3,3.0,9/8/2018,"Grabbed breakfast with a friend, the place was relatively empty but the service was extremely slow from getting our order in to recovering our food and our check. The staff was kind though.",,,
13,Jolene H.,"New York, NY",7,135,51,4.0,2/10/2018,"Happy to live across the street! But wouldn't go out of my way for the place. I've been a few times, with friends, to watch a game and drink. Love the open area with community-styled seating and the buzz of chatter. Feels like a non-intimidating version of a cafeteria! Ordered pickup through Eat24 a few hours ago. Cheeseburger and bacon burger, both rare, both with fries (only $2 extra!). I called 30 minutes after ordering to check and see if it was time to brave the cold for our burgs. The first employee I inquired with had no idea what my order was and abruptly passed me on to another employee, who was just as uninformed. Apparently, West End no longer accepts orders using Eat24. I'll just call this an unfortunate oversight - by more than one party. Still, the manager, Carlos, was kind enough to rush my order as a courtesy. It was ready within 15 minutes. Cheers! The burgers were both very well-executed. Cooked perfectly rare, very thick, and had a nice spice to the seasoning. The buns were thin and squishy, which I prefer, but can appreciate that some like those fluffy or heartier sorts. Fries were a hit as well! Crispy but not oily. On the thicker side and rustic, with the potato-peel on and heavy seasoning. I really liked that they were long (perfect for dipping). Not blown away by the meal, but certainly pleased. Will definitely run across the street sometime soon for another round.",3,,8
14,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,484,1951,3.0,6/24/2017,"For the first time in a long time my group and I received decent service here.  Three out of ten times that I have ended up here the service was unbearably slow and not at all friendly.  I am extremely glad to see a ton of diverse (and New) employees who were a huge improvement to prior experiences.  This time around we were actually able to enjoy ourselves and focus on the purpose of our get together despite the rainy, gloomy weather.The decor is rustic and their backyard patio is very comfortable, welcoming and makes you feel at ease.  The patio also hosts its own bar (although not always open), as well as games like shuffleboard and giant Jenga. However, table service in this area was the weakest link so sit in this area when not in a rush. The place and the restrooms are well maintained and clean.Notable mentions in regards to the food are: the fried cauliflower, truffle french fries, vegetable quesadillas, BBQ/hot wings and their sliders/cheeseburgers.  Their food is pretty solid but it plays second fiddle to the large selection of beers and cocktails.  While the bar doesn't specialize in any liquor, it certainly has a decent amount of selections available.If service were up to this level each and every time, this place can easily reach its potential.  It seems there is a new manager in charge, and this has definitely made an excellent difference.  I am glad that they improved in order for me to finally be able to write a positive review.",13,5,9

19,Brittany J.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,3.0,7/5/2018,"Food is good and the space is pretty good as well. Big open space with lots of tvs. Great place to watch sports and they play all the games. The prices aren't terrible for a beer garden in manhattan. The outdoor games are cool as well.The only negative thing here is the service. The staff is young and clueless. I was given 3 different answers, by 3 different people.They charged someone else's tab on my CC and when confronted I was ignored. (Definitely bring cash to this place and don't pay with CC)",,,
20,Andy D.,"New York, NY",16,42,1,1.0,4/1/2018,"We came in... three parents and our four kids... 4pm on Easter Sunday. We sit in the front at one of the communal tables. My friend asks one of the servers if she would mind lowering the music a touch (it was blasting lame 90s hard rock). She kindly lowered it. Then things got weird. The ""manager"" marches over to the music system and cranks it back up. He comes over to our table and asks us if we still want to order. We ask him about the volume... and he starts to get visibly angry - like aggressive - and says ""those two in the corner like hard rock and this is a bar."" They were both on their laptop. He said ""I can't make everyone happy and if I turn it down those two will be upset...what am I supposed to do""... blah blah blah. What a joke. To the owners - this is the UWS. Know your lane and appreciate the neighborhood where you operate. You could crush it... but you aren't...  and at this rate you'll end up like your predecessor in no time. Good luck.",1,,

The beer selection is nice and the wait staff was attentive and quick with serving us. We ordered the Teriyaki wings, sliders, and large pretzel. The pretzel and wi ha we're awesome but the sliders were lackluster and I probably wouldn't order them again. I am excited to come back and explore both the beer and food menu more!",,,
22,Shannon C.,"New York, NY",4,40,3,3.0,4/7/2018,"Food is pretty good, but some things are overpriced. (The $14 Cobb salad, for example, is about a 5:1 ratio of romaine lettuce to toppings -- although shame on me for ordering a salad at a bar). A cheeseburger and fries is $12, though, and pretty tasty. Also, the music is WAY too loud! Fun atmosphere for a bar but not so much for dinner. They have board games! And 90s pop music. It's cool if you don't mind the noise.Minus a couple points also for mistakes in the order. But again, it's a bar mostly! Don't let the number of low tables fool you.",,,

I've been to this place many times and I have to say that today was the best experience I've had. We absolutely loved our waiter Keith. He was very attentive and knew what he was doing. He recommended a vegetarian dish for my friend that she absolutely loved. He found a beer for my mom who usually doesn't like the taste of beer. He was just great.

My friend were about to go inside to get drinks today at 1:00am (a group of Hispanics) but the waiter(or the manager which he called himself, but i doubt he was) told us that they were closed and no longer serving. However, a group of white people came in and sat down at the tables and got drinks. We argued with the waiter and he told us if we dont like it, we can get the fuck out and he doesnt wamt our money.

26,Monique R.,"Brooklyn, NY",899,907,538,4.0,11/15/2017,"Was in the area meeting a friend for happy hour and the pub we were at was not up to snuff so thanks to the handy Yelp App, we found this place had an early happy hour and was very close to where we already were.The happy hour menu had $5 apps and $5 drinks. An extensive beer menu had us all starting with beers. I had the schofferhofer (grapefruit) beer which was nice followed by a mule which tasted like gingerale (not a bad thing) and then when we were looking to up the ante, we asked what well vodka was being offered for the night. Due to a surplus in their stock, they were serving top shelf vodka for well vodka prices. Our hearts soared and we began ordering doubles with happy hour slated to end in an hour. The downside however, was our drinks took a very long time to come out.The food came out at lightning speed. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. The chips and guac were just okay- I would probably not order them again. The Fried Chicken sliders were great with a soft bun, hot sauce and cole slaw. The bourbon wings were my favorite. The monster fries were awesome. The burger was not terrible. Overall, this was a great place to end up on a random friday evening. Its way off the beaten path for me but if i am ever in the neighborhood again, i will be making a visit.",6,,4

Because we were watching the game, we didn't allow that to bother us too much. When we received our food, it was cold. The waitress (while having somewhat of an attitude) was open to my feedback about my food and had one item remade. To make matters worse, I had also ordered a beer which arrived well after I received my food. The service was so poor that other patrons we outright complaining in the establishment.

I tell him "" how do you know if we have ordered?"" he ignores me and smerks. I let the bartender know, he agreed it was wrong.

Updated review","I used to really enjoy this place. Their prices have spiked so I haven't been much in the last couple months. Saw an Instagram promoting their half off tacos for Tuesday. Walked in and sat down, asked the waitress (who previously ignored me when I tried to get her attention TWICE and we sat there for 15 mins waiting for water / menus) and she scoffed at me and said I was at the wrong place. Showed her the post and she asked one other worker who said ""I don't know"" and she turned around and said it was next Tuesday... but it's posted every Tuesday on instagram. She came back once throughout the whole night despite me trying to get her attention and was consistently rude.

So we headed to the back to go outside and a waitress comes up behind us as we were WALKING (I just want to emphasize that because we were moving, not loitering taking up space, i was following his lead, walking down the hallway to go outside, normal stuff) anyways this waitress comes up behind us and literally says with the nastiest attitude ""YOU GUYS GOTTA MOVE"". For starters an excuse me would suffice. Also.. it was a Thursday at 6pm the place was not at ALL crowded, she was walking around stressed like she was a bartender at the 40/40 club on a Friday. Clearly she needs some training if she's that flustered to serve three tables. We looked around outside after that, and she glared at us multiple times outside... then back inside as we were leaving... not quite sure who peed in her orange juice this morning but an attitude like that will ruin a beautiful business. We didn't even bother getting a table and spending our money, I would never pay to get that treatment.",,,

I felt compelled to write a review after a recent visit. The staff are always accommodating, the manager is AMAZING, and the energy is always good.Recently, a disgruntled gaggle of 40 something year old parents decided to bring a small wagon-load of children to a bar for lunch and began complaining about service and music volume. The foppery of this sad group (kids excluded) was screaming out in testament of what had likely been weeks of apartment imprisonment being taken out on the venue's staff. West End, keep doing your thing, we'll keep coming back. Peeps with kids, please join but don't ruin the vibe, it's a BAR.",,,
45,James D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,0,3.0,4/25/2018,It's ok. Sometimes the music drowns  out the conversation. And sometimes the bartenders are preoccupied with whatever to give you a second look.  But during off hours it is worth a visit.,,,

47,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,3.0,9/10/2015,"So we were meeting a friend on the UWS and she recommended we try this beer garden establishment.  Our friend told us this was restaurant or underneath new management .   From the outside it has a very inviting appearance.  Very open space, community tables, and outdoor seating.  We were able to seat ourselves and selected the outdoor table and it was only three of us including myself.  It took a while for someone to acknowledge or even bring us water.  But I assumed it was because they allow people to seat themselves.  Once our server came over to us he realized we didn't have water he pretty much passed the buck and let us know someone forgot to do their job.  We ordered drinks and one thing I did LOVE is that they have my fav grapefruit beer and he recommended doing a vodka bomb with it.  WHICH I LOVED and had three of them during the duration of the time being there.  We also ordered food as well.  I ordered the quesadilla which was decent but the guac it came with is what sold me on it.   My friend order the burger and she said she enjoyed it but nothing special.  Our server wasn't super knowledgeable about the menu but tried to play it off like they change the menu alot.So you are probably saying why would I only give this place 3 stars?????Well our server pretty much disappeared after a certain time and we always had someone NEW at our table like every 10-15 minute clearing our table. Like literally every 10-15 mins.  I almost felt like we were being rushed out  Like someone would come over and take like one or two items at a time.  New servers were at our table and I almost thought our server must have left for the day.  I think they need to work on communicating among their staff a tad bit moreI am going to give this place one more try in hopes that the service is better next time....maybe.",3,2,2

Their spacious beer garden and great happy hour deals (draft beers and appetizers) make for an ideal place to go after work or classes.

They have speciality beers and their pitches are old school style. I had their chicken sliders that are on the appetizer and it was so good.

The place was rather empty. We sat a picnic table for 8 people. The waiter took a while to greet us and get our drinks.  I had the refreshing Schöfferhofer Hefeweizen & Grapefruit non-beer.  It has a 2.5% ABV, a crisp fruit taste, sweet malty finish, and the perfect summer drink.  After downing this, I had the Brugse Zot, which is a Belgian Pale Ale with a heartier 6.00% ABV. It was hazy amber color with notes of lemon, spice, and low carbonation. We had some appetizers.  The Buffalo Cauliflower with Hot Sauce and Bleu Cheese sounded interesting but was very mediocre.  The Corn Fritters were crunchy and tasty.  The Loaded Fries were by far the best thing here. The freshly cut potatoes were fried to crispy perfection. Then they were loaded up with fresh tomatoes, spicy-ish Chorizo, creamy Queso Fresco, Sriracha, and a Sunny Side Up Egg. The combination was splendidly decadent. I ordered a Med-Rare Burger as well.  The bun was a generic but fluffy. The burger was cooked medium. It was juicy, fatty, and packed well.  The Thick Maple bacon was as sweet as advertised.  The shredded lettuce was delightful because it has this nostalgic Burger King feel to it.  Plus it captures more mayo within its folds.  The Tomato was wedge cut which was a novel but makes sense since the tomato was fresh on the softer side.  The red onions were thinly cut. The cheddar was super melted. The Burger was filling and good.Overall, I liked the place but the slower service and lack of value puts this place in the three star range.",,,1

Super chill vibes all around, great variety of drinks to choose from.3. Watched some of the home run derby, explored the beer list and demolished the bacon cheeseburger. Thick cut bacon and a juicy burger. Great selection of beer too.4. Brunch-got the huevos rancheros and sat in the garden area out back. Huevos were phenom and I hear the fish tacos are great too.

So u walk in and it's kinda confusing because they don't have a hostess. You're free for choose any table and grab your own menu on the way in. When we walked in we kinda stood there and a guy in the back said, sit anywhere u like. Which we did then I realized the menus were in a box by the door.  Ok so I go back and get them.... We were served water and told our waitress would b here shortly. Hmmm... She kinda took a long time and wasn't the most outgoing or friendly person. Either way she was effective10 for the food!!!!

Wtf!! It wasn't like we were hanging around after the game. This was literally in the middle of the game!!Listen if you as a bar don't want to stay until the end of a World Series game, and provide drinks during it that's totally fine.

If the food had been great, I'd have thrown in an extra star, but unfortunately that was mediocre. I had a soggy burger and weird fries.Lame all around.

Every one in my group left full and tipsy and incredibly happy. We didn't even get to enjoy the garden since it was a bit cool but couldn't have asked for more from what was available inside.

69,Kanika H.,"New York, NY",74,195,6,1.0,9/19/2016,"I made reservations for Sunday brunch with my meetup group.  The reservations and confirmation were easy peasy...My group begins to arrive for brunch, and this triology of hot mess occurs:- Firstly, we were told that West End Hall doesn't do separate checks, which is ridiculous considering the size of our group.  Some of us were paying with cards, others cash and since we were a meetup group, there would be people who would be arriving late/leaving early.  I asked if perhaps some of us can order at the bar so they can have their own tabs.  Their response: ""No, if you order at the bar, you have to eat at the bar.""  Only...at the end to find out that save two other guests and myself (who shared one tab because we were the first to arrive), they did separate checks for everyone else.  This was never communicated to me @ all.- The staff are the most clueless I've ever seen...every time I ask a question, even if it's a simplified inquiry (ie- ""Does this place have a hostess?  I didn't see one at the front door.""), I get a deer-in-headlight stare before they respond ""I don't know.  Let me ask my manager"" or a rather curt reply. Really now? -_-- The place is OVERRUN WITH LOUD, OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN!  They were so noisy that my group could barely carry a conversation.  If I wanted to be surrounded by that many kids, I'd dine @ Chuck E. Cheese or McDonald's...not a bloody beer garden!The food wasn't bad, as was the mimosas (which aren't bottomless, but still pretty inexpensive @ $5/pop).  But considering that one experience, I definitely would not come back here again, which is a shame because I wanted to try the truffle burger.",4,4,
70,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,8/15/2015,"When I heard that Five Lamps had closed, I wasn't upset in the slightest. Sub-par drinks, sub-par service, all together underwhelming. When I heard its reincarnation was a bright, lively beer hall, I was wary but couldn't keep my curiosity at bay. After visiting West End Hall on Friday, I can happily say that in this case, the second time's the charm.So I came here with a friend at around 8:30 on Friday. It was fairly full but still a decent amount of seating to choose from (you seat yourself here). This place does a great job with maximizing space--large tables and plenty of 'em. There's a friendly vibe here that I didn't get from Five Lamps. Light-washed wood, large, simplistic/industrial-looking light fixtures and communal drinking/dining style make this place wonderfully inviting.Because this place classifies itself as a beer hall, I might as well give a little synopsis of my beer drinking experience. I have to say, I was quite pleased with the menu. My experience may be different from that of many others though, because they currently have two Belgian triples on tap--which happens to be my favorite kind of beer. If that wasn't enough, they're also offering my favorite stout. I was happy to find that I hadn't tried either of the Belgian triples in my short time as a beer drinker, so I opted for the Tripel Karmeliet, which was full bodied without being too heavy. I will say that it took a questionably long time for us to receive our drinks, but it could have been worse.The fare here, as one would imagine, is upscale bar food. The entire menu looks so good that choosing what we wanted was a somewhat laborious process. We scanned and re-scanned the menu until we finally just decided that our hunger trumped our indecision....okay actually that was just my friend. I had to ask the waiter. I ended up ordering the fish tacos which were really really tasty. I don't think I was hungry enough to clean my plate, but I still did. Nothing particularly fancy about them--just grilled mahi mahi, some kind of slaw and chipotle mayo (one of the best food inventions to date--up there with bacon and every kind of cheese). But I'd absolutely recommend. My friend ordered one of their fancy schmancy hot dogs, which she scarfed down quickly as well--safe to say we were pleased. Lastly, we had an awesome waiter. He actually took a seat at our table to chat with us about beer, food, life, why bars close at 2am in other cities...you get the point. Other than our first round of drinks, everything was served and cleared efficiently. The UWS was desperate for a beer garden (the only place around the area with a comparable selection of beer is George Keeley's) and it finally got one!",8,4,5

Very random place for a beer hall, but apparently its where all the 20-30 year old on the upper upper west side congregate.Very large tables, there are tables on the sidewalk and a large courtyard in the back. Its very loud, but hey its a beer hall.They have happy hour Mon-Fri until 7pm. 5 beers are $5, and also their buffalo wings, buffalo cauliflower, meatballs, and pork wontons.1. Their buffalo wings were AWESOME. 5/5. they were very crispy and juicy and just the right amount of heat!2. The Buffalo cauliflowers were dissapointing. 2/5. they were breaded and there wasn't much buffalo sauce. Its just...if you're getting cauliflower as an app...it shouldn't be so fried, kinda defeats the purpose.3. The pork wontons were so so. 3/5. They were fried wonton skins with pulled pork, some bbq sauce and a slaw on top. I wish there was more sauce4. Thai Mussels -4/5. pretty good, The sizes of the mussels varied greatly. some of the mussels were large and juicy and some were tiny. The flavor was good, and the toasted crispy bread they paired it with was perfect5. Southwest burger. Very very juicy with great guacamole. The siesta fries were very crispy (at least double fried) with salsa. 6. The hungarian bratwurst was GREAT. really good value at $8. It also came with 2 sides we got to choose from and came in cute little jars. The pickled onions had great flavor7. Grapefruit beer. at 2.5% is perfect for girls who don't like beer.

80,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,4.0,6/23/2016,"Ever wanted a beer hall right outside your apartment?  What a coincidence, so did I!  I now live right across the street from West End Hall and couldn't be happier.  I went to this place's predecessor years ago (Five Lamps) and the setup didn't change all that much.  They just added some chandeliers, new tables, dressed the place up a bit, added a FOOSBALL TABLE, and improved the beer selection (see below).  The backyard area remains in demand and is a great retreat from the city that is similar to what you might find at a bar around Prospect Park in Brookyn; this isn't common on the UWS which makes it more of an asset, evidenced by it constantly being crowded.  There is also a shuffleboard table back there now as well as an additional bar (not open for the season yet).  This is a place that gets crowded, but luckily it's big enough to handle the crowds.Service is friendly but the busboys that bring the food screw up a fair amount of the time.  I've observed this just the other day with a to go order someone else was getting, and I've had it happen to me first hand multiple times.  If you ask for a given doneness on a burger and your friend ordered a burger too with a different doneness, make sure you cut into it first.  The food here is not a large portion and it is too pricey for them not to get this right.  Luckily, when correct the food here is really good.  I've all of their beef burgers and my favorite is the South of the Border burger.  The truffle burger is also good but it's pricey at $18 I have to be in the mood for it since they really pile on the truffle flavor; it's not as overwhelming if you ask for just regular fries with it.  For the same price I can get the steak and cheddar hoagie, which includes skirt steak and veggies with homemade 'ale' cheddar.  I just had this for the first time awhile back and it may dethrone the burger as my go-to.  The fries themselves are freshly made and pretty good; dip them in the not-too-spicy chili sauce they include with ketcup/mustard and they're even better.  My girlfriend also likes the greek-themed chicken burger and really nobody I've come with has ever had a serious problem with their food.  Generally speaking outside of the busyboy issue, the food is good across the board here.The beer menu is actually pretty good for a beer hall.  There is a large volume of taps like most bars of this type, but there is always something interesting on tap worth trying; a lot of beer hall just select a bunch of accessible, wimpy beers and call it a day.  Here you might find a sour or 2, a bourbon barrel aged beer, or a really strong IPA among the options.  Top breweries like Founders and Evil Twin are mainstays.  At the moment they have Westbrook Mexican Cake on tap which is the 'beer of moment' in terms of beer geek popularity right now.  Of course the more accessible stuff is available too, including Weihenstephaner Hefeweiss and a variety of lighter IPAs.  They also have Schofferhofer Grapefruit Hefeweizen for those who'd rather just drink grapefruit juice with a slight amount of alcohol.  The bottle list goes much deeper, and while there is a lot of worthwhile stuff it is overpriced on average versus what's on draft.  Overall, this is my go-to bar in the area in terms of beer selection, food quality, and location.  I'm giving it 4 stars for the space itself and beer selection, and only 3 for the food.  They're going to be serving alcohol pre-12pm on Sundays now that the NYS law banning this changed (even if few other places observed it).  West End Hall has some areas for improvement but they've already done a lot since opening and are continuing to step it up.  Keep up the good work, guys.",1,,

If you come around 5:30 right after work, there are select $5 drafts, and it's pretty empty. At that point you can still grab any seat you want, and hear your date. I have to say that the decor here is nicer than most beer halls too. Definitely hit up the back patio during the warmer months; it's beautiful, spacious, and has its own bar. Beware to large groups, they will only let you split the check 4 ways, at the very end of your meal. If it wasn't for the subpar service, I'd give West End a 5. Come here for drinks and snacks, not dinner.",1,,
83,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1601,1308,3.0,8/21/2015,"West End Hall is the newest beer hall on the Upper West Side and enters the market with a good selection of brew and some pretty good food. The staff was ok, but very slow and forgot to take our order for nearly a half hour. They also forgot to trade out menus for brunch and for the beer list changes. The beer selection was good, obviously IPA heavy, but there were some good malty and wheat choices as well as a sour which wasn't especially sour. The brunch food was surprisingly good for a beer hall, particularly the fries. The truffle burger was luxurious enough to give me mild gout and the fries coated in truffle oil that came with it were just different enough to not be overpowering. The fries themselves were nice and thin but not overly crispy. The Hungarian Kolbase was good as well, though only comes as a side so is a small portion. The sriracha and chorizo fries, with an egg on top were funky and delightful. They were as pleasing to the taste buds as to the eye.A great option now in an area that needs some offerings like this.",,,
84,Ryan G.,"Manhattan, NY",212,3,0,2.0,4/15/2016,"Incredibly slow service considering the restaurant was fully staffed and slightly over half capacity. Food was satisfactory, but beer selection was weak. The biggest disappointment was the management. Some advice - Next time when a customer requests something, don't respond ""I'm doing other things and will get to it, when I get to it"". Standing outside while texting your pals after handing out tips to the staff is not a stop everything to get this done kind of moment... take it from some who has been in the food and beverage service industry for over 15 years. If you can't handle simple requests, let someone else do the job. All I can say is best of luck, just remember a bar no different from yours closed in this very same spot ;)The upside, our bartender!",2,,
85,Gerard B.,"New York, NY",1,25,0,1.0,4/30/2016,"Been there in person = not bad; encouraged to order online.Ordered on GrubHub = awful experience:The online menu was apparently incorrect. So, someone from the restaurant decided to call and interrogate me about the order.  ""How did you find that item on the menu? We changed the menu.""  I replied, ""It was on the menu. You should take this up with GrubHub.""  He insisted, ""we changed the menu a week ago. You must have placed a previous order, and that's why it came up.""Appropriately testily, I replied, ""I have never ordered from you on GrubHub. I did not order inappropriately.  This is an issue you need to take up with GrubHub, not a customer.  Take that item off my order; complete my order perfectly; and please deliver my order.""He acquiesced.  I confirmed on the GrubHub app that indeed I had in fact never ordered from West End Hall before.I called back a few minutes later, asking to take off the tip since without that particular menu item, the tip would be too high.  A kind bartender picked up and after I explained the issue, promised to put me in touch with the owner.Someone called back. It wasn't the owner.  It was someone who further interrogated me about my order, and who refused to take the tip off. AND who subsequently hung up on me when I insisted I would tip in cash if I felt like it upon delivery.I called back.  The kind bartender answered again.  He again promised the owner would call.  After some time, still no call back.How unprofessional! How rude!  Way to treat customers as less-than!  Way to displace upset with GrubHub on paying patrons!  Way to add insult to injury!Massively inconsiderate!  I expect the food to arrive covered in spit--that's how self-interested and dispassionste much of the staff seems.  Be careful when ordering from here--you might get both poor treatment and contaminated food...AND the food arrived (possible unsafe) with a charge for BOTH the item they don't have on the menu anymore AND the tip I asked them not to charge.Thank Jebus I called GrubHub, and they took control over this travesty and convinced the restaurant to correct their errors.  If it wasn't for GrubHub's authority, West End Hall would still be proverbially pooping all over my family's afternoon.Still no word from the owner.  Apparently, he also does not appreciate good customer service.  If the awfulness comes from the top, fair warning: that awfulness will accumulate down the line until it ends up chunky and distasteful in your food.Update: 8 hours later, one of the owners called.  I was putting my baby to sleep and respectfully said I don't want to talk about this anymore.  He insisted on talking about it.  No apology.  Instead, he started to make a case for how he doesn't deserve a poor review. I told him again I don't want to talk, and he hung up on me.Does the poor customer service ever end at West End Hall?  Apparently not! Read the other reviews: over and over, remarks about poor customer service!  Buyer beware!",1,,1
86,Y C.,"New York, NY",31,25,2,2.0,4/12/2017,"One of the worst meal experiences I've ever had, and keeping it PG-13, I'm including the time I found hair of suspicious length and thickness baked in my bread (another review for another day).  Did someone not show up to work?  The floor wasn't even half full but we spent more time trying (and failing) to flag our server and waiting for service than actually eating.  And when we finally *did* get to eat... Should've listened to the reviewers saying the burgers were dry because they were 100% right.  To the server's credit, she did try to make things better for us (have the kitchen redo the burger and partially comp us for the excruciatingly long meal) which is why I give them 2 stars instead of 1 star.  But I could've done much more enjoyable things with that time I wasted here, such as attempt to gouge my stomach out with a dull butter knife.  So no, I will not be coming back.",,,

I have never been disappointed. The food is so good, which I don't usually expect from Beer Gardens. Sometimes I come here for the food more than the drinks.

89,Nina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,37,12,2.0,4/14/2017,"I called in to order a veggie burger and sea salt fries for take out. Whoever I spoke to on the phone had an attitude that was completely unnecessary. When I walked in to pick up the food, it was ready and I was able to get in and out which was great. The part that wasn't great at all was what happened once I opened up my food. The burger and fries were there alright but the sriracha mayo, which was the entire reason I decided to get a veggie burger from there instead of elsewhere, was nowhere to be found on the burger or anywhere else. Because of the ingredients in the burger, it wasn't completely dry but it was dangerously close. And the fries. The fries were okay but who gives fries with no ketchup?? Those were the driest fries I've had in a while. With the overall phone service and quality of food, I won't be recommending this place or returning.",,,
90,Jay V.,"New York, NY",3,67,0,3.0,12/19/2015,"No complaints about this place, but no raves either. We were a party of four: For brunch I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was very good. I washed it down with a double hopped IPA. Beer at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon could never be bad and the combo was nice. The only complaint would be I ordered a side of the Hungarian Kielbasa, which was five bucks, and the portion was about 1/4 of a kielbasa link. It was made up of four micro thin slices and a tablespoon of shredded pickled onions. It was so tiny! Come guys, kielbasa is cheap and I'm sure you could do better. Other than that, they were slow enough to have ok service and everybody's food at our table was satisfactory.",2,1,1

94,Matt D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,1.0,12/2/2016,"Went here last night to grab a quick bite and a beer. Ordered the bacon cheese burger and an IPA. It took 30 mins for the waiter to bring me a flat beer, sent it back and then asked for another one. Then the waiter brought me a different beer that I asked for. Sucked it up and drank it because I didn't want to wait another half hour for a beer that would take any normal person 30 seconds to properly pour and serve.Bacon cheese burger came out cold and soggy without bacon about an hour after I ordered it. Sent that back and it returned 20 mins later with one shriveled piece of bacon and no cheese. Are you serious?Tried to talk to the manager but he was dismissive and kept disappearing on me. Nothing was comped, the waiter apologized but I heard nothing from nobody in charge. Bottom line, horrible service, horrible food, horrible management, and the bathroom floor of the men's room was covered in pee. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemies because nobody should have to go through what I went through.",2,,
95,Ashley B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,1,4.0,4/20/2017,"The spot has a nice feel. There are games to play at the table like battleship, uno, connect 4, and many more. I went during a late Sunday afternoon and it wasn't crowded, but this place gets packed late at night during games. They have lots of TV's set up around so its a good place to catch a game. They have tones of beers on tap, so if you like to try different beers this is a nice spot to go to. When I went I ordered the south of the boarder burger. It was very good and had a nice kick. It came with fiesta fries, which is just salted fries with fresh salsa on top. Eh, the salsa made the fries soggy and didn't add much to the flavor. It would have been better if there was just a dry seasoning or special southwestern dip for the fries, but I was still overall satisfied with my meal. The atmosphere of the place is very relaxed and is a good place to go and chill with friends or family. I will definitely be coming back.",,,
96,Evan H.,"New York, NY",314,781,44,4.0,12/30/2015,"I'm a big fan of west end hall -- both for dinner or brunch/lunch. What great thing about this place, other than the huge beer selection and good food is that it's very kid friendly.I've yet to come in beer garden season where the back area is open, but I look forward to checking that area out. The food is essentially upscale bar food, with some more ""bar"" favorites and then some things that are a bit nicer. I've enjoyed the salmon burger, fish tacos (just 3 tacos, nothing more), huevos rancheros, wings, and fries. The giant fresh pretzel is also delicious. The beer selection here is top notch. A lot of new places in this area claim to have a great tap selection, then proceed to have the same 7 craft brews that have been on menus since 2009. It's nice when places have tap takeovers and offer some more interesting selections. The bottle selection is also quality.In addition to all the above, this is a great place to watch a game. They do often seem to pull up the tv screens, so it's not just a sports bar.",1,,

98,Ellen C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,7,2.0,12/8/2015,"Disclaimer: This is not about the food but the service they offered.So I had two friends having their birthday dinners here in October and December, since I went to both, I had two kinda bad experience.The first time I was there, my drivers license was taken away by the waitress when I was ordering food, and couldn't get back until I paid the bill. I didn't know that was illegal until my friend told me they had no rights to have my ID. I was not even ordering an alcoholic beverage, and they didn't ask to SEE my ID but instead they took it away. I ordered some fries, and after waiting for half an hour, my friends at the other table suddenly asked, ""has anyone ordered fries?"" I said yeah I did, and she handed me a plate of fries that I ordered and said, ""sorry it's been here for a while, we didn't know who ordered this so we had a few."" I really don't know why the waitress served my fries to the wrong table, but when I took the plate, the fries were already cold like stone. I had to ask the waitress to heat those up for me. The waitress apologized with a smile.The second time I was there I ordered a beef dog, and asked for fries as a side to my plate. The waiter took my order and came back with a full plate of fries and charged me the price of the full plate. I asked him why weren't the fries in side size, he responded, ""we have this size only."" He didn't let me know when taking the order, which I don't know if is an act to charge more money. So that was awful.My friend who also went to the dinner asked the waiter to charge her phone, but when she was about to leave and asked for the phone back, the waiter couldn't even remember which phone he took and he asked her to go to take her one away. Overall the service is awful and not so considerate, I would never come back again unless the guy I have a crush on asks me to dine here.",1,,

108,David B.,"New York, NY",59,140,2,4.0,7/28/2015,"A new beer hall has arrived on the Upper West Side (maybe the only one?) and I checked it out a couple weeks ago.West End Hall features 30 bottled beer options and 20 draught beers and ciders on rotation. They have an eclectic menu that ranges from your more traditional beer hall sausages and bratwurst to pulled pork wontons, mussels, salads and Mediterranean spreads (think hummus, tzatziki, etc.). I can easily say that everything I tried was delicious, especially the pulled pork wontons and crab corn fritters.But what is most appealing about West End Hall is what you can't see. There is a secret backyard garden that feels like you¹ve entered into an undiscovered hidden gem on the Upper West Side. It's quiet, peaceful, relaxing and the perfect spot to spend a weekend afternoon hanging out with friends away from the traffic of Broadway.I recommend checking out West End Hall and enjoying this ""secret"" backyard beer garden before the rest of the neighborhood catches on!",1,,

114,Steph X.,"New York, NY",8,20,0,2.0,6/25/2015,"This place had a lot of potential, but I think they still have some kinks to sort out, particularly with the menu. Ambiance / decor was nice, although the stools used at the tables are pretty uncomfortable to actually sit in. We weren't sure, upon walking in, whether to seat ourselves or to wait for someone to come by, so we awkwardly stood at the entrance for 5 whole minutes before a server came by and said we could seat ourselves. Beer menu: it seemed like there were some good options, and I was really happy to see that they had two sour beers on the menu. Food: The food menu was ok and sounded really good, but the execution was poor. We ordered buffalo wings that were not really buffalo wings - they were clearly some sort of chipotle, house-made sauce (which was good!) but not buffalo. A simple fix would just be to modify the menu to reflect this. Portions were not great either.I ordered the beef burger (which is $14 on the menu, but we were charged $15. It wasn't worth bringing up to the waitress), which came with really delicious fries. The burger itself was small, like shake shack style, and gave me diarrhea, as I found out later that night. TMI? Too bad. My partner ordered the pork sausage, which which was tasty, but came out sad and by itself, sliced on the bias, on its own little cutting board. The sausage should have come on a bun, the housemade ketchup was waaayy too sweet, and what kind of beer hall doesn't have a soft pretzel on the menu? Overall - if you come here for a drink, it'll be fine, but avoid ordering food if you can!",1,1,

119,Lauren C.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",35,83,3,4.0,7/16/2015,This Beer Garden replaced Five Lamps which I only went to once. They have a very nice setup and a serious selection of craft beers with various different levels of alcohol. Out back they have a backyard of sorts with umbrellas and tables so it's a perfect place to have a few brews and kick back with friends.

Not busy on a summer midweek night and attentive service. I had an Equinox pale ale, sweet and sort of fruity. My friend had a more potent Belgian beer. Food was meh and more pricey than it should be: a $12 Chicago dog (a gussied up hot dog with no sides included with that price), decent fries with sea salt, and a bland Mediterranean spread plate (hummus, tzatziki, and a red pepper spread) with grilled pita strips. $60 with tip seems $20 too much for beer and snack food - even in Manhattan - but we wanted to try out this reopened beerhall in our 'hood.

123,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,3.0,7/27/2015,"West End Hall is still in its infancy; it's a step up from the former Five Lamps Tavern, but still needs room to grow. I have faith.The beau and I headed here for dinner one evening before heading out to the movies. Time was of the essence, and we were hoping to be in and out relatively quickly. We entered to what looked like the old Five Lamps, but with much better lighting and TVs embedded in mirrors along the walls. The beer draughts along the wall look so awesome and sleek! Upon entering, a sign told us to seat ourselves and grab our own menus. Easy enough. We did just that. It took more than five minutes before a server came over to us in a half-empty restaurant. Eh. We ordered, and...it took about 25 minutes for our food to come out. We had a very simple order, seemingly: A hot dog, a chicken burger, and a split order of fries with cheddar sauce. The burger was really on point! It was ground chicken with shredded greens, garlicky sauerkraut, and tzatziki sauce. It was fresh-tasting and surprisingly light. I would absolutely order it again. The fries with the cheddar sauce were also great. (If a restaurant has bad fries, I'll easily write them off. Haha.) The sauce had that perfect cheddar tang and a delightfully creamy consistency. The hot dog, however, the beau wasn't a full-on fan of. He liked it, but was a bit bemused by the $12 price tag for a hot dog, albeit loaded with mustard, relish, chili sauce, and onions. It came with no sides; my chicken burger, also $12, came with a side of fries. Admittedly, I'll agree that $12 is a bit steep for a hot dog, no matter how loaded it is.Service was friendly, but hit or miss still. I think they're still gaining their bearings, a bit.There was something about Five Lamps that turned me off, but I have much more faith in West End Hall. There are many more menu items I'm interested in trying, and I got a sneak peak of their outdoor beer garden: Beautiful! I'm sure West End Hall will gain its footing in the next few months, and I look forward to coming back and trying more food. I'm even more excited to sit in the beer garden while the weather is still warm!",,,
124,lizz s.,"New York, NY",131,15,0,5.0,8/26/2016,"I visited West End Hall with my sister last week and really loved it.  The restaurant is bright, welcoming and decorated so well.  There's ample sidewalk seating the front as well as a huge garden in the back.  The food was presented well and tasted great.  We ordered the Veggie Burger, Buffalo Cauliflower, a giant pretzel and the fries with Sriracha and a fried egg.  Out of all of them the the burger and the cauliflower were our favorite!  Their beer list is also fantastic.  Lots of awesome rotating craft with something for everyone.  We will definitely be back to West End Hall again soon!",,,

Lots of craft beer options - I had to drink cider because of my gluten thing, but it was really good! Also had a yummy cocktail.The food is amazing. We started off with mussels, which were great and finished with burgers. We'll have to return for sausages, since it is a beer hall.Tara was an attentive and friendly server! She was great!",,,1

I went three times and each time bad experience, Recently I went with a friend to have one drink and there was only two customers at the bar and one couple seating at the table and the staff were talking right next to us for almost 10 mins , after we got their attention, we order our drink and right where the register is behind the counter I saw a mice running, l told the bartender and the mice passed again across the counter disgusting!!

127,Alberto T.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,4.0,1/23/2016,Looking for place to eat Brunch on the UWS I finallygot a chance to try West End Hall on Broadway near 106 Street. Granted it was during a blizzard and I was one of three or four customers who braved the elements but that did not bother me since I have seen the place always crowded. I sat at the bar and was greeted pleasantly by Nikki (the bartender) who turned out to be a wonderful host. I asked her for a glass ofProsecco & a Brunch menu. After discussing some items I settled for the Salmon Eggs Benedict and a sideof Hungarian kielbasa sausage. The eggs were exceptional and were accompanied by a small side salad and tasty home fries. The kielbasa was delicious and was served with red onions and two kinds of ketchup (mild & hot) plus a tangy mustard. I finished everything with  first coffee  and then some Chamomille tea. I also was given a complimentaryMango Bellini drink which was a pleasant surprise.I had a great time.,1,1,2
128,Paul D.,"Manhattan, NY",3,18,0,4.0,7/30/2015,"The food is outstanding, especially the burgers. They always get it right. I ask for medium, they give me medium. That's a rare thing at most bars. It tastes like a burger I'd make in my backyard, but better - and less like a bar burger. Nice beer selection. I think there are A LOT of tables -- but the bar area is big, so I'm not complaining.It's a lot of dudes, though -- so maybe have a ladies night or something. The bartenders are nice but sometimes its a little confusing about what you ordered - maybe work on that? I shouldn't have to tell you what I ordered.",,,
129,D L.,"Bronx, NY",6,44,40,4.0,5/25/2016,"I've been to this bar twice prior to this evening. Each time I've had drinks here I've enjoyed myself. The ambience is laid back and allows for conversation. Expect to hear anything from Selena Gomez to Desiigner's ""Panda"" track. The volume of music here is pretty low so I wouldn't recommend it if you're trying to get your party on. The upside to that? You get to have some amazing conversations with old and new folks! I absolutely ADORE their rustic open garden in the back of the hall. The garden is intimate and enclosed by local buildings. The bar has done a great job at not making you feel like you're having drinks in the middle of a bunch of buildings by covering the buildings walls (about 15-20 feet high) with faux grass. This addition really adds to the vibe here. They have garden lights going across the garden area which only adds to the beauty at this back door open space. Do I recommend it for happy hour? If you're a beer aficionado, yes. The variety of drinks here isn't plenty when it comes to wine and/or cocktails. I ended up ordering Rose which was $9.00. They do have food specials here as well. Their wings are incredibly thick and juicy! Definitely a bang for your buck here.  Overall the place is so much fun. The place is very tidy which I pay close attention too anywhere I go. The service isn't bad and the wait time with food and drinks is pretty quick. The vibe is laid back here and it looks like people are just focused on having a nice time chatting it up with good company. I will continue to visit and tell others about my positive experience here. I definitely recommend it.",,,

The bartender was rude about our IDs and forgot our orders. The beers are overpriced and come in small servings. No steins? Only 2 German beers? In October? Just because you have long tables doesn't make you a beer garden.It really is just an overpriced bar. Won't be back.,5,1,1

142,C B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,8/10/2016,"Two stars for the drinks, which are good, well-curated and well-made, and the patio, which is lovely. Everything else was a debacle. Fish was chewy, like biting into a Madeleine and being transported to a grade school cafeteria. Our server was surly, even outright contemptuous--though I recognized other servers walking around that I knew and liked from other closed neighborhood spots. I guess we got the short straw when it comes to service. Really, the biggest shortcoming is being so pricy and so rude when the product isn't that good. I'd suffer abuse for a truly transcendent experience: this is not that experience. There are a handful of places in the neighborhood that offer a similar, but positive experience. I'll use my money at those establishments.",,,

My friend noticed though that the drinks were charged at full price!  When we asked the bartender she said the prices were correct, we asked for the manager and asked why our drinks were at full price during happy hour!  She muttered something and changed the bill!

(Ok, OK, I had the tots twice!)  The Siracha aioli for the tots are to die for.  I saw the fish and chips as a new main food, but will come back for that.My favorite thing about WEH is that they've bothered to have the food fit the beer.  I can always find food and beer that go together.  I had the steak hoagie and the stout on tap.  An easy place to have a drink and the food is really good!  Looking forward to good weather coming up this Sunday to hang out in the garden.  Who wants to be cooped up inside when it's beautiful outside?",,,

I don't get it.The crowd is usually composed of young professionals. Mostly attractive, but people usually come here in groups. Not really a place to hit on people or get picked up.They have board games as well.Why only three stars? Gets too crowded for the space sometimes and you'll have to wait. There aren't too many bars to spillover into in the area.The space doesn't really allow for mingling amongst other groups naturally. You'll look like a creeper. Challenge accepted?",,,

My friends had the chix burger and a hamburger which they too loved. Endless beer choices that apparently change daily and my favorite side bar was the free foosball table!

151,Alyshia G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,8/23/2015,"My husband and I are on a constant search for a regular bar. We like going out for drinks in the neighborhood at least once a week, and once we find a place we like, we'll go in the winter, spring, summer and fall for years. When our favorite local place closed recently (Lura), we began our search yet again. We've tried a few places and haven't quite found the right combination of a place that's nice to look at, comfortable, not too loud or quiet,  friendly and with good drinks.West End Hall seemed like it might be a good option. The inside and outside are lovely, and at least now while the Columbia students are still away, the crowd seems pretty mellow and not too obnoxious. We ordered the delicious sounding Sweet Collaboration cocktail from the menu, because, tequila. It tasted fairly nice, but didn't seem to have any tequila. When we ordered a second round, we mentioned something and the waiter came back with drinks he assured us had double the tequila. When we went home, 4 drinks at $12 a pop later, we were still stone cold sober. Probably the wine and beer can't be diluted and are great- the list looks great- but don't order the cocktails if what you're looking for is a cocktail.",2,,

No sign of goodwill or any gesture from the manager either. Few days later I discovered that, without informing me or my consent, they tipped themselves, as I left without the check knowing that prior to that I've cancelled my credit card. Short message for the waiter: a customer found my card on the floor next to the payment device and contacted me. Definitely your fault mate.",1,1,
158,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,3.0,8/15/2015,"I'm a little split on the review of this restaurant. Starting with the positives, the food was pretty good. We had an assortment of different foods but I would say our favorite part was the mussels - you can't find them in many places around Columbia and they were excellent. I've seen a few reviews mentioning the burgers but if that's what you're looking for then  go four blocks north to Mel's burger bar. My biggest problem with west side hall was that we kept seeing cockroaches around the restaurant. Yes, they are open to the sidewalk but I have never seen cockroaches in any other restaurant regardless of their seating arrangement so it was pretty disturbing. It's also slightly worrying because this restaurants predecessor had problems with rats before.",1,,

I can't remember one of the servers' names I had, but the second one I remember was Julia. She was prompt and friendly - that kind of restaurant experience where it's kind of like, they always show up right when you need them. Overall - all about it!",,,
160,Kelsey H.,"New York, NY",134,41,0,2.0,7/23/2015,"I was eager to try West End Hall since it opened a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. I expected a vibe similar to Bernheim and Schwartz up the street. West End hall, however, was much louder, with over 5 TVs placed closely together. I struggled to hear my partner across the (communal) table. Look, I don't like communal tables-never have, probably never will. I particularly hated West End Hall's tables because rather than at least give diners individual seats, they have wooden benches to share. Do you know how hard it is to get up from a bench when wearing a dress/skirt? I sadly now do. On the night my partner and I had dinner, they had no hostess on staff. A server told us to seat at a middle table, but didn't walk us there or provide menus. Eventually, we requested menus from a busy bus boy who only gave us one to share (I will say that the bus boys/food runners were really buzzing around, and this is not exactly ""their job""). After that, service only went downhill.  It took around 15 minutes for a server to come over to us and take our order, who then explained that she thought someone else had already come over. Whatever. I was too hungry to leave at this point and just wanted some food. Because my boyfriend was still full from his late lunch, we chose to only share an order of sliders and the crab and corn fritters, with the option to order more food later if needed. Each dish was $14-while I think this is a little steep for 3 sliders, it was actually insulting for 5 small fritters. Our server never came back except to clear plates when we were finished. The food was fine. The sliders were solid sliders, but had no special standout--the cheese was tasteless, the patty didn't burst with flavor, and I don't think there was any interesting sauce (if there was, it failed to do its job). Although I was still hungry after finishing up, I chose to leave rather than give West End Hall more of my money. I've had off nights at Bernheim and Schwartz too, but their food (and service) is decidedly better (try B&S's fried pickles! So good!)",1,,

It looks very similar to Five Lamps but the decor is a little more updated - looks more like a beer hall, which according to our waitress is what they were going for! That brings me to our waitress - she was awesome! So friendly. She mentioned they would be offering outdoor seating come July. They also have a beer garden out back!

The chef doused them in salt and lemon to hide the rancid taste and smell.  My husband's burger, which was supposed to be well done came bloody and half cooked. The Ceasar salad also tasted off. We asked for a refund from Seamless, but the restaurant denied our request. We tried calling the restaurant, but no one picked up the phone. We feel ripped off. We were great customers who have left great reviews for this restaurant in the past!  I went to seamless and added up how much we spent at this restaurant over the last year, and the number is in the high hundreds.

177,Christopher F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1,2.0,9/19/2015,"Avoid the Groupon! My husband and I had a Groupon for $60 worth of food and drink. The fine print said the drinks had to be $7 or less. Surprise #1: the menu had exactly one drink less than $7. Surprise #2: that drink, normally $6.50, was on the Happy Hour special for the evening, so it was ineligible for the Groupon for that particular night since Happy Hour drinks were also verboten. So, we could not use the Groupon for any drinks.So, we had to order a lot of food. The $14 corn fritters: a rip-off. Five small fritters, tasted like they came from a freezer. Cheese fries: soggy. $11 German pretzel: delicious. Pork Sliders: meh. Hungarian sausage: pretty good.The beer, especially the chocolate egg cream one, was stellar. The good news: the neighborhood has no place like this. If you go all the way to the back, there's a hidden outdoor German beer garden with big umbrellas and communal tables-- a really cool space. The bad news: terrible service. Our meal took three hours, with five different waiters rotating around and frequently bringing us other people's drinks and food while rarely refilling our water. They were pleasant but frazzled and confused. When the bill came, it had food on it we hadn't ordered or eaten and they hadn't taken off the Groupon. They were nice about straightening out the bill.If we go back, we'll just have a beer and a pretzel and will make sure we have a lot of time to spare... and no Groupon.",,,
178,Shona M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,0,5.0,8/29/2015,"Amazing service, delicious food and a great selection of beers. Found this place completely by chance while walking around the UWS and sat down as they have a nice outdoor area, the staff was helpful and super friendly, they served us food even though the kitchen was about to close, and it was fantastic. The mussels were fresh and their sauce was fragrant and creamy, the burger was cooked to perfection, and the fries were chunky and flavourful. Highly recommend!",,,
179,Coleman H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/17/2016,"Came here for the late night happy hour- made it the best place in town, but they stopped the late night happy hour.  Lost my business in this area, sadly",,1,
180,Brett C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"Wow.  Never again.  I live in the neighborhood and had been to this place about two dozen times.  The food and beer selection are great.  Service has always been a little touch and go.  So today I was enjoying brunch when a child's bday party started. Fine, it's the UWS, people have kids and their bday parties at restaurants.  But then the kids' entertainment started, which consisted of drums and tambourines and made the place awful for everyone else there.  Have a big party, make your money.  Ok, I'm really fine about that.  When you're pushing the tables aside for some children's bizzaro drum circle and ruining the brunch of everyone else (a bunch of people left the bar when this started), you're dead to me.",,,
181,Ted L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,3.0,6/19/2016,"Good list of beers, good atmosphere, good bar food.  The only problem?  They really, REALLY need to step up the service.  It's almost impossible to get anyone's attention when you want to order something.  If they take care of that, I'll most certainly go more often.",,,
182,Gabriela B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,18,4,2.0,8/8/2015,"The environment is nice, with outdoor sitting and a beer garden, but the food is just really dissapointing, both in quality and in quantity, and very much overpriced. I've been there twice and am certainly never going again.",,,
183,When K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,3.0,8/7/2015,"While we didn't love this, we'll definitely be back to give it another shot. I've read a lot of dissatisfied customers in regards to Five Lamps, but I always thought the place was okay and in a great location. So when West End opened I was happy to see the location re-utilized with a beautiful new interior.The beer garden out back is definitely a selling point, and the menu has some really yummy options. Unfortunately, the outdoor seating up front closes really early (rumor has it noise complaints sunk Five Lamps, so I wonder if these things are related).We had the food here for brunch, and everything was just okay. The Sriracha fries with the egg on top actually had what looked to be pico de gallo on top, which was pretty flavorless and made everything soggy. The drinks were pretty light on the alcohol and as I've read in other reviews, service was really, really slow even though we were one of only three tables for the majority of brunch (we got there early, right at 11).But the cauliflower app and the truffle burger and fries was really tasty, and because we didn't get a chance to sample the full beer menu we'll be back to give it another shot. This restaurant is really new, so I hope it has a chance to work out all the kinks. And add Sriracha to their Sriracha fries!",,,
184,Joseph R.,"Englewood, NJ",1,11,2,5.0,7/6/2015,"Ok, Munich meets New York.  Octoberfest in July!  Over 100 different beers, authentic beer garden in the middle of NYC AND sausage from around the world!  Really?  Are you freakin kidding me?  I think I've died and found heaven.  Seriously a very cool place with a great vibe.  Big screen for sporting events, and friendly, attentive service.  A ""go to"" place.",,,
185,Jake M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,1.0,11/7/2015,"I've been three times and every time the beers get more expensive and the service gets worse. $10 for 12 oz pours of mediocre beers have become the norm. Last night will be the last time I go. Waited over an hour for just wings and it wasn't even that busy. Waiter blamed the kitchen when he clearly forgot to put the order in. Nothing was comped. Looks like people are catching on to this failure of an ""beer hall."" I'll be happy to see it go out of business in 2016.",1,,
186,Betsy F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,2.0,2/9/2017,"It is a pleasant space with communal and smaller tables. If you go for the first time, you don't know you seat yourself and have to get your own menu. You also don't know you have to flag down a waiter or waitress every single time. My husband went to the bar finally to order drinks, which sent the waitress running to our table. When our drinks came, we said we would like to order. So the bar hop takes our order without writing it down. I knew we were in trouble. I had clearly said, ""Caesar salad to start"" but it came with the burgers. I said we didn't want it with dinner and they were gracious about taking it away and crediting us. We had to flag the waitress for each beer order and for the check. The burgers were fine. Nothing special and not close to how good Toast burgers were before they suddenly closed recently. Other customers looked pretty happy, but frankly we wished we had gone to the Abbey Pub where they actually look happy you have come. We may give it another try to see if this was just a bad night but everything needs to be better.",,,
187,J L.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,9/6/2015,So bad. The food and service was awful. Not much more to say. Very disappointing. Go for the beer but nothing else. Even the cheesy pretzel was awful- how could you mess that up? I've had better food at TGIFriday's.,1,,
188,Paige P.,"Elmont, NY",0,3,1,5.0,4/24/2016,"I've been to west end hall a few times and it's a great experience over all. My server Julia was extremely knowledgeable of all of the beers that are constantly changing which if I do say so is any beer geek's dream. On top of the impressive beer selection the food is amazing. If you know what's good for you, you'll get the buffalo cauliflower",,,
189,S K.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/15/2015,"Had a great time here! I sat at the bar and Dan had really good recommendations. 1. The truffle burger was SPOT ON! 2. The beer selection is outstanding! Chocolate Egg Cream Stout and the Baha Hoodie were sooo good. I am so happy there is a rotating craft beer bar in the neighborhood. In the middle of the night, they finished one of the beers they had and replaced it with another one. So Awesome!!! I love beer and I'm always looking for a place that has something new on. Definitely will come back!",1,,
190,Christie D.,"Chappaqua, NY",0,3,1,5.0,2/24/2016,"Big space, great for groups, lots of TVs and large beer selection. Wednesday night trivia @ 8pm is awesome - $50 and $25 rewards.",,,
191,Kathryn L.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,6,0,5.0,3/2/2016,"Great place for a large group, or a small gathering.  Unique garden setting in the back!  The food is excellent, not your ordinary fare.  Large selection of beer and a full bar as well.  This is the kind of place that you could go to alone and find people to hang out with...the main hall tables are long and makes it easy to meet people.",,,
192,Tony S.,"Bronx, NY",0,23,0,1.0,7/25/2015,"Great ambience. However, service is slow, some beers were out of stock and the beer that I was served was warm. Oh, the rum punch tasted like a 5 year old made it.",1,,
193,Lee B.,"Manhattan, NY",14,15,0,5.0,11/25/2015,This place rocks.  Great outdoor patio area in the back.  Great decor.  Excellent hot dogs.  Great fries.  I saw Kristaps Porzingis in here last time I came.  So it gets 5 stars just for that.,,,
194,Grace K.,"WHITESTONE, NY",190,70,0,4.0,11/25/2015,"Nice ambiance with a rustic feel with the wooden chairs/seats. Got the seasonal beer - pumpkin, which was delicious. The appetizers were good, nothing remarkable but tasty.",,,
195,Angela D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,7/21/2015,"Come on, how can you charge $12 for a lonely little sausage that's basically a plain old hot dog? You could have thrown in a potato -- or something! The $14 hamburger was small and not to order (ordered medium rare, got overly well done). The truffle burger was small but good OK at $17 (!!!!) and if you want the cabbage instead of the fries, they charge another $2. So basically the hamburger was $19. Go to Mel's for a good burger. Go to the guy on the corner for a good hot dog. Don't come here for food. The beer was good though so if you want a biergarten, noisy, cheerful, and want to drink lots of beer, then fine.  I left this place wanting to go out for dinner somewhere.",1,,
196,otto h.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,3.0,11/1/2015,"The beers were good, but the service was not so much. I was asked if I wanted another beer, and after say no, my glass which had two more gulps in it was briskly taken away. Kind of annoying, and probably not on purpose. But with the $8-9 median beer prices, not so nice.",,,
197,Beau B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,3,0,4.0,9/10/2015,"Julia is a real solid server who really knew her brews, leading me to discover the magic that is Rodenbach Grand Cru... Great food and good vibes. Over all, just a great time! I'll be back for more next time I'm in NYC.",,,
198,Darren L.,"Westbury, NY",43,52,2,3.0,8/12/2015,"Service was a little slow at first, but the place was pretty empty.  We sat for awhile before finally getting menus.  Dinks were good, Salmon was nice.....avoided a burger to be healthy, but next time will def try one.  The place is pretty big, but tables of course right on top of each other.  SInce it wasn't busy, we enjoyed the meal......would go back if in the area.",,,
199,Michael M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,8/8/2015,"Great space, lousy service. We sat out back and although it wasn't crowded the service was very slow. I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out like leather. I sent it back and the next one came out raw. It was a frozen pattie so there probably were no options in between. Also, the first three  beers I ordered they didn't have. I'd stay away.",,,
