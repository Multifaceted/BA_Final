1,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,3.0,11/6/2018,"Thank you, Mel for introducing me to this low-key happy hour spot. Divey, but good.If you're walking by and not paying attention, you might miss the entrance to this bar. You'll need to walk up some stairs to get to the bar area. There are some window seats overlooking the street below and seating in the back as well, but both times, we opted to sit closer to the bar. It's pretty dark in there so you might have some trouble reading the blackboard with drink specials - fear not. I got you:HH is from 5 to 8 which is pretty good for the city, considering most bars have a HH that ends at 7. This makes Greenwich Treehouse the go-to spot to drink for cheap. The selection is pretty good - lots of beers on tap and if you are feeling fancy, they carry Wolffer's Rose Cider. Well drinks are discounted during HH too.",5,2,2
2,Jessica M.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",19,20,5,5.0,10/5/2018,"Love this bar. They have a great happy hour everyday from 5pm - 8pm and the bartender is great. Very lowkey, chill, and great to meet new people.  Lots of space in the back for groups and you can bring your own food.",,,

7,Alex N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,4,1.0,8/31/2018,"Usually I love this bar but today the bartender was a jerk about the jukebox. My friend and I played 2 songs, had fun, then he told me if I played something he didnt like, he would skip it, so I should save my money. I get not wanting bad music, but the way he said it was really rude so I was pretty disappointed in that disrespectful service. It's normally a great bar and I come here for a reason. Idk who this guy was but I need to come back when he's not working. I'm trying to have a fun night out, not get approval for songs I enjoy.",1,,
8,Klaudia A.,"Brooklyn, NY",166,13,0,4.0,6/25/2018,"This is one of the first bars I started to recommend after living here a few years. I'm a big Star Wars fan and only discovered it had all these little Star Wars touches after a friend invited me - but you'd never think of it as a ""Star Wars bar"" per se. The back room/area has been the site of many of my podcasting friends' monthly meetups, and they're always playing a New Hope on a loop. Super cute, and my only complaint is that it can get way too loud, which is unfortunate because it's a great place to invite people you haven't seen in a while.",,,

11,Arthur S.,"New York, NY",64,49,52,3.0,6/28/2017,"It's 2015. You haven't given up on life yet. You meet some friends at Greenwich Treehouse. Happy hour goes til 8pm so you all get drunk off $3 bud lights. You regale the group with the tale of your last one-night-stand. Your friends inform you that sleeping til 1pm at someone else's place is a faux-pas. You refuse to accept this reality and start polling other patrons about the appropriate departure time from a one-night-stand. Turns out it's 10am.  The outing quickly becomes the best night of your life. As time goes on your life falls to sh*t. You become desperate to relive that night. You return to Greenwich Treehouse again and again but it's never quite the same: you get hungry but there's no food, you go on the weekend and it's too crowded, the bartender asks for ID and doesn't accept your NYC-ID. Years pass, but you can never recreate that night. Each night out leaves you emptier than the one before. It's time to accept that you peaked at Greenwich Treehouse and no amount of cheap beer will ever bring back that glorious night.",1,14,1
12,Ben B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,4.0,5/19/2018,This is a fun and casual bar. Tons of Star Wars references/imagery all over and they even play A New Hope on repeat in the back. Plenty of space and affordable drinks.,,,

14,Emery F.,"McKinney, TX",298,28,16,1.0,6/25/2017,Only putting one star because there's not an option to put zero. The atmosphere and bartenders are great. The manager ruins the entire experience for everyone. If you want to improve your patron experience fire him and promote one of the classy bartenders who actually understand the importance of customer service in a consumer based industry. Won't be back.Update one year later: returning to the area for pride and will be making sure to avoid this at all cost,,1,
15,Karina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",161,60,1,1.0,9/22/2017,The worst service ever. This is directed to the shaved head bartender with the ill fitting mustache. He was super rude.

16,Justine G.,"Jersey City, NJ",176,153,80,3.0,3/10/2017,"Went for a friend's birthday celebration on a Thursday night. The location is very convenient and there are lots of resturants nearby. They do not serve food, but encourage people to bring their own (BYOF) or order delivery to the bar. The crowd was a little heavier around happy hour, but thinned by 9PM. It was never desolate, but rather had a comfortable number of poeple populating where you could still easly find a seat and get to the bar with minimal jostling. Drinks are solid but unspectacular. The tap list is a little light for my liking, but there is a rotating list of bottles and cans. The people watching is the best part of this bar, but if you don't get a seat by the large windows in the front then its really no different than the dozens of similar, mildly-divey bars that populate this area. The bathrooms were servicable. Overall, it felt like a place I had been dozens of times before despite this being my first time visiting. One thing did strike me as odd and off-putting. During the happy hour rush, when the bar was very crowded and it was difficult to get an order in, the bartender asked to see ID. So after you saw me waiting a good while and when I finally get a gap of space at the bar, now you tell me to get my ID? Why not ID at the door? I then had to forfeit my spot and then jostle for place again, only to get the other bartender who served without question. Minor, but still annoying. If I were in the area and the front viewing area had space, I would give it another go, but its not somewhere unique enough to seek out on its own.",1,2,1
17,J R.,"Melville, NY",0,25,2,4.0,5/20/2017,Bartender stole my jukebox tracks to play biggie and wave his light saber. Saving grace was the Legos starwars movie playing in the largetv?!??Drinks cheap and crowd fratty?Come back- maybe I think I had a good gimlet here in high school- maybe?,,,

Updated review","I love this place. It's a quirky neighborhood bar that appeals to students, fans of Star Wars and Big Buck Hunter. Beers are cheap during happy hour and the bartenders are generally friendly but unwilling to take abuse from anyone, which is refreshing to anyone who has ever worked in the service industry. They don't serve food but can give you plenty of recommendations on where to order from and some menus to check out. There is a small semi-private room in the back where you can hang out with a few friends if it's not taken. I've had plenty of great nights here and continue to frequent this establishment.",,,
25,Philip N.,"New York, NY",8,149,26,4.0,6/28/2017,"This is a neat spot. Lots of selection, especially their tap beers. They have a great HH that goes until 8PM and they have good bartenders. Lots of TVs. Huge location. Go check it out.",,,
26,Holly C.,"New York, NY",409,1256,5,3.0,2/27/2017,Low key bar. Lots of space on a Friday. We had a few pickle back shots & moved onto the next bar. They have a few arcade games which could be fun if you're with a group of friends.,4,3,3

28,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,4.0,7/18/2015,"Happy hour is 5-8. Half off beers and well drinks! Most of their beers come out to $4. They don't have a lot of options on draft but they have a lot of bottles, so you'll probably find something that'll suit your taste buds.Every time I come here during happy hour, I always get a seat. It's never too packed, which is perfect for me (since I hate crowds and loud groups. And yes, I know this makes me sounds like I'm 80 years old but I'm okay with that). I think it's because it's a bit hidden. You have to go upstairs in order to enter the bar.The place is kind of divey (the front is definitely less divey than the back so try to grab a seat there) but if you're just looking for a few quick/cheap drinks, this is the perfect place to do so!",2,1,1
29,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",417,497,8937,5.0,11/1/2015,"Hrmmm- love this place, I do. Yes, that's Yoda speak for you.  Because Yoda oversees the proceedings from the titular treehouse that hangs in this whimsical bar that's a nerd's paradise.  Superhero paraphernalia adorns the walls, and they're usually playing Star Wars on loop on at least one of the bar's screens.  It's my go-to Halloween spot after the Village parade.  And while the $5 Halloween night cover might seem like a bit of a drag, it's worth it to revel amidst your fellow nerds clad in superhero attire or Jedi garb.  Lightsabers encouraged.",,,

I came here as I was waiting for a table to open for dinner down the street and sat at the bar with a few friends. It was a Saturday night and fairly crowded but nothing too bad. They had a movie projected on the wall, I can remember what it was, but I want to say Star Wars? Either way, it has that hip/sportsy/divey thing going for it and I liked it. Mixed are around $8 a pop for well and I believe their happy hour is $4. Its a great place to kill an hour or two and don't be afraid of the weird alleyway steps up.",7,,2
32,Jason Y.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",526,317,2,4.0,5/11/2017,"Stopped by for a buddy's going away a few weeks ago and this place is as advertised: well priced drinks, games to play and TV's for sports.  The bar did get packed past 9pm but if you come early and grab a good area, you should be fine.",,,
33,Katie S.,"New York, NY",153,10,9,5.0,4/18/2016,"If I were to imagine myself in the TV show ""Cheers"" (modified for my generation, obviously), it would look a lot like Greenwich Treehouse.If you go to Treehouse expecting cocktails with fancy names served with exotic fruits to top them off, then you should turn around and find someplace else to drink with your friends. Treehouse is a very laid back bar - I mean, they've got Star Wars paraphernalia all over, so that's gotta mean something! They usually have some variation of Star Wars playing on the big screen; if not then a classic comedy or sci-fi movie or a major sporting event. Be warned: Jay, the best bartender ever, is a Red Sox fan... I've forgiven him this one flaw.If your phone is need of some juice, they've got chargers along the wall to keep you going. And for those of you who want to add some additional merriment to your drinking activities, there are some games (BIG BUCK HUNTER) in the back room. So far as seating: there is a back (back) room for smallish groups, a back room for larger groups, a fun balcony area, and the bar itself (#1 primo location).There are also drink specials on different nights, but honestly I don't even pay attention to any of that because at the end of the day I'll drink here and pay whatever. Also, big bonus, you can order food directly to the bar (they don't have a kitchen) which means you and your friends don't have to fight about what to eat!TL;DR: Greenwich Treehouse is a Star Wars bar and you have to go there if you like beer and fun people.",1,1,1
34,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",620,332,2371,4.0,1/19/2016,"I genuinely like this place. Maybe its nostalgia, maybe it's the cheap drink specials (or maybe it's both?)This part of town isn't a desert for bars by any stretch of the imagination, that is, unless you're looking for a cheap drink. Yeah there is Jonny's not too far away, but I never really cared for that place (I LOVE dive bars but I find the staff here to be on the rude side, and the whole place to be over hyped in general).  Greenwich Treehouse is not a dive bar, not by a long shot, don't get me wrong.  What it is, is a place that is on the eclectic side (read; laid out kind of poorly with decor that appeals to college age kids) that has really good drink specials*. Looking for a classy place to bring a date to? Yeah this isn't it, but if you're looking to hang out with a group of friends it's absolutely worth checking out. The beat the clock special on Thursdays' can't be beat (see what I did there?).  1$ beers from 5-6 (yep, that's right dollar beers), going up 1$ an hour every hour until 8 (serious bang for your buck). 4$ house  drinks and 2$ off you already cheap drafts for normal happy hour every other day of the week (including Friday and Saturday), means that no matter what day it is, if you're here between 5-8 you're saving a few pennies. If I am in the area with a group this place is pretty high on my list of pregame bars (or nightcap bars), for convince and price.  All in all it's a solid spot, great for after work with a few friends (especially on a Thursday....just saying).___________________________________________*OK drink SPECIAL, but beat the clock night aside, this place really does have cheap drinks.",17,13,15

Updated review","Since the awesome bartender, Evan, left, there has been a serious downturn in service! The new bartender never remembers regulars, isn't very nice and usually charges everyone to include his tip.   Maybe people stopped tipping him because he was so bad. Why be a bartender if you can't stand people or booze?! Anyway, we still come here for our weekly happy hour with friends, but we're trying to phase it out. Unless the bartender suddenly changes or gets a new personality, we'll be looking for something better ASAP.",6,1,

41,Julia R.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,37,1,2.0,12/13/2015,"This is a popular hangout for The New School MFA students, which is why I (reluctantly) come here every week or so, but my experiences just haven't been all that good.PROS: Arcade games, decent drinks, a back room/library where you can adjust the lighting (granted, this is a total dive, so there's penises and phone numbers scrawled everywhere), a large table for big group seating, videos playing, Yoda.Plus, they like to leave free food out (Pocky, rice krispie treat cakes, etc), which is really great. When this place isn't popping/crowded, it's not bad. There are window seats and it can make for a nice place to chill.CONS: The bartender that everyone complains on here about? Yeah, he's very rude for no apparent reason, and it ruins the experience every time I come since he seems to work the shifts that line up nicely with when I get out of class. He asks to see our IDs every single time we come in here, which I get, standard policy, but we come here like *every week* and sometimes only order water. Then he stares at our IDs for approximately 3 minutes as if they're fakes, even though we're all 22-30. But whatever. We were kicked out of a party room in the back recently which we didn't know was a private party room, and not in the friendliest of ways. The staff are...well, maybe I just have bad luck.The bathrooms are pretty grimy and could use a good cleaning. The biggest problem is how crowded this place gets. I mean PACKED, super hot, no fans or anything to break up the sweaty, humid atmosphere. Nowhere to sit, just bodies packed against each other. And that's a standard dive, sure, but it's not the kind of place you want to go when you want to chill.So Treehouse, I will continue to visit you and pray that Dave (?) is nicer to us, because this is where all of my friends/classmates go, but I still don't understand why you disappoint me so.",2,2,

We brought in a few pizzas for everyone, had privacy in the back space and celebrated all night. Beers were only $2.75, they had the football games playing and everyone had an awesome time.

Treehouse theme on point -- there's a large treehouse (feat. a Yoda doll peeking out) and a small book-lined private room in the back.  Now, could they do even more with this cool theme? Definitely. Is it a little noisy and hard to stake out spaces for conversation when it gets crowded? Yep. Are the $3 PBRs cheap for Manhattan but still generally grim? Of course.

The appeal to this place is definitely the happy hour and the fact that you can bring food in, but unless it's 2 am and I can't physically fit into Fiddlesticks, I won't be back anytime soon.",3,3,

58,Sera R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,1.0,3/27/2016,"My friend and I stopped in for a nightcap. Needless to say, the bartender with the long dark hair put a huge damper on our evening. On a slow Monday night, we bought tacos from the place downstairs, and took a spot by the window. My friend made the fatal mistake of asking the bartender if he made a good martini. It went down hill from there. He checked her ID and it was expired; she had just had a birthday and we are both in our mid-40's. He said he couldn't serve her. When I tried to buy a beer, he told me that she was not allowed to stay. Based on the countless bad reviews here citing this same bartender's attitude over several years, he must own the bar. Skip this place.",3,2,

Well kept enough that you don't really have to worry about cleanliness, but divey enough to maintain an unpretentious vibe. Look for the green sign that says ""BAR"" up the stairs.The happy hour special is decent here, and they have a pretty good selection of beers. It can get pretty crowded here, but every time I've been, the crowd's always been manageable regardless. Bartenders do a good job with the drinks, and are pretty nice.Also, Big Buck Hunter AND Big Buck Safari in the back. Not too shabby.If you're looking for a chill night in Greenwich Village, this place is definitely worth trying.",2,,

62,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,3.0,1/19/2014,"It's ""a bar above it all"" in a more literal sense, posted above Greenwich Avenue. Figuratively, it's pretty on the level with any other average dive-y bar.It was pretty easy to find a seat for five at 8 p.m. on a Saturday night, though around 8:30, we were kicked out of the back table near the safari hunting video games* because it was reserved. There was no sign posting that...but...whatever...we grabbed two small tables near the front. I got blasted with an occasion cold chill as the front door opened, which wasn't exactly pleasant. The bartender was friendly enough and I got my drink is due time. I wasn't in a mixed drink mode, so they luckily had a hard cider on tap. Unfortunately, it was Original Sin, which I'm not a fan of. Still, it was there and only $6, so I took it. I did enjoy the nice vibe, yellow and orange Christmas lights twinkling along the top of the bar, really good music (some Tears for Fears, some Genesis), and was neither impressed or disappointed. It was a fine pit stop in the midst of a food / bar crawl I was in the middle of.* - A video game to shoot animals?! I'm not a super duper ""Save the Animals!"" type, but that really made me sad and uncomfortable for whatever reason, and I was still completely sober at the point I saw this. Ha!",,1,

The decor is eclectic, there is a treehouse with Yoda looking down, string lights and lots of stuff hung on the wall. The vibe is extremely casual. Young adults mostly. The service is laid back, but no one was rude.We did get carded,so carry your ID along. This is certainly not the place for cocktails, get a beer, and settle in.

We arrived for on a Saturday afternoon post brunch and stupidly expected ...at least decent... service. Bartender Dave acted like ordering a beer was asking for his first born child, and when my friend asked if he was ok, he responded with ""how am I supposed to act to please you? I served you drinks. You should be happy.""   Please note,My 12 friends and I were barely buzzed and showed up to an empty bar (except 2 guys) super disappointed.

Oh, that's right, they were written by people who have no concept of bar etiquette. If you're a lousy tipper, expect crappy service! Anyone who works in a hospitality job understands that good service, like good food, deserves recognition. Just because there's a great happy hour special, that does not mean you get to drink without tipping. The discount is on the product, not the service!That being said, the eclectic music selection offered by Jay, Robert Downey Jr.'s doppleganger, was fantastic. From the moment my friend and I sat down he made sure to chat with us, refill our drinks when they went dry and he had an overall positive and friendly disposition. The ambience of the bar was chill, and enabled a conversation, but when a good song came on, it was okay for the two drunk girls at the end of the bar to sing at their hearts content. In the back room on Tuesdays there's also an open mic for stand-up which seems worth the visit on those nights. And finally, there's some real quality stuff written on the bathroom walls, so this bar definitely has character. Needless to say, I'll be back!",3,1,2

Okay, because I knew I was going to Yelp about it, I had a sip or two of my brother's beverages (vodka soda + tonic, both A-OK).I was here at about 8:30 PM on a cold May Saturday and the crowd was light, mostly groups of friends. The lay out of the spot is interesting. You have to walk upstairs to find it. They seem to have good happy hour specials. The bar is quite high up and the staff on the other side are elevated, making it feel like you're a 13 year old sneaking into the place (which I kind of like). What made the joint to me was the way they decorated the space. It's quaint, there's many tables all around and even a random ""game room"" in the back which is designed like an old library.  Apparently they used to have board games in that space, until some nice folks decided to pilfer them (damn you, i was in the mood for some sober Jenga).Overall, this is a place that I would investigate further, on a night where I actually feel like doing some damage to my liver. Highly recommend for a first/second casual date.",,,
81,C. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,12,0,5.0,9/17/2014,"This is a regular spot for me. If you want to just sit, have a few beers, chat with the bartender and listen to some good tunes for a bit, this is the place. If you're by yourself, sit at the bar and chat with other regulars around you. Everyone has a story, is usually friendly, and there might be a good or weird movie on if there isn't some kind of sportsball playing. There is no food, but delivery is allowed. The drinks are strong, the beer flows freely, and the bartenders are among my favorites in the city.Fair warning, if you look young and the bartender doesn't know you, he will card you. Take it with a smile, make a joke about being immortal or babyfaced or something, be friendly, and tip your bartender.",2,1,1

You head upstairs to access the bar and it's the front part of the bar is a balcony overlooking the sidewalk below, which is different. Then there's a small bar area in the middle and the back room with just a wooden table right in the middle, some comfy chairs to the side for a smaller group, 2 bathrooms and a jukebox. Then there's an even smaller room within the room and you can close the door too. Yoda is in a treehouse as well. It's a little weird setup but the turnout was great.The beers are warm by the way.

My friend chose this place for their happy hour deal ($5 well drinks) and I had never been so thought it would be a good time to check it out. We went on a Tuesday evening after work. It wasn't crowded at all but slowly started filling up later on so I imagine late night would be busier. I had a vodka tonic and was really surprised at how strong it was! Most places tend to water down their drinks at happy hour but not this place! You definitely get your money's worth. The space is really cool too, it's elevated above the street and they have a big window with bar style seating so you can people watch as you drink. They have a few other rooms in the back, too, so it seems like a nice roomy place if you're coming with a larger party.

If you aren't nerdy enough or if he feels like you don't belong in ""his"" bar he will ask you to leave and give you crap service with rude remarks until your gone.

All the drinks we ordered came adequately strong, not watered down for once, AND he was able to make a good drink for my friend who doesn't really drink. Fruity and great tasting but still packed a good punch. Only thing is that it was pretty quiet and a little too chill in here but it was probably because we were there early on in the night.",2,,

87,Liz N.,"Washington, DC",119,706,11,4.0,12/1/2014,"I'd definitely come back to this bar if I'm every around this part of town.  The quintessential dive bar... you got ur darkness, you got ur nasty bathrooms, you got no space (BYOF--bring you own food though), not so exciting tap selection but not too bad bottle selection and the quick and attentive lone bartender manning the fort.  The beers are pretty cheap for NY standards, and the happy hour runs until 8 pm.  $3 crappy beers, $2 off draft and $1 off bottles. People tended to migrate a lot so you won't stand more than 30 minutes before finding some place to sit.  The theme is pretty much drunk-star wars-treehouse-dive-converted-century-old house.. We were here for probably 3 to 4 hrs and I still found my eyes wandering to all the nooks and crannies of the place that gives it character.

There are 3 varieties of Big Buck Hunter for the ardent fan.Margaritas were available for $6--small but stiff. There were also $4 kamikaze shots, which went down well. On other days the specials are even more alluring, so keep an eye out. There's a nice big table in the back, perfect for our group, and a private nook in the back for more intimacy.",3,1,1

Not to mention, there are a ton of delicious pizza spots within walking distance (for ex Joe's and John's of Bleecker St).

The bartenders are really awesome, and obviously do their best to stop and chat with as many people as possible. The beer-and-shot special is a pretty good deal at $6, but otherwise the prices are on the high side. Bottles will range from $6-10 and drafts are $7+. Keep in mind you're in the West Village, though, and also if you're polite, both Jay and Jordan, the usual bartenders are really generous with buybacks. Treehouse, with its college crowd, cool bartenders, good choice of music, and awesome Classic movies playing on the projecter makes it a welcome laid-back divy kind of bar in the otherwise stuffy and snooty West Village.",,,

The bar attender insisted that my co-worker wanted to cover it even though I insisted that I was paying for this round.This guy really needs to stop arguing and questioning his customers. MONEY IS MONEY!!!The bathroom is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!! I thought I was going to catch a disease just by opening the door! I had a good time b/c I was with good company. Other patrons looked like they were having a good time as well. Just warning you, AVOID THE BATHROOMS AT ALL COST! Get your drinks by paying cash. The bar attender is a weirdo!",4,4,

No specials today? It's St. Patricks Day and you aren't even honoring your happy hour special? Irish people all over the world are so disgusted with this place right now.Alas, bartender wouldn't budge - so my $2 beer was actually $6-7.2 beers later - I left to find a better place to celebrate the holiday of drunken debauchary.Moral of this story - this place is alright on Thursday's but just remember in the back of your head how they are a disgrace to St. Patricks Day, Christmas, Yom Kippur, halloween or I am sure any holiday that you want a cheap drink.",10,8,2

Yep, you heard me right! You just can't beat that one!! A word of warning, however... especially if you're hungry after work--they don't serve food. They do, on the other hand, advertise what they call ""BYOF"" (Bring Your Own Food)-- for real. What an interesting concept! Personally, I have yet to bring any food, but my friend Ryan and her husband Greg have brought in snacks for Thursday's Beat the Clock festivities.The atmosphere at the Greenwich Treehouse is nothing fancy, but that's not what they're going for. The place is an inviting, casual, no frills neighborhood bar, and that's part of what makes it charming. Note that on Thursdays, a guy named Evan is typically tending the bar.

The happy hour on Thursday nights is pretty intense.  Draft beer starts at $1 (!) from 5-6pm and goes up a dollar an hour until 8pm.  I tend to stick with the Brooklyn Lager, but there are a few other beers you can choose from. I will say, the crowd here is young... but I dig it. The music is a nice mix, the bartenders are fast and friendly, and this has become a go to spot for Thursday happy hours.I also noticed they have some video game that seems to always have someone playing it or waiting in line to play. It involves shooting a buck or a deer or a bird, if you are into that.",2,2,4

I had vaguely heard of happy hours here being decent, but didn't put too much stock in the rumors given that 1. it's in the West Village, which is about as gentrified/newly expensive as any other neighborhood so it couldn't possibly be cheap and 2. happy hours these days seem more of the singular variety, as in a single hour, say from 5 to 6pm. Thankfully, Greenwich Treehouse founded a lot of the good press surrounding it. Happy hour stretches until a positively curfew-breaking 8pm. The specials are more special than mediocre, with the two of us ending up spending less than ten bucks with tip for our first round. While the tap selection is nothing to write home about, neither is it something to bemoan. Though the venue is by no means large, it manages to somehow feel comfortable and spacious. I'm sure on the later weekdays, when packed to the gills with guffawing buffoons, I'd be lamenting the relative dearth of tables, but as the only ones in the bar, it was hard to envision. Bonus points for embracing the approach of Halloween by playing Sleepy Hollow on your projector.",1,1,2

They had specials written on a board outside on the sidewalk by the doorman. He checked our IDs and we came upstairs. The inside was decorated pretty cool and felt like an actual treehouse (a little kid's dream right?) lol. Anyway, towards the back of the bar they had a fake little fireplace and a Yoda chillin' from the ceiling. They also had two arcade games in that back area as well. As a short girl, it was hard to reach the bar and get the bartender's attention so I had to basically climb up on a barstool and embarrass myself trying to get their attention. Lol. Anyway, this one bartender I didn't get his name though was very nice! Friendly and I told him I needed a few things for the group I was with. He was attentive and got it all right which surprised me because of the volume in there. Prices also weren't bad either. I ordered a Heineken, Captain & Diet and three Jameson & Pickle back shots. I was expecting a $60 tab, NYC prices. However, I was surprised that my tab only came out to $30. Success! The place had fun music and I would come back.",,,

Best of all they have great deals on Thursdays where it is $1 beers and $2 for a quality beer from 5pm and it goes up a dollar by the hour. It is a great idea to both get costumers and to let us consumers get some quality beer at low prices. The decor is woody, with dampened lights and it has nooks and crannies that are cozy.

Otherwise, based on both our experience and the many negative reviews that refer to him specifically, it makes no sense that he still has a job there. We walked in on a Tuesday evening when the bar wasn't terribly busy. It seemed to be a pretty cool place, but the bartender gave us a funny look as we sat down at a table near the bar. I ordered, and said that my friend wasn't drinking and he immediately got upset and said that she'd have to leave. She handed him her Brazilian government identification card, and before even looking at the birthdate, he said ""NO WAY! Anybody can print one of these!"" He threw it down on the bar and walked away. Lost business for the owner, alienated two potential customers, and seems to be an unhappy guy. I'll return when he's gone.",2,2,

A couple screens were showing a basketball game, but everyone in the place was there to just have a good time. Perhaps the oddest feature of this bar was the little nook in the back with a full bookcase that felt more suited for a coffee shop. Staff seemed kinda friendly and personable. Drinks were very reasonably priced, although their beer draft selection was very limited. Still, they offer as good an experience as any in the city. Definitely will come back if I get a chance.",,,

At one point late in the night, right after I had ordered 3 drinks, he bluntly said that a large group had reserved the area where we were sitting and we had to move. Never mind the fact we had been there for a few hours without knowing it was reserved, bought plenty of drinks, and were minding our own business. There was a tactful way to handle this and he didn't know it. In an abrupt fashion, he basically made me feel unwelcome, after I had spent good money at his bar. When I didn't give him a tip after he rudely tried to kick us out of our seats for doing nothing, he told us we weren't welcome again.

165,Jenna I.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,254,53,5.0,12/6/2011,"Used to hit this place up with my ex boo and his friends on Tuesdays for the beat the clock special. Had a really pleasant encounter with the bartender and decided to come back every Tuesday for the rest of ever. WAIT IM NOT KIDDINGThe real story goes like this- used to hit this place up with aformentioned peep-a-jeeps, peepizzlez who mind you are working professionals digging the less than 8 dollar beers, and would order well over the hour, into normal priced territory like mad playaz pimping all over aforementioned world. One fated Tuesday I order a Stella, pay and wait, with mad acknowledgement (even a hand written note!!!!) of where my beer was. Its cool, the bar was semi busy- but the bartender totally took the time to stop and even inform my parents about the status of my beer. So I was waitin, wonderin- ""yo I paid right?, and I'm pretty sure that everyone else ordering a beer at a bar, in this society, pays for their drinks""  Bar tender (not the taller guy with short hair- he's cool too- the other one with longer black hair) sees me waiting and tells me, ""Sorry sometimes you have to wait to be served."" With a empathetic look on his face.  OH REALLY Its cool though because i forgot when bars are crowded i must persevere. so I tell myself good tip, I'll tip him monetarily on this beer then, because I would tip him if he was NORMAL 100% ($1) but he was super chill so maybe $4. Maybe I'll get it right next time. IT'S WRONG NOT TO cause tipping is mandatory even when the waiter is rude....I go back, chill with my peeps they order more, I think I have someone grab me another one cause I'm lazy....whatever time passes.... But who walks into to the little nook in the back- Helpful Bartender! But what happens next!!! Helpful Bartender tells us to stay as long as we want forever, because he is not making money off of us but he thinks we're fucking awesome. Yes. He says that to all of us, because he got tipped on a happy hour beer. And proceeds to offer us chips and basically verbally seduces us working professionals until we agree to stay and snuggle. Listen people, I get it, its happy hour- but are you really that awesome as to offer us cheap beer, a place to relax all night AND YOUR FIRST BORN?!?!! So awesome. Five stars because it is a chill place after work, and because the other bartender is a cool dude, but five stars because I'm ALWAYS coming back. Every Tuesday.   If you want to treated like a prince for wanting cheap beer come here! This the place for you!!!  I'm here all of the time and willing to duel anyone who disagrees with me. Because I speak the truth. And so does America. God bless Greenwich Treehouse and long hair bartender.",3,6,3
166,Jeff L.,"Atlanta, GA",2,49,12,1.0,2/8/2014,This place is a dump.  Bunch of nerds standing around blocking path to bar and bathroom.  Try to squeeze your way through & they think they are on revenge of the nerds & start throwing dork smack.  Stay away,1,5,1
167,Sarah S.,"New York, NY",4,18,0,3.0,9/2/2014,"I like the relaxed ambiance and I've always been able to find a seat.  The beer selection isn't amazing but there's one bartender who makes a great Hendricks martini.  They definitely don't water anything down which is a refreshing change.  Candidly, it's a good place to get drunk after work if you're feeling it.  However, I'm giving 3 stars because one of the bartenders is extremely cold and unfriendly.  He always looks at IDs with extreme skepticism and furrowed brow, bro, this isn't the god damn airport.  His attitude is just plain rude.  Chill out--you'll probably make way better tips.  I'm a great tipper and shit like that makes me want to give $0.  Other than that, you can ignore him and have a great time with your friends.",,1,

It's not the type of place where people push and shove for drinks, which were super affordable. The hh deal was $2 off draft beers which are normally $5 so a $3 beer is pretty solid. My friend got a well drink which was strong and good. It's a great place to sit and chat. I'll be coming back!",,,1

The Treehouse is a up off of street level, hence the ""treehouse"" reference with great views of the street from up above for fantastic incognito people watching. The motif is a bit divey, but still interesting with a large chalk board proclaiming the deals and drafts on tap. The bartender was also friendly and a buyback was given happily during our visit. However, note that there is no kitchen here, but you can order any food you'd like delivered directly to the bar! I was impressed with both the vibe and the prices.

172,Michael W.,"New York, NY",177,40,0,4.0,1/6/2013,"I was supposed to meet up with a few people at Fiddlesticks one Saturday night but by time we got to Fiddlesticks it resembled a packed out college bar and that wasn't exactly what we were looking for.  We walked down the block and saw the Greenwich Treehouse and decided to try it out.Nothing impressive about this place that sets it apart from anywhere else but I also had no complaints either other than the awful smelling bathroom (yes, i understand it is a bathroom but this bathroom smelt like they had been storing a dead body in there).They had a few different bar games which I did not attempt, but it seemed like the crowd already at the bar was enjoying.  We did play with the jukebox a little and they music selection is extensive.  My group grabbed a spot up on a bar along the window looking out onto the street which wound up being a pretty good seat.  The drinks are well priced and the staff is very attentive and always looking to make sure there isn't anybody hanging out at the bar not being served.  Overall I recommend the Greenwich Treehouse as a place to go with a few friends for a low key bar night,",,,
173,Mark A.,"Bangor, ME",160,246,34,2.0,12/20/2013,"Should change its name to Fiddlesticks-Spillover, as this is where desperate people who can't get in to Fiddlesticks try next to grab a drink.  The Treehouse is a true dive: dark, dingy, and kinda made my skin crawl.  That being said, the beers were cheap-ish, and Buck Hunter in the back was clutch.  There are worse places at 2 AM.  I could see how this bar may appeal to people who live on the street (strictly out of convenience), but otherwise, I'll check out the numerous other bars in the area.",2,1,

I am certain that my definition of a ""wild night"" differs slightly from most ""normal"" humans, and this place has always been pretty damn tolerant of my insane, drunken behavior. I've danced on tables, got busy in the bathroom, against the wall in the middle of gen pop, tossed a drink at a guys face, took off my shirt... Good times!Anyways, the drinks are good. There is an OK jukebox, which never hurts, and the tolerance of the staff alone is enough to have me coming back for more, and often. It's a bit on the pricey side, but what isn't in NYC? It's worth the $80 for 4 drinks and 2 shots.This place has surely become one of my favorite downtown watering holes.",1,,

177,Ryan B.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,111,15,4.0,2/25/2012,"Liked this bar a lot. It has a very casual atmosphere. The bar itself is pretty small, and can get a bit crowded. If you go in the back, it's a little quieter and there is a large table for seating. Also, in the way way back, there is a kind of separate private room with a few seats and a table. If you snag that area, like my group did, you kind of have your own private hideout which is nice.The beers were all $5-$6 on tap, and the selection was pretty solid. They had Shocktop on tap and Lagunitas, amongst some other standard beers.The bartender was playing his iPod over the speakers and kept the music going most of the night. Basically, this place is a little above a dive. It's a fun place to hangout and not too expensive of a place to drink for the area.",1,,
178,Ian C.,"Long Island City, NY",54,386,3,4.0,3/18/2012,"I've walked down Greenwich Avenue several times and I've always seen this bar from the other side of the street. I always said I wanted to go in there but somehow I always ended up at Fiddlesticks which is further down the street. But after strolling down Greenwich Avenue for a quick drink, my friend and I finally stumbled in here.We were a little hesitant to stay because there weren't a lot of people and it seemed kind of dead. It was a Sunday evening, though. Then we saw on the big screen that Batman: The Dark Knight was on, so being the nerds that we are, we got pretty excited so we stayed to watch. Of course, we got a beer. Actually we got three. There was a lot to choose from and I didn't feel like I needed to stick with just one. They didn't have any more Anchor Steam, even though it was listed. What a tease. But the beers they did have were good. Now that I've finally been here, I'm coming back when I'm on Greenwich Avenue. Maybe I'll stop inside Fiddlesticks, but I kind of like this place better.",,1,
179,Rob K.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,151,36,3.0,7/1/2011,"When all other ""good"" happy hours are offering discounts on PBR, Genesee, and Bud, the Treehouse rewards drinkers with dollar Smithwicks, Stella, and Brooklyn Lager, from five to six on Thursdays.  Each hour, until eight, the price goes up a buck.  That's just brilliant.  The tap list isn't extensive, but please message me other bars in New York that offer significant discounts on quality brew.The bar came highly recommended by two regulars, but I'm afraid they may need a new spot, once word spreads.  There was a crowd, but overall the tone was calm.  The bartender was awesome.  Pretty soon they may need more branches on this Tree House.",4,3,2

(I am not a jerk...my friend is...just kidding =) My friend was having his going away party here and he reserved the rooms for a private party. Nope, he didn't have to pay extra or even put down a card. The problem was that we got there at 9:30 pm and he sent out the invitation for 10:30 pm. So, yea, for about an hour there were 4 of us and we had the two back rooms to ourselves. The bartender was totally cool with that. He imbued my friend with the power of kicking people out. That is pretty nice that he put the guests' needs ahead of the bar's. The bar staff is pretty chill and not snooty like other places. You wait at the bar to be assisted, they see you, you get your beer...no nonsense. The beer selection is pretty vast, and not too expensive, most are around $6. For New York, that is pretty good. I got the negra modelo served in a glass, solid. The atmosphere was that more of a cleaner dive. It is really casual, really laid-back and just a chill place to hang out. Thanks Treehouse!",6,1,2

He'll have a drink with you and carry a pleasant conversation.The layout of the bar is interesting, with some high stools by the bar, and a cool section up front in the window overlooking Greenwich Ave.  There is a secret room in the far back corner that my friends started calling the ""boom boom"" room.  It seats about 6 people comfortably, and there is no television in that room, but there is a window overlooking the backyard.  There's also a really cool ""back room"" with a long table surrounded by chairs and a giant TV over a non-working fireplace.  This is where we hung out...it's about three steps to the bar and three steps to the bathroom and three steps to the video games.  It was the perfect room.  This bar is awesome in my book for one main reason: Connect Four.  When you have no interest in sports, its' really fun to play a game or two of Connect Four (with friends or strangers).  See how alcohol affects your strategy.  I really liked the Greenwich Treehouse, and I'd go back, but even at 5:30pm on a Sunday, it was pretty quiet.  Maybe it's the inconsistent hours that throw off all the patrons...",1,,

I have this weird thing where I judge people for getting wine and a divey bar.  It seems pretentious to me.  Similarly, ordering a PBR at a 5-star restaurant just seems odd.  That being said, I got talked into a glass of red on Friday.  Two glasses were $12ish, but as I watched, every pour was really to the brim.  Someone else pointed out that the beer selection is kinda lacking, which I have to agree.  They apparently make their own beer (last time on tap was a brown) and it really doesn't hold up to other browns.  Maybe I will just have to be that girl...I also was a little mesmerized last time I went because they were playing 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It was pretty comical as the night wore on to get tipsy and see a bunch of people gawking at H.A.L.
