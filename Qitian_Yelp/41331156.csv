0,Estefania R.,"Chicago, IL",16,47,3,5.0,8/19/2018,"After doing a lot of research I'm so happy we choose this hotel. Location is amazing, 2 blocks away from Times Square, very convenient if you are planning to walk around this crazy city. Service was outstanding. Rooms are small but very comfortable and QUIET! Will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit NY!",1,,
1,Anne D.,"Centerport, NY",535,29,29,1.0,11/7/2018,"I stay in a lot of NYC hotels, normally not in Times Square but because I was working down the street I thought this would be convenient........Upon walking in you are hit in the face with an awful perfume Incense like smell (probably to mask the scent of the sketchy lurky pool located in lobby).....Front desk staff were pleasant. That is the only pleasant thing about this hotel!Everything is run down! The room was not fresh.... the bed linens had marks and holes in them. Moving on too my arrival back to hotel at night around 1am my daughter and I were grossed out already by look of room and we get in bed and I see what at first looks like a fuzzy brown thing much to my horror it was a bug! A small bed bug looking creature! I called front desk they offered another room... ummmmmm nooooo!We packed our stuff very quickly and left hotel ASAP! I rebooked another hotel that I knew right away on opposite side of town.... This hotel should be avoided! There's a reason price is not as high as others! You have been warned!",,,
2,Dhyia T.,"Denver, CO",314,98,227,4.0,4/11/2018,"Staying in Midtown sucks. Let's just start there. It's congested and dirty and it's super touristy. I always wonder about the people who invest in building hotels in this tight space. I will say that whoever sits on this board...created a unique experience and did a good job. It's important to note that I can't compare a NYC Manhattan hotel to other hotels in the country -- this is just a different monster. So yes, there are tons of hotels with tons of space that surpass this hotel, but your in midtown where there is just not enough space - period. Okay, let's get started. Checking-inThe front desk staff was so amazing. They engaged in light polite conversation and were so kind with great customer service. They went through the check-in process so quickly so I could get into my room and relax. In fact, the room that I initially had didn't work for me and they were able to find a room where I could be more comfortable without protest, in fact she went through the available rooms and upgraded me. That felt great. The RoomIt's NYC, so don't expect a room with a view, but I got a sliver of the street with a good amount of natural light. The room was sizable with a comfy king size bed.  Now, the shower! YASSSSS! Life changing. That's all I'm gonna say. I stayed in room 604. It was divine. Lots of pressure for an old building. Great for washing hair. Amenities If you are looking for a pool with a swim up bar, you don't have to go all the way to Caribbean for it. This hotel has it!!!! It's the coolest thing. With black lighting and a sauna room. The pool is behind the front desk and right next to the bar. Such a genius idea. I wish I had time to take a dip. But definitely check it out. They have a gym and also breakfast served everyday too (it didn't come with my rate). OverallIf you must stay in Midtown, then I would highly recommend this hotel. I mean it's next to a popular Irish pub!! The staff is friendly and put you first. The rooms are spacious and thoughtful with excellent showers. And the amenities are creative and thoughtful. Enjoy your stay!",3,2,4
3,Mike S.,"Long Island, NY",638,624,2753,4.0,8/10/2017,"Although I live close to NYC, from time to time, on special occasions we like to rent a hotel room directly in the pit of hell.. um.. er.. Time Square. It's nice to enjoy a show, have dinner/drinks along with a nightcap without worrying about how am I going to get home. Just stumble down the street and land on your rented bed.Truly, Room Mate Grace was a nice place to land. The small hotel room is well thought out along with a lot of style. The shower is a large space with a rainfall head to get you nice and soaked. Our queen sized bed was upon a platform, which might make people with mobility issues struggle to enter, but I found it fun. Sink outside the pocket doored toilet and shower area so your roommate can finish getting ready while you shower. Our hallway wallpaper had me trippin' out with the alternating stripes.Most importantly the room was quiet even with a large window facing the street and the AC kept the room nice and cool. All very comfortable.Buffet style breakfast was included in our rate. It had a large variety in the mirrored eating area. Scrambled eggs, bacon, yogurt, juices, fruit, breads, muffins, donuts, espresso machine and even pancakes at a touch of a button. There is a small pool, which is nice but seems more like a novelty for such a large hotel.",18,12,11
4,Cecelia C.,"Orlando, FL",96,196,684,3.0,3/22/2018,I have mixed feelings about this hotel but here are some pros and cons from my 2 night stay.Pros- Conveniently located next to Times Square - A wide selection of breakfast items and healthy options as well (note: breakfast is not included in stay)- Bed and pillows are soft and comfortable - Despite some issues at check in and check out the customer service was very good to resolve all issues - Complimentary ice water in the lobbyCons- Rooms are small. We got upgraded to an executive room and it was a standard size room. - The executive room (1605) has no door to the shower/sink area. The only door is for the bathroom.- The hallways are dark and have a funky unpleasant odor- Elevators doors did not work well. Kept opening / closing for no reason.,2,,
5,Missy F.,"Arlington, VA",6,29,6,5.0,10/28/2018,"I gave my assistant a few requests: a hotel in New York that was centrally located, clean (read those yelp reviews!), and affordable. This was perfect. The rooms are modern and look great, it had fun bath products (does this only matter to me?) and clean. I had a great stay here, highly recommend it!",,,
6,Reem C.,"Lemont, IL",0,18,0,5.0,10/27/2018,"This hotel wowed us. The service was amazing especially Tyshana and Francisco. The breakfast was the best any hotel can offer, the room was clean and the pool was amazing. This hotel was a true gem.",,,
7,Ashley N.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",175,1,4,5.0,5/29/2018,"My husband and I chose this hotel based on its location and unique style and we couldn't have been happier! We were able to upgrade to a King Suite for an extra $15/night (totally worth it!), the staff was incredibly accommodating, and the room was beautiful! We thoroughly enjoyed the unique decor of our room, extremely comfortable bed and luxurious walk-in shower with rainfall shower head. Loved every minute of our stay! Our only complaint was that we didn't get to visit the beautiful pool and sauna areas because they close entirely too early. Everything in NYC is open so late so we wouldn't arrive back to our room for the evening until midnight or later. It would have been nice to be able to unwind with a dip in the pool after our long, daily adventures. Other than that, the stay was perfect! Thank you!",,,
8,Jasmit D.,"Modesto, CA",12,119,89,5.0,7/3/2017,"My husband and I traveled to NYC for the first time and we were able to get a room at the Grace. Let me start off by saying that it is a very young and hip hotel. They have all these different patterns on the wall and its young and fun!! The staff is amazing!! I remember one day one of them was singing really loud, on top of being cute! He was a great singer too. All the staff and receptionist were young and fun as well. And also very very polite!! Now I'm not saying that this hotel is only for young people. It's not. It's for everyone!! The vibe just gives off fun. The location could not be better. You are surrounded by great restaurants. Times Square is only a walk away. You could not ask to be in a better location. The room my husband and I got was a small room. But honestly we didn't need anything bigger. It had a big bed. Bathroom was nice and clean. The hotel itself was clean. And the bar area is very nice. I'm sure if we ever decide to go NYC again. we will be staying at the grace because of our amazing first experience there!! Thank you.",4,,2
9,Erin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,89,14,3.0,2/20/2018,"I love the line of Room Mate hotels, and have been spoiled at the two in Florence, Italy. This one has the benefit of a great staff and location and bathroom, but the rest was not enough to return.Our queen room (#407) was extremely small, with hardly anywhere to put bags. We asked for a quiet room away from 45th street so had a back view. The black color scheme made it feel even more claustrophobic. We called our room the Black Hole. The bed was fairly comfortable, but the platform means one person is literally crawling across the bed every time to get in or out because there is no perimeter where you can walk on the floor.The amenities were very spare, we had to chase down a bottle opener and were told to bring it back right away as the hotel only has one...? Sergio at the front desk was friendly and efficient. The bathroom was very nice with great hot water pressure. Next time we will find another hotel line, and stay further away from Times Square in favor of more Square Footage. ; )",1,,
10,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",383,633,1398,4.0,2/10/2017,"Got to hang out in the lounge area, and it kinda looks like a cheap strip joint! Very cool though, you've got animal prints covering walls and ceilings and a lot of light and mirror ornaments. Boudoir feel. Warm and dark. The coolest part about this bar/lounge is the open window to the hotel pool. If you are in the pool, you actually can order a cocktail and sip it as you are hanging out in the water. Pretty awesome.",4,,4
11,Alicia W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",273,786,323,4.0,12/19/2016,"Fantastic location. We got a great price. Highly rated on TripAdvisor. Booked the room and then had to call back to change the reservation. Very accommodating. Great staff. 1 breakfast included with the room and it was pretty darn good. $13 for the extra person... if they even need to eat or want to eat at the hotel. Cute pool and a little workout area on the second floor. The staff is very, very, very accommodating.",3,,2
12,Nicole B.,"Buffalo, NY",171,268,272,5.0,3/16/2017,"I absolutely LOVED this boutique hotel! I specifically look for boutique hotels when traveling, because I can't stand the cookie-cutter look alike hotels.  I always like to enjoy something unique, that will remind me of the city I visit, instead of your typical Sheraton, Marriott, or Hilton, etc. I found this hotel on a travel site, and ended up getting a great price. I ran into some issues due to the severe storm the east coast had the 2nd weekend in February, leading to our outbound flight getting cancelled.  Unfortunately, we are delayed and not rescheduled to fly out for another 24+ hours later.  Since I was loosing an entire night/day at the hotel, I was worried about a refund.  I contacted the hotel and they couldn't have been more helpful.  They couldn't refund me directly because I booked through a 3rd party site, however they made all the calls to the 3rd party site to get my money refunded.  We arrived the next day, about 3 hours prior to their check in time (3pm), due to the flight being rescheduled.  We had a ton of luggage and carry-on's that they locked away for us until we could check in.  Everyone was so friendly and welcoming.The room was awesome! It wasn't large or roomy, but a perfect size for 2 people and for a weekend in NYC.  The decor was unique, modern, and fun! The bathroom was split in two - the shower and sink on one side of the walk way, and the toilet on the other side with a separate door.  I always appreciate this, as it's helpful when two people are getting ready in the same room whilst traveling.  The bed was spacious, and oh-so-comfy!  There was a mini bar/fridge, large closet, and large TV.  Everything was clean and perfect.The bar downstairs had a funky-modern lounge, and there was also a pool on the other side of the bar (we did not check that out tho).The only thing I didn't like, which had nothing to do with the hotel itself, just the logistics - the proximity to Times Square.  During this trip to NYC, I realized how much I couldn't STAND Times Square, and absolutely hated walking through it daily every time we left the hotel to get somewhere.  I would 100% recommend this hotel, I personally would just reconsider staying because of Times Square solely.",,,
13,Kate F.,"Cromwell, CT",87,32,21,4.0,8/22/2017,"First off, let me start by explaining my 4 star selection. The only reason it didn't receive 5 is because I've been blessed to stay in hotels that were larger, more amentities, etc.With that said, this hotel was wonderful! The trip was for my daughter and I to have a girls trip. We stayed in a queen size bed room and were comfortable. The beds are on a platform, which we found to be fun. The rooms are very small, but they do a great job of utilizing every inch. The shower was wonderful with its sunflower head! The wallpaper is so funky and fun! We told Eugene that it was my daughters birthday and he made sure there was a gourmet cupcake waiting in the room. Seriously, how sweet and kind is that!The entire staff was helpful and sweet.We will definitely come back!",1,,
14,Judy C.,"Chepachet, Chepachet, RI",3,2,0,5.0,4/16/2018,"We spent 7 days in NYC, staying at the Room Mate Grace hotel.  It was fantastic.  The hotel is located 1/2 block from Times Square so it couldn't be more convenient.  Our twin room was big enough for two people, the beds were really comfortable and we could hear no noise from the road.   A special thank you to Tashany, Sev, Sergio and Serg.  The staff were terrific.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and they were all smiles.  A real credit to the company.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, and I hope I am able to stay there again.",,,
15,Corissa A.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,1,0,5.0,2/26/2018,"This was my first time in NYC and based off the ratings I decided this was the best price and location for me. I had no idea how close we were to Times Square! It was awesome. We were able to walk to all of the local shops and restaurants! This hotel had a funky but pretty neat decor, that really stands out. But this hotel will forever hold a special place in my heart, because this is where I recently became engaged! I will definitely be back for another visit in the near future!",,,1
16,April I.,"Miami, FL",3,12,22,4.0,2/13/2018,"My husband and I stayed here for one night to celebrate his birthday. The room was very clean and smelled fresh all the time, the shower room was very spacious, and the breakfast was excellent! They served eggs, bacons, sausages, different selections of cereals/breads/muffins/bagels, cheese, ham and turkey, orange juice, pomelo juice,coffee and tea, and fresh fruits, and yogurts. My husband and I had a late checkout as well since after the heavy and hearty breakfast we had we felt sleepy that we had to take a nap, and the bed and pillows were so comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect as well since it's in Times Sq and it's right next to pubs and starbucks. The rooms are soundproof too. Im giving it less one star since thw location of their pool was a bit awkward for me because its overlooking the lobby and the hotel guests passing by can see you.. thats why we didnt decide to swim that day. But overall we had a great time!",,,
17,Troy H.,"Round Rock, TX",222,838,1260,5.0,9/13/2016,"Simply a great place to stay while in NYC. The location was great and the staff were really appreciative of us as guests.We spent about 4 nights/5 days here and we never had a worry or problem. The staff: Christopher, Stefan, Lou, and many others were always willing to help us with tips and tricks around NYC, get us VIP passes, and simply help our busy schedule go with ease.While we stayed there the hotel hosted a hip-hop bar/pool party and the staff maintained control of it the entire time while providing a good time to the attendees. The big selling point for me was the next day. The next day they actually drained and cleaned the entire pool area and still kept the hotel cleaned for other activities like breakfast buffets and the sort.Overall, for blindly searching out a hotel to stay in while visiting NYC, my research paid off well and I will always recommend them for a great location and visit.Side note, they are also two doors away from the Cranberry Cafe which is a cafe and market in one. So if you need late night snacks, drinks, or an affordable lunch it is just a few feet away at your leisure.",6,,1

19,Gigi L.,"Coronado, CA",283,298,357,1.0,5/24/2016,"They charged me for a one week stay, and I never even checked in. I got there super late, exhausted, and they couldn't find my res. They recommended another hotel, so I checked in there. Then they charged my card for the entire week for this hotel, too! I can't seem to get a return call from the manager so I am very frustrated. I stay in NYC in boutique hotels often and I have never had something this bizarre happen.  Ever. Steer clear or pay cash. That's my suggestion.",3,,
20,Karen R.,"Palo Alto, CA",116,31,0,5.0,5/31/2017,"This hotel deserves a 5 star rating if only for its room rates and location. My husband and I traveled to New York during graduation week when hotels were full and rates were exorbitant. I would have preferred to stay in Brooklyn because it's quieter there but he wanted to stay in Manhattan, so Manhattan it was. I made an earlier reservation at a chain hotel. Then I found Room Mate Grace Hotel. Wow! That price for the location? And with very good reviews, too. So I booked it and canceled my other reservation. I am glad I did.This hotel is literally a few steps away from Times Square. Very easy access to subway, cabs, Uber, Lyft, and other forms of public transportation. If you're a tourist, this location is perfect.We stayed in a queen room which was very small and without much navigation space. If you have a lot of luggage, you might have a problem because there's nowhere to store them. The bed was on a platform and since I am not so young and fit, I had a hard time getting on and off it, especially since my side of the bed was against the windows. The room was quite dark, too. There was a main light when you enter and a lamp on each side of the bed as well as reading lights but those were the only lights. The bathroom was quite big in relation to the size of the room. I loved the shampoo and conditioner that they provided.The hotel is along 45th street, in the middle of a very busy tourist destination. Somehow, the noise from the street at night didn't bother me. However, on my last night, there was construction work with a lot of pounding during the wee hours of the morning; and that woke me up.There is a breakfast spread that is worth its price. It is very convenient.It is a small hotel and not too many people so there's not a lot of competition on the elevator; which is nice because that is an issue in the chain hotels I stayed in. I would recommend this hotel to tourists with tight budget. It definitely is worth your money.",,,
21,Taylor B.,"New York, NY",24,53,75,4.0,2/14/2017,"Looks are deceiving rooms are smaller than what the picture is displayed online.  Reminds me ofparis hotels. I Love the new decor, staff is great. Everything is small  hallways , sauna rooms. Ughh can i say claustrophobia. Overall it's a nice low key spot. Pool bar makes up for everything. Beware Call in advance pool might reserved.",3,,
22,Roxanne O.,"Lyndhurst, OH",35,508,240,4.0,6/16/2016,"I was pleasantly surprised by Room Mate Grace. I got an amazing deal on booking.com and got a nice queen room on the third floor for two nights for under $600. The decor in the hotel is...different. And they pipe in a perfume smell a la Abercrombie and Fitch. But my room was clean and the staff was friendly. My room had a platform bed. Not sure how to people would be able to stay in the room unless the person sleeping closer to the wall never had to go to the bathroom. I'm not short by any means, but I kind of had to hurdle to get into bed. This definitely wouldn't be optimal for someone with mobility issues. The one good and bad thing about the hotel is its proximity to Times Square. I was in town for work and had no time or desire to go sightseeing, and it was hard to get an Uber at peak times. I would definitely stay in this hotel again!",2,,
23,Kathi K.,"Howard, MD",0,14,0,5.0,11/20/2017,"We had a rough start with a room that had a broken heater, but they took us seriously and made good on the problem. They were fully booked for the King rooms, only had a basic available. They moved us, took 30% off the entire bill (not just one night) and promised us (and came thru) a King room the next night. Also comped us breakfast the next morning. When I complimented them on taking care of the problem, they graciously gave us breakfast the next morning too!The location is perfect, beds are very comfortable, and everything is clean. I wish the pool was open later but really, we enjoyed the place.",,,

The host/doorman made us feel very welcomed and the front desk staff were very friendly and enjoyable to talk to. The room was tiny- to be expected but the beds were very comfortable and the air was nice and cold making for a really cozy nights sleep. For lunch we grabbed paninis from Cranberry (next door) and ate next to the pool, then took a dip before heading back out to the craziness of the city. The staff really came through after I left items in the safe and they mailed everything back so quickly.

27,Amy S.,"Houston, TX",178,3,4,3.0,2/26/2018,"If you think you'll be able to use the indoor pool at this hotel, you're wrong. One of the reasons we booked here is because of the indoor pool but it was closed majority of our stay because of private events. It was also closed because during one of those events someone broke the light inside the pool so they had to completely drain it to fix it. We could've stayed at another hotel in the same location if we had known that they were going to cater more to outsiders than actual guests. The pool should not be listed as one of the amenities if it's not going to always be available. I called to explain this to the front desk and was informed by Sergio that people do not book for amenities, they only book for the room. Um.. aren't amenities listed to help people decide which hotel to stay at? and being that the pool is listed multiple times on Hotels Tonight you'd think guests would come first to using the pool.  Very disappointed with how Sergio handled the situation. Also, the room is clean and the bed is comfortable but it is VERY small. The closet door is extremely loud every time you open/close it.",,,

31,Kathy T.,"San Francisco, CA",197,92,133,4.0,8/21/2015,"My review is relevant only for the hotel aspect, not the clubbing/bar/pool scene.  That said, I had a smooth check-in, even coming very very late in the evening (checking in around 11pm).  On a different evening of my stay in New York, a late night check-in had resulted in my room being given away for ""unforeseen circumstances"" and I was deferred to a sister hotel and had a complicated time tracking down my refunds.  Therefore, coming into this situation a bit wary, I was pleased that I had a room that faced 45th street (as opposed to facing an alley or a wall or a vent, etc) upon my arrival.Hotel Location: The highlight of this boutique hotel is definitely the location.  Half a block from Times Square, nestled between the Hyatt hotel and a local pub, this decorated hotel is perfectly located in a central hub that makes almost everything in Manhattan accessible. It's 3 blocks away from the nearest subway line.  It's walking distance to Times Square and Rockafeller, and if you're an ambitious walker, the southern edge of Central Park. Hotel Room Quality: There was a strange and trippy wallpaper design in the hallway (specifically on the 4th floor, not sure if it was the same at every level) that was comprised of thin vertical black and white stripes.  Had there been a strobe light, I would have had a seizure. Just walking past the stripes made me dizzy and lose depth perception.  Not sure if that's a pro or a con. Speaking of wallpaper, everything was very modern and clean, but my room was particularly dark because of the navy tile and navy wallpaper.  The gold accents on the wallpaper did little to lighten the mood of the room, but overall, it was nice.  The bed was raised, and sandwiched into the corner of the room adjacent to a tiny closet that doubled as a mirror.  The pillows and bedding were comfortable, clean, and crisp. The bathroom was partitioned from the bed area, but had no door, so expect to be cozy and comfortable with your roomie.  The shower head rained straight down, but the water pressure could have been improved.  The only complaint was the shower drain was not in the best condition, allowing water to pool around my ankles.  This was a bit concerning because I wondered what other gunky shower water could have flowed back up and out of the drain and gotten on my feet. Hotel Room Size: It is New York, and not only New York, but Manhattan, and not only Manhattan, but Times Square.  Yes, the room is small. No, you won't be able to house an obnoxious number of people in a single bed room spilt 1 room 4 ways to game the system and keep your trip cheap.  No, you won't be able to have a dance party or do acrobatics or cartwheels across the room.  This hotel room is best used for getting a solid night's sleep (bring earplugs, dump trucks, drunk tourists/locals, and construction around Times Square make noises that windows just can't keep out).  Overall, my experience was pretty satisfactory here.  My company paid a bit of a high price for a last minute reservation for this room as a part of my work trip, but it was worth it. The location was prime, and really on par with the pricing for other hotels in that area.  Having seen the quality vs price of some other hotels near the Empire State building, I felt like I got a fair price for the room I paid for.  There are some pretty shady rundown hotels that look more like halfway houses in the area, and those are cheap alternatives to this for those who are looking for something more affordable.  Would I come back? Sure, if the occasion is right! To some, the nightly rates here might considered a ripoff, but for the big city experience, it is expected.",3,,4
32,Stephanie H.,"Seattle, WA",81,190,26,4.0,7/7/2017,"I really have enjoyed my stay so far at room mate grace, I was bummed that I couldn't check into my hotel early, there was no flexibility from the front desk staff however they were very friendly. my room was very clean and the location is unbeatable. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the bar with Ronny! I'm taking away a star because the pool closes at 8, it should close when the bar closes or it should be open 24 hours since  there is not a lifeguard on staff and it's not on a floor where guests sleep. I would have enjoyed it after my dinner and before bed for sure. The bed is really comfy and my room was really clean. So far so great, I would def stay again!",,,

I recently booked it for a night of staycation. For me the big draw was the pool, sauna & especially the steam room. They recently had a renovation that included removing the steamroom (the best part). The pool which is already small and clearly built for adults to enjoy closes early (used to never close) and there are tons of kids, which I suppose is fine if you have kids. The breakfast, which used to be included in now $16 and is one of the worst I've ever had anywhere. Save yourself the $16 and go next door to the deli and get yourself something much better for less than half the price. They have lost my business. Fail.",3,,

Rooms so dark, no lights. Should hav told us needed key to turn lights on. Loved the bed & sheets- so comfy & clean. Wall paper dark. Didn't spend much time in room but clean & nice. Water pressure great. Needed towels, said they would send- no one came. Next day called again. He asked what sign is on door? I answered, yes come in. He said, better if no sign. Silly- no sign is better than COME IN. Just say sorry & send towels. Quiet, no noise. Slept great.Left hotel & went left, walked all the away around to get to Times Square, duh.

38,Phyllis M.,"Summit, NJ",16,5,0,1.0,2/16/2017,"My husband and I checked into this hotel for our little Valentine get-away on 2/13/17.  We chose the hotel, in large part, because of the indoor pool/bar.  Both my husband and I confirmed several times before and after we checked in that the pool was open until 10p.m. the day we were there and the bar opened at 5p.m.  We thought the hotel was really cute with nice little touches including 2 for 1 drink coupons.  We came back to our hotel in the early evening to enjoy the pool and our free drinks.  We went to our room and changed into our suits and headed down to enjoy the pool bar.  As we exited the elevator there was a rope across the entrance to the pool/bar.  We were told that the entire bar and pool area was closed for a private event.  I was livid considering that,just a couple of hours before, we had confirmed the pool/bar hours. I spoke to the man at the front desk who was immediately rude and dismissive.  He told me that they had ""just"" booked the private event which was already in progress.  I asked to speak to the manager who had the same dismissive/""we don't really care"" attitude.  He advised me that the web site says the pool could be closed.  I understand that but it was unacceptable to tell a guest multiple times that the amenities were available up to a couple of hours before and then shut the area down.  I honestly do not believe that the private event was actually booked on the spur of the moment. There were no other bars or restaurants on the premise so my husband and I had to go back upstairs, get dressed, and go back out into the city again.  I would never recommend this hotel.",1,,

43,Nunya B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,11,0,5.0,12/29/2016,"The location can't be beat! It's literally a half block off of Times Square and within walking distance to a number or major attractions, including Rockefeller Plaza, St Patrick's Cathedral, Trump Tower, 5th Avenue's designer row, Bryant Park, etc. Plenty of dining and theater opportunities within a block or two. 2-3 blocks from the nearest subway access, I believe. The rooms are small, but as to be expected for a boutique hotel. Very Euro feeling. There are several room configurations to choose from. We had the triple, which was a queen bed, with a ladder to a single bed overhead. (Might remind you of cruise accommodations.) Very comfortable, very well appointed with modern fixtures. The bathroom was plenty spacious (no tub, but a huge stand up shower with rainfall shower head). The shampoo/soaps were delightful. In-room safe available (free), along with a mini bar and snack tray (not complimentary.) One interesting thing was that we entered the room, which was tucked back in a corner, in total darkness. None of the light switches appeared to work until we realized that you have to insert your room key in this little wall mounted slot to get power to anything in the room. I assume this is to help save energy, by shutting everything off when you take your key and leave the room. Pretty cool! We paid a little extra for the breakfast, which was quite nice and allowed us to eat quickly and get our day started. It had quite a spread of continental breakfast treats, along with a hot option of scrambled eggs and either sausage or bacon, as well as a waffle machine. The pool, with swim-up bar, is small but very cool. Looks like they have DJ's and pool parties in the evenings, but we didn't have time to check them out. The staff couldn't have been more friendly or accommodating. As we went out on our last night, we had asked for some transportation info relating to our departure travel the next day. They sent us on our way to enjoy our evening, but did all of the research and had our routes mapped out and print r for us when we returned late that night. They were awesome! We did find discounted rates on one of the travel search sites, but ended up with an even better deal by visiting the hotel's direct site and taking advantage of a deal they offered for joining their email list. We'll definitely be going back!",,1,

46,Micaela G.,"Austin, TX",37,207,51,5.0,1/22/2014,"Stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed myself! It's a cute little boutique hotel and right in the middle of everything. It's a smaller hotel with small rooms, however, this is New York-what on earth do you expect? It was however definitely not cramped and I was perfectly comfortable.. the layout is what makes a difference. My room was a long rectangle so the toilet and bed didn't feel right on top of each other, and the shower and toilet are side by side with a wall in between-which I love for privacy. The bed is on top of a platform which was great for throwing my suitcase underneath to make extra room.. they also equip the room with an empty fridge, and a safe. The incidental deposit was only $25 which is like.. unheard of in NYC. Also, free wifi with a really strong signal-what?They have a breakfast as well (till noon! no waking up early to rush downstairs) for $10 per person in the cutest dining room, and it was a good little mix of everything. The staff was really charming and helpful, and stowed my bag when I showed up too early to check in. They have a pool/sauna/bar/gym as well which I didn't get to use but I peeked in and it was really nice. The bed was comfortable and clean, and the noise from the street wasn't too bad.. you expect 24/7 honking when staying in Times Square but I only really heard loud truck horns or sirens, but not enough to wake/keep me up. I was also staying alone and never felt uncomfortable or unsafe-in the hotel or walking back.Not really the vibe for kids, but I will definitely stay here again while visiting NY. I had a friend in town at the same time staying at a Westin and she went on about how much she would have rather stayed at my hotel.

I can't say anything about the rooms since we were only in the city to party. We were SO lucky to have had a hookup, otherwise I very much doubt our group of 50+ would have been able to get in. We ordered several bottles and those that didn't contribute, paid at the bar. TOTALLY agree with Dave H. when he says this is a terrible idea. Popping bottles is the way to go. We had Ciroc Coconut with pineapple, which the lovely waitress recommended. We were in the upper section of the club, overlooking the pool.Speaking of which, I really didn't like the pool. I .. don't get it. The whole place smelled like chlorine and felt really muggy. Not only that, the d-bags in the pool kept aiming their inflated beach balls at our group. Several people were hit with the wet beach balls and many, many drinks were knocked out of hands. Some sort of barrier (glass, perhaps) should be installed upstairs to prevent this from happening. *shrug* Like I said, I don't really ""get"" why the pool was there in the first place. I don't know what this adds to a nightclub.Anyhow, the event was a lot of fun and my group got very drunk. The music was Top 40s and just .. okay. I'd go back!",1,7,5

It IS New York, after all - not sure what some of these reviewers expected, but it was great for the two of us. I booked a Superior King Room. When I'm in NYC, I sure don't spend time in my room! I just need a place to lay my head, in between! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is I did have an issue with the standard of daily cleaning from the housekeeping staff. Let me be clear, the hotel is, by no means, unkept or dirty. It was very neat and clean, overall. My only issue was that my bathroom mirrors, glass shower doors and bathroom counter top, we're not wiped down on a daily basis. I would see the same spots on the mirror at the end of the day, for example. I also don't know if my floor was vacuumed every day, either. I don't think it was. Also, I stayed for 5 nights and I know that my sheets were not changed while I was there. By no means was it dirty, just expected a bit more from housekeeping.  I did discuss this with a very nice girl at the front counter and she was very apologetic and said that she would let housekeeping know. Even offered me free breakfast! I appreciated her taking the time, if even just to listen! Overall, a great stay and I would definitely stay there again!",2,,

Its lobby was very small and busy, but we didn't mind that. Their doorman seemed to be really nice. It was an expensive stay. Everything seemed not too bad until the last day of our stay.We checked out pretty early in the morning on the last day and asked to store our suitcases in their storage place. Their staff seemed really helpful and nice. We came back in late afternoon and took all our suitcases and took a cab to New Jersey. After we checked in to the hotel in New Jersey, I opened my carry-on size suitcase, I realized that both my iPad and GPS were gone. I called the hotel right away and was told the manager wasn't there at the moment. I called back later and got to talk to their manager about my stolen properties. He (I forgot his name) said there was a camera recording their storage area and he would check its footage. He called back the second day and told me no one touched my suitcases and it must be me forgetting where I put GPS and iPad. I was going to California for a job interview the second day, so I had no time to deal with them and decided to just let this go. However, two months later, I came back to New York and saw photos synced from my stolen iPad to iCloud and showed up on my iPhone. I called the police and they asked me when I realized they were stolen. I said when I was in New Jersey. Of course they didn't want to their job and help, and told me to go to New Jersey to report it.

Okay so regardless to what everyone else was doing, I managed to have a good time.  Unfortunately, I would never go back again.  There are NO LOCKER ROOMS TO CHANGE INTO OR OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES.  You will have to change in a bathroom the size of any McDonald's or gas station bathroom.  There are two bathrooms with one toilet & a sink in each.  Just imagine waiting behind people that have to change their clothes. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!  How do you have a steam room & no locker rooms?  The pool should not be open to the public.  It should be for hotel guests only & it is the smallest indoor pool i've ever seen.  I had a shot of ciroc.  Literally a SHOT. $15?? are you freaking kidding me? $15 for A SHOT? Puff Daddy might even think that mess is crazy.Long story short, I had a good time because we made the best of a bad situation.  I would never go there again & would not recommend anyone else go, unless you have a room in the hotel or feel like blowing money on bs drinks.  Oh, & they don't accept credit cards so expect to spend $4 to withdraw money from the ATM if you forget.",9,7,

It was a bit weird because you would not expect to smell chlorine upon walking into a hotel lobby. Anyways, the bartender was nice and friendly. Drinks can be charged to the room if you are a guest. The price of the drinks was a bit expensive as expected since the hotel is smack in the middle of tourist driven Times Square.

Granted, many of them are about a bad experience at a pool party, but the front desk attendant informed me that the hotel no longer offers these parties, due to noise complaints. Anyway, this is the most unique hotel I've ever been to. If you are looking for something full service and luxurious with lots of space, room service, and concierge, you will not be happy. This is nothing like a Sheraton or Marriott, and the style is very European. The layout kind of resembles the artsy downtown lofts I've seen in Houston, and it felt like somewhere I would want to live. I loved the laid-back atmosphere and the lack of pretension. Also, Ronny and the ladies at the desk were helpful and very friendly. The indoor pool has a pretty lights, comfortable seating, and a SWIM-UP BAR!! Which I have not seen in NYC until now. The walk-in rain shower was impressively huge and I also liked the closet space and refrigerator. The wifi was fast and free.

64,M.K. T.,"Somerset, NJ",7,24,1,3.0,3/31/2014,"My wife and I had evening tickets for Raisin in the Sun at the Barrymore a couple blocks over so I decided to book a room here for some R&R afterwards.  Having read some of the earlier reviews about noise and chlorine smells, I requested a room on a high floor.  We were situated on the 14th floor, which was indeed nice and quiet in relation to the lower levels.  However, it is true that you can smell the chlorine from the lobby, and there is a definite level of elevated humidity/dampness throughout the hotel, even on higher floors.  It wasn't super off-putting but noticeable.The room itself wasn't a standout - small (but not cramped), clean and neatly furnished.  The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom (shower, no tub) was decently sized for the compact space.  Fridge (with adjustable temperature control!) was a plus, but the tiny flat screen TV with half of the channels not working was a minus.  And of course, my recurring pet peeve of standard def channels on a HD capable TV was present and another minus.  Wifi didn't work either, which is another negative being that pulling LTE signal in NYC drains your phone battery something awful.Although I booked partly because of the novelty of the pool with swim up bar (which definitely seems priced in), unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try it out before showtime.  When we returned at night we found that it had converted into a makeshift club/lounge.  I don't mind people aiming to getting their groove or smooth on but the line to get in extended into the elevator area.  I understand you guys have space concerns but surely the queuing could be done a bit less invasively.No restaurant or room service, though there are juices, waters, soda, and beers downstairs behind the front desk for purchase and there are a number of different dining options up and down the block.  Service was adequate but not notable.  The elevators had TV screens that I imagine are supposed to be programmed with a video looping *something* but they just had a DVD video main menu staring back at us. All in all, a decent, clean, no frills place to stay in Midtown but nothing to draw me here again for a repeat visit.  Maybe I can barter my tech support services to 'em for a couple free nights.  At least that way they'll get sound on HBO.  Otherwise, I'll probably be trying my luck elsewhere next time.",2,,

The Room Mate chain who already had some really sweet looking boutique hotel in their portfolio picked it up and has further developed the concept.Rooms are tiny in the New York sense but the fantastic King beds make up for it. The feel is very European with just frosted glass covering your shower sessions. Make sure you're with company you don't mind showing your great shape to as they'll be able to take it all in!The reason I keep returning to this place all these years later however... Even native New Yorkers are surprised to learn that right by Times Square there's a Swim-up bar with the best pool parties the city has to offer (a scant offering but still).

Yep, you read that right, there's a pool, more like a wading pool, but dayam, girls, you all planned this one out huh? Nice view... if you get my drift.Did not plan to be here, otherwise, I would have brought my own bathing suit. Hot stuff, hot crowd. Drinks are super pricey ($15 for one vodka redbull), but I liked the idea of Dave H, booking a hotel room and changing and drinking in your room before coming down here. Regardless, I'm glad I found this slightly scandalous NYC gem.",1,2,1
67,Ashley R.,"Bronx, NY",78,2,2,1.0,7/5/2016,I came in with my friend to check in at 2:50 and I gave the front desk my id and my bank card I had a temporary bank card but it says the bank name because I lost my card ..the front desk lady said I can't use that because it's pre paid how the hell is a bank card pre paid ?? Anyways my friend had to use his card and show id and we checked in about 4:20 we got upstairs the room was small we had 2 bunk beds moving forward I invited some friends it was about 10 of us we got in the pool .. Pool was amazing and the security let us stay a hour extra which was 12pm but it ordinary closes at 11pm after went upstairs had drinks and a different security guard came up stairs and said he is giving us 1 warning to lower down cool we just decided to go to the bar on 47 around 2am just so we won't get kicked out .. I came back around 4 am went to sleep I checked out the next day with my friend who card was being used at the hotel and they said since their was a lot of noise and people they would have to charge us 150 extra like are you kidding me ??? They gave us only one warning and if they thought it was to much people why didn't they say anything when they seen all of us going up stairs ?? But back to the 150 I feel like it's bullshit they charging us 150 if they gave us only 1 warning and plus we wasn't their this stay was bullshit ! And a rip off plus they kept the $50 deposit,1,1,

The Posh decor, the front desk, just the dramatic entry into the hotel, very nice. This is truly perfect for a girly girl or planning an amazing girls weekend. Located in the Theatre District, smack in the whirlwind of Times Square. They have truly paid attention to every detail. You aren't just your credit card.  Very laid back, upscale, professional.  I love the  minimalist  feel to this hotel, not over run with people, busyness, traffic, especially given the location.  Kind of like they know they are cute, so you don't need to tell them! You could step right outside and be swept away, just like that!  We were upgraded to a beautiful King suite , because of technical issues at no cost to us. I was amazed at the size of our suite given our proximity to Times Square . It is practically right outside your door.  The decor , nice, felt like I was home.  This bed, absolutely amazing! I wish I could take this with me! I can't sleep, it's too quiet and comfortable here.  But I like that.  Youre not in your suite long enough to nit pic every single detail, if you are here for business or pleasure,  not in this place, it serves it's purpose , in an elegant way, I'm sure it's good for a small family, but I'd recommend you stay at a larger chain for more family friendly accommodations! But this one here , strictly I'd say is all adult , seriously for the grown and sexy!  Perfect for couples , and like I said a great girls getaway!  Mini bar, came loaded. Drinks, wine, beer, snacks , amazing closet space, iron, board, bathroom , nice, tub and shower, on one side, toilet separated on opposite side of bathroom for privacy.  Living room Perfection!  Absolutely comfortable.  Equipped with safe and a mini coffee bar.  There is no way you couldn't have access to every need, it's at your feet! Bring comfortable shoes, lots of energy and plenty of money and check in at Room Mate Grace. It's an amazing representation of what a Boutique Hotel truly is.  It really is a fantastic place to stay if you are looking to be in the center of it all and have that New York Experience.",,,

(next door--went on AT ALL HOURS of the day/night, 3AM JACKHAMMERING made it impossible to sleep--and we were on the 9th floor!!!)-very small TV-strong chlorine smell on first two levels (didn't bother us, but may bother some; can smell from outside hotel)",5,,

I never went into any of the rooms, so my review is solely on the lounge areas.It's an interesting concept: a three level place- first level, being lounge/bar, second level- being pool, third level- being dance area. It's also definitely a tad small. I thought it was nicely kept up though, and for its small-ness, it's actually a cute place to be, if you want to hang out with a close group of friends. It's not a huge party place at all, but I thought it was still rather cute- you're sitting in a lounge, then ppl go up to the bar, dripping weight from the pool, while you hear the DJ playing music in the background....Hmmm.

How many club/lounges do you go to (outside of Vegas) where there's a pool?? The pool isn't really for swimming though, seeing that it looked to be about only waist-deep for most people. Still a good place to pretend like it's summer in the dead of winter!Crowd was only alright, and the space for dancing was pretty small, as were the spaces allotted for each individual table.

A few of my friends have had parties at the downstairs bar that is adjacent to the swimming pool. The swimming pool is always lit up with hues of purple, pink, and blue lighting.

The location of the hotel was perfect! Room was clean and quiet. Small of course but that is what makes it NYC. The bunk beds made a fun adventure for my boys and I.Best of all, the people were INCREDIBLE. FSD Luis, Jasmin and Chantell made the hotel stay one of the best parts.

79,Kim R.,"New York, NY",305,111,56,3.0,5/30/2013,"Overall, I enjoyed staying here. The staff was very pleasant and generally helpful. But things just KEPT going wrong - including the fact that the pool was closed - the very reason I booked here! The pool thing wasn't exactly their fault and they did everything they could to try and make things right by me on all accounts. But their up-front communication before checking in is poor. I was repeatedly given bad information and the on-site staff had to keep making up for that. The ""too-cool-for-school"" boutique hotel is very conveniently close to Times Square and Rockefeller Center! But do not stay here if you are not young and/or nimble. Getting in and out of the bed is no joke! I should have gotten a 9.5 for the dismount. Also, the rooms are very Euro-tiny so if you are sharing space you had better be close friends. You can also hear through the walls if your neighbors are noisy - or you are. Only the shower or the toilet can have a closed door at any given time. Choose wisely. Cleanliness was good on check-in. But not sure what the maid did to my room besides making the bed. Continental breakfast is available downstairs in the morning. For some reason they include marshmallows. Cool!Clean, modern & friendly, I say stay, if you are aware of all of the above and it doesn't really matter to you since you won't be spending much time in the room anyway... and are able to get into bed like you are mounting a gymnastics high horse.",,4,

The upsetting thing is new management changed rules way too much and that shows me that they are not professional.  The first time I went there, they didn't allow me to go in to the party event, because I was not wearing a collar shirt (first the invitation states you can wear a nice t-shirt; so they going against what is posted to wear for the party.  The party is a pool party, so the minute I go through those doors my clothes will be off)...  So I have to go to Aeropostle to buy a tennis shirt to get through TRAP NUMBER ONE!  Coat Check: TRAP NUMBER TWO they want you to leave your bags there at coat check.  How I was suppose to go in the pool with my camera or iPhone (I am planning to take pictures of the event with my friends at the bloody party?)  They made no sense.  I left my bag at coat check; when I was ready to leave, it took them 30 mins to find my bag.... WOWWWWWWW, why do a coat check?Drinks are water down, I'm not kidding!  Can I get White Russian or sexual orgasm drink?  Their response, ""We do not make college drinks.""  B-tch, that is not a college drink, if you go overseas you see them there.  IF you do not know how to make the drink I WILL TEACH YOU!!!!

It was one of my best friends 25th birthday and we all were EXTREMELY excited to go, pool party in the spring!!! Why not? But quickly after arrival our excitement turned into disgust! The 1 hour vodka open bar was great and what made it greater was I arrived at 11pm (when the open bar was suppose to be over) and the bartender still allowed me to get drinks so thank you to her!! But on to the main event ...My friend had been working with a ""party planner"" and he did nothing to plan. He told my friend our VIP Seating area was behind the DJ booth so we headed up only to find our VIP Area was the Sauna Room!!!! No seating! And we had to drag over a stool. Ok, we decided to change into our swimsuits. My friend was told by the ""party planner"" there was 4 rooms as changing rooms ...HE LIED! the rooms he spoke of were the two unisex bathrooms! 15 girls had to squeeze into the bathrooms and try to change, one of the bathrooms was smoke filled!! The two women in there before us were smoking cigarettes, in the bathroom! ok, we tried to rub that off also we headed back to our ""VIP Area"" to drink (the deal she paid for listed 2 bottles of Rosè included in her package...if you go to event bright page it also says that...) but we were QUICKLY surprised when the ""bottle girl"" asked us for a extra $60 dollars for the bottles.  HUH?! that's suppose to be included...No again the ""party planner"" LIED!! it was not included. And in order to get the bottle we had to pay and when we confronted him he laughed and said he told my friend it was extra and he DIDNT! Not In the emails nor text messages! He didn't try to help he just laughed !!! He was clear he scams a lot of people!! and to add on to it the ""bottle girl"" (can't remember her name but she was Hispanic) had a BAD attitude and was rude to all of us!! She said they ran out of sparklers for my friends bottles but when I went downstairs I saw her bring out sparklers for someone else's bottles. I asked her about it she said ""ooppps I just found some"" and grinned. LIED! They only wanted cash we would have had EXTRA if we knew we would be paying extra for EVERYTHING! but the ATM machine wasn't working! so my friend and I had to walk to the bank IN OUR SWIMSUITS!!!!

They're also obnoxiously strict about their coat check policy. You must pay the $2 coat check. It's ridiculous. It's one of those places that's neither here nor there. It could be a 4* place if you came here with the right people or a 2* place because of all the obnoxious crowd who came for the ""Ooh, a pool and a bar! How chic!""If you came here with a bunch of friends, I can imagine that this is a pretty fun place to party. There's a shallow pool with a swim-up bar, a steam room, and pretty good music and drinks. All and all, the makings of a place that fun and a little different from your usual lounge/club in New York.On the other hand, if you came here with the mind that you wanted to party and have a good time but didn't come with a bunch of friends, this might not be the best place. The crowd can be rather obnoxious (drunk people + water = bad news). There's no dance floor. Instead there's a lot of wet people (and not in a good way) running around getting you and your stuff wet (and not in a good way). If you wanted to come here just wanting to relax and chill, this isn't the place to do it. While there always been plenty of seating (one of the few lounges in Manhattan that does), the music is played way too loud for you to comfortably talk to your friends. My friends and I had to talk into each other's ear in order to hear each other. The loud music just seems a wasted to me because there's not real place to dance. So that's the Hotel Grace bar.Lots of seating to sit and relax with friends, but can't talk to them because of the music. No real place to dance to the music. It doesn't know what it wants to be, so it's sort a little bit of everything. It is conveniently located in mid-town near Times Square, so it's a good place to take your out-of-town friends for a drink if they're staying in Times Square as a ""look what NY has and you don't in your hometown.""",6,4,1
87,Greg K.,"Oxnard, CA",14,147,12,4.0,6/27/2011,"Room Mate Grace is a fine Times Square adjacent hotel option. It's close to all the midtown, theater and tourist venues but not enveloped by the crowds. This is very much a boutique hotel with international clientele. The rooms are clean, nicely appointed and spacious by NYC standards. The reception area is compact, cozy and is equipped with a well stocked kiosk style store. The social draw here is a rather unique lobby area pool, lounge and bar venue that is frequented by a very young crowd. I would suggest requesting a room on the third floor or higher to insure that the disco trace PA system in the lounge is muted. This is the only in hotel entertainment option but plenty of alternatives are readilly available within short walking distance. The hotel staff is attentive and accommodating to a variety of quest needs. The room prices are fair and discounted by 10% if booked and prepaid a week in advance. All in all, a great midtown hotel option.",,,

90,Amy G.,"Chicago, IL",111,165,21,4.0,9/4/2012,"Super fun boutique hotel hidden off the main drag of Times Square.Rooms and common areas are decorated in sexy, swanky geometric patterns and have fun layouts with lofted beds, bunks, and more.What Room Mate seems most known for is its beautiful pool and swim-up bar. They also have stadium seating above the pool to enjoy beverages and views of the beautiful people, a lovely dry sauna, and nightly activities poolside including DJs, body painting, and more.There were some mix-ups about non-guests having to use the mandatory (?) coat and bag checks and paying admission for pool access but nothing that wasn't remedied with a few questions to management.Poolside drinks are pricey. If you're having a party, it's almost worthwhile to get a room and BYO to sneak down. Another thing of note: This establishment appears to be owned by a Latin American hotel chain. Most communications from the hotel and in-hotel written materials are offered first in Spanish and then English.",2,,
91,Maria B.,"San Francisco, CA",125,77,192,4.0,2/13/2010,"When planning our NYC trip, I wasn't sure where I wanted to stay. I decided on Times Square/Theater District because there would always be people around and I figured every train ran through the station there. So then the search for a hotel started. With wanting to stay within a decent range - Hotel Grace was a top contender. After settling with the fact that it was just on block away from the middle of Times Square and had breakfast included in the mornings (it just made our on-the-go days less of a hassle in finding coffee and food), I booked our room. The hotel is small, but nicely decorated. Don't try getting your luggage through the revolving door (like my smart self). There's a door right next to it that you can open. We got to our room that had a street view. If you're looking for a quiet night, don't count on it. However, I'm used to city noise and was so tired from our days that it didn't matter how many people or taxis where making their way down there. The room is small - you figure that from the pictures on the website. But I was surprised how well everything just fit in there! I think they do a good job about compensating for the size of the room with the quality of the bed.  I slept like a baby every night we were there. Maybe I was tired from 8 hour walks or maneuvering through the subway, but I did look forward to finally getting back to sleep. Service was all around good all around. The free wi-fi was so convenient, especially when we needed the internet to help us re-direct our itineraries for the week. Breakfast gets pretty crowded, so plan to come early if you want to eat in the sitting area. But you can also take food back with you so no biggie. There's also one of those ready to eat food places next door so you can grab something else for breakfast, pick up hot food for lunch or dinner, or bottles of water for the long day ahead.",4,,1

There were two bouncers and a long velvet rope protecting the sanctity of the non-line.There was a $15 cover to get into the bar. I guess a cover is justified when they have a pool, but it still seemed high for this type of bar.The layout is kind of interesting. When you first enter, there's a small bar with lounge type seating. That leads around to the pool, which is surrounded by stadium seating that leads to a second floor. You can also get to the backside of the bar from within the pool - kind of cool. The pool itself is small, but not as tiny as I was led to believe from the reviews. The whole room smells like chlorine, and you should expect to get splashed by drunk girls, so be prepared for such things.The DJ was playing Top 40/typical bar stuff but was switching songs literally every 15 seconds. Very annoying. Just as I would start arranging my arms and legs to move together, the beat would change on me.Overall, this was a unique experience - not somewhere I'd go every day, but a good place to have a quirky party.

97,Amanda H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,2/1/2014,"Note: this review is just about the hotel bar + pool  --I haven't stayed at/seen the rest of the Grace Hotel.This review is part of my effort to swim across Manhattan (message me if you have a pool for me to try!!).  It was a cold night in January and I wanted to lay in bed with the covers over my head, but a friend was having a pool party at the Grace Hotel and I love checking out new pools, so how could I not go?  The pool is about 3.5 feet deep, not huge but enough room for plenty of people and a casual game of volleyball with a small beach ball and people holding champagne glasses in one hand.  The pool is also lit, which makes it look really, and there's a DJ booth with turntables (although I don't remember the DJ doing anything all that memorable when I was there).  And they provide towels.  And of course you can drink in the pool, steam room, and sauna.There's also a nice-sized steam room AND a nice sauna in the same area (AND showers outside them plus one in the steam room), plus a seating area with cushions and little tables for your friends who suck and won't get in the water (plus the bar on the other side has plenty of comfy seating.  We had the whole place for my friend's party so there wasn't a cover and I just pay $4 plus tip to check my bags, which was amazing.  I definitely want to go back like once a week now and have my birthday party there :)",3,,

99,Julie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",379,649,484,4.0,10/6/2011,"I loved staying at this hotel during my time in NYC. This place is très chic! Cute and hip boutique hotel in the heart of Manhattan about a minute away from Times Square. As a young traveler, this place soooo fit my personality! I booked it through travelocity and got a great deal for a 4 night stay. So do your research to save money! Lobby is a bit small, but wonderfully decorated. Check in was a breeze and I got upgraded from a standard to a deluxe without even asking. It translates to more square footage in the room, which is like winning the lottery in the world of NYC hotel rooms. Yay! The NEATO stuff:The rooms smell like apple when you walk in. I like!Beds are super comfy! Ipod dock to play your jams Free wifi! It was reliable and quick too. The windows are nice, thick and sound proof. Sooooo important if you want quiet sleep away from the NYC traffic. Awesome.Each floor of the hotel is decorated with unique and colorful wall papers. My floor had a Tim Burton-ish theme to it. LOVE. My bf and I found ourselves pressing random floor numbers in the elevators just to check out the cool wall papers on every floor. =)Bathroom is big and spacious. They have a pool and bar in the lobby. Pretty neat. It would get kinda busy on the weekends, but our room on the 9th floor was high enough that we couldn't hear the bumpin' jams.They have computers and printers in the lobby when you need them. The coulda been better:Flat screen tvs in our room was tiny! Maybe 21 inch? Not that we watched it much, but it looked so tiny on the vast blank wallThe bathroom doesn't have a door and the shower is facing the doorway. Definitely a little awkward if you need a little privacy. The staff was very nice and helpful. Definitely a great experience.Oh and you can pick up FREE apples everyday from the lobby. Rest up and eat up! =)",3,2,1

There was no manager on duty according to the front staff. The front desk staff finally & begrudgingly called a manager to speak to us.

The person who was supposed to be coordinating the party or whatever and who promised to take care of certain accommodations I needed wasn't even there.The $4 mandatory coat check was absurd, there were no changing rooms or lockers to put our clothes.  I changed in a bathroom - gross!  The pool was tiny.  They had guards or bouncers or whatever were coming up to people literally every 5 minutes asking them if they were guests or if they had ID (which of course we didn't have on us because the bartenders had to keep our IDs for some reason).  One even stepped into the sauna to bark at us.  It was so annoying and kind of intimidating and you just could not relax.I asked a bartender how much a Corona cost and instead of just telling me, they put their finger up, ran away, and got me the Corona (which was 14.00).  Also, my friends and I really appreciated seeing that obnoxious ""convenience fee"" on our bills after closing our tabs so we could get the hell out and go somewhere else.",14,4,3
102,Jerrica J.,"New York, NY",963,1360,221,4.0,4/1/2011,"Being the socialite that I am, a friend invited me to a private hotel pool party on Tuesday night. I was not expecting much more than a chill night of mingling with new people and listening to electronic music.When you walk through the revolving doors, you enter a dim lit hallway and check in your coat with the clerk, and enter the bar area. 90 percent of the guests were definitely in their swimwear, five percent in underwear, and the other 5 percent fully clothed. I did not have time to go home to change prior to coming to the event, so I ended up being the last five percent fully clothed. I would have stripped down and joined in on the fun, but I really did not feel like getting wet in the pool that night. Maybe next time. Drinks were a little on the pricey side, so I had to opt for Heinekens which were $9 each. Eeek, but I guess thats what you get for hotel bars in Midtown. A couple of beers in, I was chillin'. DJs were rotating every hour or so, and it stayed pretty consistant with dub step, house, and breakbeats. I really liked how the sound quality was smooth and not too loud, so you could conversate with people around the pool area.The pool area was really nice, a smaller pool probably held about 40 people, and a swim up pool bar window in case you didn't want to get out. On the side of the pool there was some couches with tables and the upper deck had the DJ booth, steam room, and sauna.Overall I had a good time, and I can't wait to see the many photos circulating in the NY socialite photo galleries soon.

The atmosphere is fun and sexy with a lot of different sections to hang out in.... bar/lounge area, pool with swim-up bar, stadium-like seating, sauna and steamroom and a few other private areas on the second level. Getting in is a hassle and not because of the door (maybe on weekends or if you aren't with a private party) but because of the coat check. It's mandatory and about $4 per item I believe. There is also nowhere to put the belongings you choose to take in such as.... the clothes you wore there! So you're left to put these to the sides and hope no one swipes them. I felt comfortable leaving my purse unattended for a bit since I was among friends. But on a normal night, I would not want to do that. So you're left with the option to check it, which can run you up to a $20 coat check tab alone. Drinks are expensive. I know we are in NY and Times Square at that. But $15 for a small, watered-down Bay Breeze? Come on... Also the bartender had a real attitude and was soooo slowww. Make sure if you go to plan ahead for the whole coat check headache.",,1,

My son and I stayed here for one night and I was extremely disappointed. The man at the front desk told us we were upgraded to a deluxe room- seriously? I would hate to see a standard room. This place is a dump, not very clean, small rooms, very very noisy. You could hear people in the hallway slamming doors at all hours of the night. View of a wall. I checked the mattress twice for bed bugs (didn't see any, thank God!) because this place is so dingy and disgusting. The only upside to staying here was the gentleman at the front desk.

106,Vicky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,77,59,3.0,6/8/2011,"Came for the pool party. Hogged the sauna.The pool was tiny. I know from experience that whenever someone say it's a pool party it's tiny, but this is the smallest I've ever seen!Getting in was no problem, with the name a promoter. Mandatory coat check, not so nice.I initially wasn't planning to go in the water, but after an hour sweating my fat out, enough drinks to calm some large animal and my friend's artful application of persuasion I gave in to just have a dip. I didn't bring a swimsuit, not that it matter much as most didn't care. And besides, lingerie and swimsuit can easily pass for one another. I have to say, orange bra and purple underwear isn't a combination you see often. I don't know what I was thinking.Towels were liberally given out, or at least it seemed so because every time I turn my head there is someone taking my towel only for it to be replaced by a new one.There are no changing rooms, but there are not that many people in the back and it's dark enough that no one really cares.Drink-wise, I had some too sweet something. It was somewhat nauseating if not chilled, but very strong. Two cups was enough for me.With a window leading to the bar at the middle of one side of the pool, you'd find a lot of spilling and with it being a pool you know there are some people that just don't get out to take care of their business.

The best thing about it by far is the fact that the free continental breakfast actually has good food. That helped me save some money. There is also a pool in the lobby. I never used it but it's a cool touch. Unfortunately, the rooms are terribly cramped, the internet connection is slow, and the showers have absolutely no water pressure. I had to rinse my hair in the sink. The location (time square) is convenient, though I personally find Time Square to be a location I want to avoid, not have to come back to every night. I don't think I'll be staying there next time I go to New York, but I was happy enough with it. They also tend to have parties downstairs at night, so if you want to come back to a silent lobby, this isn't the place for you.One last thing, if you stay there, go to the Cranberry Cafe to your left and get one of their grilled veggie wraps. I wish I could have brought a life time supply of those wraps back to LA with me!",3,,1

The (three-foot-nine deep) water's a bit murky, but the sauna/steam rooms are apparently very nice.  Changing rooms to the side. Guests are urged not to enter the area based on the signs unless dressed in a swimsuit, but in reality no one was checking. The dry bar was cool and pleasant, although a bit step up onto the seating spaces; you have to be careful if you're in heels, it can be wet from people departing the pool. Looks like there are stairs from the pool area up to an above-the bar area, too.

This hotel ranks among the WORST and they are thieves! When I arrived, it took about 5 minutes for me to be acknowledged at the front desk. Workers were too busy chatting among themselves and checking their cell phones. Finally I was helped by this lady who had the worst attitude ever. It seemed like she thought she was doing me a favor by helping me. I was given my room key and she scribbled the number on it so I went to the wrong floor. I came back down to ask for a clarification and ask what floor and room I was in. She looked at me as if I was the stupidest person she had ever encountered and gave me the room number and floor with an attitude. When I got upstairs, the room was tiny and smelled like cigarette smoke. I took comfort that it looked clean. I tried typing in the WI-Fi password they had given me for the internet, but it did not work. I called back to explain that the password did not work, and right in the middle of my sentence she interrupted me with another password and user name and hung up. How rude!Later that night, I realized that I had forgot my toothpaste. I went downstairs to ask for some and I was told ""We don't have any...you need to go to Duane Rude"" she then turned and they continued talking. How awful!To top it off, when I checked out and ran to work, I realized that I had forgot my coat on the bed. I called about 6 times after being promised that someone would call me back (but never did). The 6th time I was told that no one found my coat and that I must have left it some where else. LIES! Someone clearly stole my coat.  I know the difference between thinking I forgot something and clearly remembering that I left something on the bed. I am in the process of writing to their regional manager. They have to know that their staff is crap and that they won't be around too long if they keep given horrible service and stealing guest items.",3,,

So Boom, my friend decides to celebrate her birthday by having a pool party at the Grace. Package includes a table, complementary champagne, and 5 comped guests. I kindly arrive at the location and upon approaching the door I give my name and state who's party I was there for being that I was in on her list of comped people. The both the man & woman at the door said that there was no list & I would have to pay $20. HMMM. I'm like ""um k that's not right there has to be a list"". Their response was no she didn't submit a list & the normal cover charge is $40. I said you know what whatever, paid the money walked inside. I get upstairs in time to see my friend talking to the promoter who helped with her arrangements, he was nice enough to go refund my $20. Went to change into my bathing suit and lookey, lookey, AIN'T NO DAMN CHANGING ROOM. Only musty bathrooms with horrible lighting & wet floors. Fast forward a little bit later into the night, the djs were playing a bunch of techno, so being that it was her party we kindly asked if we can switch to some hip hop or reggae. DJs completely ignored us, but once we complained to the promoter, he said something and it changed got about 5 songs then went back. WHATEVER. Couple minutes later, we see some police walk into venue, low and behold they wanted to check bags because someone brought in liquor from outside. UM EXCUSE ME ?! .. you gon' check who bag?! .. not I said the cat. ANYWAYS .. now to the pool. Which was ok apart, from the cloudy water & the grown men acting like 6 year olds playing dodgeball with the beach balls. Fast forward a lil bit later again, at maybe about 2 the decided to close the top area, & kick out everybody that was up there .. REALLY? .. so we had get out the pool to go move our stuff to the area besides the pool. After a while the security come flashing his light in the pool telling everyone to get out. Someone said ""I thought this was ending at 3"" he goes y'all were supposed to be outta here at 2 but the manager let you stay here longer. *insert blank stare here* WHATEVER. We get out the pool, I go to get a towel for myself & my friend. The little piglet handing out the towels asks why I need two. My answer was simply ""because my friend needs one"" he goes ""well your friend should of walked over here like you!"" .. HOLD THE PHONE .. who you talkin to bro? .. When we were leaving, we saw one of my friends guest who they just let in after BUYING A COLLARED SHIRT AND PAYING $40 to get in. MIND YOU, THEY KICKED US OUT THE POOL ALREADY, IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE. What you're telling me is that they saw what you had on, told you no, you went to go BUY a collared shirt and paid $40 even though they knew the party was over? WOW!! Just WOW! .. My friend got multiple calls and text messages from others saying they got turned away because of their dress code. Which is funny because I thought it was a pool party, from my knowledge I thought you have to change your clothes to get into the pool. Maybe I had it wrong this whole time, smh shame on me -_-. This place has the WORST customer service in America. From the moment I walked in until the last moments I walked out, every employee (with the exception of the promoter, who tried to accommodate us to the best of his ability, an a really nice security guard who actually asked what was wrong & apologized on behalf of everyone) has a HORRIBLE attitude. All the wanna do is take your money & treat you like sheet once they get it. First and last time I will ever go to this place. The pool is too damn small and too damn foggy for such a horrible ass experience.

My wife and I were first timers to New York City and this was the perfect location to hit all the main first time attractions like Times Square, The Rock, Broadway, Union Station, Central Park and the Museums. Rooms were big enough and the bed was very comfy. My only complaint was a draft that came in through the windows on cold nights. Free breakfast was also a big plus and included an espresso machine.Read some reviews that mentioned low lighting and we were about to agree... noticed on our last day of the trip that the light switches had dimmers...doh!!!It should also be noted the room does come with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. From reading reviews it looks like not all New York hotels do and we were uncertain going in so we packed our own.One word of warning if you don't take your laptop (they have free wi-fi).

In fact, I was so convinced that my friend was playing a joke on me that I arrived at the Hotel Grace sans swimwear only to discover that there was in fact a seriously fun indoor pool complete with swim up bar. Since it was a friend's birthday party, our group took over both the bar and the swimming pool rather successfully so it didn't seem like the Eurotrashtastic bar that other reviewers encountered and we didn't have to pay for our swim. Despite the shtick, the Hotel Grace does right by its theme. The inside bar is low-lit and shadowy chic while the neon-lit swimming room comes complete with comfy bleacher-style seating, a steam room and sauna. Pick up your towels and drop your drawers at the coat check.

The place has potential, but  they need a better staff and it would be a fantastic spot! We were on a guest list for the party so we didn't have to pay a cover, but I'm sure it would have been expensive. The drinks were ridiculously expensive- $9 for a bottle of Heineken and $17 for a vodka & Red Bull in a tiny rocks glass! That's what you get for being a block from Times Square I guess. The main bar area was a bit cramped, but it wasn't super packed so it was bareable. The DJ was great, playing a good mix all night, however, there is no dancefloor so it's pretty impossible to get your groove on. There are no changing rooms, just 2 giant bathrooms. They should really split one in half and make the other a locker room. The pool was tiny, but hey it's a pool in a club in NYC so you can't expect olympic size, right? It was heated so it basically felt like a giant bath tub. Unfortunately we got in and less than 5 minutes later we were kicked out by the staff who told us it was now closed. Really? The bar itself closed shortly after and we were kicked out before 3 am. Umm I thought we were in NYC? Doesn't every bar stay open until at least 3am?! The staff was extremely rude about it too, calling one of our friends a derogatory name in the process! Her and her husband happened to be staying at the hotel that night and complained to management about the rude bartender. They didn't seem to really care. Bottom line I would say it was fun, but not worth the price or the hassle of dealing with the rude staff.",2,,

Otherwise everything else was clean and simple. It's walking distance to many eateries, coffee shops, and stores which is great. We didn't really spend too much time there, so I didn't get a chance to go to the bar (although it looked like it was happening). Oh also, the website mentions they have ""fitness equipment"".

The reason why they are getting 3 stars is because just like a pretty face, you you can only admire it for so long. The pool is tiny and is clearly not for swimming. It is more like a Giant Jacuzzi where you can ""swim"" up to the bar and knock yourself out with shots. Without a doubt you'll look cool for a night or two but eventually you'll have to move on! The crowd is a hit or miss.  Apparently there are people paying 10 bucks not to get into the pool, but to sit nearby a pool and check out the goods.

That way you won't mind when random drunks pull you into the pool as you're walking by--thank god we had planned to swim!Oh, and a word of advice--if you get a drink, it may seem like a great idea to bring it into the pool with you--maybe on a tame night, but if it's rowdy, don't even think about it. You will get splashed, bumped into, or knocked over. You will end up with a glass of pool water as you swim in your jack and coke with a frown.When my friend and I told the bartender what happened, we bought another drink and he made us each an extra shot--fierce!Oh, and make sure you've got a designated buddy to watch your stuff if you're in the pool.

The hotel was hosting a private party, right below us, and the music was so loud it sounded like the band (or DJ) was in the room with us. They kept it up until 4 a.m. The management refused to move us and advised us to ""talk to the desk, tomorrow"". There is also an indoor pool in the party area and the stench of chlorine was unbearable. It took us almost an hour to get our bags our of bag-check. Not because they were so busy but because we couldn't get anyone to help us. Needless to say, I will never stay at this hotel or any affiliate hotel, again. BTW: ""free"" Wi-Fi wasn't working.",3,,

We had booked a petite room, because the hotel was a bit over budget. Since we were staying on a Sunday night, we thought we would give it a try and see if they would upgrade us.... and they already had... to a penthouse room!! So that was pretty awesome.. the staff was really nice.. the pool was open 24/7 which was perfect for our post food coma nap.. 2 am swim.. and to top it all off.. the next morning during the continental breakfast.. when they did not have soy milk.. they offered to go out and get it..

I usually red eye it from La to NY and I did this trip, yes I understand that I am early but most hotels are accommodating. I arrived at the hotel at 930. Hoping for a check in. but to my luck nothing was available. Jazmine the front desk girl was the most rude and disrespectful. I have never in my life been treated that way and was astonished. I held back my italian anger much better than I thought. so I kindly asked for her to keep my number and call me if anything changed. she said ya check in at 3 pm ... The door man was sweet and said he would see what he could do. I came back at 1230. and I asked if anything was available. once again she wrote me off like I was a piece of trash. Ignored me at first than said check in is at 3. By than my blood was boiling, I sat in the lobby til 2 and went back up the door man said there had been rooms available sense noon. I was checked in. I got to my room and it was a double size bed, I paid for a kind deluxe and it was a standard. it to me 4 steps to get to my bed, the layout and rooms are tiny. I stuck it out, but never will be back. Customer service is important to me. If you want to be treated with disrespect go to Grace, if not choose somewhere else.",2,1,2

Then the remote for the t.v.was broke and had to get a new one. No one told me that the building next door was under construction and they started banging away at 7 am, so annoying.

I went last night and even emailed the bar manager in advance and told him I was having a small party. When we got in the pool it was COLD!!!

The rooms are tiny, the gym is the size of my kitchen at home...but hey that's NY for ya. The rates were reasonable (not sure if that's just the deal my company has) Overall it's a cool little spot but the pool croud can get awkward (ie Jay Z parties and gyrating men in speedos on random week nights) Sheck it out!",1,1,1

If you're in the pool you can just swim up to the window at the wet bar, opposite side where it's the dry bar, get it? dry? cause we... yeah, haha you get it.It's small but it was fun and you can just sit there watching the crazy people in the pool really make a show for you, haha! It was a pretty diverse crowd which I liked, and it was an intimate setting so I got to actually sit down and drink and chat. Overall the bar was a good experience.The rooms are totally hostel style NYC, they are contemporary with use of three color schemes: white/black/gray, white/blue/beige, white/black/beige, and just enough space for a full-size bed, and a 20'flat screen lcd TV on the wall, with an ottoman at the foot of the bed that has a DVD player attached beneath it! Haha! Talk about space-savings, man, NYC, gotta love the creativity with use of high walls, in narrow rooms right?!The bathroom too was interesting, it was pretty modern with the exception of it being locker room style showers, with no tub, just a drain in the floor so even if you're using the potty you'd have to wear boots so your feet don't get wet if you've just showered, or someone else is.If you're just looking for comfort on a budget and no frills, smack in the midst of Times Square/MidTown, this is a good place to go.Happy Travels!",2,1,2

The shower in the bathroom with no tub around it was a nice suprise.... However, having the bar close before midnight on Wed. and around 1am on Thursday was a bummer (who goes back to the hotel before that?). When I finally got to enjoy the pool on Friday night around midnight (again, they were closing up apparently due to lack of business and fashion week beginning?!) I had to beg for service from the bar. They saved face by giving me a few glasses of champagne for free and letting us turn the music in the pool area back on.The breakfast listed for free by another reviewer is actually $10 per person for cereal, and fruit, coffee & tea that sort of thing.I felt welcomed by the front desk people and they let us stowe our bags there after check out for some last minute shopping in the village.

140,Ryan D.,"Nashua, NH",264,358,64,4.0,10/16/2009,"I'm really not in any position to give a FULL review of the Grace since I wasn't actually a guest there. Why do they call hotel patrons ""guests"" ? When you think about, guests don't typically pay out their buttholes to stay at a place. Anyway, moving on... There's a weekly gay party here on Wednesdays called DR!P. I've always wanted to go, and with it getting colder and colder I figured it was time to dive in... pun intended.It won't lie... I walked right by. It's has very little visibility from the outside and is easily missed especially when it's super dark outside. I was worried I was going to get lost somewhere in the hotel before I found the pool. That was silly, because the hotel is actually not that large and the pool is RIGHT THERE on your left when you walk in. I also imagined DR!P to be a super large party. It actually isn't; pretty reasonably spaced with a pretty reasonable crowd. Or at least at 10:00 PM, when it first opened. I was getting mixed cocktails for $6.00 a pop, so I got pretty messy within the first hour and still had money to spare. Sadly, you really can't dance or mingle that well here. It's swim... or well, swim really. I sat at the bar to get my drink on for the first two hours, then I started doing laps AROUND the pool. I didn't actually want to swin (and might not ever), but enjoyed everyone else having a good time. The DJ was rocking a mix of 80s to modern music, but also made me nervous because... well doesn't that seem like an electrical accident waiting to happen? Pool + DJ booth = ZZZZAP!?I recommend it. I think it's DEFINITELY a good place for groups of people. The sofas in the back of the pool bar are perfect to get sloshy and have fun with some friends. I like that you can swim up to the bar and get a drink, but I don't know how practical that is since your cash money would probably get wet. The crowd was just beautiful enough (a pretty good mix of older and younger) and I'll probably go back. I hope they don't close up for the winter.",1,,1

Plus, it's right in the midst of the theatre scene, which is pretty much my first love in NYC. The staff was pretty friendly for the most part, but nothing overwhelming. I've definitely received better service elsewhere. Although the vibe of the hotel was very chic and boutique feeling, the facilities were less than spectacular...there were lights in my room that were broken, the TV didn't work part of the time, and there was duct tape holding a carpet down in the lobby. The workout room was a joke. Thank goodness Crunch on 54th let me work out there while I was visiting. I think I would just rather pay the money and stay at The Standard the next time.",1,,1

The bartenders were serving the people who were in the pool behind the bar. I shortly realized the real party was upstairs. And so it was! The music was excellent and the vibe was right. The only thing that the night lacked were better bartenders. The drinks were watered down and I witnessed some thievery on behalf of the bartenders. They used their tip bucket as a cash register at times. Other than that I really liked the place and would consider going back and buy a bottle instead.

We were felt-penned on the wrist (classy) as a sign of having paid the cover. Then it was $8 for two coats (mandatory check). I felt totally ripped off before i even really entered the space.  A watery drink served to me by a silicone chested blonde with peroxide hair and bad tattoos set me back $16. Then it's off to the kiddie pool (3 feet deep) which reeks of chlorine. First view? A couple sucking face for what seemed like hours. (Get a room why dontcha???) Strict door? Proper attire?  Uh..me thinks not. The crowd looks like they're straight out of 'Jersey Shore' or 'Housewives of New Jersey'  Stonewashed bootcut jeans and fitted banana republic shirts? (how apropos! oh wait: it's not 2005?) I think a majority of the clientele are probably UFC fans working day jobs at a D'Agostino's meat counter somewhere in Long Island. The DJ talks (!) (yes you heard right!) over the overly-loud top 40 and 80's mash-ups which are nonetheless popular with the crowd who screams along to  tunes like 'Party Rock Anthem'. I suppose he is accurate with his target audience so i can't really blame the guy.  If you have any taste whatsoever, avoid this bridge & tunnel/ tourist trap like the plague and come downtown. If you have to have a pool to be happy, go to the Thompson Hotel in Soho (not that much better but a definite step up from this vortex of crap).",2,2,
167,SE W.,"Columbus, OH",1,32,0,2.0,7/16/2012,"I stayed here a couple years ago and had a great time, so wanted to come back.  Not so much this time.  The pool closed at 11pm.  The bar wasn't open.  The charged 13.95 for a continental breakfast of bagels and juice.  Not worth the money. You can stay down the street and get more for your money.",,,
168,Miss P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,1.0,4/1/2012,Roommate Lounge at Grace Hotel is overrated! I had a birthday party there and arranged with management to have my guests in free before 1 AM. Well little did I know this place is racist and sexist. If you are not a size zero you are NOT getting in. For those who made it in the drinks were watered down and service was horrible. The doorman Rob was getting his way molesting everyone on there way in. I heard him tell someone they weren't  wearing name brand so they were not getting in. The infamous pool looked like it belonged in the YMCA with the algae and garbage in it. The music was horrible & DJ played outdated music and the crowd was boring! I should have had my party at South Beach.,,,1
169,Karina G.,"New York, NY",1,13,16,5.0,4/21/2014,"I was there this weekend 4/19. I celebrated my birthday and purchased a Living social deal. The deal was great and still available for 6 more days (Go buy it ). It includes entrance for 10 ppl, champagne and snacks. They offered a open bar from (10-11 vodka only) but it did the trick. I had a great time! Everyone wears bathing suits, they had a coat check. The drinks could be better, like frozen drinks. They have 3 sections, but the top section was closed. Its definitely  a really nice place, it just needs to be spoken about. The food/snacks was good, they don't allow food or sell food, since they don't want it near the pool. But if they did something to accommodate that, they would make $ and  attract more ppl. They provide towels which was nice. The dj played really good music but was an A**hole, me and a friend requested a song and he said no in a VERY NASTY way. Its not a big place, so him playing a request would have not been an issue. I deff would go back, but I just hope more ppl hear about it and more ppl attend.",,,
170,Erik B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,10,0,4.0,3/27/2010,"Oh man, this place is really funky and awesome!  Went here for my birthday earlier this month and had a ROCKING good time.  Going here alone is probably kind of, well, lonely.  But bring some friends and it's awesome.We weren't guests of the hotel, but we wanted to go to the swim-up bar to see what it was like.  For $10 (which they loosely collected; the later you got there, the less likely it was they took this money, I don't know why), they let you in the place then there was a 2 drink minimum. This might bother some people, but my friends seemed okay with it.  They have one-occupant bathrooms in which you can change, and they have a coat check (whom has plastic bags to give) for you to check your clothing.  They have disposable bathing suits for $20 if you forget yours.They also have a sauna and steam room.  So, basically, you can take a 4 hour vacation.The only reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars:1. The chlorine is INTENSE and ruined all of our clothes.  So don't bring your gucci.  I didn't mind since I brought a bathing suit from a free pile.  But a friend had her somewhat expensive one ruined.  There was no warning about this, and the manager was unapologetic (offering a free drink for a ruined $80 bathing suit...not even the cover fee).2. The bouncer was kind of unnecessarily intimidating (asking if we were on the list, but not saying we could go in regardless of being in the list...we had to ask).3. The drinks, though not bad, were a bit over priced.  So the cover and drinks (I had three) came to $50.  Which a night out with a LOT less to offer in this city can cost a LOT more.I do, however, recommend this place whole-heartedly.",,,
171,Keoni B.,"New York, NY",24,47,5,3.0,5/26/2009,"The Hotel Grace, formerly the QT Hotel sports a cool wading pool and bar just off the entrace/lobby.  It's only $10 gain access to the pool, steam room, & sauna, definitely worth it.  We had drinks in the pool and watched the ball game which was projected on a huge screen.  It is a small pool and can get crowed, but there are not many options like this in Manhattan.",1,,1
172,Christine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,86,0,1.0,7/19/2008,"Was dragged here for a friend's birthday party and instantly knew it would be terrible by its proximity to Times Sq. as well as gaggle of visiting Staten Island-ers in bikinis, sipping $15 weak drinks.  I'm still recovering.  In the words of Conrad:  ""the horror!  the horror!""",2,3,
173,Layne B.,"New York, NY",68,51,1,4.0,11/9/2008,"This is my favorite hotel in NYC. They think about every single detail. The rooms are amazing and efficient (small). The pool and spa are beautiful. And we love the breakfast. If you like modern hotels, this is a must stay. oh, and they are dog-friendly. This boutique hotel used to be called Hotel QT.",2,1,2
174,Michelle S.,"West Hollywood, CA",79,98,10,2.0,10/5/2011,"I've stayed at grace hotels several times. In fact, I had recommended the hotel to my colleagues and we've stayed there two weeks ago for several nights with a total of 4 people. Today, after being in a long long international flight, I was looking forward to stay at the same hotel to enjoy the room and hotel facilities. Upon my arrival, I was told that the hotel was overbooked and I had to move to another hotel. Not only did I not get a notification ahead of time, the front desk person gave me no choice but to stay at another hotel while charging me. In addition, I had to drag my luggages and carry on to the other hotel. The hotel I've moved to not only was in a more inconvenient location, the room was 1/3 the size of the room at hotel grace. And I was charged for the same price of the room?? This is not only very unprofessional of the hotel, but the service was horrible as well. The front desk person's attitude was not apologetic at all, though she said sorry. She also gave me no choice but to move me to the other hotel. I might have booked another hotel to stay at if I had knew.",,,
175,Ed Z.,"San Francisco, CA",169,143,10,4.0,3/2/2009,"One of the slickest, most comfortable hotels you can find in New York, with big fluffy pillows, great service (though a tad expensive), and all the amenities that you can fairly expect. The shower is huge (and powerful), the included shower gels were great, and I even though I had a delightful view of a mucky street, I still felt comfy and warm there. Great hotel.",1,,2
176,shannon e t.,"Seattle, WA",24,137,0,4.0,1/23/2009,"we're on our second night of three, and so far, no horror stories.the room is small, as expected, but well designed so the extra space is hardly missed. the simple textures and colour scheme make the room a calm and quiet refuge from the bustle of times square just outside. the communal areas are equally as well designed while conserving space. the hotel loses a star for teasing its guests with balconies and sliding windows that open wide enough only for a five-year-old to slip through.",1,1,1
177,Shannon D.,"New York, NY",90,896,0,3.0,8/14/2011,Liked it. Fun pool area and good electronic music. Well set up. Wouldn't necessarily seek it out but would go again. Crowd wasn't super upscale but went on a rainy Sunday and I wanna see it on a Saturday night before really deciding,,,
178,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",77,214,0,3.0,11/9/2008,"Came here on  a Thursday with some co-workers for happy hour. We had heard a rumor of $5 martinis. Much to our dismay (and after the bartender had already poured our drinks), we found out that this special only takes place on Mondays and Tuesdays. So, we ended up paying $15 for the martinis. Not such a great deal. But, the place is cute and there's an indoor pool right next to it which is pretty cool if you're a guest at the hotel.",1,,1

181,Jenny Y.,"Boston, MA",0,7,0,1.0,1/2/2011,"I have never been to a hotel where the staff is rude, slow and not helpful.  the maid was extremely nice and that was it.  all the others were morons.  it took over 20 minutes to check in for no reason, they had our reservation and all the billing information, the woman was just a moron.  then when we asked for directions to basic places (like where can i buy a tooth brush) she kept saying ""i don't know"".   I needed to print something so I called the front desk they said there are computers in the lobby....they failed to tell me that i needed to pay for them.  not the end of the world but i had to go back up stairs to grab my wallet, just not the type of service and information i needed.  finally when we asked for directions the front desk kept saying go outside and ask a cop, i'm shocked with the poor service.  the pool in the lobby is not worth it",,,
182,Ava R.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,538,29,4.0,7/31/2009,"I always have a really good time every time I come here. Be advised, I only come for the pool, sauna, and the bald bartender. The glisten on the top of his head is mesmerizing. I've never paid more than $10 to get in here and I've been on nights when it's almost completely empty and nights when it's been ridiculously packed (the Brazilian party). The drinks are decent, though I've yet to taste one that made me crave another. And expect to shell out at least $15 each. The steam room is spacious and really, really steamy. Which is always a great place to start. (Thanks, Ava). If you don't want to swim or get wet you're probably a loser and should make yourself comfortable in the first or second floor lounges furnished with black leather couches and the like. They give you towels and they do a good job of keeping the pool/sauna/steam room clean. It's just the bathrooms that get kinda gnarly. There's only two and the floors are usually wet and covered in toilet paper pulp by the end of the night. So wear flip flops!",1,3,1
