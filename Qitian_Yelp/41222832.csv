0,Megan K.,"San Francisco, CA",13,206,3,4.0,8/9/2018,"We had a good time here.  Comedians were funny and engaging, obviously some are better than others but I don't understand all the negative reviews on Yelp, even watching not the best performance to me is entertaining.Cool little dark room, seats about 250 people, a nice cozy venue.Food was reasonably good and for spending about fifty bucks we had drinks, sliders and three hours of entertainment.  Was a good value, and I didn't expect amazing food because obviously it's a comedy club not a five star restaurant.  Why are people on Yelp complaining about a ten dollar drink, obviously they have to make money somehow here. I just didn't appreciate all the malicious anti Trump jokes.  Most of the comedians were too liberal so that was annoying, why does everyone think it's ok to target jokes at white conservatives and the president in a malicious way?  As a white conservative though, I still had a good time otherwise and don't agree with the negative Yelp reviews, I thought the performers gave it their best shot to be funny, it was a good value and we had a good time overall.",,,
1,Ashley B.,"Newark, NJ",22,97,259,2.0,10/21/2018,"So I have to start by saying I enjoyed seeing (many) of the comics. There were definitely some awkward sets, but it is what it is. Our server was accommodating, timely and attentive. Nice job in a crazy setting.Aside from that, I WAS NOT a fan of a couple things. 1: bathroom lines are RIDICULOUS. After the show begins it's a good 1 minute wait at any point to use one of the two gender neutral restrooms.2: A $20 cover AND two drink minimum is also ridiculous. I could go on about  why this is lame but do I really need to?Those two things in themselves is enough to turn me off from a certain venue. Oh well..",1,1,
2,Courtney R.,"Alexandria, VA",10,127,294,2.0,10/10/2018,"Bought tickets from a guy selling them in Times Square for ""half price"". We went and they have a small and a large comedy room. We got put in the small comedy room which seats about 20 people.  I can only imagine how difficult it is to make a group of people laugh,  but there were only a couple out of at least 6 or 7 comedians that went up that were actually funny. I ordered chicken tenders and French fries and I had to send them back for the meal not being satisfactory. I ordered another drink instead,  and I was brought out wings (which admittedly looked better,  but wasn't what I ordered). They have a two item purchase requirement like most every other comedy club I've been too. I think the fact that I paid money for the ticket and then still had to pay for the food was what ultimately led to this place only getting two stars. Had the tickets been free it probably would have been a little bit better. Definitely don't buy them for $30.  Negotiate if you buy them off of the people in Times Square.",,1,
3,Amanda S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",94,8,1,1.0,10/2/2018,"do not visit this little scam hole..dont buy from ticket distributors on the street either. they lie about the real line up. its not who they say it will be. horrible. the show we watched was painful! forced laughs because we felt so bad for these ""comedians"". cringe. bad. no.",1,1,
4,Brian G.,"New York, NY",1,6,0,1.0,9/29/2018,"I feel like an idiot for not checking out the reviews before going here. TOURIST TRAP. The show was a complete shit show that started 30 minutes late. The comics ranged from OK, to awful and skin crawlingly awkward. The bad comics often would get mad at the crowd for not laughing. The 2 drink minimum is heavily enforced, and they have no whiskey drinks or cocktails worth risking. The $10 dollar beers are painful. Spend your money at the better comedy clubs in NYC, like the Cellar, or Upright Citizens Brigade.",2,2,
5,Arshile K.,"Toronto, Canada",87,41,97,3.0,7/22/2018,"It's an odd thing rating a comedy club. Am I rating the venue or the experience? For the the sake of this review, let's say the experience. The first comic (the host) was awkward to the point where I really wasn't sure which direction things would go. Between his timing and his over-the-top self-deprecation, I was sure we were in for a rough ride. In the end, he made one of the best jokes of the night, which is either a testament to his ability to come through or proof of my inability to gauge comedy. The two comics after him were really great. The two comics after them were terrible. Again, I don't know how much sense it makes to judge a comedy club by the quality of it's talent, but that's what we're doing here. To be fair, the venue itself was also a 3 star experience- totally fine, except that it was raining and water was getting through the ceiling. My girlfriend was not happy, and there wasn't enough room to move. I came in a group of 4. None of us had to pay cover thanks to the lady in the front who decided to let us not pay entry (which would've otherwise been $25 US each), so long as we each bought 2 drinks (around $10 each) per person. Great deal, especially given how long the comedy lasted. With the entry price, would've probably not been worth it.Would maybe come back, if I hadn't thought to make reservations elsewhere.",1,,
6,Carolyn L.,"Vancouver, Canada",125,1167,10567,4.0,4/11/2018,"My friend got us tickets for the 9 pm show. We started waiting for the doors to open at 8:20 pm and got in when the doors opened around 8:30 pm. We waited a bit more before we were able to head down the stairs to the proper venue. The building housed many other offices in there. The guy at the door will show you to your table. Setup was a bit cramped and you would be sharing the tables with strangers. And you need to buy 2 drinks. We didn't realize gratuities and taxes were already included in the price. The drinks were pretty strong, then again I hardly drink. There were about 6 comedians that night and they were hilarious. My favorite was Mike Vecchione. His tone was almost monotonous but what he said was super funny. The place is tiny so the comedians really do not really have to shout into the mic. Totally hurt the ears. A good place to have a laugh though.",,,
7,Michael L.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2,146,96,2.0,10/3/2018,"I have been to many comedy clubs.. This is one of the least desirable clubs I have been to.  Over-priced, poor performing comics and there were several comics this evening.  Went from not funny to really not funny to, my lord, get me out of here.  Way way over priced for the show, drinks and any appetizer they may have offered.",2,,
8,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,2.0,8/14/2018,"The venue is decently large, plenty of seats, albeit a bit run down. Depending on what you order, the prices are fair/high. The drinks were $12-16, while a bottle of water is $6! I think that's ludicrous for water. Food on average is $8-15. There's also a 2 drink minimum, not including food.",,,

10,Dave S.,"Ephrata Township, PA",2,46,9,4.0,10/15/2018,Fun place. Got tickets from guy on times square. Great comics of all different styles.  Note everyone has to spend at least $15 plus 18% gratuity and tax.,,,
11,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,3.0,2/10/2018,"Saw Blank the musical here and had a blast! the show was very funny and I'd definitely recommend it to friends.Only comment would be that the space is kind of odd and many seats aren't directly facing the stage so you have to turn your head to see what's going on, and some views may be obstructed by others! They also have multiple shows going on and only let you into the space about 5 minutes before they start. Overall though the tickets weren't expensive and I laughed a lot so I'd say it was worth it!!",,,
12,Zach S.,"Huntington, WV",53,2,1,1.0,9/11/2018,Tickets weren't bad at all. What stinks is they make you purchase drinks alto attend the show and the prices are outrageous . Last time here,1,,

BJ in Times Square sold us tickets saying that Caroline Rhea and Ryan Stiles were performing as well as a surprise guest from SNL. Not the case. All nobodies. Some were solid, many were not.

Updated review","There was no bad connection. I was deliberately laughed at and told ""good luck proving that!"" Yours was the only venue I went outside of my apartment that day. The next day I tested positive for benzodiazepines & before you attack me again, no, I do not take any prescriptions. You're defensive because you've had this complaint before. You know that someone in your venue has done this multiple times & will continue to. Your attitude and lack of concern is exactly the problem with our current climate on assault.",3,1,
15,Julie W.,"West Sacramento, CA",2,31,18,1.0,10/25/2017,"This place doesn't really care what it takes to fill their seats. One of their vendors selling tickets in Times Square stated Ryan Stiles was opening for Tina Fey. Needless to say, this was not the case. When we were seated, it didn't seem like we were at the correct show, so I asked a few of the employees, who were unable to identify who was performing that night. The woman taking tickets didn't seem to give a shit one of the club's vendors was selling tickets under false pretenses. The club seems like it has potential, but the way they do business is very shady.The tickets identify the shady vendor as JJ. Don't buy from JJ! He's probably using your cash to buy meth.",2,3,1
16,Leah F.,"San Francisco, CA",32,70,14,1.0,6/8/2018,"Show was too long (3 hours) especially for what it was. Most of the comedians were not funny and desperate; the ones that were fine had one or two good jokes. Very disorganized payment at the end. Aggressive bouncers micromanaging our every move when we were waiting for our friends outside. Yelling at us to stand at the front, then the side, then the front, repeat. Back off or make up your mind, bro. IDK how I forgot to vet this place on Yelp first. Do Comedy Cellar instead for a positive experience.",,,

Had to stand outside for over 30 minutes after the doors opened though. The place is a little dingy, the bathrooms were not well maintained, and the drinks were outrageously priced for what you get (a Long Island iced tea was $12 or $15 for a medium sized plastic party cup) and there's a 2 drink minimum per person.

I told him to ""chill out"" and he said ""I will throw your ass out of here"". Such a rude and hostile place. Just as the other posts state, they are so concerned about filling seats that they forget how to treat customers.

20,Alex S.,"Washington D.C., DC",34,10,4,5.0,2/13/2018,"I had an awesome time here last week! I don't know how some of these people say they got drugged or had a bad time...maybe YOU are the problem. Everyone has an opinion these days and seem to feel overly entitled. I saw the 9pm show. The show room had like 200 people in it and the crowd was having a blast. Servers were great especially considering how many assholes were in the audience. I guess people really have no concept of how demanding the service industry is, but those guys were killing it. Drinks were okay, but I don't go to a comedy club expecting a douche bag with a top hat and handle bar mustache to serve me some flaming crazy drink I'd only see at Tales of the Cocktail- I come to a comedy club for COMEDY . Didn't eat the food as I am a female and we just look at food and cry. ALSO- to all the people bitching about being lied to from street vendors...CHECK THE WEBSITE. IF YOU CAN YELP YOU CLEARLY CAN TAKE THE TIME TO CHECK THE WEBSITE OR CALL THE CLUB. WOOOOOOOF this is Trump's America. Instead of offing myself, I think I will go see some comedy...or maybe read more of these hilarious yelp reviews from the people who have nothing better to do with their lives. Good luck kids.

They said it would be ""a few minutes"" until we could head in. I also noted that the group of 10 people next to me all got their tickets for 10$ ?!?! I waited for another 20 minutes before calling it quits at about 10:30 pm. The showing I paid for was supposed to start at 10 pm. It was 10:30 and I still wasn't in. This is ridiculous.

No Jeff, they are not all ""funny as f.@k."" But for 6 or 7 other unsuspecting people, the crowd were his family and friends.

This is actually common at legit clubs.  However, If this was a legitimate comedy club it would not resort to using ticket sellers in Times Square.  I had attended a real comedy club the previous night (Comedy Cellar) and knew it was possible for big time comics to show up last minute to a show, as Louis CK did show up when I was at the Cellar (for $20 mind you - same price as this dump!).  I was roped in with the promise of Amy Schumer performing and decided against my better judgement to check it out after Alex approached me in Times Sq.When I showed up to the dingy hole, there were about 7 other duped tourists waiting for the show to start in the lobby.  They canceled the 11PM show because there wasn't 10 people in attendance to justify starting it.  They refused to give us a refund and then made fun of us for buying tickets in Times Sq.  They gave us a phone number to the boss of the ticket sellers, Jeff.  Of course he never answered or returned our calls.  The club claimed they usually handled refunds in 1 days - I never got a response. The club should pay the refund if they cared about their reputation!  I just visited their website and they have on their ""Now Hiring"" Page information for becoming a ticket seller.  There is no reason why the club can't do the right thing and issue a refund.   Unlike other people leaving negative reviews,  I didn't even get to see a show by mediocre up-and-coming comedians...  My tickets were real, but still was refused a refund.This was hands down my worst experience in NYC.  Hopefully you are reading this before buying tickets.  When your spidey sense tells you not to, AVOID THIS PLACE.  GO TO A REAL COMEDY CLUB LIKE THE COMEDY CELLAR OR CAROLINES.Lastly, I noticed when reading reviews that the club owner almost 2 months ago said they had some ""rogue sellers."" Well those bad apples haven't gone anywhere.  Don't pretend you have nothing to do with them... The real comedy clubs around town don't have this problem.  You have the power to fix this issue. Honestly, I don't think they are serious about fixing the problem.  Does the owner have a reason for why the boss of the third party doesn't help with a refund?!  Is he going ""rogue"" as well?  Please change your business practices and build your company with some integrity.",16,5,3

We bought our tickets from a funny dude near Times Square. I should have known better, but this guy was nice and hilarious. After talking to him and telling him I had two teenage kids with me and one of their friends -- he assured me the show would be clean.  I was hesitant, but got suckered in. We went and the lady seated us right at the front. We tried to move to place tht was easier to leave from (just in case), but she moved us back to the front. In hindsight, I should have sat right next to the door. I was appalled and disgusted by the profanity laced, crude, lewd, repulsive things that were spewed out that night by the ""comics"".  I ha e tried to protect my kids from things like this their whole life and in one 60min show they heard so much more than they had their whole lives to this point. I was furious tht we had been lied to and were trapped in our seats. We weren't the only ones who were mad. There were many others that were ticked off and completely put off by the terrible attempts at jokes and the lewd and profane comics that assaulted everyone's intelligence and morals. Do NOT go to this place. There is a 2 drink minimum also - and these are THE WORST DRINKS you will ever have. Mine wasn't edible - I took two sips and left it there. It was awful tasting. This is the farthest thing from clean stand up comedy.  It's repulsive in every way.",6,5,1

54,James M.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,18,0,1.0,6/29/2018,I actually hope this place this goes out of business. I know it sounds messed up because people need jobs and its not the fault of the employees. The owner of this club is ripping off tourists saying certain comedians will be on the line up when its just a bunch of open mic beginners. This would be fine if the cover was $5 instead of $20 plus a two drink minimum. If the comedy cellar or gotham comedy club are sold out don't go to this club. Waste of money.,,,
55,Melony M.,"Cedarhurst, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/28/2018,"We just left Broadway Comedy Clubs 9 PM show. We had bought tickets online after seeing that Mike Vecchione would be performing on their website. This information was directly from the clubs website, not an outside promoter or scalper. Mike Vecchione (along with other comedians listed on the schedule) never showed up and no one said a word about it. Immediately after leaving the club, I decided to look at Mike Vecchione's twitter only to find that he NEVER planned on being at Broadway tonight as he is currently in FLORIDA for a scheduled performance there. I will never return to this venue and suggest that no one else waste their money here. The club is run by scam artists who have no regard for their customers and treat paying customers as if we are wasting their time by asking simple questions such as ""is this where I pick up my tickets?

Then I came back again the following weekend...one of the comics I saw the previous time came out again and he told the same jokes. The host / MC also told the same exact jokes , so you know....that was a bust .

We declined the first time, then the second time he won us over by flattery and name dropping celeb comedians and saying that it was the New York comedy festival and they were doing taping for the show. Just a rip off. It's my own fault for not reading reviews before hand. It's in a DARK HOT SMELLY BASEMENT. Don't go. We made it 40 minutes in, it was not good. Subpar comedian at best.

It should be made clear that the tickets only include cover and not the two-drink minimum per person. Also, it kind of seemed rude that they were pushing alcoholic drinks on us. Some people don't like to drink. The wait staff kept walking in front of the stage when people were performing which was very distracting.But the show was absolutely fantastic. It was a great medley of comics, all of different races, genders, different comedic styles. The show was incredibly diverse and that didn't take away from the comedy as it sometimes does when someone is the token comic.Also, I got a mudslide (for my drink) and it was delicious! 8/10 would return",1,,

63,Nicole S.,"Hoboken, NJ",181,329,308,4.0,5/27/2015,"Broadway Comedy Club was a good night for sure. I came this night specifically to see Harrison Greenbaum - a must see. He will have you laughing your butt off!  But I did enjoy the whole show. I wasn't a fan of the style of the performances which I'll explain: There 2 opening comedians that performed about 10-15 minutes each followed by several, several comedians performing for about 5 minutes (or what felt like less) each. 5 minutes is a very short set, and a couple of the comedians were cut off on their last joke because they didn't have enough time. This may be normal for certain comedy clubs, but it was the first time for me.The night ended with a 15 or so minute set by Harrison Greenbaum (headliner) - this came after receipts were handed out and we were paying. I was worried he wasn't going on because the show ran late, but luckily he did go on.I was able to snag complimentary tickets with a coupon code I found online. Tickets are usually $25 each and there is a 2 drink minimum (non alcoholic drinks count) and drinks are about $8-$10 for a beer. I recommend checking online for discounts beforehand or running into the ticket sellers in Times Square for a good deal!",3,1,1

Without a lengthy narration I will list how they dropped the ball:- Did not advise people of the nye crowd nor did they tell them to have a hard copy of tickets which would be required to get past barricades. (I had to be nicely assertive to even get there without tickets in hand.)- Long wait in the freezing cold- Jam packed crowded with seats too close to neighbors- Bathrooms a mess from previous show and no mirrors - Took over an hour to order a first drink; neighbors never even got theirs 20 minutes before show ended- Skeletal selection of drinks; couldn't even make an old fashioned or dirty martini; opted for bad wine and a bad bitter tasting frozen mudslide  - Two comedians great, others not good and a couple were way way too raunchy - Never received the champagne part of the New Year's Eve champagne toast Not good.

There's a 30 minute window before the show, but I delayed the whole process, since I was traveling on foot i.e., Metro North, subway and dodging out-of towners.  In any case, the comedians were actually waiting for our arrival! When we arrived, my sister (who purchased tickets through Groupon) simply showed her tickets and immediately sat in the theater ""room"".Broadway Comedy Club is tight. This might be a negative to some. If I had to guesstimate, the room sits at most, 40 people. We managed to grab really good bench seats against the wall. Honestly, I'm glad my sisters and I arrived late, because all the chairs were taken and only thing left was that bench! Requirement for coming to Broadway Comedy Club is to purchase a cocktail. You're not going to get Jack or Hennessy here. Cocktails are wine-based, and to me they were good and sweet (still with a kick).""My Big Fat Dysfunctional Life"" turned out to be hilarious, and the actors were on point and brought it every time with their punch lines.

Which is bull.  Go online tix are $10.00-20.00.   The guy said  he'd come down on price charged us $45.00 for two tix for 9pm show.  Plus you have to buy two drinks.  Drinks were expensive and the beer my husband had wasn't even cold.  The seating is horrible instead of having the seats face the stage the have it so u have to turn your head as your sitting there.  And the seats were soo close together was terrible.  We moved to a different seat at other side of our table so my husband didn't have his back to comic.  I saw other people ask the guy sitting people to sit in certain spots and he had a who thing about sitting where he put them.  On the street when buying tickets the guys like oh this guy and these people will be there and some chick we heard of would be there.  Yeah right. I don't think not one was there that the guy said would be.  Bunch of bull to get you there. And the place is pretty far from where the guy sells the tix.  The place is old run down. Old pics of once popular comics on wall is only interesting thing to look at.  Wondering people in these pic ever worked at this crazy place.  Kills me how owners of these places in NYC just don't care about fixing it up maybe slapping some fresh paint on.  People working there don't seem to be enthused to be overly friendly to chumps Ike us that they get to come see a show here.  Seems like they mostly get the foreigners to go.  And I'm not comfortable having young teenagers being there which was weird.  Why a family would take then in there?  And some comics kept looking like they were hesitant to tell the dirty joke, and others didn't care.  Comics themselves they tried, some were funny most weren't. Seems like they all feed off crowd joking about them.  One guy had his bit he did but was terrible. Most looked like a bunch bums off street.  Don't waste your money or time.

You end up paying a lot for drinks because they require a 2 drink minimum. The first 3 acts weren't bad (the opener/MC, a guy from Brooklyn, and a guy from Boston[my fave]). Then it was all downhill from there. It was painfully awkward to sit through. Something that bugged me was that the comedians only came for their own set. So almost every set started with the same opening (asking the same questions to the first row audience or asking for a hoorah for weed).

When we agreed to pay for the tickets, he called and made us fake reservations for a fake table. The show was in a small, dark basement. The 5 comedians did improv and it sucked. 5/10. It's something I'd expect from a free college performance, but that's about it.The two drink minimum is a sales scheme. We each bought one drink and got away with it. Totally wasted $50 in total.  Even thought about speaking with management after the show to tell them what we were promised vs what was delivered but decided against it.  From another yelpers review, I see that complaints did not help anyway.On a positive note, I have learned to read more reviews before attending events blindly!",9,8,6

98,Rob S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,264,92,1.0,1/27/2016,"SHIT SHOW ALERT - WORTHY OF ZERO STARS - I despise the Broadway Comedy Club and will never go back again.  It is dank and reminds me of a 1970s basement where they had shady card games.  The cellar is very warm and when crowded morphs into a steam-bath.  One of the two bathrooms has been out of order every time I have been there and when they work they are filthy, reek of piss, shit and god knows what else.  Oh and do not be fooled by the name, this dump is nowhere near Broadway and certainly nowhere near Times Square where the touts selling tickets for this place work.I've read the stories about the aforementioned touts and the stories are sickening.  Advice to tourists - Never trust anyone selling anything in Times Square, CD's, Tickets, Photos with Superheroes or Photos with Painted Women with Saggy Boobs, Drawings etc.  And never trust the human-debris representing this place.  No reputable comedian would enter this place let alone perform here.  On the website it says they, ""Feature at least four national headliners per week."" I guess one would have to have an operational definition of, ""National Headliner."" Regardless, I find this claim dubious to say the least and have never seen, or heard, of anyone remotely famous performing here.Moving along, the comedians who are not, ""National Headliners,"" are almost always bad, awful and cringeworthy.  Bush league comics, people who can only play at dives like this or another in the Village that shall remain unnamed.  The lowest common denominator.  You may get a chuckle but for the most part you will sit through inane banter, insulting the people in the front row, crude sex jokes etc.  Terrible.Ten dollar bottle beers are part and parcel for a comedy club anywhere but are bitter when consumed at this place and usually tepid.  I once tried one of the mixed drinks and it was one of the worst things I have tasted in my life.  Apparently, they do not have a liquor license so they use.....Sake.  Just imagine the quality.  Think of your local Sushi place and the 5 gallon, no-name box of Sake and you have the idea.  They have food, they say it is, ""Pub Grub.""  No respectable New York City Pub would sell the shit they peddle here.  The portions are minuscule and it comes out of box, into a microwave and then to your table.  Garbage.  The waiters and waitresses are nincompoops for the most part.   Some of them look sad as they probably thought life had better for them than working in this shit holeI cannot believe this place is still open or even allowed to operate.  Between word of mouth, the slew of bad reviews on Trip Advisor and the Two Star average on Yelp, you would think the doors would have shut a long time ago.  However, it is still there, robbing and swindling people, forcing them to breathe foul air, drink wretched cocktails and listen to barn yard comedy.  To sum up.  No reputable comedian would ever perform here.  No New Yorker worth their salt would urinate in this place and tourists, go somewhere else or do something else.  This place is not worth it, there is better.N.B. - They tack the gratuity onto the final bill and do not tell you so do not tip.  This is bad manners and bad business in my opinion but I would not expect different from this place.",14,11,7

The vendor we bought our tickets from assured us that there was a whole lineup of good comedians. It was a great disappointment to me when none of those comedians were actually performing. The comedians who did perform were subpar. Secondly, the food was awful. I had the most disgusting chicken tender I've ever tasted in my life, and I paid $10 for two gross chicken tenders. Lastly, the service was atrocious. After the first 5 minutes of the show, the waitress did not come back to our table once until she came to bring us the check. At that time we asked to order another drink and she said no because there was another show starting directly after, even though there still ended up being about a half an hour left in ours.

107,greg m.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,28,0,1.0,10/10/2016,"We came here because a friend was doing comedy one night. She's just starting out, so we assumed most of the other comics were going to be in the same boat. With that in mind we arrived early so that we could get a jump on the seats we wanted: seats AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF THE STAGE. I just didn't want to be in the spotlight if I wasn't going to be laughing. You never know.Voluntarily sitting near the back is apparently frowned upon because our waiter singled us out while patrons were still arriving, forcing us to sit near the front. Shortly thereafter my friend (the comic) showed up, and greeted us. Our waiter asked her, ""Are you a party of one?"" To which my friend jokingly replied ""You need to find a better way to ask that."" With a sort of Herculean humorlessness, he replied ""No I don't."" He then took our order and I noted that the menu said ""2 drink minimum"". He was very forthright about the liquor being pretty bottom-shelf so I opted for a soda and some sliders instead. Then the show began... the MC, was PAINFULLY unfunny. Swiftly killing all the humor in the room aside from the occasional, forced courtesy-laugh. Which I would liken to the emotional equivalent of delivering a shit 3 hours premature. It was like being at Thanksgiving dinner and listening to your chauvinist, wise-cracking uncle who's absolved from any fault of making the whole table uncomfortable because he's ""old school"". Finally he brought the first comic on who wasn't exactly great but in comparison to the MC was pretty ok. My sliders and ginger ale arrived. The sliders were store-bought, probably from the frozen food isle but whatever - I wasn't expecting much. Overall the comics could be divided into two categories: young women just starting out who regaled us with their wit regarding being a gentrifier, their dysfunctional families and how much dating in NY sucks... and men over 50 who have been divorced at least once and desperately need an audience for their misery. It was like a cross between the deprogramming scene in A Clockwork Orange and the finale of The King of Comedy. Then our waiter returned and asked if I would like a second drink. ""No thanks"", I said. He motioned with an authoritarian finger to the menu. ""TWO DRINK MINIMUM"". I motioned to my plate of sliders. Does that not count for something? I mean, it costs as much or more than a cocktail. Again, he pointed to the menu... as though I was partially illiterate and didn't understand the way things work there. ""TWO DRINK MINIMUM"". Quite irritated, I waved him off and muttered something like ""Just charge me for another drink then."" He went away. Another comic came on. This one was of the young female self-loathing-gentrifier variety. Before launching into her diatribe of quasi-funny dating quips, she took an extra special moment to single us out, sitting near the front - for NOT LAUGHING ENOUGH. I believe the phrase ""impenetrable wall"" was used to describe our disposition. So now we were officially being chided for not laughing at crappy jokes from the seats that we were forced to sit in against our will despite showing up early to avoid said situation. Our waiter returned. With renewed emotional resolve, he asked what I would like for my 2nd drink. I then asked him, ""What if I buy another food entree?"" This would not suffice, no. He pointed with his divine finger, again to the menu. It was clearly stated in black and white. TWO. DRINK. MINIMUM. What am I? Some kind of idiot? Do I not understand that food is not a drink? It matters not if I buy 10 entrees. There is a 2 drink minimum. I don't recall what I said at that point... but if free expression would have been appropriate I would have said something along the lines of ""Just give me one of your sub-standard, headache-inducing margaritas to help me get through this shit-storm"". He obliged. After a several more comics, our punishment ended. The show was over.We stood up, convened with our friend - the comic. Who was actually pretty good. Reeling from the experience while our waiter approached the stage and did crowd control from the mic. As this was a midtown club that makes its bank hustling tourists in for sub-standard entertainment while serving up bottom-of-the-shelf drinks to wash down your preservative-laden sliders; it makes sense that their business model would be to cram in as many showcases as humanly possible... as quickly as possible. This meant that everyone who had just seen that awful show needed to GET THE HELL OUT to make way for the new batch of suckers waiting to get in. My friends and I were not respecting this by standing around and talking for 7 minutes. Despite several other groups of people milling about near the exit, our waiter singled my comic-friend out, by name, from the stage, over the PA. TO GET OUT. We did. And will never, ever return.",10,9,

These people must not have a sense of humor or be very sensitive. The 2 drink minimum per person is standard practice for most comedy clubs, even here in California. Plus, the tickets are so cheap, it all balances out. At the end of the day, 2 people were entertained and had an amazing time for almost 2 hours for just $80. Sounds good to me! They also offer Blue Moon beer, which was a huge plus for me. To be honest, we initially thought we were scammed by the salesperson on the steet that sold us the tickets. We got buyers remorse when we walked into the club and saw how dingy and small it looked. I guess we judged the book by its cover, which was wrong of us to do.

127,Isteak H.,"Queens, NY",294,39,3078,4.0,7/23/2015,"Wow, just WOW! This place right now in my eyes hold very high standards. So through my job Red Hook On The Road, a free job training/job placement for the CDL B license, I got an email to come to the Devil Cup for FREE with a certain. Now when it is free why turn it down so I thought to register for two different nights. However, I am lucky I went to only one and thank god it was the good one. So as I am walking to find this location I notice the area they are located in doesn't strike like there place where you find a comedy club. It was in a residential building, or at least that is what it looked like to me, and it seemed just weird it was there where they had other commercial areas being used to for other things. So I go inside and through a small walkway there is a lady with a book that had the people's name and how many they were expecting to bring. Around it you see pictures of all these famous comedians now taking a picture with a different person every time. I am assuming they are owners or co owners. But to see all these legends and to imagine their stand up is pretty crazy to think about. So once I got my free ticket I proceeded downstairs where another gentleman asked who I was and from there guided me to a seat. So here comes my first reason why it wasn't a five star. The guy puts me with an older lady, which wasn't that big of a problem, but to put me near a hot wall lamp where you have no AC on at the same time was just ludacris. It took me a good while to cool down and stop sweating. I wish I had my own place to choose from would have chosen a better spot for sure. Now the outside of this room had the same thing with famous comedians and their picture autographed. There was a red color to the whole place and if there were other colors the lighting of the candle wouldn't be enough to tell it. The room we were in was definitely tad bit on the small side, or it could have been due to the way they organized their chairs rows. Definitely an hard thing to walk, which is why I was kind of ecstatic I want in those tables. They even had people sit next to strangers. Definitely some funny faces were present when you looked at same people's expression. The other thing I hated about my Damn seat was that I was looking at a pillar most of the Damn night. I had to move every time to see the comedians, so that was annoying. It was definitely a right squeeze for everyone.Now the food and drinks, whoopeeeee!!! Lol. So I didn't order anything. If you check in this place you receive a free appetizer which I used to my advantage. Hey if you are broke like me most of the times you do whatever lol. So with the free appetizer I got the chicken wings. I got seven wings and they were normal size wings nothing really special. Now when I bit into these wings they were what I wanted. Tender, moist, juicy, tad bit crunchy, ans overall heaven. Most wings I eat, and what a lot love, is the overly crunchy exterior and a moist interior. For me I can avoid the outside being like that because it almost taste a little rubbery. These wings they were falling of the bone with the juices running off of it perfectly. With the added blue cheese dressing--which was in a cup as it looked store bought, which is sad--it definitely held up to the wings standard you would want anywhere. The other disappointing part comes now with the drinks. I had a white mountain, which is sake and a pina colada, and a sake sunrise, which is sake, champagne, and orange juice. As you can tell sake is the theme here, duh duh duh duhhhhhhhh! Hahaha. First these drinks definitely tastes great, that is if I wanted a juice or smoothie to drink. I never had sake so I don't know it's strength but I was definitely not even close to trading any alcohol in the drinks. Great part is that they were both $10 each and you have to order two drinks if you are going to stay there. So I spent that much and did not even feel a buzz, yay for me! I tasted more ice than anything else. Definitely not with the ten dollars which is the other reason for my discontent. Now for the main event, the great comedians of the night. Like I said I was ecstatic and jubilant that I went the day I did. It was the quarter finals of the Devil Cup and these comedians were on the to of their game. Man oh man were they all funny in their own. Their own style their own delivery, and their own knock out punch line. Even if they were telling jokes in the same line, which we not the case, each style was definitely prefect. You had highs with some and lows with others, and it pretty much fluctuated like that throughout the night. The funniest guy was this African African dude and only looked like he was still using fake ID to get drinks LOL. But his jokes were on point. Definitely cooking back for that reason. I don't care if you suck at food and drinks, you have to live up to the title of being a comedy club.",4,2,

Don't expect huge laughs unless you're already drunk.  The 2 drink minimum doesn't help since they can't serve real alcohol so stick to the wine. That's actually a bit pricey for what you get.

After checking yelp I see others have fallen for this same scam.  In order to salvage my money I went to the show against my better judgement and they had 5 or 6 comedians only 1 of which were decent.  The rest were average to Poor.  Some seemed like they had no material whatsoever.  Upon leaving the club people were smoking pot on the street in what seemed a not so safe neighborhood.The biggest crime is I wasted the last night of my New York trip watching this when I could have enjoyed one of the many quality shows just a few blocks away. Save your money and go elsewhere, Caroline's or Comedy Cellar but not here!",2,2,1

The rating went up a star because of her. Drinks were reasonably priced for the area, only one server, so with her tip and 3 drinks it cost me $43 more... not bad.

134,Lisa C.,"Dallas, TX",85,74,1,2.0,3/3/2015,"This isn't a TOTAL scam, but it is scummy. Here's the straight dope:1. Don't believe anything the guys at Times Square say. NOTHING. The club is not taping for Comedy Central, no one from Saturday Night Live will appear, big headliners like Ryan Stiles will not be there. LIES, LIES, LIES. However, there will be some funny comics, and you will laugh.2. I paid three tickets for $20 on Times Square, after threatening to walk. My advice: Don't pay ANYTHING for these tickets on Times Square -- you can get into this club FREE and just pay the 2-drink minimum by showing up. You won't get seated in front, and you may not get a seat if it fills up, but at least you haven't paid anything. Our paid tickets got us up front. Not really worth it.3. Buy the cheapest drinks you can, such as beer -- they're overpriced -- and if you don't drink alcohol, tell them you want the all-you-can-drink of non-alcoholic beverages for $15. They won't volunteer this info.Overall, there are much less tacky, scummy places to see comedians in NY. Read other Yelp reviews and avoid this one, unless you're desperate for entertainment.",14,3,3

She claims if I call the manager he will call me back and give me a refund. This is clearly a scam - the ticket guy is there then gone forever - club pushes responsibility back on the ""ticket seller"" and gives you a contact number so you don't scream at them to get your money back - naturally no one calls you back to reimburse you.With all of the drama surrounding street performers and Times Square, and the comedy show ticket sellers getting caught up in it and swearing they're legitimate and shouldn't be affected, you would think they would be more careful.

It turns out the people listed on the website weren't even accurate, so I am glad we didn't have high/any expectations.As mentioned 100 times on here, the staff is disorganized. One guy tells us we have 15 minutes before they start seating people, the next guy says at least a half hour. Thinking we could pick our own seats, we chose to wait (not having dinner first). Luckily, we were seated quickly, but they only sit you ""from front to back"" so we were right next to the stage. TIP- Unless you want to be part of the show- come later. I know that is not the advice of everyone on yelp, but it's true. Next time we'd probably come closer to the time of the show that way we can enjoy the show and not worry about being part of someone's act.The comedians were OK. No-one I ever heard of, and likely will never hear of again, but they were funny. There was one comedian who was a retired cop who was particularly hilarious. The food was the biggest joke. As mentioned, we didn't eat dinner so we tried a few appetizers to hold us over. The nachos were from a bag and not particularly good and the fries were still partially frozen.

""you know, the one with the brick wall Jerry stands in front of."" (nope!)The actual comedians were mediocre, and one of them only had racist jokes. And the drinks were ridiculously expensive. With the two drink minimum, our bill ran us almost $50.Just hoping that writing this review will help keep others from getting swindled.",5,1,1
177,Mike R.,"New York, NY",1,71,1,1.0,8/8/2016,"For a place that professes to be a comedy club, everyone working there seems pretty miserable and bitter. The demeanor of the woman collecting the money is best suited for a funeral parlor. The sound system in the room upstairs was terrible. The curtains were dirty and the tables and chairs were suspect too. The comedians were freaking terrible too-amateur hour. For $20 to get in AND a two drink minimum, the comedians should be much better. The host was stale with jokes she must have been using for the past 20 years-painful to sit through. These were old hacks, wannabees, and foul-mouthed dregs of society. Save your money, avoid this place and go elsewhere.",4,2,2

179,Zo V.,"Frisco, CO",118,4,0,1.0,6/23/2015,This place sucks like you read about! Service was bad.... waitress messed up order 3 different times then tried to charge us for every drink! We were scammed into coming here by some random guy on Times Square who told us Tosh and Luis C.K were performing but when we got there a guy that looks like he just came off the streets came to the stage. Don't go to the Broadway Comedy Club because it sucks! I would rather kick myself in the face before going to this club again.,6,6,3
180,Sen-Pei H.,"New York, NY",317,421,316,2.0,10/4/2014,"Although this was my first experience at a comedy club to check out my friend's friend's performance, I found the experience to be a bit shoddy because of the hostess's mistake of sending my friend and I in to wait for the 11pm show rather than the 10pm. By the time we got in, there were no seats left and we had to squeeze into the very back bench. That being said, some of the performances were funny.",1,,
181,Lauryn D.,"Newark, NJ",1,43,44,2.0,11/21/2016,"Ehhhh. What can I say?  The comedians were funny. I won't lie. However, the hustler selling the tickets on the corner gave us names of people that weren't there and I highly doubt that those people ever performed or ever will perform there. It is in a tiny basement with picnic table seating (about 8 tables). It seemed pretty run down. By the way the guy selling us the tickets promoted the place, you would think it was high class. Mixed drinks were horrible. All liquor bottom shelf, STAY AWAY from the pina colada. They do have bottled beer, can't go wrong there if you like beer. Besides a little talent, it would have completely failed. You don't know these comedians. Do not be fooled by the names thrown at you. But they had jokes. They made me chuckle. The 2 stars are going to their effort and the comedy at their very novice level. And since I went there to laugh (which I can't say I didn't) that is the reason I felt the need to leave 2 stars. By the way, there is a two drink minimum, so you will pay more in drinks than you did to get in. For two of us the bill was $50 plus $30 for buy one get one free ticket. This was definitely not worth $80.",1,,

187,Brandi P.,"Baltimore, MD",668,605,115,4.0,2/24/2014,"This place would have gotten a 5 star review but I had to knock off a star for a few minor mishaps. Let's start with the good... this comedy club offers some really great performers, at a reasonable price. The show lasted for about 3 hours, with 5-6 performers - which is highly unusual for a comedy show. You really get your bang for your buck. Of course, the drinks are relatively expensive and there's a two drink minimum but that's any comedy factory. Just think of it this way.. it's a night out on the town!Mishaps - they make you stand outside for a really long time, even after the 11pm ""open doors"". So if it's cold, be forewarned that the bouncer will make you walk back and forth between checking in with your tickets and the lounge ""waiting area"". Not the nicest setup but I understand it. Second mishap was that the audience was told that they needed a red ticket to confirm that they paid... well my boyfriend and I were ready to head out a bit early and couldn't get the waiters attention for the ticket. We wound up having to wait to the end of the show and just walking out without a ticket. If you're ready to leave, don't wait around for the ticket... because you'll never get it.",3,,1
188,Chris C.,"Falls Church, VA",68,7,3,1.0,8/11/2016,Don't fall for this tourist scam. They have vendors in Time Square selling tickets of people that aren't actually at the club. Beware.,1,1,1

First of all, the doorman was pretty rude and obnoxiously kept telling us there is a 2 drink minimum per person. I mean, I get it. Yelling it once is enough. Don't  order any mixed drinks. I asked if they had any orange flavored vodka, I mean who doesn't nowadays, and they replied, no only well vodka. Yikes! Instead, I ordered an $8 Mikes Hard Lemonade since I'm not a beer drinker. The place felt like a sauna inside, and most of the comedians weren't great. Tony Jackson was awesome, though. He definitely made it worth it!",1,1,

When you check into Yelp, you get a free appetizer choice on the menu.  Try the chili with cheese nacho.  It was either I was very hungry on an skipped lunch day or because the nacho was super delicious.  I guess I will go next time to be the judge of that.",4,1,5

They were all very friendly, there was a greater at the door and an ""usher"" showing us to our seats. We were in the upstairs room, nice and intimate, busy still a good crowd.There is a 2 drink minimum, but this is pretty standard at any comedy club you go to, and the drinks could even be non alcoholic, which is not so standard. We bought our tickets on Times Square and we got a great deal. There were quite a few (7) comics which I had mixed feelings about. I would've wanted some of them to stay on for longer, and maybe some not be there, but with that amount of comedy it's a given not everyone's gonna tickle your funny bone equally. For the most part pretty funny!If you can get a good price I would not hesitate to go!",,1,1

Updated review","GREENWICH VILLAGE COMEDY CLUB - I'm posting this as an update to my earlier review of the Broadway Comedy Club (zip stars). I just went to a show at the ""Greenwich Village Comedy Club "" on MacDougal Street to support a friend of a friend who was performing. Sorry, but there was nothing funny there at all. The comics were a bit hacky and after a drink or two I wondered if they would get better as the night went on. They didn't. The reason I linked this to my previous review of the Broadway Club is that I found out they're owned by the same person. Wish I had known before I walked through the door. With all due respect I felt they should pay me for sitting there. Sorry to say it was another (pricey) waste of an evening.",3,2,2
196,Sofi F.,"Morristown, NJ",40,3,3,2.0,7/16/2015,"Almost walked out to avoid spending the extra 40 bucks for our required 2 drinks each after hearing the hostess' introduction. Would have been nicer if there were actually some options on the drink menu. The real comedians turned out to be really funny so it was definitely worth staying. Could have done without all the corny tourists laughing at nothing..but again we knew it was going to be cheesy because we bought the tickets off the street from some tourist trappers. Definitely do not pay the full 30 dollars...even 20 dollars is expensive considering the comedy cellar is only 14 dollars and it's actually legit. We would have gone to that but it was sold out...in conclusion, it's a tourist trap so don't go unless your really desperate to see some decent comedians and everything better is sold out.",1,,
197,Valerie C.,"New York, NY",305,736,221,3.0,10/31/2011,"I came here with my friend for Broadway Comedy Club's Open Mic night on Sunday. There is a one drink minimum - all cocktails were $5! Not too shabby. We arrived at 6PM to support her friend and left about an hour later. From what I've observed, anyone can just walk in and sign up for the open mic. In fact, most of the audience were comedians themselves just enjoying some laughs while waiting for their turn. Each comedian gets a roughly 5-10 mins time slot and the show looked like it lasts about 2 hours. The first few stand up comedians we saw were... not funny. But it did seem to get better (drinks in our system probably helped with that). There was this one guy who was performing for the first time; super nervous and it definitely showed. My heart went out to him - if you ever read this Mr. Tranny Sex Story - keep it up, you'll be great! Brian J. and Oren were our favessss! Def wouldn't mind returning for an actual show.",2,1,
198,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",388,154,7,1.0,6/25/2013,"A few things you need to know about Broadway Comedy Club beyond what you've already read on Yelp:(1) They do not serve real liquor in their cocktails. They serve half-strength liquor substitutes with names like Rhumbero, Tequesta and Klir Red (look them up.)(2) Not all of the shows at Broadway Comedy Club are produced by Broadway Comedy Club, but every show has the same drink minimum. My guess is the ones on their site are the ones they produce.(3) The bathroom line can get pretty long, so bring your catheter.",3,5,1
199,Stacey M.,"Jericho, VT",2,26,3,2.0,3/17/2015,"I would give this 1 star but our waiter was nice and one of the several ""comedians"" was pretty funny.  The atmosphere here was like a VFW or church basement having an open mic night. When they say the comedians were on David Letterman or Last Comic Standing, they must mean as janitorial staff or stage crew because most were downright awful.    We had people walking in front of us the entire night and I wouldn't be surprised to find out the place was just a cover for some illegal activities.    Drinks were ok.  My husband ordered an Arnold Palmer and was given an alcoholic drink-  glad he wasn't on the wagon!  For $20 ppl plus a 2 drink minimum, I feel like I requested to see a comedy show and was told to bend over and take it instead!",3,3,2
