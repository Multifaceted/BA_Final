1,Dawn B.,"Seattle, WA",44,191,31,4.0,10/13/2018,"No trip to NYC is complete without a stop off at Pete's. I was a little disappointed we stopped in on Declan's day off, as he is a legend in a legendary town but Garrett took pretty good care of our group.Minus one star because Joe charged us full price when he brought my gf a drink when I ordered another. We told him no problem, he could leave it but where we come from those mistakes are usually comped or, at most, half price. Charging us full price meant we went lighter on the tip and didn't get that same warm and fuzzy feeling like we normally do when coming here. Can't help but think we lost out 2x with Declan being off last night.",,,1

3,Eric H.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",410,359,103,5.0,9/17/2018,"Established in 1864,  Pete's Tavern is one of the oldest bars in the city.  What is almost as old is the continuing fued between Pete's and McSorley's over who has been around the longest.  McSorley's was established in 1854, giving them a ten year head start.  However, Pete's maintains that it has been opened since the beginning, while McSorley's shut down during prohibition.  Pet's say that makes them the longest running bar in the city.  But McSorley's says there is no record indicating they shut their doors during the 1930's, therefore, they are the oldest and longest running bar in the city!  Wow, does that make sense!! Regardless, Pete's is a fabulous place and the best bar in the city to eat and drink in history.   The food here is quite good and they offer everything from steaks, pasta, seafood to burgers and pub food.  I have often popped in for a quick bowl of soup and a beer, as they are great for a short visit or a long stay.  The tables in the bar are nice and cozy and the feel of the place really takes you back to another era.  There's also a nice dining room in the back.   I really enjoy coming here and I try to make it a part of every NYC visit I make!",5,,

7,Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",663,841,861,5.0,6/22/2018,"I'm surprised I have never written a review of Pete's before now. I come here for the ""old New York"" ambiance and love to bring visitors here.  Most people are familiar with O'Henry and I also think a lot of people fancy themselves as the next great novelist. (stick to your blog posts and Yelp reviews people)  But it's still a thrill to see the booth where O'Henry used to hang and chill with a pint.Now the food. I've never had a bad meal in here and have eaten here probably 20 or 30 times over the years. (love them for brunch) The service is always great.  However, my most recent salmon lunch was overcooked and over seasoned.  I just wished they'd move to a better mix of healthy options, to also help ensure their longevity further. For the full experience, come in the Fall or the Holiday's.  The afternoon light that streams in the front windows at the bar is magical.  You'll really be transported.",1,,1

Loved the Christmas vibes, crowded but found a spot at the bar and had the best time. Great music, juke box so whatever your choice may be. Just all around great stop in the area. And it's a New York landmark so why not! Oh and I left a bag filled with vintage things and Christmas presents and they graciously returned it. Just...so happy! Thank you! Love love love!",2,,

10,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",201,204,584,3.0,12/29/2017,"After discovering this bar on social media my friend and I decided to give it a try before trying our luck at Rolf's nearby during the holiday season. In a nutshell, this is definitely a nice neighborhood bar to visit that will surprise you with its history, as much as it did with its decorations.My friend and I came in early one evening and were able to snag a spot near the bar (no stools had opened up yet). We were impressed by the miniature Christmas display they had set up in the windows, something that looked like it could be at a department store! Once we walked inside we were even more taken back by the red Christmas lights strewn across the ceiling along with the other miniatures and figurines hidden within the walls of the bar facing the people ordering.We kept it simple and ordered their version of spiked eggnog (not strong and over-priced) along with a beer to hold us over. Overall the specialty drinks seem not to be worth it, but if you're here just ordering your regular and get to experience their decorations first-hand, it's a must.Not sure what Pete's is like during the rest of the year but if you're looking  for a bar that'll put you in the Holiday mood, be sure to make a stop at Pete's Tavern",,,
11,Charisse S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",130,192,359,3.0,12/8/2017,"I would like to give this place a better review, but I have to base this on my actual experience. I went out of my way to come to this place because I'm a big fan of egg nog and I try to go to places that serve spiked eggnog or a drink similar to that during the holiday season.The spiked eggnog was a delight. They top if off with whipped cream, which makes it a little creamier. The holiday decorations are a nice touch as well. However, what I did not enjoy was how overcrowded it was. I could barely walk into bar because it was so packed. Mind you, it was only a quarter to 6 pm on a Thursday. I understand that this is around the time everyone is having holiday parties, but It's a big pet peeve of mine when establishments don't simply close or organize their space to accommodate large parties that have booked the place for an event. It ruins the experience for other customers as well as the parties themselves. So I'm not sure if the different parties called ahead or someone and their closest 50 buddies just decided to randomly waltz in. I'm guessing it's the former rather than the latter. Since we didn't want to walk away empty handed, we quickly ordered and a paid for our drinks. The moment we finished them, we hightailed it out of there to enjoy the rest of the evening at another restaurant in the area.",,1,
12,Melissa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",75,332,485,4.0,8/25/2018,Okay I have to admit that I've only hit up Pete's Tavern while waiting to get into a neighboring establishment but I should really come more often! The tap is always fresh and prices are reasonable. They also seem to have a good crowd of regulars as it's one of the oldest bars in NYC.,,,
13,Nancy R.,"New York, NY",6,9,0,1.0,11/14/2018,"Beautiful and festive decorations, lovely staff, food is from they day they opened. Everything tasted old and from a can. The tartar sauce was sour and just awful. I can't imagine.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE food.",,,
14,Danielle L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",187,2,0,5.0,7/29/2018,"Jeremy was a phenomenal bartender. Friendly, personable, and talkative, he made us feel welcome right away. He told us all about the history of Pete's and answered all of our questions about the oldest operating bar in Manhattan--they fixtures are the original! Beyond his knowledge of the bar itself, he had great drink recommendations and made sure we were happy with our choices throughout the night. We're new to town and he went above and beyond when he heard we wanted to join a roller derby of all things, helping us to find a league near by. A Sunday night stop turned into an unforgettable experience and i can't reconvened Pete's enough--especially when Jeremy is behind the bar!",1,,

20,Emily D.,"New York, NY",40,189,340,3.0,12/18/2017,My friends and I decided to come and see the decorations and grab a beer after some dinner. The bar isn't too big but they also had tables that people weren't allowed to sit at. I ordered a round of shots and unfortunately they were so warm and when it costs $60 the least they could do is chill it. We also had a beer the bar was super crowded so we decided to sit near the door but someone kept yelling at us to get up. It was around 10:30 on a Friday night and no one was using that table to eat so it was kind of annoying that they wouldn't let anyone sit there. Overall it's cool to come for a beer and to see all the decorations but the staff is rude and the drinks are whatever.,2,3,1
21,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,815,371,4.0,11/26/2017,"I had a fun dinner last night with a new friend and his old friend in town. I'd never been. The bar is a bit of a nightmare. Incredibly loud and while I love Christmas, this was like Christmas, the neon version. The back rooms, however, are comfortable and not too loud. Our server was hilarious. Speaks Hebrew and my dinner companions have also lived in Israel. I ordered a Grey Goose up with a twist along with my usual warning: ""NO olives anywhere in the vicinity of the drink."" Added: ""I'm like a DEA dog with drugs, except with olives."" He brought the drink and said, ""Here's your very dirty martini."" It was perfect. Friends had burgers (sadly, no cheese) but they were large and pink in the middle. Old-fashioned steak fries reminded me of childhood. I'm on a slim down week after two successive sinus things so I had the boring beet and goat cheese salad. It was fine. But not exactly the type of food you order at a place like this. I'd not go to the bar (at least not when this neon Christmas thing is going on). But it's historic. Also, I disagree with the reviewer who compared this to McSorley's. Apples and oranges. I wasn't invested in the nostalgia of the place. I didn't pick Pete's Tavern last night (didn't know we were going there, in fact), so I had no expectation. But it's cool that it's so old and I do love this part of town.",4,1,1

Love the vibe and atmosphere of bar and restaurant. Food-wise, the bread to start off with is great. Good drinks--I had the margarita and my friend had the martini.

24,DJ F.,"Bayside, NY",28,353,5,2.0,6/28/2018,"Always wanted to try this restaurant as it's an institution.  Our seafood entrees were fine once we received them.  Had to ask for bread which should have been brought to our table automatically.  Busboy came to remove our salt and pepper for no reason, we asked him to leave it.I had ordered my salmon and veggies grilled with no garlic.  Our server told us the chef screwed up the first time and forgot about no garlic in the olive oil so he would grill me another piece of fish.  We were hungry and had already waited 30 minutes for our entrees.  Both salmon and seafood linguine were were tasty once they arrive but service very spotty.  Our tip reflected this.  So it was our first and last time.",,1,
25,Jillian S.,"New Orleans, LA",0,23,2,1.0,10/3/2018,"We recently met family and friends here for dinner, and though the waiter was exemplary, the food was horrible. Most of us ordered hamburgers and fries. The fries were so saturated with grease that you could see the grease inside. The burgers were completely tasteless, and mine was really undercooked. I didn't eat too much of my burger but what I did eat actually made me very sick from my stomach. It's hard to believe there are establishments like this restaurant that continue to exist without investing in their kitchen. Isn't the point of being a restaurant all about serving good food? Tasteless, greasy and undercooked food that makes you sick in a city of great restaurants? No thanks!",,,
26,Ting C.,"Denver, CO",133,38,23,5.0,7/6/2018,"Absolutely my favorite place in the area. Great atmosphere, food and service. Food serve very fast and fresh, definitely worth the pricing. would love to come back to this oldest original bar in the city.",,,
27,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/18/2017,"This is such an awesome bar. There's something more fun about going to a bar that has so much history and tenure- especially because there's only a handful of restaurants that actually survive decades in New York, never mind hundreds of years. I love their unique touch where they pass around free small snacks in the bar area for anyone drinking. Definitely try to come on the early side of happy hour if you want to get a spot at the bar. This place gets packed.I docked one star only because I think the food menu is a little overpriced for what it is.",,,
28,Michael S.,"Ossining, NY",13,261,80,2.0,10/13/2017,"I went to Pete's for Happy Hour. The bartenders are not friendly and they can ignore you especially if they are talking to a regular patron. I could deal with that, but what really aggravated me (and its the first time in 50 years) I've ever seen this is they have 4 draft beers listed for Happy Hour at $5 per beer. I order one and the bartender takes $6.00 out and gives me 50 cents back. I asked isn't the beer $5.00? He says the extra 50 cents is for tax. Tax for a beer, is this a 7-11 or a bar, WTH?The HH menu says passed Hor'derves - nice touch, but the guy came around one time in 3 hours.",2,,
29,YiHsin C.,"Flushing, NY",75,20,23,5.0,9/9/2018,"The server was very attentive and I liked the setting of the restaurant though the couple seating table was too narrow, not enough leg space. The omelet with smoked salmon was creamy and has the smokey flavor. It was too salty which was nice. I liked the home fries. Everything was very fresh. It also comes with a small blue muffin which was disappointing because it was cold and a bit stale.",,,
30,Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",923,1222,5104,4.0,8/15/2017,"I visited Pete's last month because it was used for a wedding after party. It happened to be convenient to the venue being only a few blocks away. Our party was in a second floor room, up a small, dark stairway at the very back of the restaurant. The dim lighting added to the feel of the place - a casual pub. The passed appetizers were plentiful, with one or two trays coming out every few minutes. There was just about every bar food you could want - yum! The room wasn't very big, but was a good size for us (maybe forty people?).",5,1,2

33,Andrea M.,"West Chester, PA",15,176,135,5.0,1/28/2018,This is the oldest running bar in the city. It was a great place for some beers. There are Christmas lights strung across the ceiling which was a nice touch! There are pictures all over of all the famous people that have been there before. We got there at like 2pm on a Saturday and got a seat at the bar. When we left at 4pm there were a bunch of people standing waiting for a seat at the bar.,,,
34,Suzanne E.,"Chicago, IL",101,353,28,5.0,1/27/2018,"I forgive this place for harboring O. Henry, whom I was forced to read in high school, because: it's old, it's gorgeous (so much Victorian detail everywhere), and if you can find a seat at the bar no one objects to your hanging out and reading--and the Irish coffee is restorative. Whoever thought up the winter décor--a carpet of rosy little lights on the ceiling--really understands what the soul requires between Christmas and the first spring flowers.  Very cheering.  And a lovely location, on a residential street near Union Square--kind of a nice stopping off point if you're heading from midtown to the Lower East Side or vice versa.",,,
35,Holly A.,"Philadelphia, PA",19,47,36,5.0,7/27/2017,"Pete's is the best. I may be biased because I live in the neighborhood but there is honestly no better neighborhood bar. It's super chill, I always have great service whether I'm sitting at the bar or sitting at the restaurant and I've never had to wait for a table although the place always seems full. There's outdoor seating in the summer time and amazing Christmas decorations during the holiday season. Plus the egg nog is on point. The drinks are pretty basic - I usually stick with beer or wine, except for when I'm drinking the nog! When it comes to food, the Monday night pasta special can't be beat. $14 for a salad, glass of wine and delicious pasta? Pretty much unheard of in Gramercy. If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a casual spot, I definitely recommend Pete's!",,,

40,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",418,354,3232,2.0,9/24/2016,"I think I did Pete's Tavern the wrong way: I came for lunch, sat outside and ordered a salad. If I ever came back, I'd do a burger or a sandwich and sit inside. There were flys all over the place outside and the table was sticky and wobbly. We got iced teas and salads. I had the mesclun salad with grilled chicken. Our iced teas were good, and the salads are big, but the chicken made the lettuce soggy, and the salad was pretty boring: just chicken, lettuce and some tomatoes. The prices are really reasonable for lunch, and our waitress was very nice, so I feel bad giving two stars, but I really didn't enjoy my salad or the outdoor seating area.",1,1,1
41,Alan A.,"Queens, NY",125,324,1952,3.0,6/22/2016,"Pete's Tavern was a favorite dining spot of my parents back when I was a kid. It was also the last time I had a meal there. When I found out that my wife had never been to Pete's, I took her there for our anniversary. As we sat and looked at the menu I told my wife not to expect a 4 star gourmet meal, just yer basic red sauce Italian. And that's what Pete's serves up. They also serve up a little history. The 150 year old place was a speakeasy during prohibition. It was also the tavern where the writer O'Henry wrote many of his short stories. The place still looks like it did when he wrote there.It was very busy for a Tuesday night but we were still seated right away. We were brought a basket of bread (cold), menus and water. When our waitress took our drink order we also asked for some bread that was heated. She brought over our drinks and warm bread and took our order.I always have veal parmigiana to gauge an Italian restaurant's kitchen so I ordered that with spaghetti and meat sauce. My wife ordered linguine with shrimps, scallops and calamari. Both meals came with a very basic house salad.I was able to cut the veal with my fork which is always a good sign. The sauce was sweet. The spaghetti was cooked properly but the meat sauce was a little too heavy. My wife's seafood was also cooked properly. It's nice when a kitchen cooks calamari properly. It was tender and did not have the consistency of rubber bands.Pete's is the type of place you have to experience at least once. Yes I know there are plenty of better Italian restaurants in NYC, but none of them have the ambience of Pete's Tavern nor the ghost of O'Henry sitting next to you in your booth. Mangia!",4,,2

45,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,2.0,5/15/2017,"I'd wanted to check out Pete's Tavern for awhile, and finally did yesterday afternoon.A couple of friends and I dropped by for brunch and drinks. Seated outside, we were able to enjoy the cool spring weather under an awning that protected us from both the rain and later the sun. However, the food, drinks, and service all left a lot to be desired.One of my friends ordered from their brunch menu, and selected the BBQ burger with a side of fries and a mimosa. While the burger itself was decent, the sauce was simultaneously too sweet AND salty, and the fries were clearly of the generic frozen variety. Furthermore, the pickle looked as though it had been sliced and sitting out for days. And her mimosa was weak.My other friend and I ordered only drinks, selecting a bottle of Peroni and a Bloody Mary, respectively. The bottle of Peroni cost $8, which is entirely too much for a simple bottle of beer at brunch. And the Bloody Mary was nothing special, and accompanied by a rancid lime.Finally, when it came time to pay, we gave the server two cards to split the bill in half. However, shortly thereafter he came back and informed us that he had accidentally put the entire charge on one card, asking if it was okay. While we worked it out so it was, that sort of inattention to detail is nonetheless indicative of someone who has no regard for his customers.I do not plan to return.",,,

And celebs seem to love this place based on the photos on the wall, and I did see Jimmy Fallon drinking a Guinness with his buddy on St Patrick's day 2013here with my own eyes, so I guess this place is legit.I've been to Pete's multiple times during my 4 years as a Gramercy resident and it never disappoints. Family always loves this place too when they visit.All the food is great - they have food specials in the bar which gets quite loud and crowded, and a quieter area to sit in the back.  My recent Thursday visit was great per usual. Ordered a salad, and cheeseburger. All the plates are HUGE so my boyfriend and I split this and were satisfied.Always get the steak fries! Such a classic. I also ordered the Big Apple Martini, sour apple martinis are a fav of mine and they have a good one along with other cocktails.Old school joint, with efficient old school service. I love Pete's!",2,,

Way to live it up! And the Yankees won and they had stoli vanilla. Which is often not in many bars. Food company and atmosphere was great. Felt the presence of all the famous ppl!,,,

A lot of people I guess, my friends brought me here for their unbeatable prime rib dinner deal: every Tuesday night their prime rib is just $17.95 and comes with garlic mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. That's just insanity. And the steak is good, cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of fat. Definitely worth coming out for! I recommend asking for a side of horseradish to go on top of it. We also split the fried calamari/shrimp appetizer which is your standard bar fare, but does come in a massive portion. The pastas on the menu are as much as the prime rib special. Service at the bar was very friendly, service at the table was good enough, no complaints. Ambiance is old school. It's a big space, lots of wood, twists and turns, and nice details if you're keeping your eyes open. Blue Moon is $7 or $8, I'd stick to their happy hour specials instead. They have their own house ale which I think is the only happy hour option, but I'm honestly having trouble recalling.",3,,

The food came out after about an hour of being there and both of our meals were incorrect.

We're all business owners and it was a celebratory night because a merger was in the making. When the lot of my diverse group approached the bar for our second drink, the bartender Anthony stated he would not serve us. This was the technical first drink I would be purchasing, he stated that one individual in the group ""had enough"" and thus will not serve seven others whom were only beginning their evening.

He told me that the meat was not over cooked and tough and "" I should have asked how the wings were cooked before I ordered them ( which I did). later while I was coming out of the bathroom I heard this manger mocking me to his staff.

That should not have taken 15 minutes to tell us. I get that you're a busy restaurant but this means there's communication problems between FOH & BOH which probably has to do with poor management. Our food then took even longer to come out because I would imagine the kitchen held our whole tables order until I re ordered. When the food came out all our meals were good.

While the decorations were great, this was easily the worst service I have ever had in New York City. I have never reviewed a place on yelp but felt compelled to because of this service.The bartender accused my friend and I of not paying for our drinks. Even when we produced the receipt, he refused to believe us and begun speaking loudly and rudely about us behind the bar. I understand it can be frustrating when 'customers think they are always right' (I have spent many years working in hospitality myself), but when a customer is able to produce a receipt, that is pretty clear evidence. I have never tried to cheat a bar (out of 7 dollars...) and I can understand when a server makes a mistake, but to treat two young girls so poorly and so rudely in front of the whole bar, when we produced a receipt, was disgraceful. The bar wasn't busy, and it wasn't that hard to remember that we paid straight away, for two wines... I couldn't get out of there fast enough.",9,1,

It has a good, diverse, basic menu of pasta, seafood, chicken, burgers and steaks.  My prime rib was good but not great and seemed a bit tough, but my wife was very happy with her Chicken Piccata. My wife also chose better for the salad--the ranch dressing was very good, but my blue cheese dressing was weak and didn't taste much of blue cheese. The real reason to come here is less about the food and more about the history and ambiance, and in this regard Pete's doesn't disappoint. It's an old place--the longest continually operating bar and restaurant in the city--and it oozes old-school charm. The bar is often crowded and loud, but the restaurant in the back is quiet. The servers are very professional. And if you come during the holidays, the place is decorated just like it should be--with old-fashioned lights and Christmas trimming. There are lots of better places for a meal in the neighborhood, but there are few places to get a sense of New York's past like Pete's.

I went for the first time for dinner tonight and the food ranged from just so basic (eggplant parmigiana) to pretty grim (buffalo wings and buffalo chicken salad that weren't buffalo at all).  Instead they were sort of in a sweet and sour, Asian-inflected sauce.  Service was solid.  Really wanted to give Pete's 4 stars but just couldn't on this visit.",1,,

102,Akemi H.,"New Milford, NJ",0,7,4,4.0,12/26/2016,My friend invited me for dinner before Christmas. It was my first time here and I really liked that light on the ceiling. It was just beautiful! Some of my friends ordered prime rib and I ordered striped bass(we shared each other) Fish was a little dried but it came with lemon w/ sashes. Rib was very tender and only $19.95! It was way beyond my expectation. Atmosphere was somewhat so peaceful despite of the crowds. (I have to push them to get into our seats)I'm so glad my friend made reservation 3 weeks ago. Next time I want to come back w/ my family.,,,
103,Peter B.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,15,1,1.0,7/7/2017,"If this place is so great, why did they serve me the worst, cheapest, pasta soaking in a water filled dish with some cheap, diluted, watered-down tomato sauce?  Skip it.",,,

105,Alexandria T.,"Houston, TX",471,655,1979,2.0,7/6/2015,"We headed to Pete's Tavern on the Fourth of July after our original plans fell through because of holiday closures. Three of us were seated at super tiny table outside. Seriously, the table was really tiny! The server seemed to be a little overwhelmed with the amount of tables, and never brought over water or silverware for me after I got there a little bit later than the other two. I read about the history of Pete's being the longest continually operating restaurant in NYC, but I don't think it has much else going for it. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, which is just grilled chicken and a bun, and I added cheese for an additional charge. It was really bland and basic. My boyfriend got the burger, which he said wasn't very good either. The place was really overpriced, and the food very subpar. I will not be visiting Pete's again anytime soon.",1,,1
106,Fred A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,1,4.0,1/30/2018,When this place is slightly crowded but quite it's a gem.  Anyone will enjoy an afternoon meal here.

The place was pretty empty and it's definitely not the typical midtown lunch spot.

On a bad day they are flat out obnoxious. They will literally run you down if you happen to be in their path while they're serving drinks of food. Hey guys.

This place is usually pretty busy but is filled with a good, fun crowd. They have good food options, but I haven't tried any. If you get super hungry at the bar you can also move to the adjoining restaurant. The drinks weren't super strong but most are reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and you can entertain yourself looking at pictures of the celebrities that have been there.",,,
117,Joe L.,"Rumson, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,6/18/2017,"Pete's was always our favorite place decades ago. Wonderful food, servers, friends that you would make for life with just a simple hello at the bar. Since then, left for the suburbs across the river to raise a family. Now we're back living in Manhattan again. Pete's is STILL spectacular! As though nothing has changed. The only thing that is different is that nearly all of the staff can now be our children... Same great food, tables, pictures and most of all friendliness and professionalism that begins the moment you are welcomed entering the dining room.

They were able to squeeze a large group in for dinner on a Saturday night when we did not have reservations. The Christmas decorations were amazing, drinks were good. i had the eggplant parm which was amazing. Portions were large. Our waiter was so nice and attentive even on a busy Saturday night. Our food and apps came out quickly. Can't say enough good things about this place. 5 stars!",,,
119,Craig C.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",54,46,2,3.0,6/13/2017,A bit of a tourist trap. Overpriced and nothing super special here. The bar itself is very cool but food is average at best. There are many better options in this neighborhood if you are looking for good food.,,,

121,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,390,60,5.0,2/2/2016,"Being one of the older bars in NYC, I wasn't into it when I first walked by. I was all ""you're not new and shiny and glowing and trendy!"" But then I realized I am no longer any of those things either, so I shouldn't judge and need to probably stop by for a burger. I got that burger about two years ago and have never, ever looked back. Pete's is a neighborhood gem for those lucky enough to live just around the corner. The bartenders remember you, are oh-so-friendly and keep your beer filled to the brim. It's very cozy and old school inside, with a decent amount of outdoor seating in the warmer months. The menu boasts your basic pub fare, highlights are the burger, mozzarella squares, penne a la vodka and chicken parm. I like their fries and nachos a little too much. The food is always solid and comes pretty fast and the wait staff is friendly but not overly so. The have loads of space to dine, which you won't notice right away. There's a back room! And the single high top table in the front is the best seat in the house. They even brew their own beer, Pete's Ale. It's extremely delicious but goes down real easy. Maybe too easy? I don't know. I don't know if I have ever left here sober. I used to live in the neighborhood and would be here ALL. THE. TIME. And even now, living very far away, I stop by frequently after work. I don't even work near here. That's how good it is. I like to feel like I'm going home. That's what Pete's is. Going home. It's like hanging out in your living room but with a beer tap and professional kitchen. I have come early, late, day, night, rain, snow, sleet and sunshine. It's always appropriate to be at Pete's.",7,3,3

No shortage of reviews on this well-established institution. I have had many a Dark and Stormy in Bermuda, home, and the occasional bar that carries Goslings black rum. What I never had before was one that looked dark and stormy!  Ice and ginger beer go in first, then the Goslings gently added on top - looks like a storm cloud settling over the drink. 20+ years of mixing these things, never occurred to me to try it this way. Pete's ale also pretty darn good. Next time, we will try dinner and drinks.",,,

But the beer was nice and cold and very cheap. $4 for a blue moon. Smaller than I expected inside. I'm not sure how many bars in New York City have the title oldest tavern. I'm pretty sure McSorley's says the same thing. And the bridge Cafe used to say that as well. There's really nothing special inside to set it apart from any other Irish bar.,,,

They said that it was just listed there, but when we did the math, we realized it was added.

When my mom got her prime rib, she said ""oh sorry they never told me it was ready..."" and instead of having them re-do it, she brought it out to her medium when she asked for it super rare. Also, I ordered a steak with mushrooms and it came out without mushrooms - when I reminded her that I ordered mushrooms, she goes ""oh you did"" and still doesn't bring out the mushrooms until I asked an owner/manager.Food was beyond delicious but as I said, our waitress sucked.

A waiter spilt steam water on my phone but immediately apologized, but it was sloppy that he spilt it from the plate or whatever and so much of it. Fortunately a good amount landed on the floor so no damage. Decor was your typical pub decor. The place is famous for being the longest operating restaurant and I guess lately they have been skating by on that. Lots of photos of famous people in the restaurant, so it was nice and cheesy.Details on the food:I ordered from a four course prixe fixe menu because I was in a private room for an event. The appetizer options were calamari or baked manicotti but the portions sizes were terribly off. The manicotti was appetizer size, but the calamari was large enough for two or three people. The calamari was delicious though, hot and good, and freshly breaded. Just too much so lots of ppl wasted. The salad I could do without. It was a pizza shop salad, iceberg lettuce and gigantic piece of tomato and whatever else they could find to toss in. The entire options were veal Parmesan (with pasta) or salmon filet or shell steak with mashed potatoes and escarole. No complaints about the steak. I had the veal Parmesan. It was alright. Tasted like a frozen piece dropped on a deep fryer. Came with a side of spaghetti. It was alright. Nothing exceptional again. the steaks looked much better and everyone said they were delicious. For dessert they brought us a sampling. The pies tasted store brought and they didn't hear any of them up. There was cheesecake (meh), pecan pie (store bought) and apple pie (which they didn't warm and was refrigerator cold). They or a glob of whip cream our the can on all of the desserts too which took away from them. The gelato dessert was the best. But then again you can't really go wrong with just ice cream.This place is obviously where you come for drinks not for food. So if I wanna drink for cheap and am in the area I might consider it.",1,,

Updated review",So I don't write a lot of reviews.  Really only when I go so somewhere and it knocked me over. Last night I went to Petes with a friend looking for something for a relaxing Sunday night dinner.  She suggested a few places and we settled on Petes and I'm glad we did.  The service was good from the start.   I ordered the chicken parm in a spicy marinara with a side of pasta.  It was phenomenal.  The portions were huge.  It's one of only two times in the last 12 months I have taken food home because there was so much.  Also loved the atmosphere.  Decorated for christmas it was great.  I would suggest it to anyone,,,
162,Nilsa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,276,287,4.0,6/27/2015,"Despite the very uncomfortable booth seats, the food here is pretty decent. I was craving for some pasta and got the meatball spaghetti. My god, the meatballs are ginormous and are so good. I could barely finish one meatball for my whole plate of pasta! On the other hand, the clams casino was a disappointment. There was no breadcrumbs mixed with bacon baked on top of the clams, it was merely a piece of bacon on top of a sliver of clam meat. We basically got bacon on shells; it was quite sad. Stay clear away from clams casino here, but embrace the meatball pasta here!",,,1

164,Regina H.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,2.0,2/22/2017,I used to be a FAVORITE FAN of Pete's Tavern.  Went in last night and they are now under new ownership/management and their menu is (blah).  They took away the most delicious item on the menu - the creamy Italian house dressing.  Why would you mess with perfection?????  The wait staff was not very helpful and when I mentioned how sad I was to the manager (?) his response was (like the food - blah).  It is a very sad day for me.  I will no longer be a Pete's Tavern customer (unless they bring back that salad dressing).  It truly makes the entire meal.,1,,
165,Eric W.,"Arlington, VA",23,83,36,2.0,7/10/2015,"I didn't like my meal and couldn't finish it. Even the most basic parts, i.e., the side salad and the spaghetti, were mediocre. My server was polite but seemed a little confused.I did like the atmosphere, which was quaint. It seemed like a genuine, neighborhood bar. I'm giving this place two stars because it might be a nice place to sit outside and have a beer.  But don't come for dinner.",,,
166,Isabella M.,"Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/3/2016,"I wish I could give zero stars to this place. Extremely racist and rude people. The server was rude. Did not acknowledge I was there forever. Took my order last. The people there were rude as well. Extremely unwelcoming. I went with a group of great colored friends, and we were the only colored people there. It was very discouraging to see the kind of rude and insulting attitude we received from people of the bar. Even the workers of the bar were very rude. On top of that the place is extremely crowded that it is difficult to move around anywhere. Also I know it's nyc and nyc pricing is insane but this pricing is not worth it. There are many cheaper bars you can find and have fun in that does not have white privileged people. So disappointed in this place. Never coming back. Telling my friends also to never come here.",6,1,

168,Em P.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,55,113,3.0,5/29/2015,"I really truly wanted to like this place. I had heard a few things about it. Mainly about its historical relevance to NYC. But I had never heard too much about the food. And honestly, I don't begrudge anyone who likes Pete's, but there's a reason why I hadn't heard one person speak about the food here: it's blah. We had the fried calamari to begin with and it was no better than something you'd get from the frozen food section in the supermarket. Now, that's not to say they were horrendous. It's just that the quality wasn't up to what I was expecting it to be. We also had an oven-roasted goat cheese salad with chicken that was quite good...except for the fact that we had to wait several minutes to get our chicken. I will say this: the staff was awesome. Our waiter was super attentive and our hostess was very sweet. We sat outside on a pleasant Sunday afternoon but we snuck a look inside and the interior is very nice.",,,

171,Nick M.,"Chicago, IL",36,47,2,2.0,3/4/2016,"Pete's used to be a great historic solid food institution. As neighbors we had a surprising disappointing meal tonight...friends' steak sandwich was burned fatty and chewy. Usually don't complain but this was exceptionally bad. Manager offered us a round of beers to smooth things over, then brought only two beers and still charged for the steak sandwich. Not their best work, probably won't ever come back with all the great restaurant choices in the neighborhood. The pork and the burger also weren't too great and service was very slow. Clams casino was recommended by waiter, but it was small. Very small. We're talking 6 tiny tiny clams for three big guys. Manager admitted steak sandwich was not good. Sorry we ordered something off your menu.... Too bad but with a place this old I have faith that it will be great again one day. #MakePetesGreatAgain",1,,
172,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,4.0,1/12/2011,"Lemon Sherbert was taken here after being freshly liberated to be in God's hands by a literary, prolific poet friend. I was enticed by the history on the outside and a plaque commemorating the renown literary figure, O. Henry of the American classic short story ""Gift of the Magi."" As per their takeout menu: ""By 1864 a tavern opened here... the oldest continuously operating bar and restaurant in New York City.""  An Italian American cuisine tavern which pre-dates 'progress' of Prohibition were unable to terminate Pete's Tavern.My Chicken Marsala was tasty, but their burgers are the main attraction for the patronizing at Pete's Tavern.  Disappointedly the house salad dressing accompanied with my Chicken Marsala entree was bland as it was oil lacking solid substance, no flavor.  The burgers sit on sour dough bread and is accompanied with steak frites, not like the typical thick potatoly French Fries as I love the thin cut and salted flavor of steak frites.  The warm apple crumb cake fits to the accord of a bitter winter's day to comfort my broken heart damaged by callous and unfathomably nasty encounters. Customer service is very warm and friendly from the maitre d' to the server and bus boy, which is whole heartly to see it still exist today in the 2011 era.  In the facilities area there are photographs of famous or celebrities displaying their patronage of Pete's Tavern.",2,,2

175,Jon L.,"New Galilee, PA",1,42,4,3.0,8/9/2015,"We went to Pete's on a Saturday night whim. We couldn't decide what type of food we both were interested in eating, and after looking at the menu online for Pete's, decided we could find something no matter how diverse our tastes for the night.Walked in about 9 pm. Several seats at the bar open. Asked about outdoor seating for dinner. Instantly and politely seated. Our waiter, who turned out to be quite attentive, took our drink orders. With drinks in hand, let's talk food. Our waiter seemed to offer his real opinions about different items on the menu, and led us to choices we liked. Appetizer of calamari was really good, and bountiful. With a side salad, that really would have been sufficient. Oh no, though not to be. My eggplant parm showed up at a good pace for our meal. Steaming hot. Tasty. Spaghetti side with meat sauce was also good. Prices are probably on the low to middle side for NYC. All the wait staff were extremely attentive and friendly.After dinner we had to sit at the bar just so we could say we did. Great history, the liquor selection seemed above average, but the draft beer selection was just ho-hum. Bar tenders were pleasant and attentive, but not overly so. Would we go back? Sure. And look forward to it.",,,

186,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,8/9/2012,"Pete's Tavern claims to be the oldest continuously operating restaurant & bar in New York City. That's all fine and dandy, but I still prefer McSorleys any day over Pete's. Sure, it's old and historic, and it has that classic 1800's look, but to me falls well short of the ambiance and charm that McSorleys has. Pete's always reminds me of the kind of place the ""suit and tie yuppy 1%"" goes to, while McSorleys reminds me of a bar the ""regular joe crowd"" congregates at. It's just more of a fun scene at McSorleys, while Pete's is the type of low-key spot to bring the parents when visiting, or have a corporate event. The decor is very nice and you can tell they put effort into maintaining it.Now don't get me wrong, Pete's Tavern is a nice place and the food is actually pretty decent here. I've been here with my dad a few times for dinner and the food is served up in large portions at reasonable prices. The menu here is a decent size with a mix of appetizers, salads, burgers/sandwiches, pastas, and entree plates that are a step above the average pub type fare but nothing to rave about. They also have a separate lunch menu, and also feature specials during both lunch and dinner. On nice days I work in the area and have taken a seat outside to enjoy lunch in the sun. There is seating inside at booths and in a dining area. Along the walls are pictures of celebs that have been there, along with some historic facts and tidbits.  Beer selection on tap is decent. They even have PBR on draft - but no real happy hour deals to speak of. Service can be hit or miss depending on the time of day and the crowd. Also, the times I have been here the people and staff have been pleasant enough, and it can get crowded at the bar after work hours. In my opinion, go to Pete's for a drink and a meal just to say you've been there, then head over to McSorley's for some real drinking fun.",8,3,4

I had to practically wave the 2 bartenders down even though there was hardly anyone there and they had made eye contact with me 5 minutes before.  When I finally ordered my drink, he grabbed the empty beer glass in front of me, so I let him know that it wasn't my glass (in case he was thinking of refilling it). I got an EYE ROLL! Like I was annoying him or something!According to other reviews, staff is just plain rude here.
