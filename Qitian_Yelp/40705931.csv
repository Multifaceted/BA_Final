0,Meems N.,"Fresno, CA",6,56,221,5.0,11/5/2018,I only leave ratings for restaurants that I would definitely come back to. You can read the gazillion other reviews already on Yelp.The only thing I would not order is the chicken. Everything else was outstanding.,1,,
1,Xinting Y.,"Baltimore, MD",48,158,698,4.0,10/26/2018,"Dining here is a definitely an experience. Me and hubby shared the farmers feast and regular set. And we enjoyed their genetically modified products, I am not a fan of peppers but I've never had peppers taste that this--kind of a mixture of meat and other spices, but still crunchy and juicy. Their mini-tomatoes taste great too, no matter with the sauce or not. My favorite dishes are the herb-wrapped bean bundle with egg salad, I think those are one of the best beans I ever had: the flavors of herbs are incorporated in the beans through the smoking process, but the beans are still moist and soft. The breads are fabulous, the idea of putting crushed nuts in the butter is great! The main dishes we got the beef and pork. We didn't know the three pieces are different parts at the beginning, each of them tastes great but different. The only down side is the portion, I mean, it would barely feed us :-( So we asked for additional breads.Blue hill accommodates my dietary restrictions, but not as well as I expected: I suppose the eggplant would taste much better with dairy products, but ours tastes very bland--they could do a better job making the taste better. Dietary restrictions should not mean less flavorful food!Overall, nice experience. Would like to try the stony barns location next!",,,
2,Julio G.,"Newark, NJ",224,362,1216,4.0,10/24/2018,"Great but not amazing. Im a big foodie and perhaps I was expecting courses to be much more satisfying but I didn't love every dish. Yes the food is spectacular and unlike anything else you'll have in New York but I left with a void. Particularly in my stomach. If you want a fulfilling dining experience this place is not for you. Upon entering you are instantly greeted by a super attentive staff. Attention to detail is their specialty. Check your coat and enter the small and initiate dining room. Once seated you are almost immediately offered tap water or sparkling water. The menu is simple. Choose from a small selection of entrees and pairings or have the farmers feast which is basically chefs choices. There is also an additional option to add onto the farmers feast which includes two additional dishes. Prices start around $100. Once you've looked at the menu the waiter comes around to take beverages, choose a unique craft cocktails or some rare wines and beers. Everything on the menu is unique and has a story which is quite engaging. Once your meals are ordered the food begins to pour out. Small dishes leave the kitchens and find their way onto your table. The presentation and offering is unlike any other place I've ever dined in. The staff has a wonderful way of placing these dishes so delicately and methodically in front of you. Ever dish is framed in a way that creates an instant interest in it. Although the dishes are plenty and wildly different I did feel I waited an unusual amount of time between my courses. Personally it felt at least 10-15 minutes before each dish was delivered (I had about 8 different dishes). The food was deliciously and savory. The flavors brought together on the plate are so exquisite and perfectly paired. I particularly enjoyed their famous in home squash that has a wonderful natural sweetness to it. Almost every dish was an experience in itself, I thoroughly enjoyed learning their nuances. Overall my dining experience was remarkable for the exception of the me waiting a lot and the feeling of not having enough. I would assume this type of dining is just not fit for someone such as myself that is used to larger plates but  bravo to the wonderful staff who had the dining room ceremonies down to a science. Would I come back? YES, will I ask for an additional plate of bread? I THINK so!",2,2,4
3,Laura D.,"San Francisco, CA",176,268,444,5.0,9/10/2018,"Sooooo delicious. Lucked out and got a last minute reservation at the bar. They are super flexible with the menu so we got one of the seasonal tasting menus and regular tasting menu to share which allowed us to try everything we wanted. The amuse bouche, bread, corn, duck, pork, and dessert were amazing. And a lot of the dishes were vegetarian and really brought out the fresh simple ingredients. Just an overall great experience.",1,,
4,Kovi K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",77,37,134,3.0,7/20/2018,"I really wanted to love Blue Hill @ Washington Place.After watching Dan Barber on Chef's Table (a Netflix documentary about exemplary chefs) and reading the yelp reviews about this restaurant, I was very excited. With ingredients picked from their own garden, each dish was meant to ""wow"" the taste buds. The vegetables were meant to be out of this world.We opted for the farmers feast tasting menu, and started off with a cucumber lightly drizzled in sauce. It was delicious, but it was just a cucumber - it didn't wow me in any way. The remaining courses were very similar: good, but nothing spectacular. The crab & baby corn dish was incredible, yet extremely salty. Some cocktails were great while others (like the bourbon Walnut) tasted like medicine.For it's price range, I expected better from this restaurant. Again, the food was very good, but it was not the Blue Hill experience I had imagined. Maybe the OG Blue Hill at Stone Barns (where the farm is) will be better.However, I will admit, the service was phenomenal.",3,1,2

6,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4581,2942,8899,5.0,8/10/2018,"I often think that Blue Hill at Stone Barns was one of the best meals I've ever had at a restaurant. As such, it's taken me far too long to dine at their far more accessible (in terms of price, availability, and proximity) sister restaurant here in the city.I don't know what I was waiting for.While you don't get to wander the farm beforehand, and the setting is not nearly as bright and beautiful (although this is as nice as a subterranean room can really be), the focus on excellent, seasonal ingredients remains. It may not be the same experiential marvel as Stone Barns, but the food is just as delicious and interesting, the service is just as friendly and knowledgable (you will never feel rushed or uncomfortable), and we left more than satisfied. Most importantly, the paté sandwiched between paper-thin, crispy chocolate is also served here, and was once again a favorite bite of the evening.The menu we had will not be the same as the one you get, but rest assured it will be delicious. In the interest of tasting as many different things as possible (our usual MO, but especially at Blue Hill), I opted for the Farmer's Feast, and my wife got the prix fixe. On paper, that is ten individual courses, but with all the complimentary items they bring, we probably tasted more like twenty. Not a single bad bite amongst them.Maybe it's a question of superior product, but Blue Hill has the uncanny ability to unlock deeper flavor in their ingredients than you usually get. The prosperosa eggplant will taste more like eggplant than any eggplant you've ever had. The badger flame beets capture the intense essence of beet. Things just seem to taste the way they should, and the way you wish they always would.Some plates will be artfully arranged (like the grass-fed beef), but they've also mastered the art of serving produce that looks thrown together and natural, but is extremely well thought out. Our final fruit course was a farmer's market basket with two of everything, so each of us could sample how fantastic blackberries in season can be.And of course, everything is properly cooked. The Stone Barns Pig was perfectly crisp pork belly skin paired with melt in your mouth fat, deeply flavorful loin, and also the impossibly tender leg. The beef was exquisite.If you're not as into dessert, Blue Hill will change your mind. In this absurd heat and humidity, I don't think I've ever had a more perfect plate than the Blue Hill Farm Milk. So simple, clean, and cravable with summer berries, elderflower, and a herby basil sorbet to finish it off. Oh, and I'd make it a point to try their cocktails. Oftentimes they bring the same out-of-the-box-but-always-delicious ethos to bear there. There's a drink on the menu with mozzarella brine and tomatoes, and I love it. ""Picture It, Sicily 1955,"" I believe it's called, and picture it I did.Basically, this restaurant is worth the spend. They do it right, and they make it feel special.",18,3,14
7,Anne R.,"New York, NY",839,445,5141,5.0,3/30/2018,"You order the tasting menu and your first course is one radish.  ONE RADISH.  You look at it and you're thinking, ONE RADISH?!?  What the hell?!?  How does that count as an entire course?!  Then, even though you don't like radishes, you put that radish in your mouth because it's the only thing to eat on your table.Then your brain says... Ooooohhhhhhhhhhh.... it's not just ANY radish, it's the most flavorful bit of purple and white vegetable fiber you've ever put on your tastebuds.  Then you start to wonder how they put that much flavor into one radish, and why other radishes can't taste this amazing.... and suddenly you spent five goddamned minutes thinking about that ONE RADISH.Every course is a bit like that.  Every dish. Every beer. Every wine. It feels absurd, until you put it in your mouth and realize it IS ABSURD, because it's so damn good.I hate you Blue Hill, because it makes me angry how good you made a single radish taste.",23,30,18
8,Yaa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",199,97,232,3.0,9/5/2018,"I was really excited to try this farm to table restaurant after seeing Chef's Table and hearing that the Obamas had gone a while back during their visit to NYC. A friend surprised me and took me for a celebratory dinner. I was underwhelmed to put it mildly. Every course/item from the bread to dessert lacked for something. It seemed to me that the food was prepared with care (and technical skill) but perhaps the love was missing. The other issue was that pork seemed to have been the real highlight of the evening based on other patrons' tables, and I don't eat pork. We did inform the server of this and were assured that we'd still be able to have a beautiful dinner, via the tasting menu. The service was good and the ambiance is nice for a quiet, intimate dinner. However, the food really missed the mark - simply unremarkable.",,,
9,Alan B.,"Buffalo, NY",8,200,0,5.0,7/25/2018,"Absolutely delicious.And fantastically tiny. The entire farmers feast came in at ~550 calories, including dessert. About equal to two slices of pizza.Most of those calories come from a delicious potato-pea-zza. Also incredible were the two tablespoons of roasted farm fresh chicken, the single teaspoon of pate with the bits of roasted chocolate.I loved the goats milk and rhubarb and the largest piece of the entire dinner, a slice of heavenly blueberry pie, unlike any blueberry pie you have ever had before.The service is outstanding. They change plates and silverware for each of the 8 different tastes.3 people. 24 separate place settings, Two drinks. +tip came to $500.",2,1,1
10,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",413,305,542,5.0,2/9/2018,"What a dinner! One of the best I've had in recent memory. My amazing boyfriend surprised me with reservations for Blue Hill on a weekday night. I'd been dying to try this place for years (though he didn't know that), and it lived up to all my expectations, and then some.I had the daily menu, which is a four-course meal (including dessert), while he had the more extensive six-course Farmer's Feast. You definitely won't leave hungry as there are so many little gifts from the kitchen in addition to what's on the menu - 3 amuse bouches, 1 intermezzo, and a post-dessert snack, by my count. I heard that there's an even larger menu that expands on the Farmer's Feast, but we didn't have enough time to try that (it also requires the participation of the whole table).The menu changes quite often, but highlights from our meal included the Jerusalem artichoke lollipops, venison tartare, carrot steak (SO much better than EMP's carrot tartare), sea bass, scallops, and apple mousse cake dessert. The vegetable preparations, even in the dead of winter, were mind-blowing. Their carrots alone were a revelation on how carrots should taste. The bread and butter with toasted grains was almost life-changing. In short, there wasn't a single misstep through the entire meal. If all this sounds slightly insane and like I'm being paid off, I'll just say that I really haven't been this delighted with a single dinner this much since my meal at Atera in the Lightner era.Highly, highly recommend for a special night out.",4,2,3
11,Angela M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",206,215,3805,5.0,6/27/2018,"Ahhhh, Blue Hill. We first dined here back in 2009. It was delicious, memorable, and we still talk about two specific dishes from that dinner almost a decade later! Fast forward to 2018. Upon coming to NYC to visit, we knew we had to come back for another experience. Chef Dan Barber and his team of kitchen craftsmen and women are nothing short of extraordinary, and he definitely deserves all of the praise and respect he has garnered. They own a farm outside of the city which serves as their main source of provisions. We made reservations about 3-4 weeks in advance, and from the start, service was so pleasant and inviting.We arrived about 10 minutes early, but they sat us within seconds. This was definitely appreciated. We decided on cocktails over wine, and each started to read the menu. Mezcal? Peas? This was called Peas, Shoots & Leaves. Maybe the name wasn't so creative, but was this drink HEAVEN in a glass! Peas from their farm, blended well with assorted herbs and an egg white. I couldn't get enough, and even ordered another. My husband enjoyed the Viex Carre. This was not your typical, and was aged in acask for added depth of flavor. It was garnished with an edible flower, which added a floral scent and essence to each sip.We decided to go ALL in. You may choose from a 4 or 6 course tasting, or go all in for the Chef's Farm Feast- which is what we did. This is 8 courses, but with so many additional snacks and bites thrown in between. We had:-Garden Crudités: a selection of raw farm veggies served with whipped lard made from their pigs. Where can I get a pint of this?-Baby Tartlets: with cheese and farm greens -Assorted Cured Farm Meats-Pate: garnished with spicy chocolate crisps-Last of Season Rhubarb Salad: this had crab also and the rhubarb was insanely good-Snap Pea salad with Ash Aged Cheese made at their farm-Soft Shell Crab- with broccolini -Bread made from wheat and grains milled at their farm and butter from their cows -Chicken with smoked cherries and potato -Grass Fed Beef-Farm egg plate- these eggs come from chickens that only eat a specific type of sweet pepper. They said to give the yoke a brighter color and a different flavor!-Farm berries served under Frozen Farm Milk- Pea and White Chocolate Pie: yes. You read that correctly. Bizarre! Creative! Memorable!-Strawberry and Rhubarb cake with spicy chocolate crisps and a candle for our celebration Take me back! Service was outstanding- everything was timed perfectly. I never had to ask for a damn thing, and water was always full. This experience is certainly not cheap, but is with out a doubt, worth every dollar spent!",3,1,5
12,Danielle G.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",219,67,31,4.0,8/9/2018,"My boyfriend and I took my mom here on Tuesday for fun, and it was a lovely experience! We each did the Farmer's Feast, and at first, it felt like the portions were too small, but we left feeling satisfied, not hungry.We had the tomato and melon salad to start, which was light and delicious. Next, we had the potato and farm egg, which was MIND BLOWING. The egg gave the potato a nice creamy flair. Finally, I ordered the pasta dish, as I am a vegetarian, and it was superb.For dessert, my mom and I had the blueberry pie, and they made a special non-dairy treat for my boyfriend, it was a pistachio sorbet and he LOVED it. I would say, the bread and butter is a crowd winner too! The butter was so fresh and creamy. The service was superb and they were very accommodating to dietary needs and allergies. All around winner.  I would only say 4 vs 5 stars because they did mix up the plating at our table, twice, not once, which is a big no-no at a restaurant of this caliber.",,,
13,Janus C.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",705,474,9,4.0,7/2/2018,"Rounded up bc nothing was baaaad. But also, nothing was particularly good. My favorite dish was the farmer egg, but a lot of the dishes we had (tried the pre-fixe with a party of 4) had the same undertones, so it got expected after a while. Service was nice, but once again nothing outstanding. The ingredients were fresh, but I didn't have a single mindblowing dish. Overall a mild meal for an expensive price tag. Also, they only had one option for dessert, which is underwhelming considering we had 4 people eating the same dessert.",2,,2
14,Susan L.,"Tenafly, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,10/26/2018,I was here last night for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.This was my first time and I was only told the best reviews so I was naturally very excited.The meal was fantastic UNTIL I found a small metal staple like piece of metal in my food.I am not someone who likes to make a scene or to be obnoxious but this is something VERY serious that if I had indeed swallowed could've been very sick. I am not a litigious person and I certainly did not want to ruin the dinner for my boyfriend or for the two couples next to us so indiscreetly told our waitress.I don't think anything was deducted for me and anything special aside from a glass of free wine.The meal itself aside from that was great but I'm hesitant to go to the west village location again from this experience.I'm also surprised the manager did not come over to apologize or anything else was done... extremely disappointed about this but again not sure if this has happened often but I certainly did not get a good service in regards to what has happened to me.Extremely upset as I was looking forward to this for months and that this happened to me.I would suggest they train their staff to share something like this to the manager and be a little more courteous and apologetic when something serious like this happens.,3,,
15,Patrick A.,"Arlington Heights, IL",102,13,0,5.0,9/21/2018,"I came here in late August which means I had the last of the summer menu options. I ended up choosing the off-menu tasting menu which includes two more courses along with the Farmers Feast for about $140. Also to clarify, they have three set menus starting with the tasting menu at $95 consisting of four courses. Then the Farmers Feast consists of 6 courses at $105, and the non-listed menu which is the Farmers Feast and 2 more courses selected by the chef at $140. My dad and I selected the special menu, and it was worth every penny.For starters they bring you a few finger food dishes. I thought it was a part of the main dinner, but in a sense it was appetizers that aren't a part of your courses. That said, I am not sure if this offered to every menu, or just the $140 menu. That said, the small plates were amazing, and they bring out a serving for each guess.Moving onto the courses, but they were amazing overall. Since it was in August, then it was mostly summer offerings including a tomato salad, experimental corn, peppers wrapped in thyme and rosemary, duck, blueberry pie, and other seasonal varieties. Therefore if you look at today's menu as I write this in mid-September, then you would see similar dishes as the tomato salad, but the desert includes peaches over blueberries. Overall your experience will vary a lot depending on the season. That said, every dish was amazing. They know how to cook the food properly, and being a farm to table place, then everything tasted fresh. They will also mention in detail at times how the food is cook, or if they experimenting with something new. For example they had a dish called experimental corn. The dish was setup on one side with regular sweet corn, and split down the middle was a sauce. Then on the other side of the dish was experimental corn which one of their farm partners was trying out something new with their crops. Therefore the corn was more bitter with a bite, but amazing. In the process of serving the dish they presented the corn husks to showcase how it looked different, and how it had black kernels. I can go on about the meal, but overall it's easily one of my favorite meals I've ever had. The service was very good. We had an amazing waitress, and the hostess was kind and polite. Furthermore, the place is small, cozy, and intimate. Overall this is an amazing place, and I highly recommend everyone try it out.",1,,

17,Shirley C.,"Santa Clara, CA",253,273,381,5.0,12/3/2017,"Blue Hill just takes simple ingredients to a whole new level of sophicastication and refinement.The radish and asparagus to start were the most amazing radishes and asparagus I've ever had.  I never thought spring rolls can be fancy and tasty. However that was some amazing spring rolls. When I asked about the delicious sauce, the server said there were only 3-4 ingredients. So simple, yet so elegant. The duck was probably the fanciest ingredient for this Michelin rated restaurant. It was so awesome that I dove right into the meal before I could take a picture. It was so tender and just the right amount of sauce that it doesn't overpower the meat. I can still taste it after a few months of eating it. The desserts of blueberry and strawberry were probably less memorable. However they brought out the natural flavors of the fruits. Simple yet sophisticated. Overall, the meal is amazing. They don't have any fancy ingredients and they don't overdo the cooking.  However you'll have a great experience because the ingredients are the freshest you'll ever have. The details to the presentation is so intricate and delicate that just elevates the food.",3,2,4

I also went to Gaggan from Chef's Table and that was on a whole other level, as are other Michelan star places. We had the 6 course tasting menu and it was awesome. They have little mini dishes between the courses too. The 2 strawberry desserts were good, but I wish they switched it up instead of doing 2 similar courses. They brought out an extra dessert for my bf's bday which was a cherry pie slice and we loved it. I don't really have anything ""bad"" to say about this place, as it was fantastic- I was just expecting a little...more. Side note- make a reservation right when you can.

Veggies are the stars here but the beef is cooked perfectly medium rare and melts in your mouth. Dan Barber let's the natural flavors of his locally sourced food speak for themselves.

If you are expecting to have the best food you've ever eaten in your life, this may not be for you.

You will spend a lot of money for the wonderful service, beautiful ambiance and the simple, delicious sophistication of purpose driven food. 4.

Every dish was creative, delicious and beautifully presented. Also had components that were farm to table fresh. While there were many vegetables used in most dishes there was also veal and venison. Only possible negative is that the tables are very close and unless you are a group of four or have a corner table it's very small and tables close. Our server Adrian was the consummate professional. She was knowledgeable, friendly but properly reserved and extremely well trained. It was a great meal made even better with her fine service and recommendationsI must say I realize it takes 30 days in advance to get a table and that is the only drawback but worth the effort to get a reservations",1,,

The bread, the carrot steak, the malted desert, everything was to die for, my palate was left with every fantasy reached and I can't wait to visit their upstate NY location at Stone Barns! One of my favorite NYC dining experiences by far!",2,1,2

This was perfect for an early anniversary dinner!When we arrived, we were greeted with a handwritten anniversary card. Nice touch. Amuse bouche was light, fresh, and appetizing. Our cocktails were delicious. Our food was all delicious. Chef Barber is a master at turning simple fresh ingredients and orchestrating them into an amazing meal. Dessert was out of this world.I have nothing negative to say. We will definitely be returning!",,,
35,Andy Y.,"Boulder, CO",5,36,21,3.0,4/30/2018,"Alright, first off,  We dine ALOT.  While visiting NYNY we had set up 3 dinners in advance.  This one, which we were hoping to be our most special and our last of our visit, was a bit of a let down.  We paired the 'Farmers feast' with a wine pairing.  Our waiter was nice and shared his knowledge about the wine being paired.  The plates were beautiful and simple and a little to precious.  Although delicious!The menu stated we were going to have pork and instead we received beef.  No one informed us of the substitution.  It was really fun trying to cut it with a butter knife!  Unusual, unique and fortunate enough to have had this experience.",1,,

We got the farmers feast with the add on, and they gave us a tour of the kitchen. There were quite a few off menu items served between the courses. Innovative cocktails on the menu as well. Staff/service was best of any place I've been to in New York. Will go back.",,,
37,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",265,538,119,5.0,1/29/2017,"Incredible experience!My boyfriend wanted to come here after watching a Netflix documentary on this place, so I took him out here for his birthday! We opted for the extended tasting menu, which includes 2 additional entrees from the regular one - it was a great decision because it was JUST the right amount of food to keep us content for the rest of the night. And let me tell you, everything we tried was just terrific. From the pork liver pâté and dark chocolate, to the ""wasted"" burger (made from usually discarded items), the food we tried was unconventional and combined flavors that you would never think to combine. Blue Hill was also an incredible experience in the way that they even create some of their own food; some things to note were their genetically modified mini butternut squash (to die for), and Chef Barber even had his own brand of wheat because he made with his own formula! All in all, it was a wonderful experience, and well worth the wait.I also appreciated that our server came by with a little cake and a candle on top for my boyfriend - it was low-key, but sweet, just the way we like it! On that note, all the servers were very knowledgeable about every item we were presented with, and very accommodating. Our particular server was top notch - A+!Also want to note: I made a 5pm reservation and told the staff that we needed to be out by 7:30 as we had a show to catch - really appreciated that they paced our meal so perfectly because we were out the door right on time!",11,,1
38,Jane S.,"Denver, CO",266,197,36,5.0,10/19/2017,"It's hard to even describe the true experience but I will attempt it. First of all, I must've written down the wrong time for our reservations so we arrived an hour late and they graciously accommodated us anyway right away. It was a packed house to begin with! The service from beginning to end was how you would imagine a 5 star restaurant to be, superb! One of our party has Celiac's and they accommodated perfectly. She loved her dishes and there was no cross contamination. Every dish was flavorful but not overpowering. My fave was the asparagus dish that they brought out before cooked and after cooked. It was like art! Can't wait to try out their farm!",,1,1
39,Susan K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,44,7,5.0,4/22/2018,"What a night!   From start to finish (almost four hours of gorgeous food and wine) each dish celebrated the gifts of the garden and farm.  It started with the chocolate pate - yes, that's right liver and chocolate - who knew they were soulmates!  Even the pedestrian was sublime - bread and butter - chewy with gluten and layered with salty creamy goodness. Carrots, leeks, mushrooms and more! Venison, pork and fish all sublime!   Blue Hill is that special occasion place that you'll talk about for years.",,,
40,Melody C.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,325,42,5.0,8/28/2017,"I've heard about Blue Hill here and there for years. It would come up when so and so went there on a date, or when discussing farm to table, etc. It had been cemented in my mind as a fancy place to get amazing food for a special occasion.That's pretty heavy hype. More often than not, places can't live up to that hype. But Blue Hill definitely lives up to it and then some.We finally had a reason to go and it was just really lovely in there. Granted, our reservation was a bit early, but we still had a good amount of people in there. But they're really considerate with reservation and seating, so it didn't feel like we were on top of each other. I noticed some tables had a nice note from them, either wishing someone a happy birthday or happy anniversary, and it was just really sweet.Our waitress was lovely. She gave us enough space, but it never felt like we were forgotten. I love how the menu is laid out, just the right amount of choices I thought.And the food, the food. Even though I've now forgotten the specifics of what I ate, I do remember they were beautifully plated. More than that, though, they had such unique ways of mixing flavors and textures that was such a joy to experience. It was as if I was invited to experience the world through an artist's mind and palate.",1,,2
41,Wan Yee R.,"Ridgefield, WA",5,75,57,3.0,3/9/2018,"I had huge expectations for this place since I saw the Netflix documentary. Service was exceptional: respectful but not snooty. Decor was tasteful. Food presentation was artistic and creative. I enjoyed the duck potato, butter that came with the bread and the baby carrots with the white sauce. I thought the main courses were overpoweringly salty. It is almost like someone accidentally poured soy sauce onto the mackerel and lamb neck and belly. The dessert porridge tasted like ice cream dumped onto a pile of rice krispy cereal. It was a fitting disappointing finish to a meal that I had waited over a month for. I am very glad we didn't pick the more expensive menu.",1,,
42,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3651,952,2091,4.0,2/23/2017,Came here for valentines day and had the prixe fix menu. I thought it was a little pricey at $275 a person without drinks but it was valentines day so a perfect day for restaurants to upcharge the customer.That being said the meal was a one of a kind experience.The first course was of garden vegetables with different sauces that they served on the table. It was served on a plastic table cover on the table so once you got over the fact you were eating off the table it was good. The tuna burrito course was also very unique and delicious.The highlight of the meal was the avocado and lime sorbet course. You would never think avocado and sorbet would go together but it worked perfectly. Beautiful dish. The steak course was also awesome. Steak was some of the best I have had in terms of tenderness. I wish I had more!The desserts were also very good with my personal favorite being the cherry chocolate lollipop. The reason I gave 4 stars was I think the atmosphere was not 5 star. They were playing music that did not fit the environment and the door kept opening so we kept getting a draft.Overall cool place but i dont know if we would be back unless it was a special occasion.,1,1,
43,Aleja V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",19,8,11,5.0,8/23/2018,Really good meal. A new perspective of eating vegetables and finding their truly taste. Every dish with good presentation and unique flavor. I loved this place!,,,
44,S S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,5,1.0,7/21/2018,Truly one of the worst meals of my life. The highlight was seeing one of my all time favorite actors Ben Stiller dining in the restaurant. I brought my boyfriend here for a special occasion (his birthday). We are both vegetarian and did the the vegetarian tasting. One course was potatoes with a fried egg. I've had better diner eggs and potatoes. You would expect a farm to table restaurant to have excellent fresh ingredients that are innovative and that simply was not the case for any of the courses. I had such high expectations for this place and it was a complete let down. $500 wasted on what was supposed to be a very special meal. As I can't speak for the meat options I will say only this - if you are looking for a vegetarian tasting look elsewhere!,,1,
45,Grace D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,51,15,2.0,9/21/2018,"Excellent service and wine but the food was just...fine. Nothing was bad and nothing blew my mind or was truly special. And for $300 for 2 people, I'm disappointed. Can't believe I just spent that much",1,,
46,Naomi O.,"Bryan, TX",16,2,0,2.0,8/17/2018,"I went with my mom with high expectations after seeing good reviews. We thought there are plenty of better restaurants in other places. Nothing was special and portions were small with this price range.  Many dishes were salty and sour with strong use of vinegar (even the fruits at the end was sour). I get the concept, but even so, there should be a better way to cook or present. The only thing I liked was the restroom (JK or maybe not...).",,,
47,Christine P.,"Huntington, NY",12,81,147,5.0,12/5/2016,"This was pretty much one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the minute we walked in, the service, the ambience, the lighting and the music--all of it was incredible. We opted for the pricier of the two tasting menus (farmers, I think it's called?) we were started off with an amuse bouche-- a sort of pate that had chocolate flakes on it and he flavor was indescribable. After that I got a tomato and watermelon salad that was both fresh and juicy with the right balance of sweetness and acidity. There was a dish made with multiple different types of corn, including ancient corn, and the waitress came to the table to explain the different types of corn. Even though I don't eat too much meat, I opted to enjoy  the tasting menu as it came. The restaurant does however, cater to dietary restrictions. The drinks were absolutely perfect and although I wasn't a huge fan of the blueberry cake, the fruit plate that was served with their farms local honey was the cherry on top (literally haha) Whether you are trying to enjoy a meal with family, if you are on business or for a special occasion I cannot recommend this place anymore whole heartedly. Absolutely incredible.",4,,1
48,Marjorie Y.,"Granite Springs, NY",0,5,0,3.0,10/15/2018,"Underwhelmed, the room is small with low ceilings and they were serving steamed vegetables in Sage and several other herbs which came out smoking to all the tables causing the room to fill with smoke, for the next 2 hours my eyes were burning and my nose was running.

49,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",237,79,37,5.0,2/17/2018,"My boyfriend and I had the best dining experience at Blue Hill on Saturday night. We chose to have the Extended Farmer's Feast menu (8 courses including 2 surprises) as well as the wine pairing (I chose non-traditional and he chose traditional). We were also able to get a kitchen tour which was an awesome addition as well. Everyone who works at Blue Hill is so friendly, polite, and knowledgeable about the menu and it's accompaniments. We were so happy with all the courses we received (favorites included the pheasant, veal brisket ""Reuben"" sandwich, and the scallops and bacon ""taco""). We can't wait to go back!!!",,,
50,Kevin W.,"Irving, TX",38,11,0,4.0,12/20/2017,"Blue Hill was quite good, just not 5 stars good.  All of the food was good and fresh, but it felt like the goal was to showcase the natural raw flavor of the food rather than enhance the flavor of the food.  I can go to the farmer's market and get a really good raw carrot (which was one of the dishes we were served at Blue Hill), but I pay a lot of money at a really nice restaurant to get a carrot that is cooked to make it better than raw.  A couple of the dishes were more interesting and better prepared, but it felt uneven throughout the seven course meal.Service was good, but the meal took longer than expected - almost 3.5 hours.  Fortunately we had good company to make the 3.5 hours go by quickly, but the meal should have been outstanding to justify that kind of time commitment.",1,1,1

52,Michelle L.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",1,6,6,3.0,5/14/2018,"Frankly, I'm disappointed. Three fourths of my tasting menu was infused with bacon/bacon fat, and I personally think that's a cheap move. Clearly, every carnivore loves bacon, but if you make it the underlying theme of every dish, it's the equivalent of using the deep-fry method. The balance of savory-to-sweet was off. I was left craving an actual entree instead of the last flavor that left my palate. Not to mention the weak pours for a $22 glass of champagne.",4,,
53,Rachel Z.,"Chicago, IL",12,36,16,4.0,9/9/2017,"""I'm going to get some halal food after this."" Spoken by my friend's husband after we were served a dish consisting of 4 pieces of okra....1 piece for each person at the table. That was the general theme of our experience at Blue Hill. Not to say that the food wasn't delicious, but had we not had a very late brunch on the day of our Blue Hill experience, we would have all likely fought over each course like a pack of hangry vultures. Even with my stomach half-full I found myself feeling disappointed at every turn. Each dish was so amazing but I was unsatisfied. We had about 6 ""courses"" and a few littler snacks in between. My friend found Blue Hill as everyone else seems to-- on season 1 episode 2 (or 3?) of Chef's Table on Netflix, where we learn about the chef's farm to table philosophy. I can appreciate that. I can also appreciate restaurants where a ""farm to table"" experience doesn't cost $108 for a total of 25 bites of food. Maybe it's just my voracious appetite, but we all had the same general feeling. I am glad we went once, but it's not one of those places you are going to return to.",9,3,2

We will definitely be returning!,,,
56,Caitlyn B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",101,136,31,5.0,6/2/2017,"We visited Blue Hill in Greenwich Village for my birthday dinner. This was the only way I could get my very picky husband to agree to go because of the set daily/farmers menus. My husband does not eat anything aside from red meat and potatoes (spoiler alert: he loved Blue Hill).I was so surprised to see a wine from Liguria, Italy on the wine list. My husband proposed to me there so that was a fun way to start the evening. The sommelier came over and talked to us a little bit about the winemaker from that winery, too, which made it a very special glass of wine.Our meal was a symphony, small dishes and fast at first and slower as we went. We wouldn't even notice sometimes when a server would put down or take something from our table. The dishes were beautiful and Dan Barber and his team of chefs really allow the vegetables to shine.My husband (who only likes red meat and potatoes) LOVED the vegetables. He could not stop talking about them. He ordered the delicious farm pig as his entree but his favorite part was the vegetables! I have never, ever, ever heard him say he liked a vegetable in his entire life and here we were with him saying that they were his favorite part. The vegetables were so beautifully prepared and slightly seasoned to bring out their flavors. I have never had such delicious asparagus and lettuce. I don't normally like radishes but the radishes at Blue Hill were phenomenal.We also ordered seconds of the bread. The bread tasted like bread! You unfortunately don't have that experience much anymore. The flavors and texture were delicious. The butter was light but creamy with seeds and grain on top to add more texture.Dessert was so fun. It was a strawberry mint creamy concoction that slapped you in the face with mint at first. Then it was beautifully balanced and the crunch (I forget what was crunchy... oats at the bottom I think?) was so satisfying.I wish I could give Blue Hill 10 stars. We can't afford to go back in the next decade but I'm so glad we have our experience there to look back on. It is a meal we will never forget.",,1,1

I can't add anything of value regarding the stellar food reviews already here but I'll touch on another factor.My 11 year old daughter has gravitated toward cooking and the Blue Hill episode of Chef's Table resonated so we made the arrangements. The staff from entrance to exit could not have been more gracious and they treated her like an adult in a very positive way. Can't say enough about everyone we encountered on the BH team. Well done and thank you.,3,,
58,Oscar V.,"Queens, NY",57,22,9,5.0,7/10/2017,"Completely superb.My boyfriend and I walked into the dim, and quaint restaurant and fell in love with the romantic atmosphere. We had the choice of the daily menu (4 Courses) or the farmers feast (6 courses). We both went with the Daily Menu. A pleasant surprise was that we were given additional small dishes in between courses. Our very wonderful waitress and the staff in general were very informative, kind, knowledgeable, and attentive.Each dish was as amazing as the last. The sauces were so flavorful and creative! But the real stars of the show are the fresh, impeccably grown vegetables and meats used in each dish. A true Farm to Table experience. After a $300 dollar bill (Worth every bit), my boyfriend and I decided that we will be going back for the Farmers Feast!Thanks, Blue Hill!",,,
59,Ali G.,"Manhattan, NY",261,22,5,4.0,10/7/2017,"My wife and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary here last month - and overall, it was a lovely experience. The ambiance is intimate and cozy, our server was nice and attentive, and we were also brought back to tour the kitchen, which was a nice touch. We opted for the Farmer's Feast and were impressed with most of the dishes, but especially the sunflower marrow and lobster and corn soup. However, despite the season, we were stunned by the amount of tomatoes served with every dish. I don't mind tomatoes, but at 9 months pregnant, due to the acidity, by the time the 9th course came out described as: blueberry pie with a cherry on top, I was ecstatic for the switch-up in fruit options. So you can imagine my surprise when I bit into the cherry to find out it was not actually a cherry, but a cherry tomato. More tomato. My wife and I were holding back laughter and then all of a sudden the woman who had just been seated at the table next to ours responded to the server's question of: 'do you have any dietary restrictions?' with: 'Yes, I don't like tomatoes' and we both started cracking up. It was like something out of a Seinfeld episode.  So, though expectations were high and we were a bit underwhelmed, this is a nice place to go for a celebratory dinner, fun to try new foods and hear the stories  and origins of where each recipe came from - but if you're going to go in the late summer, you must emphatically love tomatoes.",,3,
60,Muhan Z.,"New York, NY",1,25,4,3.0,8/20/2017,"A bit overrated, watching the chef table episode on blue hill is way better than eating here. Food didn't meet expectations, mediocre. If you really want to try the real nature flavor of food, go to farmer's market or even whole food for ingredients. I felt glad didn't pair wines as the food is so so so. Decor  is just fine, basement feeling with only one window, crowded space btw tables.Imho farm to table should be great for daily eating style, but never be an occasional pricy eat out experience. Good quality ingredients do not need fancy cooking skills, and we home chefs are definitely capable of doing that.I won't go twice or recommend to friends...",3,,
61,Bruce F.,"Denver, CO",33,248,17,5.0,4/30/2018,An incredible experience. I thoroughly enjoyed our food journey this evening. We did a tasting menu with a wine pairing. As expected every plate was a piece of art and the best of the best. Before the menu items started we enjoyed an assortment of amuse bouche. We had a simple radish with some tarragon. An unimaginable pig liver mousse between two thin slices of chocolate that was strangely delicious. Bread is out of this world. The vegetables were the stars throughout the evening. One course was an incredible carrot schnitzel with sauerkraut and potatoes. The extra creative sweet potato with sorbet is something I've never had before and probably never again but it was exciting and totally worked. I feel very thankful to have had the experience of eating at Blue Hill.,,,

I didn't know what I should expect from it until we finished the almost 3 hours meal. It's not that kind of food that you will want it so badly when you are hungry next week, which usually Xi'an famous food or your mum's signature cook will do that job. It's a food experience, includes flavor, visual, concept, service, ambiance and you.I have a Asian stomach, western food usually does not do much to me. But blue hill did a pretty good job to make me happy. However, I don't say the food is so amazing, I think it's fair to say the experience in blue hill is very good.

Updated review","So I've been in this foodie binge and Netflix's Chef's Table only feeds into it. 9ver the last year, we've been on a foodie journey from Copenhagen to Amsterdam to Vienna. We've been to a couple Michelin rated restaurants in NYC but this place is definitely the best in NYC this far. As a vegetarian, each meal I had in the menu was hearty, and so! flavorful! I had the sweet potato with roasted sesame and this was AMAZING! Afterward, the Farm Egg with mushroom was the ultimate umami of brunch. The service was at par at what I would expect from a Michelin restaurant, and given the small size of restaurant, I get that personalized feeling of attention that I expect. All in all, this place lives up to the hype, and I would certainly shell out to come here again!",,,
64,Allie M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,51,2,3.0,7/15/2018,"As someone from California (and use to this type of farm to table concept) I wasn't that impressed with the actual presented dishes themselves...The few mini bites (Amuse-bouche, or palette cleansers) whatever u want to call them, I think pull people into liking this restaurant more than they should. Those plates were decent enough and unexpected (which subconsciously-makes people think they are extra special) but 3 of them were before any actual course off the menu. So the order of the plates didn't really make any sense....So anyways, on to the actual menu...they ran out of ingredients printed on that nights menu, and had to sub almost every vegetable out with peas. Peas are really not expensive from any angle on the restaurants side, so to not adjust the cost of the menu to reflect this is really insensitive to the customer. I mean a pea cheesecake, come on, I love pretty much any flavor combination, but this restaurants way of  covering up its supply and demand mistakes was just a little bit too hard to get over.  So in a quick summary of I think a 7 course menu(I got the bigger farmer menu option, or whatever it's called) I had 2 thin slices of duck, and the rest was all very small bites of peas and cheese or oil based sauces with small morsels of another vegetable. So for the price...$110 I believe,I got 2 thin slices of meat and a lot of overpriced vegetables. I had a good time there because of the company I was with, and wanting to try this restaurant out. (Oh and they pump feel good candle scents and music into your ears and nose on your inevitable bathroom break, putting u in a better mood ) so I enjoyed my visit there enough, but from a ""foodie"" perspective , I was pretty disappointed and felt pretty ripped off. :( The atmosphere however was great. (Better than it would be in SF, for a similar type restaurant). Lastly, The wine list was really bad. But in California we are a bit spoiled in that department so it's not fair to say how it might compare to other restaurants in the 4$ range in that area, but I think the answer would be lagging!!",1,,

Each dish looks so simple and minimal that you start to wonder what you got yourself into. But it is the art of minimalism and the focus of what each should be is what brings the normal into the special. Even the bread and custom butter was something to remember.Due to their ""no cell phone policy"" I forced myself not to take pictures of all my dishes (but they couldn't see me in the bathroom muhahaha!).Also the radish was delicious.",4,38,2
66,Melody T.,"San Francisco, CA",186,791,136,4.0,2/25/2016,"We went with the 6-course Farmer's Feast tasting menu for $98 and did not regret it. Overall I felt it was good value and you could appreciate the farm to table aspect + artistry of the food in a comfortable, yet intimate environment.  If you haven't seen the episode on Netflix's Chef's Table - watch it then make a reservation!The standouts from 2/25/15 tasting menu were the roasted oysters w/carrots, paprika and trout roe... the flavors paired so well together and it was my first time having roasted oysters! Yum! The three year old grass fed beef was also very tender and had a subtle flavor unique to how they raise their cattle - they say their cows are happy! :) Lastly, sprouted and malted triticale for dessert was delicious!  I don't know if I've ever had triticale (hybrid of wheat and rye) but I loved the concept of having a grain for dessert..loved the texture with a little bit of sweetness with the ice cream.We came to New York prepared for the cold, but sans ""dressy attire"". I ended up having to shamefully walk into the restaurant in Nike sneakers (or it would have been Uggs) and I didn't feel them shaming me - if anything it might have been the older patrons dining with them who looked surprised. My bad!It's also one of the few restaurants I've been to where on the menu they ask you ""please do not use your cell phone in the dining room"" which I think is fair - come for the experience - it also helps set a tone in the restaurant.  I still quickly took photos but clearly did not text/check email/gab on the phone.Our server Kayla was fantastic - friendly, professional and service was spot on.",3,,
67,Cat N.,"Philadelphia, PA",42,152,0,5.0,12/28/2016,"One of the top 3 meals of my life (so far!). We were excited to try Blue Hill after having learned a bit about Dan Barber's philosophy and history, and it did not disappoint a bit. The service, decor, attention to detail, plating (plates are made FOR Blue Hill) - all were perfect! And overshadowed only (perhaps) by the food. We grabbed early (5:30!) reservations on a Thursday holiday night, and spent a lovely 2.5+ hrs eating, drinking, talking, and enjoying the atmosphere. We never felt rushed, courses were spaced well, and we left full but not overstuffed. My partner ordered the Daily Menu (4 courses, with some options), primarily because he wanted the venison. I ordered the Farmer's Feast (6 courses, all pre-determined). The chef split one of my courses so we could share it, and gave my partner both desserts, so we ended up both having 6 courses. Dinner started with 2 (!) amuse bouches - one plate of baby root vegetables from the Farm with a tarragon sauce, the second a brussel sprout tart. Both were perfect, fresh, and amazing harbingers of the things to come. I will try to remain brief here, but just GO. Seriously. I loved the scallop dish, it was incredible. Potatoes (with uni and roe) were also great. The squash course was fun - bread & butter (OHMYGOD, so good!), along with little dishes of sauces, homemade ricotta, roasted squash. Just spectacular. My partner got the ""Merry Christmas"", which was adorable - romanesco (which looked like a little christmas tree!) and wrapped presents, little cubes of cheese wrapped in edible gold leaf. Both of our mains were also perfectly cooked - his venison was great, and I loved the capon. Desserts were light and a nice way to end. Our server was intelligent, attentive without hovering, and knowledgeable. He helped us pick out a great bottle of wine to accompany the meal. Blue Hill exceeded both of our (very high!) expectations and was worth every penny. Now, we have to get to the Farm!",3,,1
68,Aj L.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,0,5.0,5/19/2018,"Wow, just wow. Went here for a graduation dinner and the staff were all amazingly friendly, congratulating me and my family and even wrote a little card. Of course, that was just he beginning to a fantastic night at Blue Hill. The food was impeccable, flavors and ingredients I would never have dreamt of meshing together so well made every dish better than the last. Well worth the trip and the money for the best meal I've had in NYC by a long shot.",,,
69,Bailey H.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,2,1,5.0,7/18/2017,"Blue Hill summed up in a phrase ""Is it socially acceptable to lick the plate?"" The food was incredible, seasoning was on point, flavor and textures were balanced, and techniques left us inquisitive with the bartender. Also, if you are going with a party of 3 or less, do yourself a favor and sit at the bar. Especially if you're met by Oliver's warm welcome. Best service ever. Oliver was knowledgeable, entertaining, interactive, makes a damn good martini, and can exceed your wildest drink pairing wishes. By the end of our dinner all 8 bar seats were filled with strangers chatting and having a good time together. A rare find and amazing experience.",1,2,1
70,Alison O.,"The Waterfront, Jersey City, NJ",51,6,0,4.0,4/15/2018,"My husband and I went here a few weeks ago after being wowed watching Chef's Table. The service was impeccable- from the minute you walk in until the minute you leave, you feel well taken care of. The music was pretty on point too. Off to a good start!Definitely a date night out as I didn't care what the wine or drinks cost, and they were good. Food was delish overall, we enjoyed the bread (which I know they take care to make) and majority of courses. I didn't care for the dessert as it seemed to be an excuse to use a foam, but overall I was happy with the food. I gave it four out of five because it was really great, but I reserve five stars for the places I continue to think about days later.Definitely worth a try if you would like a nice, decadent night out at a place where you know they care about where the food is sourced from.",,,
71,Charlie S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,10,28,1.0,6/9/2018,"Been meaning to write this review just forgot about it. Far and away one of the worst meals I've had for their price point. Small plates that lacked flavor. Don't put a big stone slab on my table with 4 rinky dink carrots on it and call it an appetizer. I had more food stuck between my teeth. When the main course came out I looked for Ashton Kutcher because clearly I was on Punk'd or some other candid camera show. Some carrot steak dish that I destroyed in 3 bites. No joke. I went over to Trattoria Spaghetto on Carmine immediately following this meal and had a full helping of chicken parm and spaghetti. Finally my quest to have a full stomach was complete. There is a no phone/picture policy in this restaurant which is ridiculous because the doo-doo food isn't worth a spot on my camera roll and it makes you seem like a giant douche canoe for enacting such a pompous rule. There is no restaurant too good for a picture if the customer feels like it. Without us your restaurant doesn't survive. We're paying you money for food, we don't need to ask your permission to capture a photo of the food, ambience, whatever. Everyone at my table of 6 was incredibly disappointed. To every Yelper writing a positive review about this place I honestly feel you're taking crazy pills. How on God's great green goodness did you find this meal enjoyable? Sorry for the rant but you can't charge buku bucks for food that comes in such small quantities and doesn't taste that good.",1,4,
72,Brandi M.,"Pearland, TX",25,18,6,5.0,4/29/2018,"Blue Hill was everything I hoped it would be. Quaint refreshing ambiance, friendly knowledgable staff, and delicious interesting food. We were blown away by the combinations that worked so perfectly together. We asked our waiter several questions about the food ingredients and where each was from and he was able to give us a detailed explanation. The food is definitely worth the price. We will be going again next time we're in NYC.",,,
73,Anjalie F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9,48,79,5.0,8/14/2017,"Had dinner here last night to celebrate an anniversary and had a great time! We went with the Farmer's Feast, and the chef easily customized each person's meal to fit our various dietary restrictions (i.e. allergies, vegetarians). The food was outstanding, I especially loved the puffed farro in the dessert. The restaurant also accommodated several special requests, and the service was excellent - we ended up hanging around long after we paid the check and didn't feel rushed at all",,,
74,Tuwie N.,"New York, NY",238,524,94,5.0,7/10/2017,"I couldn't have dreamed up a basement restaurant with only one window to be as charming as Blue Hill was. The food was top notch, I really cannot believe the quality and creativity that was consistently surprising us behind those curtains that lead into the kitchen. The service was so friendly, awesome, and totally not pretentious. It's really just a chill and casual dinner that's just solid and isn't expensive just for the sake of being exclusive or fancy. I totally appreciate the farm-to-table philosophy that was embodied to the T here.The vegetable appetizers taste like they were watered with precious tears of mythical creatures, when in reality it's just that you can taste the care and passion it requires to run a farm to table establishment to this caliber. I am not going to go through every single course because you will likely be served a different, seasonal menu, but just trust that you are in good hands on any day/season that you wish to dine. In fact, I would love to come back during all different seasons. $100 per person (without wine pairing) is so worth it for what you're getting here. For $40 more, you can have two more courses. We left full, but not bursting-at-the-seams Thanksgiving-dinner level of full, which is ideal. They gave my boyfriend an extra dessert for his birthday, and a handwritten postcard, which was a nice personal touch.",1,,
75,Stevie H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,11,0,5.0,8/2/2018,"Absolutely wonderful, the service to start was the right mix of polite yet friendly with none of the pretension you sometimes find at restaurants of this caliber.  The food was not only delicate, delicious, and yet filling. Unfortunate, at the end of the meal I had an epiphany (for my wallet)  that I could eat here every day an not worry about any unhealthy eating habits.  My companion and I enjoyed the whole tasting and as we walked out realize that we had one of the most delightful meals yet felt as though we ate healthy-- well except for this chocolate liver amuse bouche that I would gladly eat 50 of without any shame.",,,
76,Toisha T.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,80,7,5.0,2/19/2018,"One of the best places we have dined in NYC. We were celebrating our anniverary (and we were not the only ones). Everyone was genuinely friendly and the food and drinks were fantastic and inventive. Portions were also just the right amount to feel satisfied. We did one Farmers Feast and one daily menu. I'll be the first to admit to not being a huge fan of veggies, but I left this meal willing to rethink that.",,,
77,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,441,116,5.0,8/15/2016,"Have you ever gone to bed after a meal and literally dreamt about the entire food and experience for the whole night?  No?  Well - I have.  This seriously happened to me after dining at Blue Hill.  I'm not kidding.  It was one of the most amazing culinary experiences I have had.  To date, there is no other restaurant, food, or service that I find to be even somewhat comparable.I probably cannot add much more to what has already been said.  But I'll provide a few bits of info that were specific to me.The service was amazing from beginning to end.  I dined alone and opted to eat at a table, instead of at the bar.  I chose the daily menu.  I discussed my preferences with the server, along with some dietary restrictions that were making it difficult for me to choose one option from each course.  She said that she would speak with the chef about other options we could do.  I was hesitant because I did not want to modify the beauty and flavors already created by the chef for each serving.  But the server assured me that they want me to have a great experience and that they are very happy to accommodate almost any dietary restriction or request.The chef then suggested two items from the first course (in lieu of one from the second course as I could not eat anything from the second course).  The chef also swapped out some of the items I could not eat with items that I could.  I cannot possibly explain the food nirvana as I bit in each and every piece of the meal.  I felt like I was in a culinary utopia, with the most creative, fresh, and delicious vegetables and food ever.They also created a dessert for me which was gluten free, as the standard dessert had gluten.  My dessert was teeny, tiny cubes of cantaloupe on a bed of Stone Barns honey and with some ginger.  They also brought out halves of various seasonal plums on the same honey.  I really cannot adequately describe how beautiful it is to taste fresh fruits and vegetables that are prepared in a loving way to bring out the best in each.In addition to the food, the patrons are truly very cool.  I was lucky enough to have a couple sit to my left that have been coming to the restaurant every single week since it opened in 2000!  That is dedication - and after having my first experience at Blue Hill, I can only say I envy them for being able to do so financially.  They were both lovely and I enjoyed hearing their experiences as being long-time diners.  On my right, a beautiful mother and son arrived during my dessert course and we started chatting almost immediately.  The clientele probably clearly reflects Dan Barber's philosophy of farm-to-table, as the diners all seemed to have their feet planted firmly in the ground, but aware of all the beauty going on around them and sharing it with those nearby.I will try to make this a regular spot for me as they change their menu regularly with the season.",26,14,25
78,Rachel M.,"New York, NY",9,11,5,5.0,2/12/2018,Blue Hill is one of a kind. The service is incredible - it's like a show and tell for all of the courses. They show us where the food is made for each of the courses. It was a special evening with some of the best food I've ever had!,,,
79,Aaron R.,"Seattle, WA",140,150,138,5.0,11/17/2015,"I saw this restaurant featured on a Netflix show called Chefs Table and was very intrigued by their philosophy.  In truth, the philosophy isn't that unique.   Many strive for farm to table, organic, etc.   However they take it to another level because they own and run a farm in NY that provides most of the food they serve, including meat.   The result of their careful food production is FLAVOUR!   They tend to not over engineer their dishes, instead allow the ingredients to speak for themselves.  An example is the tomato salad, very simple but outrageously delicious.  The setting is typically understated and refunded (like many Michelin star restaurants).   Service is excellent and friendly.  Highly recommended!",1,1,1

He looked to be enjoying every single one, and the variety and unusual bottles seemed, well, unusual!

Crazy $$$$$$But here is the worst of it: Unless u are a celebrity who does not want to be seen or having an illicit affair and want total anonymity i just don't get this place. You need a flashlight (they give you when you ask) to see the menu. And it is so dark you cannot see the several course meal you are eating without a mining helmut (not supplied).We were seated an hour late but good things are worth waiting for...good things not food you can't see. They tell you what you're eating when they bring each course and whisper it loud enough just to be annoying. I knew when a course was over when i head a clank on the bowl or plate signaling there was no more. Dinner for 4 with some libations was $650. Maybe not a fortune for some but PLEASE if I'm going to pay that amount I really need TO F'N SEE MY FOOD. If you want to feel like you are in a blackout, be my guest.",1,1,

We were celebrating news I received during the day and I was able to book a table on the same night, 10:30pm.The first thing you notice is the service: really nice people that make you feel at home. Also knowledgeable, quick and detail-oriented. I have a dietary restriction that was taken very seriously by the staff. The pastry chef put a lot of work to accomodate my restriction and the result couldn't be more special.The food overall is incredible. All courses were prepared with so much work, precision and creativity, but also tasted superb. We had the ""Feast"" and two courses were really remarkable: the duck and the strawberry dessert.

Updated review","A few days after our last review, we received a nice phone call from the restaurant's general manager, offering their sincerest apologies and an invitation to return. Now here's where their commitment to diners really pulled through:It's been close to 10 months since we got that phone call, and we haven't been able to squeeze the time in between our short trips to the city to come for dinner, until just two nights ago. We called earlier in the week to make the reservation, and they remembered who we were and honored the invitation.The entire dinner was GREAT. Our waitress was amazing. She was knowledgeable and so passionate about the farm. She explained our courses in great detail and was really excited to share some of her experiences from spending time at the farm, and how closely she got to know the animals that were served. Truly an appreciation to every single ingredient!We did a flight of mocktails and the bartender even created a custom mocktail that my husband loved. Neither of us are drinkers, so it was nice to be able to enjoy a huge variety of mocktails.We also learned that Blue Hill works with other local farms to provide other ingredients that their farm otherwise doesn't provide, as well as a local pottery artist who made some of the gorgeous plates used during the service.The night was a complete 180 from our first visit. All the other staff were very helpful and welcoming, and made us feel so cozy while we enjoyed all the great food. We're definitely placing this spot on our must stop-by spot next time we're in town.We love that the menu constantly changes with the season and farm harvest availability, and there's always something new and surprising!",4,,1
87,Jim M.,"Houston, TX",2,328,4,5.0,11/9/2016,"What a charming place! They actually remembered details of a conversation with my wife from a month ago when she was making the reservation and made reference to them during our meal. They knew we'd just crossed the Atlantic on a cruise from Barcelona, they knew it was our anniversary along the way. Delightful. The room is gorgeous and handles a full crowd of noise very well. The music began with quiet jazz and built to a natural crescendo of electronic fun over the course of the meal. The staff were attentive without being smothering. They knew everything you could want to know about the food and the drinks without being patronizing about what _we_ may or may not know about them. The food was pure joy. The wine and beverage pairings eye opening. If I had to make a critique, I'd ask for a dress code if only because it would mean that the table with the three terminally bored children behind us wouldn't have come, because daddy doesn't know better than to wear a hoodie to a two star restaurant.",1,,
88,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,7/7/2015,"This award winning restaurant has truly differentiated  itself by connecting farmland with daily cuisine, in a way that is both simple and divine.Chef Dan Barber was confident enough to bring vegetables like radish directly onto table to elaborate a feeling of freshness. However, the best part was always lying in the dairy and meat section. Farm milk yogurt was by far the most remarkable experience I have ever had; and the free range chicken meat was soft enough to melt down in my mouth. If I were to make one piece of commentary towards the farmer's feast menu, it will be to make it extensive at the least!Well worth the Michelin star, and thanks for the exotic experience.",5,2,3

93,Kate N.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",85,246,662,5.0,7/14/2016,"This was my second best restaurant experience. My first best one is Blue Hill at Stone Barn :) If you do not know about this restaurant or its chef Dan Barber, you must watch a Chef's Table episode about him on Netflix ASAP. He is my hero :)The restaurant is located on a quiet street and looks unpresumptuous from outside. Even the interior looks very modest but very warm and elegant. We got a cute corner table. Our main waitress was fantastic. She was so knowledgeable, clever and personable. The rest of the crew were sharp, cute and nerdy :)We both did the Farmers Feasts and wine pairing. My bf got an extended version of the Feast, 3 additional courses. The food was phenomenal, full of passion and creativity. It was delivered to us and described in the most beautiful manner. My gluten free preference was respectfully honored. We also made friends with a cute couple at the next table. They shared our passion for beautiful mindfully prepared clean delicious food. It was truly a beautiful evening! Thank you Blue Hill!",2,3,1

95,Lance N.,"Centreville, VA",28,156,154,5.0,8/10/2016,"This is my second time here with my wife. Amazing food as usual. Firs time around was a miss since for some reason their service was very chaotic and so the manager called us up inviting us to come back. This was about 1 year ago and even though that particular manager is gone, they still honored the invitation! Much respect to Blue Hill! So, if you've watched their Chef Table episode, you'll understand what you're in for -- Vegetables! But not just any vegetables. OH no, these are the most delicious veggies you'll ever have! The most delicious kohlrabi and fennel you'll ever taste and don't mind eating raw. Yes, quite peculiar but it's true! I don't know what they do to it, or how they do it, but its the best tasting kohlrabi and fennel I've had. So that's just an example of one of their dishes. But, my review about their dishes stops here. I want to keep everything else a surprise. Their food is delicious, no doubt about that and going in not knowing what you're going to get puts that little bit of magic into the experience. There's so little surprises in life, its nice to savor the ones you still have. That is exactly what happened to us. They didn't even give us a menu besides the drink list. This situation may only be for us since we were invited back but I think it would be a neat spin if Blue Hill did this more often.The service this time was a full 180 degree turn around. I'm so glad to know that our waitress has actually been to their farm, so she really shows how much appreciation she has for the food that they serve. She even mentioned how they use all parts of the animal as much as they can which is a wonderful way to show respect to the animal. As we sat there through our experience, we started to notice how lovely the plates were. They were all hand made by a local artist. Our waitress noticed us checking it out and told us all about the artist. So, not only do they use local ingredients and work with local farms, but they also work with local artists! Can't get any more local than that! From now on out, my wife and I will make Blue Hill part of our visit whenever we are in NYC. What's not to love? It's even healthy for you and the price is very affordable for fine dining.",2,,
96,Sherry F.,"Manhattan, NY",9,115,49,3.0,2/19/2017,"I have to admit, I had high expectations and Blue Hill disappointed me. We had dinner here in early December 2016. We also just came back from a 12 day trip in Paris, Amsterdam & Berlin, where the food were all fantastic. My husband & I each had the tasting menu and felt underwhelmed. It also felt a bit pretentious and not so farm to table. The waiter was friendly but the hostess & the rest of the wait staff were not so friendly. We left hungry, either the portions were too small or the dishes were not filling enough. And I'm a light eater, I usually get full easily. I really wanted to love Blue Hill but was disappointed. Overall it was just OK! Nothing special.",11,,1
97,Valerie L.,"San Francisco, CA",236,642,2,3.0,5/19/2016,"To be completely honest, coming off the hype of Chef's Table and Third Plate (Dan Barber's book) I was expecting my mind to be blown by the orgasmic freshness of the asparagus. But I walked away from the meal feeling like the wow factor was missing.Part of the reason might have been the minimal description of the dishes from the servers. They mumbled some ingredients but definitely could have expanded -- after all, we're here because we want to know where the food came from!My fiancé and I both ordered the tasting menu ($89), which comes with three dishes and one dessert. It's a decent amount of food, but we had to fill up on three rounds of bread (which was amazing) to feel satisfied. Everything was plated beautifully. Standouts were the morning egg with mushrooms (that yolk!) and the vegetable dishes. However, the meat dishes (lamb belly and pork) were not that exciting or interesting compared to the earlier dishes. Perhaps the farmers feast would have been the better option.I'm still really glad I got to experience Blue Hill and Dan Barber's culinary talents, but I can't help but feel that dining at the farm must be vastly superior than this location because you're more connected to the food and educated about what you're being served. The service, while pleasant enough, didn't illuminate the experience much for me.",8,1,
98,Cynthia Y.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",275,121,12,5.0,11/29/2017,"I don't like American food, but I can't say that anymore after Blue Hill! Their food and presentation is hard to beat and I will argue that they deserve more than one star. I also particularly enjoyed the dim lighting and quiet ambience. Their farm-to-table was my favorite part, in the sense that you can actually taste the ingredients as fresh as they can be. The tomato really tasted like it just came from the vine. I would come back for a special occasion!",,,

102,Arun P.,"Astoria, NY",0,3,26,1.0,2/4/2017,"This review is solely for the staff at the reservation desk. So my girlfriend called up well in advance of our target date for a reservation and told that reservations were taken 28 days before hand over the phone and that online reservations open 30 days later at midnight. So based on the information provided by the restaurant we dutifully called. No response for 1/2 hour. I gave up but she tried and tried. Finally, she was put on hold (for awhile) then once she got someone on the phone she was told that the only reservations left were 10 and 10:30. When she inquired how this was possible, she was told that reservations opened at midnight. Wtf. The staff offered to put her on the waitlist but then became deaf and failed to get her name so my girlfriend hung up.So the question is whether this reservation desk is just incompetent or if they are just lying for the fun of it. Either way thanks for wasting our time.Final note, if reservations all open up at midnight then why have people answer phones? Maybe this redundancy should be eliminated. Clearly they are not informed anyway.Have a blessed day!",5,5,2
103,James S.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,3.0,12/10/2017,Wow. Not sure what to say. Been there before and had amazing food. This time was off. Way off. Service was great. But food basically sucked. Table of six with the tasting menu. The veal medallions were served on a rack of veal ribs. Then they told me the ribs weren't intended to be eaten. What??????????   What more should I say?  Not up to par.,,,
104,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0,5.0,4/15/2017,"This is one of the best fine dining experiences I have had in the city. I went with the farm menu and chose the squid ink risotto, farm egg, lamb and malted barley and stone barns honey.  Every dish was very creative and I loved how I could taste how fresh and well-preserved the ingredients were in every dish. I was especially impressed with the malted barley semifreddo - it had a lovely texture and the nutty, grainy barley flavor added a nice balance to the sweetness of the cream. Overall, the meal was well worth the $88 price tag.The venue itself isn't the fanciest, but it has a warm and cozy feel. If you dislike more formal, stuffy environment of restaurants like Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Marea, etc., you will feel a lot more comfortable at this place.As this place is very popular, my friend and I had to wait for almost 3 weeks to reserve a table, but it was truly worth the wait. I highly recommend!",,,
105,Rachel R.,"Brooklyn, NY",422,637,54,4.0,12/21/2016,"Despite redefining the farm-to-table movement as we know it, Blue Hill's Manhattan project (too soon?) wasn't revolutionary.The pomp and circumstance of minimalist fine dining (think meat x-ways, artful smears of sauce, on trend accoutrements) meets good old simple farm food. This translates to a lackluster spread of small, ethically-sourced, conceptually awesome dishes in an almost austere, dimly lit room of seriously dressed people.Now, if you're a city slicker who's never tasted kohlrabi or seen a whole carrot, start your edumacation here... After Chef's Tabling and TEDtalking and Third Plating and all that jazz. However, if you've already experienced the care that goes into growing and rearing great food, this likely won't floor you. There were total hits (venison), total misses (egg in a pan) and a whole lot of solid, good food. Like a home cooked farmstead meal plated by a design team. Amuse bouche: a raw turnip & radish. Awesome. Gets the point across, tastes lovely. No follow-up sense of wonder or reverence, though.Why? In part, because there's a haiku-length restriction set on describing dishes. An institution that cares immensely about food, and no one is describing anything they're bringing to the table? ""Let the dishes speak for themselves..."" I imagine everyone whispering. Guess what? This pig is dead and I need someone to tell me which 6 sections of it I'm eating.",11,9,9
106,CityGal V.,"New York, NY",11,62,33,1.0,6/27/2017,"Seriously overrated. One dish was an egg yolk foam with sea salt sprinkled on the side. Are you kidding me? Nope. The audacity. Another dish was grilled asparagus served on a bed of grilled herbs. The ""blue hill pig"" was nothing to write home about and the hubs said the duck was good. The fluke and halibut were both good. We were thinking pizza after our ""dinner."" The portions were really small and the bread basket was made to look full by a wad of paper stuffed inside the basket. One bright spot was Jason the sommelier. We had a rosé, a chard and a Pinot noir and they were all delicious.  The waitress was terrible ...we had to hunt her down which is absurd in a thousand sq ft room.

It was a bit challenging to get a reservation that wasn't at 5pm or 9pm, but when I saw a 7pm open I immediately booked. The food and service at Blue Hill are incredible. I would recommend the Farmer's Feast as it allows diners try small portions of each course, though it is quite a bit of food in the end. My favorite course was the 898 squash, a new squash variety that is said to be the first to be bred for flavor.It seems that the menu changes often which is great because I love to try new things and will definitely be back.",2,,

The menu consisted of two tasting options, so don't expect to order anything individually. However, you can choose between two options in appetizer and main course sections. We both ordered the cucumber appetizer, which was amazing (everyone here is surprised how a vegetable can taste this good) and we got pasta and lamb for our main courses. If I could give 6 stars for this food and place, I would. The service was amazing, prompt and on point. The restaurant does a good job paying attention to the details.

(Considering the value you get, the price is very reasonable) Everything was indeed superb. All the dishes were great with fresh sensitivity. I was surprised by the idea they use egg shell for the dressing.

I've got a plenty adventurous palate and am generally not picky, but I did not care for two of the five courses.  And of the ones that I thought were generally tasty, I liked them no better--and probably less--than I would at a restaurant priced significantly lower and offering a better dining room configuration.",1,,

The meal began with caviar and a poached egg (which I am still dreaming about). I really like how they customize their tasting menu for different events/holidays throughout the year. The meals are carefully curated and compliment each other. It is quite pricey, so I'd probably only come back for a special occasion. That being said, you really do get what you pay for. Blue Hill definitely deserves of its Michelin stars - the menu is creative and the service is impeccable. The waiters did a great job explaining what was in each dish.

We had the menu (the less expensive of the two options), and every bite was better than the last. It is important to understand that the food is special, not simply because of how it is prepared and presented, but because of how it is grown and developed.

I was expecting the food to be great but BH nailed literally every other aspect of being an amazing restaurant. The ambiance is cozy, rustic and classy. Every single person we interacted with was pleasant, helpful and seemed genuinely happy to ensure we had a good time.  So much is said about the food so I'll talk about some of the other details that makes BH 5 stars. But take it from me, the food is great. The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable about the wine and the origins of the food/how it's prepared. They happily answered our questions. BH is excellent with food allergies- specifically gluten allergies. They serve gluten free bread and even offer to bring a second helping! The gluten free bread is dense and warm and so good with their homemade butter. They never made us feel weird or bad about accommodating an allergy. Our water glasses were never close to being empty. Regardless of whether you choose the farmers feast or 3 course meal, they bring you extra goodies from the kitchen- fresh veggies with a dipping sauce, cured meat, fruit and honey from their farm. It was exciting getting these little surprise extras. Speaking of extras, my dinner partner ordered the feast, I got the three course meal. This is how classy BH gets- instead of me sitting and watching him eat his extra courses, they brought out a dessert course for me too, free of charge, without us even asking! It wasn't expected but it was SO appreciated. We were elated.  We also noticed some tables had little cards wishing their guests happy birthday if they were celebrating- so sweet.At the end of the meal- one of the servers asked if we had fun. I loved that! And yes we did have fun! It was a wonderful experience, we ate incredibly high quality food, and felt so welcomed by the entire staff. We left BH stuffed to the gills and overjoyed. Also, a couple of days later, we get a handwritten postcard in the mail from BH thanking us for dining there. The little touches like that make all the difference. We hope to spend many future special occasions there.",5,1,1

128,Katie H.,"Hoboken, NJ",280,222,67,5.0,4/29/2017,"I'm going to echo what many have already said but this was one of the best meals I've ever had!! Be ready to be taken on a lovely 3 hour journey. The service, ambiance, and of course the food were all on point. I think it is totally worth the $88 or $98 price tag! Plating of each dish was beautiful and also the sheer number of dishes ensured that you left with a full and happy stomach. The quality is obviously top notch as well since all the ingredients are so fresh. Our meal started off with a few different amuse-bouches including fresh carrots, Jerusalem artichokes, and cured pork straight from the farm.My friend and I chose the Daily Menu while my aunt went for the Farmer's Feast. The standouts for me were the Morning Farm Egg and Malted Barley and Stone Barns Honey. The egg was so fresh (as evident by that bright yellow yolk) and incredibly creamy. I never would have imagined that I would like having barley for dessert but they made it just sweet and light enough to put you into a heavenly state. A nice surprise was that they brought out 3 plates of the Rhubarb dessert for us even though it was not a part of the Daily Menu (listed on the Farmer's Feast!). One of the prettiest desserts EVER! The yogurt was painted onto the side of the bowl and adorned with edible flowers and mint. It was like an impressionist painting. The Blue Hill Milk Sorbet at the bottom of the bowl complimented the tang of the rhubarb perfectly. Lastly, let us not forget about the bread! It had a great crust while still being soft and not too chewy on the inside. It was accompanied by butter topped with roasted grains and I could probably eat 5 pieces of bread with that butter alone. The slices of Rye were the perfect vehicle for this smokey butter.  Top tip: Make sure you make a reservation as soon as it's one month prior to your desired date. I cannot wait to splurge and visit the farm at Stone Barns one day!!",2,,
129,Eric Y.,"New York, NY",426,160,73,5.0,7/11/2015,"Blue Hill NYC, Wow! loved it! Quite simply one of the best restaurants in NYC!We went with the Farmer's Feast which included a 5 course meal Highlights:Stone Barns Berkshire Pork/Chicken/Beef with a curried flowering kale that was stunningly juicy, savory and sweet.  Interesting mixture of sweetness from the fruity sauce really helped emulsify the fat and proteins from the dish.  The morning's farm egg with an English pea, pistachios, and bacon.  This was on a skillet with some great al dente peas and nice crunch and salt from the bacon.  The egg was spectacular, with a creamy, silky texture that was almost like tofu.  Everything together was simply delicious. The vegetables were leafy and went well with the dish.Next came the tile fish.  Nothing overwhelming; the fish was bit on the dry side but made up for it by the complexity of flavors in the dish.The fourth course was a palate cleanser with blueberries, elderberries, yogurt sorbet, and honey.  This was tart and refreshing with a stripe of sticky sweetness courtesy of the honey. What a wonderful palate cleanser!There was one last dessert as well, a little pot of homemade yogurt with blueberries and graham cracker crumbs.  This was simple but compelling, and it might have been the best of the sweets.Overall, I enjoyed Blue Hill.  I loved the concept and use of top-notch ingredients, and the intimate vibe of the small dining room.  Service was excellent and most importantly food was fresh.  A true farm-to-table restaurant.  A wonderful NYC institution!  Loved it!",6,,5
130,Cynthia W.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",13,33,31,5.0,7/31/2015,"Not sure if it is the best ""from farm to table"" restaurant, but it is definitely one of the best. From where I am born and raised up, we only do simple steam/boil for the freshest ingredients. The best way to appreciate the original taste.The amusements & summer veggie and fruit- the freshest vegetables ever. I bet you will fall in love with raw vegetables after these.The tuna - perfectly sealed with creamy corn and fava beans. The egg - the highlight! Spectacular! I thought it was a normal poached egg with liquid yolk, which could be really messy when eating. BUT it was not. I guess it is between 5-6 mins, keeping the shape of the yolk and silky texture like tofu. The duck - I am really picky with duck, and the one doesn't meet my expectation. The duck itself is not bad. However, the sauce and eggplant cheese purée are too strong and salty for me. the only dish I don't like.The milk - maybe because I have high expectation on this one. The milk sorbet tastes no better than milk flavor from some top ice cream stores. The yogurt is a different dessert?The peach - wonderful to finish the farmer's feast. Corn sorbet is very special. And the angel/sponge cake(?) reminds me of the dessert i got few days ago with the back room in one57 (love both)I guess it is becoming more and more popular because of the netflix documentary. Not difficult to get a table at NORMAL dinner time online 3 weeks ahead. If you are so eager to try it, call and let them put you on a wait list.",4,,

Even though it's small plates, and by small I mean really small, by the end we were over full.

I was lucky enough to be taken by someone to celebrate graduating with my Masters to Blue Hill and to call the experience amazing would be an understatement. Each course just got better and better as we went along. The service and attentiveness to our table was exceptional. As two people who do not consume alcohol and pork, Blue Hill worked very well with our dietary restrictions to still be able to provide us with the experience others receive. Even the non-alcoholic drinks blew us away. We were also taken back into the kitchen for a glimpse of all the works going into what was served. The chefs and workers are powerhouses. The great part about this restaurant is that the menu constantly changes based on what is in season, so there is more than one reason to go back again soon (special occasion or not.)

135,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245,5.0,6/10/2015,"IN SHORT: The ultimate authority on farm-to-table cooking since 2000, Blue Hill is still a paradigm of sustainable food values. While you might be hard-pressed to find company below the age of 40 in the tiny, low-ceilinged space, you will enjoy a garden of Eden full of lovingly cultivated flavors unlike anywhere else.THE STORY: While the phrase ""farm-to-table"" too often evokes a conscious branding intended to attract those self-proclaimed, millenial foodies who want to feel good about whatever they're eating, its origins are in fact much more genuine, and much more authentic. The modern notion of farm-to-table cooking is usually traced back to sunny California in the 1960s and 70s, when chefs like Alice Waters were turning to organic, local foods in response to the great mechanization of agribusiness. But like so many great movements in any discipline, the popularization of the trend brought about a vanishing of the values that inspired it in the first place.So today, whenever I see a dish described only as ""whatever our farmer brings today,"" my eyes roll into the back of my head and I convulse and die, praying that it's just a campy joke. Indeed, most restaurants that have come to embrace these locavore semantics do so with such a heavy-handed gusto and nostalgia that I almost expect to see an angelic farmer floating around the restaurant with an ethereal, golden halo, sprinkling barley and pepita seeds on every diner.Thankfully, Blue Hill exists to remind us that this resurrection of farm-to-table is a farce, and the beauty and values of its earliest, former self can still be found in the basement of a Greenwich Village townhouse.Here, with either a constantly changing 4-course Daily Menu for $85 (dessert is on a separate menu, but included), or a multi-course Farmer's Feast tasting menu for $98, chef Dan Barber reminds us that true farm-to-table cooking is about knowing every ingredient from the beginning to the end of its life, and showcasing the peculiarities of its seasonality.On a recent dinner in late spring, Mr. Barber was showcasing asparagus in at least two dishes, a first course of Pencil Asparagus with preserved apricots, pistachio, and milk curd for a creamy finish, and in a second course of Stone Barns Pullet Egg with asparagus, morels, and ramps. Flavors are fresh but deeply intense, more powerful than you would expect from a dish with such clean focus.The Stuffed Ramps with vegetable pulp, malted grains, and a bit of carrot mustard on the side also had the bewitching effect of making me feel like I had entered Mr. Barber's own private garden, so delicately was the dish tended and plated, draped with blossoms and foam. But inside was a satisfying depth of flavor that balanced the spiciness and nuttiness of grains with a wholesome richness. The Stone Barns Celtuce, a type of lettuce with a thick, earthy stem, was topped with smoked farmer's cheese and chopped peanuts and pine nuts, sitting against a vibrant sauce made from mache lettuce, also known for its nutty tones. It is an elegantly refined and nuanced dish that is as bright as a candy Jolly Rancher and yet more satisfying and savory than any vegetable imaginable.The main course on a recent evening was the Stone Barns Berkshire Pig with a curried flowering kale that was stunningly juicy, though the sauce was rather expected and a piece of fat was unfortunately too chewy. Dessert was an incredible surprise, however, particularly for a person who never enjoys ordering it. The toasted peppercorn and rhubarb ice cream and cheesecake carried the Edenic themes of freshness and intense bounty to the very end of the meal, proving that when a chef like Dan Barber is at the helm, farm-to-table dining is just as truthful and alive as ever.",9,2,
136,Irene H.,"Boston, MA",345,234,262,3.0,9/9/2016,"I only heard of this place because of the show Chef's Table on Netflix. I came here with very high expectations but was a little disappointed with some of the dishes. There were some very applaudable dishes but for having spent $120 a person I was expecting every single course to have hit the spot. The service was excellent, which should be considering the overall perception of this place. As for the dishes, they started us off with two pieces of some unique hybrid vegetables (name of which I couldn't quite understand what the waiter said) but one was like a short but stumpy cucumber it was crisp and very refreshing. The other looked like a turnip (came from Germany according to a waitress) but tasted like a beet but again the flavor wasn't overwhelmingly strong and it was great with the green sauce they had smeared all over the plate, again we missed the exact name of it due to the low voice as well as the thick accent of the waiter that served it. Again I've  never seen either vegetables in my life, they could've told me it came from Mars and I may have believed them except I knew life wasn't yet quite possible on Mars. The first actual course we selected from the set menu was the ravioli and the summer fruits and vegetables (which was just a fancy way of saying a salad). Again the salad was just refreshing nothing different from a typical salad, but of course you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. The ravioli was mind blowing and probably one of my favorite things that night. Its a unique take on the traditional wrapped up bundle of meat, the 'skin' was just two slices of cucumbers. But the sauce they drizzled over that with the filling was just mind blowing. The next course we had the fish and then egg plant. The fish was a little cold like room temperature, so not sure if it was meant to be served cold or warm, but it almost tasteless, presentation on point but thats about it. The eggplant was amazing, something magical in the sauce. The next course we had the pork and then the chicken. Pork was cooked very well, tender with the right about fat. The supporting sauces paired very well. The chicken was good, if you skipped the skin since that was very very salty. It made it almost hard to eat unless you ate it with the surrounding veggies and then took a swig of water. Dessert wasn't bad, a blueberry tart pie. Then the peaches and fig with honey, s simple but so fresh, excellent honey. I am generally not the type to send food back, unless there is a piece of foreign object or completely inedible, with fear they will spit in it. If I paid $40 for this meal I may not be quite so critical but for a four dollar sign place with pretax/drinks at $88 a person, I had way higher of a expectation. Can't say I will be back at this fine establishment anytime soon again.",1,,1

138,Huy H.,"Fairfax, VA",157,145,45,4.0,6/9/2016,"Honestly, a 4.5 star experience overall. We had reservations for 6pm for 5 people and when we showed up, we were promptly seated. The menu is straight forward and from making the reservation a month ahead of time, they make sure to know your allergies and other special accommodations. Service was on the slow side of prompt but it was nice since we did not feel rushed or hurried to finish up our meal. Half of our table got the Farmer's Feast and the other their fixed price menu. All the courses came out in an organized and orchestrated way, with explanations which I appreciated. The farm-to-table theme was definitely observed as there was a surfeit of asparagus, strawberries and rhubarb on the menu that evening. Everything was well seasoned and tasted great though I do wish there was maybe one or two more bites to each dish. The kitchen does send out complementary small dishes to the table like fresh spring radishes and various pickled fruits at the end of the meal. My only critique was that while the food was well prepared, I do wish there was a bit more variety in they were incorporated into the dishes. Most of the veggies came out charred or roasted; preparation was simple for the sake of highlighting the ingredients which I get, but I think some variety in the preparation would have been great too.They happily accommodated a gluten-free request at our table with different bread and appetizers which was nice!",4,,1
139,Be Fontaneous ..,"Manhattan, NY",6,36,202,4.0,10/6/2015,"My visit was dated a while back.The only reason I gave the NYC Blue Hill four stars is because the Blue Hill at Stone Barns is a lot more amazing. The food at this NYC location is very delicious, but presentation wise was nowhere near what Stone Barns offers! Service and ambience were decent.",1,,
140,K.t. M.,"Lubbock, TX",206,91,39,5.0,5/28/2017,"Probably one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Service is impeccable. I got the extended tasting menu which included 8 courses. They bring out at least 12-14 different items. The bread is heavenly. Spent 2 -3 hours here and left with a $200 check, but so worth it. Will be back for sure!",,,

143,David N.,"New York, NY",83,145,55,4.0,11/8/2015,"Menu will change and be updated so there's not much to say about my specific courses. Just know that it's very fresh and flavorful - orange egg yolks are the evidence. Definitely not a placebo or factor of marketing: it lives up to its farm fresh reputation.One window, so no natural light but the ambiance is very warm and cozy. We enjoyed it - yellow lighting, candlelights, exposed brick etc.I also personally loved the music selection. Bird, Ray Charles, Miles Davis among them... It really makes the restaurant vibe.The dessert was the best dessert I've had in a tasting menu - almond sponge cake with white chocolate and cranberry. Very delicious. Service was very slow though - but that's not the waitress' or chef's fault (it's busy - possibly understaffed). I also love the ""no cellphones"" rule - it allows you to be in the moment which I'm personally very big on.Most importantly, the chef and staff are very accomodating to your diet (I requested a vegetarian farmer's feast). It's a good experience - would possibly go again.",,,
144,Kayan L.,"Manhattan, NY",23,8,0,3.0,6/1/2016,"I went here in March and it was absolutely amazing, it became my favorite restaurant in the city (over Per Se, Daniel, etc.) Fast forward a couple months later, my family was in town and I knew I had to take them. I managed to secure a reservation at 6:30 pm for 3 weeks later. I wanted so badly for everyone else to experience the foodgasm I had at my previous visit... But unfortunately the experiences did not match up. Maybe it just has something to do with the seasons. All 5 of us got the farmers feast. The first dish, shrimp toast with phytoplankton was good, but after that things took a turn for the worse. Next up was an egg dish which literally was just a fried sunny side up egg on a bed of veggies... The egg was nothing spectacular. It just tasted like an egg.Our 3rd course was the goose egg noodles, which was a tiny serving smaller than the size of your palm. For something that small you would expect some insane taste bud firers but, no. The noodles had a strong underwhelming taste, and their seasoning tasted a little like something you would get from a Chinese restaurant.Next we had the duck, which was cooked well. Seared crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. However two of my family members also got an additional farm pig entree as an ala carte which we all tried. It was very average, a dish you would be able to find at any establishment. ABC Cocina's pig is better.Finally we had two desserts, the rhubarb yogurt and the strawberries sangria marscapone. They were good, not amazing. You can never really go too wrong with desserts. I don't know whats up with the spring menu, are the ingredients just not good? Did the cooking deteriorate? I'll try you again in the summer, Blue Hill, please don't let me down...",3,,2

We both took the Farmer's Feast menu and everything was absolutely perfect. I'm not a huge fan of melon, but the one they served us was so tasty and sweet, I loved it!! The service was perfect, they even offered us a second dessert for our anniversary, it was a nice attention. We decided to come here after watching Chef's Table on Netflix and we weren't disappointed. I loved that the staff provided many information about every ingredient of each course, it was a unique experience.",1,,

147,Stefano G.,"Manhasset, NY",8,28,6,5.0,5/1/2016,After seeing this place on a Netflix show I decided to go here with my fiancé for my 30th birthday. We made a reservation for 830 on a Wednesday. The overall experience was amazing. The pre dinner drinks at the bar was amazing and everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable of everything they were doing and serving. I got the extended farmers tasting dinner and my fiancé got the same but asked to substitute some items. Everything that was served was amazing. They also have a very extensive wine list with a lot of price points. This dinner was absolutely one of the best I have ever had. The food and experience was beyond what I expected.I highly recommend this place.,4,,

149,jac n.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",48,132,0,2.0,8/18/2017,I've never had expectations so dashed. The supporting staff was wonderful and the food was great but the service didn't live up to a michelin star restaurant at all. The service was not acceptable. Twice during the night I waited over 10-15 minutes for someone to take my drink order. And after that I waited another 10-15 to get the drink. For a Michelin star restaurant this is insane. Worst of all was when I went to the bathroom they brought out my entree and did the presentation without me there. My boyfriend said it was good but seriously? For as much as you spend the service should be seamless. They should have more than one waiter on a table (or give them less tables). And never bring food out when the person isn't there. I also left still hungry somehow. The drink portions are pretty small (hence finishing it quickly and wanting another!) too.,3,,

We felt very well taken of in an effortless way, which is difficult and awesome.  The food was superb.  I had the farmer's feast, she the tasting menu, and that way we were able to sample almost everything available.  Nothing felt pushed or overdone.  The real standouts were the salmon and the pea-zza.  And we both agreed that the strawberry cake with white chocolate was maybe the best thing we've ever eaten.  An expensive night, but one worth every penny.  We'll definitely be back for another special occasion.",1,,

155,Amit S.,"New York, NY",212,21,1,5.0,2/28/2016,"I've been waiting to come to Blue Hill for 3 years. Finally, an appropriately momentous occasion came along. See below for drinks, food, general. Drinks, Partners in Crime cocktail, various glasses of wine: Bitter cocktail, but I always give bitter drinks a chance when I'm paying up, because they usually do it right, as they did here. We got several glasses of wine throughout the meal. They made some excellent recommendations. I've been to places where the wine didn't add much to the meal and was more expensive than it was here. I would recommend having some fun - they have a great selection - and playing around with different glasses for your courses, you won't regret it. Our selections certainly played a large role in my feelings about the food below.My girlfriend (vegetarian) and I both did the daily menu. All together here's what we got: Celery Root Risotto, squid in its own ink: Gorgeous dish, visually. Subtle celery along with ink (and whatever else was in it) made for a surprisingly light, nonetheless rich, first course. Definitely recommend this. Winter Fruits and Vegetables, celery root, lady apples, pickled potato and mushroom: I didn't have much of this, so can't comment much. My girlfriend wasn't blown away, though. Jerusalem Artichoke, in the style of baked potato, smoked cheese (no bacon bits): Forget what you think about baked potatoes. I don't know if it's where they get the potatoes or how they cook them, but the combination led me to one conclusion. This is what a potato should taste like - almost meaty, with crispy skin that almost finds a way to melt in your mouth, and most importantly, you can tell it was in the ground not long ago. And I only had one bite of the potato. Get it. Monkfish, fennel, carrot and lobster broth: I've never had monkfish before, and I'm not too well versed in the way of fish. But you can taste all three elements of the broth. The fish (expectedly cooked perfectly) was subtle and, I thought, more of an experience in texture and as a medium for the broth, which reminded me of being near an outdoor fire somewhere, just the right distance away so that all you needed to wear was late fall/early spring clothes. Venison, spaghetti squash, pickled mustard seeds and pine nuts: This tastes like you would expect. Spaghetti squash on the side, delicious to add to your bite, or in its own right. This felt initially like the least unified the dishes we ordered, but that didn't matter much because all the elements were tasty, and once I found the exact bite that I liked, I just went with that. Bloody Beet Steak, quail egg, classic creamed spinach, bone marrow and bordelaise: We substituted the for bone marrow (I forget exactly what), and this was probably the best tasting dish of the night. I've recently taken to beets, and this one was much like the potato I mentioned earlier. It is so clearly what every beet should taste like. Strong and powerful; paired with everything else, there are endless possibilities for ways to enjoy this dish. I only had 1 bite. Imagine it with the bone marrow. Get it. Dessert, apples with ice cream, don't remember exactly: Just...wow. If by now you've read this far into the review, perhaps you think, please, please don't say it it's what an apple should taste like. Fine, I won't. I will say this is a fine way to end the meal. It's a romantic, warm dish. Reminded me of the feeling after a 3rd or 4th date with someone, and you think, maybe, just maybe, this person won't be a heartbreaker, and you'll have the kindest of times together, at least for a while; you finally spend some time in their arms that night. That's this dish. Of course, let's be honest - in the real world, people disappoint; this dish doesn't. Dessert, chocolate mousse, layered with ladyfingers (I think), and some sort of gelatin situation: I thought long and hard about whether the fact that I didn't like this, at all, was a reason to give 4 instead of 5 stars. Turns out I just really, really don't like gelatin in desserts. Didn't finish it. Ambience, noise, general feelings: Small, simple, minimal lighting, a little noisy. But it's New York City, so if you can't deal with it, deal with it. We did have our reservation early, at 5:30pm, so that was actually nice and made the first part of our meal relatively quiet. Around 7:30pm-8pm, there were more than a few moments where it was difficult to hear each other. This is real food. Happy eating!",3,2,3
156,Jim S.,"Fort Collins, CO",7,342,8,5.0,10/22/2016,"We ate at Le Bernardin and Blue Hill on back-to-back nights so were a little worried this would not compare (boo-hoo, I know). Wrong! It was perfect counterpoint. The food here is simple and all about the ingredients. The most perfect radish you've ever eaten. The best bite of chicken you've ever had. Etc. Everything was absolutely stellar. Portions are small, so I definitely recommend getting the longer tasting menu. Between that and the eyes-will-roll-back-in-your-head delcious bread and butter we were comfortably full.I can see how some people would be confused by this place - if you are expecting blowout Michelin Star luxury, you've come to the wrong restaurant. But if you, like Blue Hill, are all about the food- you'll love it.",,,

Ingredients seems fresh and quality-sourced as they are known for, but the flavors were unimpressive. All I remember was drinking lots of water to counter the salt.The crowd was definitely older.

We had the regular menu for the night which included some amazing dishes with really extraordinary flavors. We were kinda dissapointed with the service though (we waited too long for the main dish) and even though they apologized, I don't think it's acceptable when you're paying $95 dlls for dinner. The pork was incredible and the chicken was just good, nothing amazing. The desserts though were truly awesome, peaches, corn, the perfect balance of sweet and sour, loved the textures. Wow. Definitely worth another visit.",,,

My husband and I both chose the Daily Menu which comes with 3 courses plus dessert. Additionally, you get some fresh vegetables to start and bread with fresh butter between courses. Everything was very fresh, the meat was incredibly tender, and the flavors were unique. Blue Hill is definitely pricey but it was worth every penny.",,,

161,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",2,86,0,3.0,1/28/2017,"I came here once years ago when it first opened and had good memories of that experience. We returned last week for my birthday. Although the food was fresh and well-prepared, I didn't think the overall experience was special enough to merit the recent hype, not to mention the $500 price tag for dinner for two. We sat in the row of tables for two in the front.  The spacing is tight, and if you're next to a table of loud-talkers, it's a problem.  We sat between two men having a vigorous and heated political discussion and an awkward third-ish date where the guy loudly attempted to impress a poor woman with his incessant verbal diarrhea.  My bf and I could barely hear each other. The thing that was really sour for me was the service.  We walked in and we were greeted with a perfunctory ""happy birthday"" and a little birthday note card at our table, but it was robotic and done as if crossing something off a checklist with barely a smile. The entire evening could best be described as ""clinical"".  All servers timed the courses appropriately, but they rushed off with barely an interaction and nobody took the time to explain anything other than their specially bred squash, which I didn't find to be a necessary improvement and a bit gimmicky.  Why would I want an explanation for our tasting menu? Because the menu is written either in some esoteric code or more likely the 5 word descriptions of each dish need an actual human to fill in some color commentary.  The amuse bouche were great, especially the Brussels sprouts, and vegetables, and the scallop was cooked perfectly but needed seasoning. Sometimes you go out and taste something that is just so delicious you keep thinking out it and tell all your friends.  Not here. Each course was brought out in its farm-to-table majesty but nothing completely blew me away.  Bottom line, it was a fairly nice evening but a bit underwhelming.",2,1,

She did pairings as the courses came out, she talked intelligently about every single item, how it was prepared, where it was from, why it is being served now and made personal connections with us both. She deserves every tip she has ever received. Amazing service! I wish I would have got her name to say ""great job!"" Food. Food was just awesome. Just a great experience. Truly set the bar. My next visit was also very good, but I was spoiled from my previous one. We had different wait staff, and they just didn't' live up to our previous visit.

169,Corrina S.,"San Francisco, CA",713,381,104,4.0,12/2/2015,"A little bit of background on my visit to Blue Hill.  I first discovered Blue Hill on a beautiful April afternoon, walking out of Washington Square Park with Roy C.  It's easy to miss (in a good way), but I remember pausing and pointing out how cute it seemed.  It's not open for lunch so I couldn't peak inside, but it definitely left an impression.  Fast forward 4 months.  My good friend introduced me to the Chef's Table series on netflix.  Dan Barber's episode is the 2nd on the list and a few minutes in, I thought to myself - this looks really familiar... and then the ah-hah moment!  It was the same restaurant I serendipitously discovered in NY!!!!  I won't go as far to say that I planned my most recent trip back to NY just to eat at Blue Hill... but I also won't say I didn't either ;)Needless to say, it was a no-brainer that we had to book a dinner reservation.  They only take rezzies a month out, so I was literally on opentable 30 days prior to my trip to make sure this was going to happen.  Then I re-watched the episode a few more times :).Now we're in NY and the night had come.  I was so so excited.  The whole experience from walking in to leaving was a perfect blur of what fine dining should be.  The ambiance and service are impeccable.  I think what sets Blue Hill apart is the story.  I'm all about the story and theirs is a great one.  If you come here without watching Chef's Table or at least knowing a little bit about Dan Barber, then you're doing yourself a disservice.  I would definitely recommend doing your research beforehand; otherwise, a plate of radishes will just be a plate of radishes and bread and butter will just be bread and butter.  Even the hand soap in the bathroom is made by Blue Hill (and no, they don't sell it - I asked).I will definitely be back next time I'm in NY for more!",7,3,5

Not quite as good as last time but still superb. We opted for the regular prix fixe menu so we could try different things. Everything was great except the egg dish which was fine but not special. Definitely recommend this place.",,,
171,Alex R.,"Arlington, MA",44,178,6,5.0,11/23/2015,"The fun thing about Blue Hill is that it's so close to self-parody. They set a beautiful slate before you and announce, almost whispering: ""Radishes."" And it's, like, radishes. Nothing has been done to them. Just radishes, on a slate, with the greens still on.If you're going to charge a hundred bucks and then give people radishes they had better be some amazing radishes, and Blue Hill gets away with it because they are, in fact, amazing radishes (or, on a previous visit, fennel, or what have you) - always some weird variety, these ones were much less peppery than your garden-variety radish (get it? I made a joke!) but also because it's more of a mission statement than a course. They're setting the tone. The point is the radish, which they've been preparing - this radish, this exact one - for like a year. They messed with the soil, they made sure the growing environment is just right, they planted everything just so, and here you are with the Platonic ideal of radish. There's really no way to talk about this without sounding like a dweeb.There will be more to it than radishes. For a place that's all about the product, we saw two foams. They are actually cooking back there. On our last visit I had the best venison of my life. I don't know if wrapping it in fall leaves really did anything that spring leaves wouldn't have, but certainly something is responsible for that venison, and whatever it is I'll pay for it.They produced some grapes at one point (hushed tone: ""Grapes."") that brought me right back to the grapevines growing in my childhood friend's backyard. These aren't the grapes you get in the store. They're smaller and the skin is thicker and they're wavering on unpleasant, a certain funky ""fuck it I'm a grape"" quality that's been edited out of store-bought grapes. They really want you to think about what a grape means. I get it. They're walking a fine line here, between Platonic grape and self-parody, but they're pulling it off.",10,22,6
172,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,11/20/2014,"My prior dinner at Blue Hill at Stone Barns was one of the worst dining experiences I've had to date [1], so the last thing I expected was to visit the Blue Hill location in Manhattan. To be fair, the decision to arrive at Dan Barber's one Michelin starred, New American restaurant hadn't been in my hands, but I was hesitant, to say the least, about what would come out of the kitchen.Located just off of Washington Square Park, Blue Hill may not be the most well-windowed restaurant in the area, but there's a certain elegance that the space commands, evident in the dark plush seats and the immaculately set, perfectly spaced tables. We were promptly greeted and given an overview of the menu; unlike Stone Barns, Blue Hill has a four-course prix fixe, a six-course Farmer's Feast... and the bottom of the menu has a small note, inviting guests to try the Extended Version of the Farmer's Feast. Upon learning that it involved an additional two courses of the chef's choosing, the final decision to go with a total of eight courses was made.After a few amuses, we were served a chilled plate of Blue Hill Farm Tomatoes. The tomatoes had been sliced and dusted with basil seeds, and were set on a light, perfectly acidic gazpacho. Each tomato was ripe and incredibly packed with flavor, but we were both enthralled with the ""smoked cloud"", a gelatinous creation that had the lightness and texture of silken tofu, but was somehow infused with a tomato taste. The dish that followed was another delight, a plate that featured Montauk Lobster over a ""corn chowder"". The chowder was almost overflowing with sweet, plump corn kernels, and the interspersed pieces of shrimp and clam added a unique brininess to each spoonful. With the finish of a juicy, seared portion of lobster, it was yet another piece of evidence that including seafood into my diet in the last year or two was the correct decision.And then, a Zucchini Carbonara, which took strands of the vegetable as the pasta and melded in three generous cuts of bacon, Parmesan cheese, and a barely cooked egg yolk. The resulting bites were savory, crisp, and rich, without being unnecessarily heavy. The course that followed was the first of the extended menu: a Ricotta Gnocchi complemented by a few tart halves of cherry tomato and a drizzle of balsamic. The gnocchi was soft and pillowy, the ricotta cheese present in just the right amount to give it a little tang. With the balancing acidity in the tomatoes and balsamic, it was an innovative take on the traditional pasta. And the second dish of the extended menu featured a lightly seared cut of poussin paired with crisp haricot verts and a light horseradish-based sauce. The protein remained tender despite the crisp skin, and the additional texture from the haricots verts and an element of creaminess from the sauce made for a complete dish.A final savory plate featuring various cuts of pork (loin, stomach, shoulder, leg) with grilled cantaloupe, plum, and roasted pepper slices demonstrated how a successful pairing of sweet and savory should be executed. Unlike my prior meal at Stone Barns, this dish was perfectly seasoned and the pork was cooked to the right consistency and tenderness. The meal ended on two sweet notes; the first, a  simple concoction of macerated blueberries in honey, topped with a yogurt sorbet, followed by scoop of cocoa nibs ice cream plated on top of chocolate cake and chopped strawberry.I'm grateful I got a second stab at Blue Hill, as I can at least personally vouch for the Greenwich Village location. It's more suitable for a more formal occasion, as I believe we were some of the youngest diners seated that evening, but our server was one of the most considerate I have yet to encounter [2]. And when all the necessary elements of a memorable dining experience align... what additional reasons do you need?--[1] yelp.com/biz/blue-hill-a…[2] She complemented my companion on his bouquet selection, and offered to keep it in water during the course of our meal.",21,4,9

174,Eileen H.,"San Francisco, CA",393,135,199,5.0,12/23/2015,Why is this place so good!! I just made reservations for this place not thinking too much about it. I read somewhere that this was their current favorite restaurant so I said why not. We had the farmers tasting and it was sooooo good. Omg. I love when a restaurant gives me that close my eyes yummmm moment and this place totally gave me that moment. I definitely recommend this place to everyone. I absolutely love it and want to come back again and again,2,2,2
175,Christina T.,"Houston, TX",150,7,4,5.0,8/15/2016,I went with my S.O. For my birthday. They were very courteous and professional. They called a day ahead to confirm my reservation and take notes of our dietary restrictions. We were quickly taken to our table(already set up) with a personal birthday card. The staff was constantly around to take care of our needs and food came out at a great pace. Not pretentious or overrated on quality of dishes. It's was a great experience and a fun intimate time.,,,
176,T N.,"New York, NY",3,108,22,2.0,3/27/2016,"So I've been wanting to come to Blue Hill because I love Dan Barber and the fact that he cares so much about the natural taste of the food I thought eating there means experiencing perfection or close to that matter... But i was disappointed because the server made a several mistakes, which i don't usually mind if s/he is nice, but on top of that our food was super salty.  I had to send a dish back because I couldn't eat it... they were nice enough to give me a ""special"" dish to replace that which was OK.  For my main course - again it was super salty but i didn't mention anything.  When the manager came and asked me how everything was I saw every was ok because i didn't want to be an ass and all.  I will most likely go to the other location at Tarrytown, but my experience here was really not that great. I think my favorite thing there was my coffee and that piece of raw carrot.",1,,

Farm to table, and each course is focused around the produce. They pay incredible attention to detail. They really made me see vegetables in a different light. They really highlighted them and brought them to new heights. Hats off to the chef, and the staff. I can't wait to go back.",2,1,1
178,Andrew L.,"University, Denver, CO",0,18,0,2.0,10/26/2015,"My fiancé and I ordered the farm feast.  We felt that it was mediocre and honestly not worth the almost $400 that was spent on it.  We came from Colorado so your ""farm to table"" philosophy has to be a little more impressive.  The tuna burrito was terrible and the fish tasted old.  Also your ""hot sauce"" should be change to a sweet sauce because it was anything but spicy.  AWe made our reservation a month or so in advance and still couldn't get in until 10 pm on a Monday (I honestly have no idea why this place is so popular). Netflix way over hyped this halfway decent establishment.  Our sever did a good job explaining our wines, but the pairings seemed off..  Also the waitress seemed to be the only part of the staff halfway interested in explaining any part of the meal.  The food runner and backstaff could care less what is going on or how you feel. I would NOT recommend coming here, unless you feel like spending more then you should on a mediocre ""farm fresh"" meal.  It's a joke.....",6,1,
179,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,773,33,5.0,1/19/2015,"Outstanding food in a nice, quiet ambiance.I stopped by with two friends for one of their birthdays on a weekend evening, and we enjoyed a fantastic meal. We ordered the farmer's feast tasting menu, which was highlighted by several great dishes---we enjoyed a dish with the 898 squash, a unique smaller, sweeter squash which was delicious and went great with the bolognese and ricotta, the morning's farm egg, and the lamb and beef. The lamb in particular was the best lamb dish I've ever had, so well-prepared and tender. My cocktail was also great (the Sweater Weather), which came recommended by our waitstaff.The service was also very nice throughout, and it's a nice place for a meal with quiet conversation. I would definitely recommend it as a great meal for smaller groups for special occasions.",1,1,1
180,Jason M.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,25,16,4.0,2/28/2017,"Blue Hill is every bit as great as it is said to be. The cooking is superb and the quiet, non-pretentious atmosphere allows its guests to enjoy one another's company as much as their meals. Simplicity is startling here. Why 4 stars and not 5? It may have been an off night or possibly new staff in place, but the service was not as well coordinated for an establishment of this reputation. There were slight mistakes with the orders / food preferences and the staff didn't communicate with each other as well as they could have. This is not a big deal and doesn't detract from how great Blue Hill is, but service was not as seamless as I expected or as in other restaurants of the same caliber... I look forward to returning.",,,
181,Taylor H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,0,5.0,4/16/2017,"This is one of the greatest meals I have ever had. The joy of simple pleasure is alive and well, and tons of complexity goes into that simple pleasure. Our waitress and other service staff were incredible. They are honorable and not upsell queens. We had the extended tasting menu and found everything to be a joy. The barley dessert was meh. The other courses were absolute knockouts. Their wine menu does not prey on you. I feel that at $138 for eight courses they provide a tremendous value for the money. My one regret is the horrendous paint-peeling nature of the flatulence that has followed. It is a small price to pay for the meal I enjoyed.",,,
182,S. B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,2,5.0,3/21/2017,Beautiful birthday dinner.  We each had the tasting menu and loved every mouthful.  The service was amazing and the price point seemed very reasonable.  Generous portions.  Highly recommend.,,,

To quote Woody Allen: ""...the portions are small and ..."" well you know the rest. Good bread, ate plenty of it. Cancelled reservation at Daniel to come here. Definitely a mistake.",2,,
184,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",285,201,532,5.0,10/13/2015,"Blue Hill was amazing, from the food, to the service and the whole ambiance of the restaurant.  I'd gone to Blue Hill at Stone Barns last year, and it was really good, so I was excited to also try the restaurant in the city. It's prob more fun to go to Stone Barns, but this restaurant definitely did not disappoint.  My parents took me for my birthday :)  We opted to do the pre-fixe menu over the tasting menu.  It was four courses plus two amuse-bouche, and some fermented rye bread for the table.  The bread was really good, and I'm not even a big butter person, but I tried it and that was really good too.  It was covered with different types of seeds. So for the pre-fixe you get to choose your dishes and I went with the string bean salad, roasted fluke, and blue hill farm pig.  Everything was great!  The string bean salad was on the salty side, but I found it really good and wasn't off-putting.  I'm not usually one to put extra salt on anything, but surprisingly I really enjoyed the saltiness.  The roasted fluke was also really good.  it was in a chowder like broth with corn and shrimp, and the fluke was cooked perfectly.  It was more on the rare side, which I usually prefer for fish.  The pig also did not disappoint.  There were a few different peices of it, and lima beans that were really good.  One of the pieces of the pig was too fatty for me, so I left it, but everything else about the dish was great.  For dessert I got the chocolate raspberries.  It was a long narrow piece of chocolate cake with raspberries on top and some sorbet on the side.  Nothing bad about that!  They also brought me out a piece of cake with a candle for my birthday, but didn't sing ;) Overall I really enjoyed my meal there.  The service was great.  The waitress was very knowledgeable, and this may seem silly, but I really love when all the dishes are brought out together and cleared together.  Also it was nice and quiet in the restaurant.  It wasn't that crowded when we got there, but as the restaurant filled up it still remained pretty quiet which was nice.  It's hard to have your own conversations when you can't hear anything but other people's conversations.  And like I said the food was great! It would probably be nice to go back for another season sometime, and definitely would be fun to go back to the barn.",3,,2
185,Bonifacia B.,"Fullerton, CA",2,50,135,3.0,11/10/2015,"I saw their restaurant on Chef's Table and got really excited to try it. When I found out I was headed to NY I immediately tried to make reservations at the Stone Barns location but had no luck... I called exactly 1 day after their 6 month allowance and they were already booked! So of course I went to plan B and booked their NYC location. To my surprise this meal turned out to be just ""meh""... Sure, some of he ingredients were good and fresh, but the overall they lacked creativeness and wow factor. The meal was so unmemorable which was such a let down since I was so excited for it :(The flavor profiles were very flat-line, and a couple of their items were very salty. My fav items from the meal was the tuna tartar amuse bouche and the apple desert, both with great flavors, and made me wanting to come back for more. Service was good, Ambiance was romantic, but the food wasn't good enough for me to want to come back.",2,1,
186,Daniel K.,"Williamsburg, NY",1,165,0,3.0,11/18/2016,"We hosted our wedding at Blue Hill at Stone Barns and so that location will always be held near and dear to our hearts. We chose it because, as far as wedding food is concerned, Blue Hill could offer something special and - on the wedding food spectrum - it was exceptional, albeit completely overpriced. However, strip away all the fanfare and the gimmicks of ""the best [insert arbitrary vegetable here] you've ever eaten served on a spike"" or ""the chef was on Chef's Table"" and you are left to scrutinize the food. Regrettably, it falls short of the mark. For there is a difference between crop innovation and quality food -- in a perfect world they would reinforce each other, but I fear the former is used as a crutch for Blue Hill, especially at the New York City location.Blue Hill in the city is a different beast altogether compared to the farm - set on the ground floor of a brownstone near Washington Square Park, it is intimate and cozy but unexceptional in almost every regard - yes, there are white table cloths and everyone looks prim and proper in the dining room, but that is about the extent of the ambiance. The service is good and everyone is friendly enough.One has a choice between a tasting menu, a three course option, and there is even a bar menu with their take on a Shake Shack fast food box (it looked delicious). With the main menu starting at $88, you are primed to marvel at the radish hors d'oeuvres, but this is partly good produce and partly behavioral economics at its finest. The other courses that followed were each decent and, using the average higher-end restaurant as a benchmark, would be deemed fine, though unexceptional. The city location is almost certainly used as a ""Plan B"" for individuals wanting the full Blue Hill at Stone Barns experience, but the city location does not have the same degree of innovation and is actually a dreadful disappointment.Conclusion: For many, Blue Hill will be a splurge restaurant for a special occasion - one in which you will have to beg, borrow, and steal to get a reservation. At the bar. Yet, this city is filled with restaurants that serve far better food at much better prices - restaurants that may not work with Cornell to create the best radish, but produce astonishing food on a consistent basis. Within this competitive landscape, I do not feel the need to return to Blue Hill again.",2,,

Decent wine list, various price points.  I've always wanted to try Blue Hill, finally went with a few clients.  The food was sub par, we did the select tasting/daily menu.   The first two courses were over seasoned, but looked pretty.  Two of us had the pork and the other two the chicken.  The meat on both was very flavorful and quite good but they didn't really come with much to make it a complete meal.  We also could have done without eating the blood sausage, which wasn't mentioned on the menu.  Maybe I just heard too much about Blue Hill from a coworker who loves it.  I expected the food and menu to be better.   I wanted to love this place and take my boyfriend there for his birthday but pretty sure he would leave after dinner and grab a slice of pizza down the street an hour later.",2,1,1
193,Julia V.,"Manhattan, NY",356,143,74,5.0,7/19/2015,"I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that I discovered Blue Hill through the Chef's Table documentary and the restaurant stayed on my mind when it came time to book my birthday reservation. I have eaten at some other Michelin restaurants around town so my expectations were high, an because this was a special occasion, I was a bit scared off by some of the other reviews.However, this meal was everything that I have hoped for and more. The restaurant itself is located in an understated brownstone steps from Washington Square Park. The service in this restaurant is friendly and attentive (everything you would expect from a Michelin star studded restaurant.) My husband and I both got the six-course Farmer's Feast Tasting Menu and were impressed with both the rich flavor and presentation of every dish. My favorite aspect was that they accommodated fresh and delicious seasonal farm-to-table produce into every meal. Each course was far from boring, and the staff was very accommodating in making any substitutions requested. Some of my personal favorites included the summer fruits and vegetables, egg in a pan (best presentation), barley risotto, and also the freedom range chicken.Some previous reviews have mentioned that this restaurant is not very good for vegetarians/flexitarians, but I found my (mostly) vegetarian meal one of the best and most inventive that I have ever had. My husband is also somewhat of a lamb enthusiast and the staff let him substitute the grass fed lamb for his main course. We brought our own bottle of wine for a $50 corkage fee so we did not get to see their wine list, however the desert wine we tried was reasonably priced and very good. I know some others have complained about the phone policy, but I kind of enjoyed the intimacy of a cozy, phone-free environment (just wish I had gotten to take pictures of my fabulous food!)I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion. The dining room accommodates only 50 people, so definitely make a reservation about a month out.",5,2,

I don't think there is any place where you can get a comparable experience in NYC - the farm fresh ingredients are a cut above, and everything is prepared with creativity, care and perfection. I mean, they somehow even managed to make eating a fennel frond an amazing experience! I also love the realistic and creative categories on their wine menu: ""Ripe & Luscious"", anyone?My husband and I both got the extended Farmer's Feast and everything was incredible. Looking back, I probably could have done with just the Farmer's Feast but we managed to eat absolutely every morsel of food over the course of three hours.  A big highlight was the farm fresh egg in a skillet, and I must say that my whole understanding and appreciation of beans has skyrocketed.  I also must compliment the wait staff for being so effortlessly warm and professional, and genuinely excited about the the food they are serving. I was also surprised and impressed by the diversity of the staff. At one point we had about four people waiting on us at once, and it was like United Colors of Benetton - but with squash!Tip: If you are interested in a more intimate experience, ask for a ""quiet table"" and they will seat you in the back room past the kitchen.",1,,

It was pretty insulting. Even the manager finally realized our waitress was a flippant jerk, and comped us the entire meal. Still - the trend is down. They set their own precedent and now have failed to consistently reach their own high water mark. Maybe they are struggling financially?",2,,
