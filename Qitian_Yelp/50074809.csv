1,Cathy B.,"New York, NY",24,69,131,5.0,11/9/2017,"I stoped by for lunch with my friends, after visiting a hair place on 222 east 58th because workers at Armen's Barbershop recommended moonstruck What can i say Nice placeFood is amazing Waiters is helpful and very  professional Food is delicious and prices are reasonable Definitely coming back.",,,
2,Abigail W.,"Queens, NY",0,17,12,5.0,9/22/2017,I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better ratings. I stopped in on my way to grab some groceries and I really enjoyed the experience. I popped in for lunch around 1pm on a Friday. Wasn't too busy and I was seated immediately. The menu has a good variety of lunch and brunch options and for midtown NYC everything seemed pretty reasonably priced. I ordered Souvlaki Chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was grilled perfectly and had nice flavor. The dish came with a side Greek salad and fries (I upgraded to sweet potato fries and they were amazing!). The side salad was fresh and they used spring mix which I always prefer to romaine.The service was nice as well. The restaurant seemed well staffed and everyone was very kind and welcoming. Overall I had a great experience here and I would definitely return.,1,,
3,Jacqueline H.,"Omaha, NE",1,29,33,3.0,7/18/2018,"Service is great and the place is really cute inside, menu is on the pricier side. I tried the waffle fries which looked awesome but tasted meh, the ranch dressing also wasn't good.",,,
4,Anders V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,10/1/2018,I ate stale carrot cake from here and got so sick I threw up afterward. It was appalling they were even selling that carrot cake. 0/5 stars. Would not recommend.,,,
5,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1113,19753,4.0,3/25/2017,"I've eaten at other Moonstruck locations. They are peaceful to me. At this location they have live fish in tanks along the back wall. Very beautiful decor. The space is small but we had a window seat that was very comfortable. We arrived between 11:30AM and 12 PM. Very few empty tables left by then. Service started out fine. We both ordered brunch. I passed on the Mimosa or O.J. due to allergies. My daughter didn't want mine. My Sweet Potato Fries were $2.00 extra. They could have left off the extra charge since I couldn't have the drink. I should have brought that to the waiters attention. After all I passed on the mixed drink. I just had coffee. Coffee Service is my only service complaint. I tried to get a warm-up by trying to get someone's attention. No one returned until we were done. THEN he asked if I wanted more coffee! By that time I already finished my daughter's cold coffee. It was really good coffee I must say. Five Stars on the food. Considering we were not asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, they were both perfect. We had the Brunch Breakfast Burgers that include bacon, fried egg and American Cheese. Mine was on a soft bun. My daughter ordered her Burger on toast. I was glad I had the soft bun because it was fresh and delicious. The potatoes were a generous portion. I finally found Sweet Potato Fries that were tasty. I added a little salt. When we left my plate was clean! No room for desert. My daughter took home half of her meal for a second  meal. That's her SOP (Standard Operating  Procedure) these days. Our brunch was pricy for our typical Saturday lunch. $25.00 each approximately including tax and Tip. We decided we enjoyed this brunch so much we would return next trip to this neighborhood. I want to try the Waffles and Chicken. My daughter said she'd try an Omelette next time. A little more attention to coffee refill and I might give them five stars. With the exception of coffee refills service was timely and friendly. I highly recommend if you please save me a seat! It's not a big place!",88,48,84
6,Lori B.,"Tampa, FL",1219,393,2095,4.0,7/25/2016,"Since we'd only eaten pastries for breakfast, and had just walked across Central Park, I was craving a full breakfast, even though it was mid-afternoon. AND!!! Moonstruck Diner serves beer & wine! Inside was quiet, with only a few other diners. I ordered an omelet, which was quite large & well-packed with ingredients. And I enjoyed a bottle of Bud Light with my meal! I wasn't impressed with the potatoes & didn't eat much of them. My friend ordered a bagel with lox & cream cheese, which she said was very good. She had a glass of chardonnay with her meal, which she immediately felt so I got to finish it!Service was OK... our first server was not very attentive. But apparently his shift was ending soon, before we'd finished eating; our second server was much friendlier.We loved the diner-esque decor at Moonstruck Diner, & enjoyed eating here.",3,2,2
7,Laura S.,"Louisville, KY",12,153,5,5.0,10/25/2017,"The portions here, wow! I had a breakfast burrito with chili, egg, cheese and ended up eating the second 1/2 of it for breakfast the next day. It came with herbed potatoes with fresh herbs, which was unexpected. Coffee was good and even though I am left handed and had to hold their mugs backwards I still thought they were neat. Service was great, they were very kid friendly and the server obviously had children with how interactive he was with my son. Food waskn our table less than 10 minutes after ordering.",1,,
8,Emery G.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",422,330,2484,5.0,5/1/2016,"I like it a lot. Yum. Been here twice, once dined in and other time I picked up. A bit pricey but it's definitely the area. The grilled chicken is not dry and is seasoned well. It's actually pretty juicy. The sweet potato fries are delicious ! Fries to crispy perfection oh my. The only thing is that they weren't consistent in shape. Check out my pictures. First time I got them they were nice and thick. Second time they were all skinny. I mean doesn't matter to me because both times they were so crunchy butttt the thick ones are my preference. Oh wells, this is deff the spot I would go to for lunch again if I'm in town. I have to try their regular fries, can't imagine how crispy those are too. **Drooling",3,1,2
9,Shante E.,"CORONA, NY",130,7,7,4.0,11/9/2017,"Chicken and waffles. At first glance it did not seem like much. Thinly sliced fried chicken breast was not my first thought when I saw Chicken and waffles on the menu, but to my surprise it was seasoned well and delicious. The maple syrup and waffle  was good too, I was just missing the whipped butter. Service was good, seats are a little un-comfy. But overall a nice place",,,
10,Akira N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,55,12,5.0,1/23/2018,"I come at least once a week after work for dinner. I always get the pasta (angel hair), garlic chicken or omelette. They are all good tasting and satisfying when you are hungry! Staffs are very nice all the time too!",,,
11,Christine W.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,61,17,5.0,6/9/2017,"Food was great and service was fast. I know this review seems simple but it's that simple great food and service and the restaurant appeared very clean. When it comes to the food I had not one issue and neither did my friend I have attached pictures to this review. I follow the restaurant on Instagram and finally decided to head there they do not disappoint. I will point out that there were only three other tables being served at the time so I don't know if that adds to the fast service. I order the three cheese pasta with shells and shrimp and my friend order the turkey burger with avocado, tomatoes, lettuce etc",,,
12,P M.,"New York, NY",11,189,1,2.0,6/17/2017,"Just no. Good service but nondescript, over-priced food. And not too much choice. If there's nothing else open then sure.",,,
13,Jewel K.,"Davie, FL",0,10,6,4.0,12/28/2017,"Overall not amazing but not awful or disappointing. At first I was skeptical but the food was adequate enough to change that. The flavors weren't mind blowing but it wasn't under-seasoned. I ordered a patty melt with sweet potato fries. The patty melt was good and filling, the sweet potato fries were weird. At first the fries on the plate and the top of the cup were good and normal, but when I started to eat from the container cup they became sour and bitter. HOWEVER, what saved the day was the fried Oreos, those were absolutely delicious. I didn't get them with ice cream because it's too cold outside. Soooooo good. I definitely recommend if you don't really have anywhere to go or desperate, if you have solid interesting plans don't push things to make extra effort.",,,
14,Frances G.,"Woodside, NY",0,20,0,5.0,5/21/2018,"A few months ago, the owner of the now defunct Hudson Diner in the West Village took over this place.  It is now better than ever! Great burgers with fantastic hashbrowns, and breakfast dishes that compliments the great coffee. Also, glad to say at least one of the waiters from the old Hudson Diner is working here too.  He's as great as the food.",,,
15,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,3.0,6/6/2016,"Grumpy cat (first world) real time lunch review y'all....Ordered delivery.  Came reasonably quickly.  Portions fine-to-generous for the area and price points.What wasn't fine for the price point were the ingredients used versus those listed on the menu.Very cool to have a BYO Omelette option.  Looked like the innards I ordered, though the cheddar was mixed into the omelette along with the other add ons....making it a hardly distinguishable flavor, and for a dryer omelette.  Hearty amount of potatoes and omelette size....but I selected home fries....not cubed potatoes (there's a difference).They honored substituting fettucinni for penne (props)...but they list this as a dish with shiitake mushrooms...they use white button.  Rather significant price and flavor differential.  Had I been eating in, this would have been sent back; nearly $15 before tax/tip for vegetarian pasta with button mushrooms?  I think not.Flavors were good....tossed salad was good (not just iceberg)....seems like they're trying to give great quality....so rounded the 2.5-stars up to 3.......but I'll think a few times - and likely have to exhaust other area options - before trying Moonstruck again, as I now have no idea if I'll get that for which I paid.",,,1
16,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,3.0,5/23/2015,"""Standard Diner""I have visited this diner quite a few times and the service during the AM hours has been hit or mis. Like most nyc diners, the menu is full of various dishes - egg platers burgers, gyros, salads, surf and turf, desserts, etc. I will say that the French fries are fried perfectly. Also, the portions are very large. You could probably feed a small country with the amount of home-fries you get with the breakfast platters. The one this that kind of annoys me with this place is that it charges you for a soda if you get a seltzer water. I mean it is just carbonated water!!!!Other than that the place is fine and perfect if you do not know what you want to eat because EVERYTHING is served at this establishment.",,,1
17,Tom Y.,"Flushing, NY",920,64,993,3.0,4/3/2016,"See last paragraph for 3star ratingCame here for the first time on a friday evening. This place has the typical diner atmosphere and their dishes really embody that as well. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken and my +1 ordered onion rings and a fruiter salad with crispy chicken.The entrees at this diner are in the $10-25 range but it's justified by their generous portions. I was impressed by the sheer size of our orders but the chicken in my salad was a tad rubbery and the other salad was overdressed. Also should mention that I asked for no olives and bacon (sorry bacon lovers /sadface) but got them anyways. It's okay, I just fished them out. Probably an honest mistake. Their onion rings were extra crispy but a tad overfried (real brown) but overall pretty good. I enjoyed this place though it could really be better.",,,
18,L C.,"Little Neck, NY",4,20,221,2.0,12/17/2016,"The service was really slow. We were asked if we wanted coffee upon being seated and it never arrived. It took another 10 minutes after asking a waiter for coffee. There were only 2 other tables occupied. We ordered an omelet with and a French toast crunch. The French toast crunch was 4 large pieces of bread with generic cinnamon toast crunch cereal on it. It tastes okay, but there was very little or no egg used in making it. The omelet was just okay, the potatoes were tasteless (thank goodness for ketchup).The food was mediocre at best, but came in large portions for Manhattan.",1,,
19,Al A.,"New York, NY",0,54,4,1.0,1/9/2018,"I ordered from here last week. I requested a Cheeseburger Deluxe, Medium Rare with fries well done. Typically, when you order a Cheeseburger Deluxe from a diner, it's a bundle that includes fries. Not here, they charged me $12 for the Cheeseburger and $4 for the fries. It was cold out, so I gave the delivery guy a nice tip. With tax and tip, my Cheeseburger Deluxe came to over $20. The burger was not that tasty,  cold and cooked well done. The fries were also cold, definitely were not cooked well done and soggy. I could have gone to a bar or restaurant that serves a great burger and had an amazing burger for less! I live in the East 20's and diners in my 'hood typically charge $11 for a Cheeseburger Deluxe. Hey, sorry Moonstruck - you are not the 21 Club. I get it, rents in your 'hood are high but selling a product at an exorbitant price and then delivering a cold sub-par product does not escape notice and will only result in less, not more revenue for you! Look around, folks. There are more reasonable and better diners then this. Try the burger at Sutton Cafe, also a little pricey but at least it's a great burger.",,,

22,Estefania T.,"Orlando, FL",4,26,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"I think this is my harshest Yelp review, but I had to write it:Went there on a Saturday. It wasn't busy. I got a hamburger. The lettuce was disgusting. It was rotting, I put it on the side. Afterwards, I told the waitress (who was great), and she said they could have changed it. But my burger should have not been served a nasty piece of lettuce. The meat wasn't good. It wasn't seasoned. It was supposed to have truffle mayo, I didn't taste it. I had to add a bunch of ketchup to eat it( I was starving). The worst hamburger. My boyfriend had a veggie sandwich, the only vegetarian option. He didn't enjoy it. The ciabatta had exactly three ingredients inside. Slices of completely unseasoned (not even salt) portobello and zucchini, and some mashed avocado that tasted like it the only reason they used it was that it was about to turn. It seems as if the kitchen staff have zero experience with vegetables! The concept and execution both were terrible; did they even try the sandwich concept before putting it on the menu? How do you forget to salt or season the dish in any way? It's not like the place was busy... I'm leaning towards the recipe being written that way and the kitchen staff not caring. However, the waitress, and service overall, was great. Hope they find somewhere better to work.",,,
23,Timothy A.,"Quezon City, Philippines",125,3,0,1.0,2/14/2017,"Thank God someone invented ketchup, mayo, salt, and pepper without it our food will be tasteless. Serving, service and ambiance is okay. Definetely not coming back :)",1,,
24,Jenna C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,54,0,3.0,10/22/2017,"The food was decent and the service was okay, but the prices definitely were not worth it. I probably wouldn't come back here until either the service and food are much better or the prices are much lower.",,,
25,Jane S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,21,1,1.0,9/27/2016,A diner that can't make a BLT. Sad says I. White hard tomato. Wimpy awful lettuce. Tasteless coleslaw. No service. Stick to breakfast and keep it simple. XOXOXO,,,
26,Melissa G.,"Harrison, NY",1,18,1,2.0,9/19/2017,"I very rarely write reviews, unless the place is absolutely amazing or absolutely disgusting. I think from the stars you know where this one is going... I never get too crazy in diners, I stick to eggs/omelettes.. who can really mess that up? Well, Moonstruck can. I asked for the potatoes well done & asked specifically if the English muffins were Thomas. He said yes, the small ones. Food comes out. My omelette was so well done it was brown. Like crispy from the grill. Soooo dry. I had to add ketchup to get it down. Potatoes were not well done, but in fact UNDERCOOKED. I'm greedy, so decided to try to eat them anyway. There was something crunchy in them that tasted like sand. I still tried another one because once again, I'm greedy. Same thing! I didn't attempt a third bite. English muffin was the cheap large ones. My spoon was dirty, which I used the handle of to stir my tea (I'm not a complainer). Obviously some people like this place, so find out what day & time they came & order what they got. Best of luck to you.",,,
27,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",946,751,3018,3.0,2/6/2015,"I used to be a regular at Moonstruck's Murray Hill location because it was always a lot of food at decent prices, and I LOVED the massive salads.  When I moved uptown and there was a Moonstruck nearby, I knew I had to try it...but it was a bit of a disappointment.My friend and I ordered delivery from Seamless and we both wanted the same roasted vegetable salad with chicken, but each with slight modifications (I wanted extra eggplant, she wanted to request no peppers).  What kind of salad order on Seamless doesn't offer an ""add grilled chicken"" option?  Baffling, I know, so when I wanted to write the special instructions I made it very clear to them to add the chicken and then adjust my total to reflect the added protein.  Within minutes of placing my order they called me to tell me my order was incorrect and I explained the situation (though I already made it very clear in my directions but whatever, I'd rather get the RIGHT order than have to deal with hunger-induced anger if it arrives at my door all wrong).  They told me they couldn't accept the charge on Seamless to adjust it, so they were recharging me for the whole thing.  Fine, here's my credit card because I'm ordering food like they did in this city circa the mid 1990s.Anyway, after that fiasco, the food arrived almost an hour later (it was a Friday night) and yes, the salads were done correctly, but WHERE IS THE BREAD?  Nope, none in sight.  No pita for dipping to soak up the juices, and two very sad, hungry girls lingering amidst Midtown East.The salad was fine, though I like the ones from the Murray Hill location better, but SHEESH what a headache to get dinner!",1,,
28,Haley S.,"Surfside Beach, SC",0,18,17,5.0,3/18/2017,Order delivery from moonstruck often ...as we live nearby. Never had an issue with delivery or food!,,,
29,Carina P.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",674,377,382,3.0,11/17/2015,"Food good service good but they don't think about logical things- for instance yesterday my Greek salad had no red onion in it and they served it to me with balsamic. I had to ask for white sauce for the pita and had to request oil and red wine vinegar to dress it with. Today I ordered matza ball soup which came w no chicken and no veggies just broth and balls. Last week I got French onion though and it was awesome ! Their fries are awesome too. I recommend it for lunch , but again... Some things just are a little ""off"" so be specific about what you want. Still tastes amazing tho and quick and friendly service !",1,1,
30,Desirée E.,"Manhattan, NY",15,9,0,5.0,5/21/2016,"The place has probably one of the best breakfast specials in town, if you happen to be near or even thinking about going (on a weekday!) you really want to go.On weekdays, before 11am, they serve a breakfast special with your choice of omelette/pancake etc, including free coffea/tea and juice. Had the california omelette which tasted like a piece of heaven, try it! Dont let the interior stop you from going there, although it has a feeling of a truck stop, it is really one of the best breakfasts I have had in town.",,,
31,Danette C.,"Manhattan, NY",101,72,106,3.0,10/13/2015,"A solid 3 stars.  I came in here as my normal go-to diner seemingly changed it's food distributor (downgraded, unfortunately) so I have been looking for a new go-to.  This place is conveniently located on 58th and 2nd and decorated uniquely for a diner - very modern.. thus the name Moonstruck (looks as if it was inspired by a space ship..).  Upon arrival we were promptly seated in a booth.  I noticed the booths were made of cloth, which personally did not appeal to me for hygienic reasons. The crowd was a bit unusual for a diner - much younger, a little more hip, and music that sounded similar to what Z100 would play was on.  However, this shouldn't be that surprising as it's not decorated like a typical diner.  Our waiter was very quick to ask us what we wanted to order.  I had an omelette with home fries a side of toast and coffee.  The omelette and toast was good, the coffee was sub-par, but the home fries (really hash browns) were flavorless and seemingly came straight from out of a frozen package.Overall, satisfying but I wouldn't run back.",1,,
32,Ethan A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,3.0,6/27/2017,"Hate to do this because I really like their food.  But I used the delivery service that they prefer you to use rather than Seamless (orders.9fold.me) -- don't use that one.  After an hour, I called the restaurant to find out where my food was.  The guy told me it just came over . . . wait for it . . . the fax machine.  Really!!?? I order online so they can send it to the restaurant via FAX MACHINE!!??  Very disappointing - the guy who answered the phone told me I should call his boss in the morning.  Maybe he'll get the email I sent him.  Won't use 9fold again.  Not worth waiting - 75 minutes now.",,,

38,Steph C.,"King of Prussia, PA",5,43,9,2.0,12/19/2014,"Had breakfast at Moonstruck around 9 am on a Thursday. The diner was half full at best when we walked in and during the duration of the time we were seated. The host was very friendly and the bus boy/ water filler was over with glasses of water almost immediately when we sat down. The good service stops at those two. We waited seven minutes to be approached by our waiter and even continued to wait after I made awkward eye contact with other members of the staff.  When our server finally does show up we ordered our entire meal: three orders of specialty pancakes, two sides of bacon, a side of turkey sausage, and home fries. The food didn't take too long to come out but everything was just mediocre at best.  The bacon was thick cut and had good flavor but was too soggy and the sausage had obviously been fried instead of grilled. The home fries never appeared and we didn't see our server with any type of consistency to make him aware that we never received them until we were almost done eating. They made their way on to the bill, but was taken off once pointed out. All in all service left some to be desired and the food sufficed in filling my stomach. Sit down breakfast options are limited in this portion of the city so I would probably return.",2,,

We were seated immediately and didn't have to wait long for our server to come take our order. However the turning point of our meal was when the server gave us a pitcher of water that had a dead fly inside. Absolutely grotesque and completely unacceptable. In order to elevate your establishment to an elite level, you need to avoid basic mistakes such as this one. The food we ordered was a tad overpriced to say the least ($7 for just two eggs!!??). But the quality of the food was decent and portions were more than enough. Obviously not the best diner in the Big Apple but worth a trip every fortnight or so.",,,

I ordered scrambled eggs (excellent- creamy and prepared just right), bacon, and a bagel. Love the bagels. Ordered some to take home. My breakfast was filling. My friend had an omelet and enjoyed it.

Then when they took my order, they just gave me the receipt and left without saying anything.I ended up ordering a grilled vegetable salad to-go, which smelled a lot like a hot Chipotle bowl! It's probably the roasted peppers and onions, mmm. The vegetables tasted nearly as good as they smelled. Portions are decent, which explains the pricing. Not that the prices are outrageous, but there were definitely some items like $15 salads that I did not think were worth it especially for lunch... Easy solution: just avoid those!",1,,

Updated review","We went here around August 2012 t to use a restaurant.com certificate. Our waitress was great but the problems began as soon as we sat down. Wifey takes a big sip of her water to see brown funk in the bottom of the glass. Not a spot, but about the size of a quarter with floaty pieces in the water. Should have left then but wifey was hungry.  As she's eating her spinach pie she pulls a hard piece out of her mouth & it is a piece of GLASS the size of a finger nail (not the size of a nail clipping, the size of a whole nail).",1,,

The milkshakes can either be nice and thick or arrive totally melted and watery. Same with the mac and cheese, it'll either be very creamy, totally burnt or just have no flavor whatsoever.

89,Tammy L.,"Astoria, NY",280,231,0,1.0,9/27/2012,"I had a terrible meal here with friends. There was a large group of us eating before an event. There were a group of 10 of us, so I called ahead. Since we were getting there at 6pm on a Tuesday night, I was told it shouldn't be a problem. The woman I talked to said that she would let whoever worked the next day to set up the table for us before we got there even though they didn't take reservations. We got there, and the table wasn't set up. Not a big deal, because they fixed it for us in about 2 mins. Things started out normally, our drink orders were taken, and we received them pretty quickly. But that's when things started to go awry. We ordered our food and waited. And waited. And waited. At 6:40 when no one had received their salads or soups and we had somewhere to be at 7:15, I finally asked the waitress for them. She told me that they'd be out in a second. Then she proceeded to bring out soups one at a time while we waited. So it took about 6 minutes to deliver 5 hot soups. And then we finally got our salads as well. Then we waited some more. Our food came around 7, but some of it was really cold. One of my friends ordered pancakes, but they failed to bring her butter or syrup. After she asked for the 3rd time, she had to ask a different staff member who wandered by for them. She told him that she'd like to eat her food before it was cold. One of my friends ordered a gyro, and it came without tzatziki sauce. She asked for some, and she was given a thick, mayonnaise like container. When she told them that this was tartar, not tzatiki, they INSISTED that it was tzatziki and that this was what they always gave customers who asked for it. At that point, the waitress suggested she used the watered down balsamic or blue cheese that was already on the table instead of providing the real tzatziki. I ordered chicken parm and it was HORRIBLE. The sauce was really bitter. I've never had trouble finishing it. There were so many problems, I can't even explain them all. One of our favorites that made us laugh, was that about 20 mins after we ordered, the waitress came out of the kitchen to tell us that they couldn't make baked ziti. Yes, they had pasta. Yes, they had sauce. Yes, they had mozzarella cheese. But no, they could not make ziti. So she asked for pasta with sauce and cheese melted on it. We figure that they must make their ziti and freeze it and just pop it in the oven when someone wants it, and they were out of the pre-made variety. It was so strange! We also were told from one server that she'd bring us soda cans because the soda fountain was acting up, and then someone else brought us soda refills from the fountain. Just error after error. Anyway, I will NEVER go back to this diner. DISGUSTING food, awful service.  Don't do it!",2,,2

96,Heather M.,"Olympia, WA",27,326,75,1.0,1/8/2014,"The only thing that saved this place from a zero-star rating was a very friendly/helpful waitress at the end of a very frustrating situation. My friends and I ended up here after having no luck in our attempt to find another breakfast joint that was supposed to be in the same area. Upon walking in, we waited about 15 minutes for a table since it's a small place and it was around the breakfast rush (no big deal, we weren't in a hurry). However, what occurred after that was unacceptable. After looking at their extensive menu, I ended ordering a veggie omelet sans cheese with egg whites only (I needed something healthy after three days in NYC). When my omelet arrived, however, it clearly was made with whole eggs. When I brought this up to our waiter, he shrugged it off and walked away (WHAT?!). I quickly called him back and pointed out how the omelet was yellow, not white. He sort of looked at me and then went over to speak with the cook. He came back a few minutes later and said that the cook said it was made with egg whites only. He then went to walk away again! I stopped him, AGAIN, and asked why the omelet was yellow if it only had eggWHITES?! At this point my companions chimed in that it clearly was made with whole eggs. I then asked if I could get it remade (egg white only this time). The waiter said they didn't do that, and WALKED away again!! Needless to say i was frustrated, so I called over a waitress who was passing by. I explained to her the situation... she took one look at the omelet, rolled her eyes, and exclaimed that this happens ALL the time (I think she was venting). She then apologized and took the plate back to the kitchen... when she returned, she said she was having the cook make another one and she put a rush on it (since by then everyone else at my table was finished with their meal). A few minutes later I had a new piping hot omelet in front of me that clearly was made with only egg whites. I was so excited that I dove right in... until about halfway through when I found a three inch black hair (not a pube thank goodness). Needless to say, I immediately pushed my plate away, instantly losing my appetite. Now, I can't say it was done deliberately, but I'm pretty sure it was. I probably should have complained, but by that time I was so over it that I just paid my tab and walked out. Never again!!",2,,

99,Jen G.,"New York, NY",36,188,0,1.0,2/27/2012,"This was my 2nd (and last) visit to this moonstruck. I had been here for brunch a few years ago and it was okay, but yesterday was terrible. I ordered eggs benedict with hollandaise on the side (for calorie concious purposes) and salad instead of hash browns. Well, I've never been so happy I ordered something on the side before because whatever was in the bowl of ""hollandaise"" was so disgusting looking I almost vomited. It was the color of nacho cheese and full of lumps. I also never got any type of salad dressing, which every other moonstruck brings out automatically, so it took me until everyone was almost done to catch our waiter and ask for it. Noone else at the table seemed impressed with what they ordered, either. I love the moonstruck on 3rd Ave and the one on Madison is pretty good, too. I suggest the owners of moonstruck consider some changes at this location as I'd hate to see it ruin the reputaion of their good locations!.",1,,
100,Erni V.,"Miami, FL",535,69,15,3.0,8/27/2012,"OK this will be a simple review, i grew up on Greek diners, i love Greek diners and i miss Greek diners when i'm not in NYC. I will review Greek diners by their Spanakopita, spinach pie because its not expensive and should be fairly easy to make. Moonstruck has the best priced spinach pie and it was tasty but im pretty sure it was made days before i ordered iti think if you caught this pie right out the oven it would be a phyllo treat because it was very tasty, good flavors from the spinach and the feta cheese but the pastry was hard and stiff, either way still better than other meals i have had in the UES. Whole foods just opened and as the ads all around town say, ""this changes everything"" i hope not. i would miss the diners if they bent to the will of the giant and ""changed"" the way they do things! bottomless coffee, great burgers, endless menus(where do they even store all that fish) and consistantly good Greek food is a staple of NYC!",,,

Updated review","Fine.... like 2 years later we finally get over our trauma and decide to order food from them (I don't even remember whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner). They got the smoothies right  and those had ice cream in them so I'm assuming the milkshake was the freakiest of freak accidents to occur. I still never think to order from them first and they're so close I wish I could.",,,
102,Stephen T.,"Manhattan, NY",61,8,0,1.0,10/22/2011,Don't try to redeem the Yelp offer because they say you have to print it even though the offer says you only have to show. It's a total scam and service is bad with mediocre food - that a million diners in NYC serve. Complete failure all the way around. Only redeeming quality was nice host and cheesy 80s on the radio.,2,,

So one morning when my friend and I were just heading home from a night out, and starving, we walked by this place and originally just went there because it was one of the few places open at 6:30am on a Saturday morning. They have a pretty big menu, and the prices are decent, not super cheap, but not unreasonable.I had an omlette with tomatoes, mushrooms, avocado, and cheese and it was delicious!! The ingredients seemed fresh too. My friend ordered some other breakfast dish and we share our homefries and french fries and both were really good. Wide selection, good food, and open 24 hours, yes!Also I liked the location and it has big windows great for people watching.",,,

You can do a lot better in the 'hood (Madison, Morning Star, Ritz, Hamilton...heck at the Plaza across the street at least the people are nice). And you won't feel like you just underwent a colonoscopy when you get the check. Can I be clearer than this? AVOID THE MOONSTRUCK DINER BECAUSE IT SUCKS HARD.",2,,

Tough decision with the variety.I ended up with their turkey burger. Quite good! Pretty standard diner fare, but good-sized portions and outstanding service. I have to say, I think my server there was probably the most attentive one I've ever had, save a very very pricey restaurant where such service should be a no-brainer.

115,MW H.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,2/12/2013,"ZERO stars for this establishment. After searching forever for a place that could satisfy my afternoon eggs benedict craving, i landed at Moonstruck. Once I walked in, I noticed an unpleasant odor (think raid/rodent repellent). Unfortunately I suppressed my gut instinct which told me to flee and instead placed my order. As expected, my gut was right and the food was terrible - the eggs Benedict that id dreamed of all morning would've been tastier if it were cardboard. And to top things off, they refused to accept my 20% off Yelp coupon. When the waiter asked the manager to come speak with us, we could hear him screaming in the back that he would not come out. We were the only patrons in there at the time. Terrible food, service, atmosphere. Avoid at all cost!",1,,

I had the pastrami sandwich and my wife had the open face corned beef. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality and big portions. This place is not what we would call a diner out in Seattle.

I've been here for brunch twice in the past month and then again for dinner last night. I'm partial to the turkey burger deluxe, with my only complaint being that there are always TOO many french fries. I also highly recommend the french toast, and the pizza burger. The next thing I'm dying to try is the chicken fingers...a diner staple that is actually very difficult to get right. I want to see how well my favorite diner handles the breaded chicken strips! Mostly I love this place because of it's location on 58th St. and 2nd Ave. It's never too busy, but never empty either. It's the kind of place you can bring friends for a quick bite, or a place where you can go on the weekend for some eggs and bacon while you read the Sunday paper. The decor is fabulous...a very modern style with lots of silver metal booths and psychedelic tiles on the walls and table tops. Going to the Moonstruck Diner is always fun!",5,,3

Several tables inside give you a direct view of the bus stop so you can grab your food and head across the street to the bus.The great diner food here almost qualifies it for its own trip from Astoria! The burger menu is very good and the toasted buns just about stand up to their greasy goodness quite well.

Updated review","Okay, so now I'm going on three weeks here in the city and moonstruck is 1/2 a block from my door: I have to eat there sometimes. But, lo and behold this past visit (two days ago) for a late breakfast at 11:30 AM was flawless--if such a word ever applied to a diner. In truth, compared to what I've experienced thus far, almost anything would be flawless here, but to be honest, there wasn't a hitch, and i suppose, based on the standards I've been experiencing thus far throughout the city, that's par for the course. This time we had a new, fresh-faced waiter who was attentive, polite, and only needed to be asked to refill our drinks a couple of times and to take our money, outside of that, what do you expect? I had my infamous cheese omelette and it actually had meted cheese inside this time, not under the eggs and on top of the plate! The potatoes were fine, and the toast was perfect. I do not like the sausage here. It is deep fried I think and from some creature or cut I am unaware of, and while it is uniform and always perfect in size and texture, it has no flavor. Makes me thinks of Soylent Green! Our Polish friend now looks at me with suspicion. I blew it there but perhaps she'll come around. The short waiter with the rooster hairdo and I have been bonding over women's soccer. He's not a bad chap. All in all a visit that went without incident, which is much needed as we were counting on this place to be a staple for us.",,,1
