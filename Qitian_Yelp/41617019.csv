The theater is not huge and they actually oversold the show so people were sitting on the stairs, on the stage and other places that they could find for people to sit. When you come inside they have a small queue line and they have two people who take and scan your tickets. If you have your tickets on your phone that is not an issue at all. They can scan right off your phone. They do not check Id's which is kinda interesting. After they scan your tickets you go into a large auditorium and have a seat. I would suggest leaving a coat on a seat or having someone save your seat before going to the bar. They have a small bar outside the theater that sells beer and wine. I did not see hard liquor.  The beers were not too expensive.  The show was good. It was about 2 hours long with a short 10 minute intermission.  I would for sure go back to see more impromptu comedy!",4,,5
1,Mimi M.,"New York, NY",6,92,4,1.0,9/20/2018,"There are really no words for how horrible the improv folks are at this place.  To sum it all up, the early evening show seams to be chock full of amateurs - the worst of the worst... like baaaad!  What makes it out of this world horrible is that most of the audience is filled with students and friends who give pity laughs.  The entire show people were laughing crazy hard at basically nothing...  laughing as if they're watching Jerry Seinfeld or something... laugh track city.  Dude, it was the twilight zone, you have to be there to understand.  I wouldn't suggest this travesty to my worst enemy.  Please give these people a script because improv is not working for them and they wouldn't know that because their friends hype them up.  These people need to know how bad they are so they get better... Coddling them only harms their growth. UGH, horrible experience.My friends were excited that I was attending this and they all said ""let me know how it was, I want to go with you next time!""  Friends... there will not be a next time!",,,
2,Willson P.,"New York, NY",409,159,1274,4.0,2/17/2018,"UCB is a  comedy club recently open a new brunch in east village nyc. Basically in alphabet city but could be considered east village since it's on Ave A.They have two brunches in LA and 2 brunches in New York City . One is in Hell's Kitchen and the other one recently opened in East Village. In LA they do have comedy classes but I am not sure if they have classes in New York. They do have a great shows listed on the Black board:) especially the one that the junior students do is great. Called new team Harold . Cost $7 and enjoy your moment with the UCB students . See those students act professional when they play the show . And keep laughing while the perform great comedy. Every night they schedule the show what is playing and how much it cost and what time on their website (east.ucbtheatre.com.  Can check it out if you like to If you are early, no worries! They have a drink room when you entered, hot and cold drinks available while you wait for your comedy show. Most shows under $12  some or them $7 some of them $9 which is very reasonable for a comedy show",1,,2
3,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,5.0,7/10/2018,"Your NYC native experience isn't complete until you've checked off 'attended an improv show' on your list and UCB (Upright Citizens Brigade) is the perfect place to do that. Considering how many comedic geniuses (i.e. Kate McKinnon, Seth Meyers, Bobby Moynihan, Amy Poehler and Donald Glover) that have passed through these doors, you are bound to enjoy yourself at any of the shows they host. I had a chance to see The Astronomy Club's ""Let's Talk About Race, Baby!"" show and it was fantastic. All the performers were sharp and quick-witted, naturally, but what was most striking was their authenticity and how they took something as serious as race in America - and often times uncomfortable to talk about with others - and made it enjoyable and relatable, while having empathy for a diverse audience. I look forward to seeing many more shows in the future.",1,,
4,Jon R.,"Portland, OR",351,2,0,5.0,8/20/2018,The show was $9. Idk about the food/drink offerings but each comic was entertaining at worst.,,,
5,Dustin P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,4/13/2018,"This is one of my favorite places in the city! I've taken classes, seen shows, met some good acquaintances...I should go there more:) And I go A LOT!",,,
