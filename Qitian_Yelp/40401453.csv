0,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",357,80,43,4.0,9/19/2018,"Usually pretty loud and crowded, but the happy hour prices are great! When beer is half off, you're only paying $3.50, and you can get well drinks for $4. There are TVs everywhere and usually music is blasting, it's got a sort of sticky frat house vibe to it, but again, worth it for the happy hour.",,,
1,William G.,"Torrance, CA",2570,1691,3976,5.0,9/10/2018,"I came here for happy hour with classmates. As we were descending into the hard life of a medical student, we intended to make it a night to remember.This place was picked as our happy hour congregation. The bar is decently sized, with plenty of room in the bar area up front, as well as toward the back (which has beer pong tables). There is also a reception room downstairs open to rent, but we didn't rent it this time around.The bar is clean, and got a good amount of foot traffic while we were there. The prices for the drinks were decent, and the drinks came out strong.The staff was friendly, as were the locals here. I had some nice conversations with non-classmates as well.This place allowed us a great night out, and was walking distance to many great eateries in the area.Kudos!",23,11,19
2,Craig S.,"Manhattan, NY",158,33,1,1.0,9/6/2018,"I arrived at Jake's yesterday at approximately 3pm with my dog, and we grab a table outside under the window. It's important to not that there was not a single other person sitting outside. I go inside with a collapsible water bowl and ask the bartender to fill it up for my dog. I order a beer and give the bartender my credit card AND my drivers license. NOTE: Bartender stated that there was no table service outside - too early and nobody to do it. I return to my dog (a 13 year old 55 bound mix), and enjoy my first beer. A gentlemen arrives about 15 minutes later and sits at the table immediately besides my table, and we begin to chat. He immediately takes a liking to my dog, and we enjoy each other's company. A few others arrive and sit on the other side of the door in the outdoor seating section. We're there about an hour, and 4 or 5 beers later between myself and my new friend from Scotland, when an employee of Jake's Dilemma comes outside and approaches me. He smiles and asks, ""what kind of a dog is that?"" I tell him that the dog is a mix. He then says that dogs are not allowed in the outside patio. Stunned (because 99% of bars in the neighborhood have absolutely no issue with it), I ask the man why? He says its their policy. Fair enough. I ask him the obvious question, ""why did it matter what kind of dog he is"", to which he begins nervously stammering about Service Animals only. I point out that it's perfectly legal for dogs to sit in the outdoor cafe portions, but I also acknowledge that it is the businesses right to choose not to allow it. This situation begs a few questions - namely, why did the bartender fill up a dog bowl and give it to me if dogs aren't allowed? Why did it take an hour to come out and make us leave? The dog was a perfect gentleman, sitting quietly by my side, so why after 5 drinks and over an hours time did this suddenly become an issue? Particularly in light of the FACT that nobody outside complained, and in fact aside from my new friend, probably didn't even notice the dog was there? To non dog people, you've probably stopped reading, but I am a dog person, and this is simply comical. I had no problem honestly as the bars on Amsterdam Avenue are plentiful, and actually have servers come out and serve you, instead of requiring you go inside to get your beverage. I go in and pay my tab, and as I come back out, the Scottish gentlemen is also getting ready to leave. I ask him why, and he says because the guy that came out and had me leave was a 'c&nt"", and he didn't want to give them his business! He ended up joining me a block up at Dead Poet! So, to Jake's Dilemma, I say, ""fare thee well"". I, my family, my friends and co-workers will certainly never return while this policy is in place. Lots of options especially if I want to drink with underage girls in a Frat House environment. Can't wait for Frank Macs to open across the street!",2,,
3,Caroline Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",92,66,17,4.0,10/19/2018,"Jakes Dilemma would probably have to be my favorite out of its sibling companies. The tables out front are perfect when you're grabbing a beer with your friends on a nice sunny day! The happy hour deals are great, and I would definitely recommend getting a ton of appetizers too. The only problem I have ever here is with an overly aggressive bouncer who never fails to make at least three of my friends pull out second and THIRD forms of ID whenever we go here. Cmon dude",,,
4,Carlos C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",16,26,39,4.0,7/23/2018,"Great place to come and have a drink anyday of the week. Everyday they have a drink special corresponding with the day.

6,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,3.0,4/16/2018,"We all know drinking games, bro-ing out, and America, generally, are mutually inclusive, and Jake has no dilemma creating the frat house chat-house to offer all these things. Beer pong, pool, foosball tables, two video games, fifteen beers on draft, and fifty types of bottled beers from across the country fill this enormous space. The 3-8pm everyday half-price happy hour makes it economical for all the youths out there. For a bro-y sports bar, this is the ultimate. There is also a back room with no TVs for just hanging and talking, although the noise from the front can be heard if there's a game on. They also have daily drink specials, such as below: $2 Domestic Mugs $10 Domestic Pitchers$4 ShotsI'm past my beer pong days (although I may drop in here for some World Cup games), but if you're looking to party, drink, and get gritty, the only dilemmas you'll face are which beer to drink and which game to play.",9,9,9

She happily suggested me the new Sam Adams seasonal beer once she had an idea of the beer I like- the beer had the right amount of flavor, hops, malt and warm undertones. Thank you Maguire for a wonderful Saturday! Go 'Cuse!",,,
8,Slippin' J.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",0,19,16,4.0,3/3/2018,"I enjoy coming to Jake's to throw a game or two of Beirut.  What I don't enjoy is those with inferior education calling it ""beer pong"".  Have a little respect and remember the Lebanese Civil War people. This afternoon my partner and I were waiting to get on a table when a burly, beastly man, who I think worked on he broadway play Hamilton, kept yelling about D3 hockey. When we played him, he refused to re-group the cups to the traditional diamond shape when the cups were down to 4. During the final shot, he kept removing his balls in an effort to distract me. I offered redemption to both after they lost, but they kept calling for a ""do-over"" bc he didn't recognize blowing on a shot he missed after the first re-rack. He used the fastball technique instead of the more elegant arch throw. Don't expect these kids to be at this year's WSOBP.",,1,
9,Danielle L.,"New York, NY",268,7,1,3.0,10/2/2018,"Pretty good go-to bar that always has the best happy hour deals (especially if you're looking for a weekend drink-deal). The food is standard, and sometimes comes out a little less than hot because they bring the food up from a down-stairs kitchen, but its still satisfying for a mid-drink snack. Will definitely return, just not when you're looking for a top of the line meal. Great for sports or just hanging out.",,,
10,Gina Q.,"Staten Island, NY",161,31,22,5.0,8/2/2018,"First and foremost, I have to say that not only is this place super fun, with great food, but their staff is amazing! Bekim went above and beyond to help me out when I asked for suggestions regarding food and beer. Not only was I satisfied, but I was super impressed with how knowledgeable he was in his recommendations. I would definitely recommend this as a great spot to have some drinks with friends and enjoy some awesome food. Ask for Bekim, you won't be disappointed!!",,,
11,Sarah G.,"Jersey City, NJ",107,142,26,3.0,1/29/2018,"Decent bar. I can only really review it based on my experience drinking beer there --but it was comfortable and inviting at 1pm on a Sunday. My date and I stopped there as one of our first places to go barhopping and it was a great first choice. It was quiet and easy to carry a conversation. I will admit that I wish they had a bigger beer selection. I had a good winter ale while I was there, but I felt forced to have the same thing for my second drink because there wasn't a whole lot of variety. For the most part, this is a pretty solid bar if you like a chill atmosphere. I don't know what this place is like later in the evening (on a Friday or Saturday--you know, when people actually go out.) If I ever get back here, I'll update my review with a more extensive perspective.",,,

The bartender was on top of our section of the bar for refills. There are quite a few TVs in the bar for sports games. And the bar played the college PSU football game for us no problem on the TV closest to us. There is also some outdoor seating areas but no TVs outside.",,,
16,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,120,201,2.0,7/28/2017,Nothing special about this bar. Drinks are not expensive but they also are not strong at all. Went for a friend's birthday on a Friday night. Ordered a few drinks but they were not strong. Good open space and solid music but that's about all there is to it. They also have some space set aside for beer pong.,,,

21,Sean M.,"Jacksonville, FL",240,505,267,3.0,1/22/2017,"I came in this afternoon for football and a late lunch and overall I had a good experience. First off, the service was the highlight here. My friend who is a regular knew the two waitresses helping us and do we got great service and the ladies we're both really helpful.Food was good, not great but certainly better than average bar food overall. My wife and I both had cheeseburgers. She created her own, I had the Texas burger and both were well cooked and good. The only issue I had was the patty tasted like it was likely either previously frozen or just not terribly fresh. With the cheese, BBQ sauce and bacon that wasn't noticeable so I ate the whole thing. The sweet potato tater tots were also tasty.We came here for football and I experienced something I never had before at a sports bar. They played music (pop type stuff, yuck!) over the commercials and then turned it off once the game came back on. That was odd and frankly annoying. The place was clean, the service was very good and the prices weren't awful either.",3,,3
22,Harvey L.,"Little Neck, NY",5,15,7,1.0,7/26/2017,"A party of 6 of us wanted to sit outside here and we were approached by the bouncer who claimed to be the manager. We presented identification for our service dog, and the vest but he claims it is not allowed. This is against the rules of the Association of Disabled Americans, and the rude manager gave no real justification except that he doesn't consider my dog a service dog. This place and manager will be reported to the ADA. I hope this review shows what a poor judge of character this place employs.",3,,

Food is great, also pricey though. They play every football game but not every basketball game. On sundays during football season, it gets packed, no seats available, so arrive before the game starts. Food will take a long while if the place is packed but on average, it come out quick.

I got my drinks from the bar and sat outside. the security was friendly and the people working behind the bar are cool.

27,Meredith A.,"New York, NY",4,14,25,4.0,4/14/2018,"If you're looking for an upscale establishment to sit down and have a quiet meal, this is not the place. There are plenty of spots on the UWS for that. However, if you're looking for a loud, fun atmosphere with cheap beers and great bar food, this is your place. They have great happy hour specials every day. Gets a little crazy on Friday/Saturday nights and the crowd is definitely younger. Probably the best place on the UWS to watch football on Sunday, as they have enough TVs to show every game.",,,
28,Carlos G.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,30,1,5.0,8/20/2017,"Please take me back so that I can re-play the night and find out what happened and how!Visiting NY looking for a dope bar to have a drink. We went in to and looked passed few bars, including The Dead Poet.. they were all blah. Then I spotted this place grabbed a pitcher of Modelo for 22 bucks and sat outside with the gf to people watch a little bit, didn't have any intentions of getting white girl wasted. Fast-forward to waking up thirsty on the wooden floor of my Washington heights Air BnB, the whole night was a complete blur. I just remember meeting a lot of people, played a little bit of beer pong and even smoked a cigar ( I had burn marks to remind me of that.)Well if I offended anyone or was out of line at any point and if you are reading this, I am so sorry!This will probably be the best night I will never remember!",,1,
29,Emily W.,"New York, NY",215,98,80,5.0,8/26/2017,"I've been to Jake's Dilemma twice now, and it's probably one of my favorite bars in the city! The drinks are good and not watered down, and also not ridiculous expensive. I got a moscow mule for like $10 here, which is quite a steal in NY. The music here has always been good. The thing I like the most about this bar is that there's something for everyone to do, no matter what people like doing when they go out. There's the bar area were people can socialize, and there's a more open space towards the back closer to the DJ where people can dance. Also, there are beer pong tables if you want to relive your college days. I'm definitely bringing any friends from out of town here!",,,
30,Raffael S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",23,2,0,5.0,8/5/2018,Absolutely great for the price. Had some beer for $3.5 a pint and we shared some nachos with pulled pork and guac. Those nachos were fantastic.,,,

I've been to many bars on the city and there isn't much that makes this bar special.I came in here on a Friday night and it was relatively busy, they have a very large space which is definitely a positive. They also had 2 beer pong tables in the back which was very cool, because that's another thing that will being a crowd. The Main reason why I gave this place 3 stars is not because it's horrible, it's just nothing special. The drink prices are decently cheap but not cheap enough that I would say you HAVE to go there. This is definitely an after party type spot that I would recommend going to after your Friday night move for some relatively cheap drinks and cool vibes.",,1,

Jake's has the beer pong game on lock--which is a strange thing for a 27-year-old woman to note. As our pub crawl brought us there, we were in a great mood and really feeling good about the fact that we were in our final 3; we made it uptown!  The highlight of the night was meeting a new group of friends, including this guy who will henceforth be known as ""baby"" because he proceeded to text me multiple times referring to me as ""baby."" That is kind of the biggest turn-off in the world to me, but I know people are into not being called their actual name, so eh. So why was meeting them the best part? They let me have some of their fries which were DELICIOUS.Actually, the best part was when this real Eric Trump looking dude was chatting up my friend, Sam M. I said excuse me so I could get to the bar, and I ordered drink and he was blown away. He was like OMG HOW DID YOU GET DRINKS IVE BEEN TRYING FOR TEN MINUTES.

Everything was fine in the beginning and later towards the night we decided to play with water (for sanitary purposes as well as the fact that we had beers on the side). A security guard randomly came up to our table and said we had to play with beer in the cups even though we had purchased drafts on the side AND had already bought about 4 pitchers. We explained that we were using water for sanitary purposes and he said it didn't matter and that it was a house rule -- we asked to speak to the manager and he was rude and said we couldn't play with water in the cups, again, despite the fact that we HAD DRAFTS ON THE SIDE.

Just average at best in my humble opinion.",2,,

59,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,7/27/2015,"Ehhhh I guess it's about time to review this place. I'm so not a fan of this collection of bro-tastic joints. I've been to most of the them - Gin Mill (the only great one of the bunch), 13th Step, Stumble Inn, Down the Hatch - they're all the same. Awesome venues to watch a game at (which I still do at Gin Mill and Jake's), but come nighttime, the collared shit-wearing, beer pitcher-wielding species of man emerges in astounding numbers. My issue with Jake's Dilemma is that while bros are aplenty, they're all so consumed with their beer pong that they rarely mingle. So even when a girlfriend convinces me to visit a ""bro-y"" bar, the chances of actually striking up a conversation with one of these guys is slim - at least in my experience. Unless you decide you would like to join a beer pong game and meet people that way - which, admittedly, I have not tried. Things I do like about Jake's Dilemma:-The space itself. One nice thing about this group of bars is that they do a decent job at accommodating large parties. There's a spacious area in front where the potential of mingling does at least exist, and a raised back area that is - for all intents and purposes - reserved for beer pong. I know I'm getting stuck on this beer pong thing - it's not ALWAYS a part of the Jake's experience. But on a Friday or Saturday night, it's a good bet. -The drink specials. Cheap drinks (great), great specials (even better). Another great feature of this bar consortium of sorts is that not only are the drinks cheap, but they have a special of some sort basically every night. All sports bars should really adopt this model. -Location. There aren't too many spots worth checking out on the UWS, which is where I happen to live as someone in her 20s (I ask myself why this is often). This strip of bars on Amsterdam (and a couple on Columbus) are the only spots I'll go to for drinks (excluding wine - plenty of great wine bars around).",1,1,1

75,Ashley G.,"Shavertown, PA",22,32,9,1.0,3/24/2018,"Came here on St Patrick's day for the last time but had been here quite a few times prior. The drinks are cheap and it has a college vibe. However, the last time we came we wanted to play pong. They gave us water cooler cups which was whatever but charged us $16 for them? That's never happened before. On top of that we bought the pitcher of beer that you ""have to buy in order to play"" and asked for a pitcher of water on the side to fill the cups up with. Sorry but we're not pouring the beer in the pong cups and drinking it out of them once the ball has been rolling on the floor. Super unsanitary and gross. He told us we each had to get individualized glasses of water to pour in there. Again, annoying but whatever. We pour the water in the cups and are drinking our pitcher of beer on the side as well while playing. A bus boy came over to the pong table and approached my friend asked for $10 ""not to tell that we were using water"" or something sexual instead of the $$. WHAT. So we went to the bartender who said it was fine to put water in the cups as long as we drank the pitcher on the side. This guy kept coming over & getting creepier and creepier. Finally my friend told him to stop coming over and do his actual job. He went to his manager and said we had cursed him out. Never happened. The manager came over who KNOWS US and said my two friends had to leave and that he'll tell his employees what their job is. The creepy guy then grabbed all of our cups that we paid for and took them. We gave the beer pitcher to another table and wished them luck. I get it was St. Patty's day and all & maybe this employee had been drinking during the day as well, but interacting with clients in a creepy sexual way is completely inappropriately and to get kicked out once you stand up for yourself? Not cool in this day of age. Won't be back, ever.",,,

Updated review","I recently was looking through my old reviews and realized that in my cheapskate grad school days, I had gotten way too enthusiastic and given Jake's a 5-star review. I  need to update this now to temper my excitement just a little bit. I still like Jake's, but it's such a college bar. I mean, anywhere that does half-price everything probably is. And that's fine if that's what you're looking for, but you need to know what to expect when you come here. Beer pong. Sticky floors. Big-name beers (think Sierra Nevada and Sam Adams as their extent of ""craft""). Lots of people that were probably in frats/sororities back in the day.But also, cheap drinks. And that's why I keep my review up at 4-stars. When you want a cheap drink (or twelve), this is the place to go. Menu is standard greasy pub fare, but again, it gets the job done when you need it.Don't expect any frills here. This is a bar that will remind you of your undergrad days, in both the best and worst ways. But when that's what you need, Jake's is the place to be.",,,
85,J.C. T.,"McKinney, TX",177,127,86,4.0,6/18/2014,"I went to Jake's after reading good reviews on Yelp and because my brother was hungry so we wanted a place with food. First I will say that this is a ""specials"" bar with tons of drink specials! Everything (with some exceptions) at the bar was half off until 8, so we were drinking beers for $2.50-3.00, can't beat that. There's a different special every day, it seems. Service was good, some things took a bit of time but not because the service was bad, because the bartender was really busy. I didn't catch her name but she was small and blonde and was hustling! It looked like she had the whole bar by herself plus tables and she was working pretty fast. She took our orders from memory and nothing was messed up. I would give the food 5 stars. I ordered the buffalo burger and my brother had the buffalo style fried chicken sandwich and we also shared the wings and everything was on point. Apparently the kitchen is also attached to a restaurant next door, and when the food was taking a little long, the bartender said they were really busy and it would be out soon. It wasn't a problem since we weren't in a hurry, and when it came out it was delicious. Even though it was just bar food, it was fresh and tasty. The bread tasted really good, like it came from a bakery, and the onion rings were light, crispy, and flakey. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and everything was hot. Can't say enough good things about the food, whoever is running the kitchen is doing a great job! I'd definitely say this turns into a younger scene around 8 pm. I noticed they had a doorman around that time and the music got a bit livelier. I'm in my 30s and I prefer a quieter, relaxed vibe, but for the neighborhood and the crowd I'd say it's about right. The feel/appearance of the bar is kind of divey but a clean, well-managed divey, like a bar that knows what they have and markets the hell out of it. Overall pretty fun, cheap beers, and good food. Not exactly my preferred kind of bar but I had a great experience and would definitely go back, especially for happy hour!!",1,,

He had the audacity to falsely accuse my boyfriend and best friend of smoking marijuana in the men's rest room, which was most definitely a lie; my partner is in the military and frequently drug tested at work so he doesn't smoke. He explained this, offered up his military ID and they both offered to be searched as they had nothing on them and weren't doing anything. The bouncers confirmed they didn't smell any marijuana, then the manager changed his story and said they were smoking a vape/hookah... again they didn't have one on them so they offered to be checked.

The monday deal was $1 beers, $3 shots and 1/2 price drinks The waitress had the nerve to ask my friends if she was giving them bad service because one of them had tipped her $3 dollars. She then continued on to be bitchy the rest of the nights and told me the shots were $4 when the menu clearly said $3 and after going back and forth with me she said the menu had fine print stating prices were vary to change WHICH WAS NOT TRUE! I checked that menu and it did not state that whatsoever ! But whatever I let her have that extra dollar. After being fed up with this sucky ass waitress me and my friends decided to stop ordering drinks from her and just getting our drinks from the bar. At the bar this bartender had told a customer to make sure he tips her because the beers were only $1. NOW I UNDERSTAND the drinks are cheap but that is NO excuse for a business like this who has multiple locations to have their employees being rude and unprofessional for tips. I have never experienced this type of service before and I must say I am NEVER coming back here again. If your business is advertising a certain price as an employee you don't have to be too pushy or rude for the tips. Good service comes with a great tip so hopefully those employees learn that.This isn't the only place that has cheap deals so I was astonished at how rude the waitress and bartender were being.

Very packed on Friday and Saturday nights, but has one of the larger bar crowds on the UWS every night of the week.A distinguishing factor, however, are their awesome specials! I'm adding a photo of their handout too, but for the record: Monday: $1 domestic drafts, $9 pitchers. Tuesday: All beer 1/2 price. Wed: $4 everything. Thursday: $13 for bucket of 5 beers. Saturday: $1 beers from 8-9. And every night they do a happy hour from 4-8 with a 1/2 price bar. These drink specials are awesome and are impossible to beat on the UWS. Another note, the servers/bartenders here have always been really nice, which is surprising to find at such a ridiculous and busy bar. They also have limited outdoor seating, which provides a nice escape from the pumping music.",1,1,
99,Pauline P.,"Richmond, TX",861,607,1354,2.0,10/31/2012,"Visited Jake's Dilemma a few times during my 2 month stint in NYC. 1st time: Bouncer would not let my friend in because he was wearing a tank top. Apparently this dive bar thinks they are an upscale bar on Hollywood Blvd 2nd time: Packed to the brim with college students holding a variety of mixers there. 3rd time: 3rd time's a charm. Snagged the beer pong table and a plate of buffalo wings// AMBIANCE // An epic college bar complete with big comfy leather couches, musty bookshelves, arcade games, and beer pong tables. // SERVICE // Decent, especially for a bar. I think the food is cooked elsewhere though (perhaps their sister bar a few doors down) and carried in the front door and brought to your table. Pretty strange.The one big upside to this place is drink specials. Different drink special for everyday of the week guaranteed to get you tipsy",4,3,3

Moments later an incredibly rude bouncer (allegedly the manager) came and said we had to leave because pets weren't allowed. I explained that I had a service animal. He very loudly insisted that I explain what service the dog provided, and I told him I could show him documents but also informed him that he legally couldn't ask that question. He argued that he could in an aggressive manner, I told him he was wrong but got the documents out and showed him anyway, and he continued to harass us until we left.

Seat at the bar is scarce, especially when there's a game on one of their many TVs. I was there today from 2-4pm. No wait staff anywhere. I watched people move empty glasses leftover from previous customers to another space just so they can sit at the available table. Was not able to get any food because of no servers.

Oh, and there's a bunch of beer pong tables and flip cup toward the back, which will make anyone nostalgic for their carefree college days. But there's a reason you moved on, and this place reminds us why.Maybe it's the abundance of cups, cups everywhere, half full cups, half cup empty, just don't set yours down because it's bound to be lost in the sea of plastic. Maybe it's the fact that the only thing outnumbering the said cups is the number of bros, bro wannabes and entire generations of bros.

This was one of the first places I went with co workers for happy hour when I started my current job and it is still a pretty solid choice when looking for a place to chill. Order a pitcher or two of beer and relax for a bit. After an hour or two, when you all start to get a bit hungry, order yourselves the bacon cheddar loaded tater tots for mouthfuls of cardiac clogging heaven. Or you could go with sliders to share if you'd like to keep it a little more dignified. I prefer the weekdays to hang out here. It is much quieter and until maybe 530-6 you can claim a big chunk of the back room for you and your friends. The beer pong games get going around then but if usually is pretty quick to claim the next game. They have a secondary bar downstairs for private parties which seems nice when I have looked in. The bathrooms have never been dirty when I go, but like I said I prefer to spend weekdays there when it isn't crazy crowded. The owners of this bar have many businesses around Manhattan (hair of the dog is another fun one, 13th step is not so much because of the people that usually hang out there) so I would shop around and see which atmosphere and neighborhood suits you best!",1,2,1

Updated review","Came here tonight and only stayed for 6 minutes. Today was probably the 15th time I've been to Jake's since moving to NYC (3 months ago). Our friend had an international ID (which works in almost every bar in NYC) and Jake's wouldn't let her in. Although that was completely understandable, the bouncer was extremely rude to her (and us) and even pushed her out the door. I'm sad to know that a place I've grown to love so much would treat their customers in such manner.Beware, they have extremely rude bouncers. The bouncer I met today was Robert, but I've always had a couple of other rude bouncers at Jake's.",3,1,

Three pints later still no food! I get it that it comes from your sister bar up the avenue, but 40 mins for some onion rings and tater tots?The bar staff were very apologetic and with $3 beers I was starving but on my way to being drunk so it turned out cool.Bottom line: seems like a frat bar that hates tank tops and food goes missing but you'll get drunk on cheap beer!",1,,

We played beer pong for a couple of hours and had a really good time. We ordered more from the table and the waitresses were really quick and nice as well. Check out this place!!!",1,1,2

And I've frequented all... They are also all affiliated and owned by the same management. But that's not here nor there. Like all his sister bars, Jake's is pretty lax. Great drink specials ($3 beer past 8pm on Sundays), good music, has beer pong tables, and shuffle boards. The front of the bar is more for the minglers, center for the gamers, and back for the loungers. Has more of a college-y feel to it, but still great for those looking for a laid-back time and good drinks.",2,1,2
148,Amanda B.,"Queens, NY",182,43,1,5.0,10/12/2014,"They have the best happy hour of any place in the UWS. Every night of the week is something different in terms of drink specials. If you're looking to not spend a lot of money this is your place. I've been here multiple times with friends who live outside of NYC and they had a wonderful time. It is a pretty spacious place and has a nice feel to it. It is easy to get to by public transportation. The music is pretty decent too.. never had a problem with that. Occasionally I will order food, and every time I have it's been wonderful. The boneless buffalo wings are basically just chicken fingers drenched in hot sauce but it is absolutely delicious. Pretty much everything on their menu is good. I highly recommend the Tater Tots, because they are bangin'.It's hard to go to other happy hours in the city because Jake's is so great. How can you beat an 11:30am-8pm happy hour on a Saturday....like really. That's just incredible. Definitely stop by Jake's Dilemma if your in the UWS, and then stop by their sister bar 'The Gin Mill,' literally a block over. You're guaranteed a fun night.",,,

As a native New Yorker, I grew up wearing Timbs everywhere (especially in in-climate weather). As it was my friends birthday, I begged and pleaded with the bouncer to let me in. When I was finally let into the bar, I discovered numerous patrons wearing the same boots I was turned away in. To make matters worse, this one kid's boots were COOKED looking like he just hiked the Adrondacks and then came thru the Upper West Side for a drink. To be sure, I even asked these men if the bouncer said anything to them about their footware and he had not! So basically, what the fuck? Overall, I was left standing in the rain because the bouncer has something against my FRESH boots but nobody else's. I would understand this shiesty policy if we were at a black tie event, an establishment with a photographer or EVEN a place that had a line of people waiting for entry. However, Jake's Dilemma is a shit ass bar for former fraternity brothers to re-live their glory days amongst any other sucker EXCEPT me because my Timbs were against the policy.

The food was great, though the nachos did not have enough chips to actually eat the toppings.  The biggest compliant is the lack of tables and chairs for their customers.

Foosball quarter tray was a little faulty, but they came and got the game to work although we were left with a tied score and one ball shy to determine the victor.

I'm an avid NYC bar/club socialite and have had very limited issues with ANY bar or club... regardless of creed, orientation, or otherwise.I'm going to start this horrible tale with me walking up to the bar very very sober at 12am.  I requested the same drink ( and shots ) from the same bartender at least 7 times and figured all was going well.  I was way too sober for about 1:30am or so and figured I would move on once my friends arrived to meet me.  All of a sudden, the bouncer walks up to me and says ""you have to leave"".  I say ""excuse me?  why, might I ask?"" that bartender says you need to leave ( the same one I've been getting drinks from the whole night and I've been tipping well might I add ).  I try to talk to this bartender and he mysteriously disappears and refuses to talk to me ( #coward ).  So I tell the bouncer ""without solid evidence I'm sorry, I don't see a reason why I need to leave"" & he proceeds to start cursing at me and almost start to force me out the door ( to which I say, ""please do not touch me"" ).  Yes, this got very rude very quickly with no escalation on my part.  I leave willingly telling the bouncer I will not be back due to the overall shady service by himself and the bartender.  To temper this review, I am NOT the type of person to get into fights with bar staff, etc.  In fact, I've maybe been in ( 1 ) fight in the last 5-10 years.  This past night struck such a nasty cord with me that I needed to point this out.

192,Ernest T.,"Parkchester, Bronx, NY",46,32,18,4.0,5/27/2015,Classic dive bar feel. Nice crowd. Good food.  Better drinks! Great staff.  Affordable prices.,,,
193,Vivian H.,"New York, NY",3,41,83,1.0,7/23/2014,Good lord what horrible drinks they make. You're better off at another bar on the street. Don't say I didn't warn you ....,2,,
194,Taylor B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,4.0,11/18/2014,"I recently threw a surprise 30th birthday party for my fiance at The Oak Cellar, the downstairs private room. We rented the space for 3 hours on a Saturday, and they work with you on pricing and are very attentive throughout the planning process. Bartenders and security were very friendly and helpful during the party. They let my friends come to set up early, and they also brought out the cake for us at the end of the night so I didn't have to worry about it. The only negative I had was the food - it got cold and kind of gross even in the sternos, but hey, it's bar food. Would still recommend this place for a party.",1,,
195,Tal G.,"Manhattan, NY",24,5,0,4.0,5/11/2012,"Packed on a Friday evening, Jake's Dilemma will always be full with students that decided to drink their way through the weekend.Staff was friendly and quick, despite some of the rude, yelling customers they sometimes face.Nice variety of beers and a good ""bar kitchen menue""",2,,2
196,Chase M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,0,1.0,7/5/2014,"This place is terrible. They turned my friend away for wearing a cool tank top. I pointed to a girl in a spaghetti strap. ""It only applies to guys."" Avoid this sexist, horrible, terrible place.",2,,
197,Cameron B.,"Washington, DC",153,411,160,3.0,12/7/2010,"Tucked in a dark corner in the back, just past the two beer pong tables is a great seating area at jake's Dilemma! The sprightly waitress informs us that happy hour is until 8pm and she'll warn us as we need to put in last orders.......4 drinks each later, she gives us one more on the house! Something something something.......blurry but great night at Jake's!It doubles as a college bar for kids who've been out of college for years, but still can't afford adult prices! With daily specials lining the wall, I'll be a college student for life as long as Jake's is around!!",,1,
198,Veronica M.,"Norcross, GA",0,12,2,4.0,8/26/2013,"I have been here a couple of times now, and their drinks are very reasonably priced especially during happy hour and middle of the week specials. They have multiple tvs where they show baseball/football games, and on the weekends I have seen beer long tables. Also, there's a more private area in the back that's not as noisy as the bar area. And there are tables outside. However, the last time I was here, the server was extremely friendly but was pretty bad about noticing us at first (another customer had to point us out to her).",,,
199,Mike F.,"Bridgeport, CT",362,189,14,4.0,8/4/2012,"With some of the best bar food in the upper west side, Jake's Dilemma is a great place for eats and drinks.  They have great drink specials daily, especially if you come in with your entire softball or football team!. There is almost too much to do, so it may get crowded from time to time.. This place has beer pong, flip cup, foosball, arcade games... And if you just want to chill out, they have a library style lounge in the back.You'd have to look long and far to find better wings or sliders.  Also gotta get the fried mac n cheese and the nachos plate.  Want more than one of the above?  Get the sliders topped with the fried mac!  Really some great bar food!",1,1,
