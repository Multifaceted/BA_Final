0,Lei G.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,52,48,4.0,8/27/2018,Ate breakfast a couple times recently and enjoyed attentive service and filling breakfast. Ordered the salmon Benedict one day and a 3 egg omelette another day - both delicious! Be aware their menu is pricey at least for breakfast. The decor was comfy & relaxing to start off the day.,,,
1,Veronica R.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,43,4,1.0,5/16/2018,"Unfortunately I had a weekend of bad food at this restaurant, although I do want to note that the front of house staff was wonderful. Yesterday I got the salmon, medium rare. It wasn't even cooked enough to cut through it. It was less than rare, it was raw. I almost threw up eating it. Today I got the scallops - those were good. But I got a latte after that had some sort of rubbery slimey thing in the foam - I'm just hoping it was old curdled milk that was left over on the steam machine. I can't even allow myself to believe it could be anything else because if I do I will definitely throw up. I also got the strawberry cheesecake dessert. It was deconstructed and not that great, but the strawberries were a deep BROWN color, and looked completely not edible. I cant even imagine the state of mind someone must have been in to let that leave the kitchen.",,,
2,Michael C.,"Warwick, NY",0,211,1,2.0,11/7/2018,"I wish another reviewer had mentioned that Gordon Ramsey no longer has anything to do with this restaurant. Bar. Grill. Whatever you want to call it. That was the whole reason I took my wife here for a special ""dinner"" pre-ballet. It was expensive and it wasn't worth it. Food was just okay. Same with $24 cocktails and $16 glasses of wine. Go here if you are on expense account or simply don't care about money. Otherwise skip it. There are far too many better choices in NYC. And what ever happened to Gordon Ramsey?",,,
3,John B.,"New York, NY",773,371,653,2.0,3/10/2018,A very typical hotel restaurant that really does need to work on its food!The fish and chips was probably the worst I have ever had since leaving good old England.  Whilst you can't compare I have no doubt these were fried from frozen. I will give them kudos for the dessert with a cracking looking little cheesecake but other than that nothing worth coming back for.,,,

5,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,3.0,11/11/2017,"The London Bar is a bar in Manhattan that seems like it should be high end, but comes off as fairly average. The bar area is a decent size and consists of many business people either staying that the hotel or working in the area. Decor wise, the place is very 80's, but instead of coming off classic, it looks and feels very outdated. This adds to an already low key and somewhat dreary atmosphere.  They have a good liquor selection and the bar service was good. They also load you up on peanuts and bar snacks during the time there. Not much else to say here the overall experience was a fairly forgettable one. There was nothing negative about it, but with the many amazing bar options in Manhattan, this one doesn't live up to the standard of being anything special.",4,,2
6,Mike A.,"Hidden Hills, CA",230,72,18,1.0,11/3/2017,"Been standing waiting for a table now for 15 minutes when half of the restaurant is practically empty...The young lady in the front is very unpleasant, she seems annoyed and it looks like she doesn't want to be here...so why is she? Why don't you teach your employees some manners...you know, a smile goes a long way...it's not like it's a cheep restaurant, everything about this place is highly priced, therefore a pleasant customer service is really not too much to ask for.I guess this in NYC for you, where people are always in a rush, and customer service is not their strong side. Bottom line: there is no place like LA.Update: my wife just ask for a side of avocado and that what she got...",5,1,
7,Yolanda L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9,70,80,4.0,8/21/2018,This review is for the bar. Had a Manhattan and Old Fashion and they were both among best I've had.   Nuts could use improvement. They are soggy and too sweet.,,,
8,Freda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,0,1.0,8/27/2018,"Huge disappointment. I was expecting a London theme but was confronted with a very run-of-the mill hotel restaurant-type menu. The prices are extremely high and the food is mediocre at best, in some cases actually bad. The service and ambience was more redolent of a diner than fine dining. Sad! I also used to come for the British breakfast and they no longer do that. For some reason this place seems to be being run in to the ground. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",,,
9,Andrew W.,"San Diego, CA",2,42,0,1.0,1/29/2018,"Since Circo closed, this has become one of my favorite spots. Almost every night for a night cap (or several).  But, London sold out to corporate America. I'm now down from about 5-6 nights a week to 3 nights a week. Will likely continue to go down until I stop coming here entirely. One of the prime attractions to a bar like this (especially for a local) is the staff (not the prices which are way above above average).  The staff used to know me, my moods, my drinks, my orders, my quirks, etc. (I used to walk in and Daniel would say ""you look roughed up.  Dark or light tonight?"" -- based on the answer, he knew the solution).  And they got to know the transient customers as well (you like that with one rock, right?; square cup or round cup?).For the most part, this place is not a ""locals"" place...it preys on tourists that are too lazy to cross the street. And, there has been lots of turnover recently. Nobody sticks around.  I'm back to explaining myself every night to every new foreign bartender (the Monday guy this week is likely not the Monday guy next week).  Not the conversation that needs to be had, especially with a regular entertaining clients. While I like the ambiance, Hilton (I think now Conrad) has destroyed this bar and needs to let well enough alone. Paul, Daniel, Gregory, etc., did a phenomenal job of keeping its regulars happy while also tending to the transients. These guys knew when the best interests of the bar were on the line, and did everything needed to ensure that the bar succeeded over anything else (for example, my SO is on a very strict diet for medical/allergy reasons...Daniel remembered that every night and when she entertained clients at the bar, he went out of his way, every visit, to make her feel welcomed and special -- never singling her out -- and doing everything possible to comply with her diet (behind the scenes)...he made magic happen so as to not once make her feel uncomfortable about her medical condition).  If management re-instates the status quo, I will gladly make new review. For the time being, though, its decisions are damaging the brand.PS - my review has nothing to do with the hotel arm which is top notch in all respects. While I have similar gripes (I.e. too much turnover) the hotel seems to consistently attract top talent...the bar, not so much. It seems to want itself to die.EDIT:  just went back. $370 bAr tab. Asked for another drink and was told management ""requires"" payment for every drink. FYI, Go to old castle (across the street)...they service people better. Better service, people, and prices.",2,,
10,Becca R.,"Seattle, WA",67,7,0,1.0,7/22/2018,"Would give no stars if possible. Terrible service, insanely overpriced breakfast with terrible food. Took over 20 minutes just to get two toasted bagels. Waiter didnt know what a mocha is &it is on the menu. Also it clearly comes from a machine and still cost $10.",,,
11,Elle L.,"New York, NY",0,37,0,2.0,4/5/2018,I love this bar especially before 5 when it's quieter. The server Ifjal was simply rude to my party of 2 and was very unattentive. He never checked on us and my brother had an empty glass for a while. He literally walked away from us as we were ordering our food and drinks. Very unprofessional. I was disappointed at the usual good service. There was even a patron who yelled at the hostess because no one came to her table and take her order. Service is definitely dwindling.,,,
12,Cassandra G.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",3,28,16,5.0,2/24/2018,Friendly. Nice ambience.Bartender Nicole was a wealth of knowledge about cocktails and theatre. Go there. You won't be sorry.,1,,
13,Anonymous P.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/13/2018,"The food quality was horrible and extremely over-priced. To start with, they charge $10 for a cup of coffee - which was basically just gross, weak diner coffee. The eggs florentine was served on two, flat, stale muffins that were hard to chew. Total Bill for that and a bowl of fruit was $72.  Worst breakfast experience you could imagine in an otherwise nice hotel.",,,
14,Aaron T.,"Easton, PA",397,508,123,2.0,12/27/2015,"The best part of the experience, was the cocktails, when we could get them.  The service was poor to say the least. Drinks went unfilled, glasses were removed without being returned with a beverage as requested, and we rarely saw our server through the night.  I even asked to split the bill between cards, and that couldn't successfully be completed as requested.  The man in the booth next to our table appeared to have the same problem as I watched his head swivel.  He may have had a neck condition or a nervous neck twitch, but Occam's Razor would suggest he was eagerly looking for his server.  I came down with the same condition later in the meal.The food was okay.  I had the scallops and my wife the lamb.  In my wife's words, ""it's hard to screw up lamb as long as it's medium rare.""  As expected, medium rare it was.  I had the scallops, which were okay.  As a gluten free patron, the menu was lacking in options, so it's not the best place for this particular genre of dietary restrictions.The service was the low point of the experience and unfortunately reduced the possible enjoyment of the restaurant.",4,1,1
15,Watch O.,"New York, NY",3,71,21,5.0,10/11/2016,"Surprised to see low rated latest reviews of the bar. I discovered this hotel last week when attended a casting for a bridal show that took place in a beautiful suite. I came back to have a drink and a bite at the bar since it looked nice.We were given a warm tasty bread and soft butter once ordered food. It was a delicious chicken soup, for an amazing low price at $6. :D Loved it.Chocolate mouse dessert was nice too. The service was good. It was not loud at the time of my visit around 7 pm. I like quiet places where you can relax and talk. And the bathrooms are huge and individual.I will definitely come back. At least for the chicken soup for sure!",2,,
16,Aline M.,"La Crescenta, CA",25,164,264,1.0,6/13/2016,"We visited here due to a single reason, we stayed at the hotel and it was convenient. One NOUN: VINCENT. He is the poison of this lounge. He was awful. So disrespectful and rude. We asked him for champagne and he ran away before we could even specify which champagne we wanted!! Came back with two glasses of Who knows what and charged us 56$ for two glasses for what could have probably been prosecco . Smh. Anytime we asked him for ANYTHING he mumbled under his breath and gave us no response. Get rid of him if you want people to ever be back here to dine/drink.",5,7,1
17,Jenny D.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,115,11,1.0,10/8/2016,"Quite possibly the most disappointing ""restaurant"" I've ever been to. Service is poor, which is sad for such a pricey hotel. I've been here twice during comicon, hungry and looking forward to some good food.Ordered the lamb rack the other day, mentioned to both the hostess and server that we were in a bit of a rush. Placed our orders in. 30 minutes later. No food yet. Nobody had come to check on our table or inform us that things were running late. I had to flag someone down to follow up on the order (should've gotten the guy I flagged down to be our server from the start), and NOW the food shows up. ""Herb crusted lamb with tabbouleh falafel and yogurt"" - ordered medium rare 1. There was no herbs crusted on the lamb. Just a plain old salt and peppered lamb. 2. Not medium rare. Cooked rare. In fact, it seemed as though the didn't turn the oven on till we placed our order in. Because of how long it took, how tough the cooked portions of the meat were, and how rare everything else was. 3. Their Yogurt made the lamb sour. So, it tasted like the meat had gone bad. It hadn't. But why would you serve the two together like that? Maybe if they had done ANYTHING to the yogurt. Mixed it up with some mint and spices maybe? ANYTHING. It would've been bearable. 3. The ""tabbouleh"" didn't taste a thing like it. Is had so much raw green pepper, which, any chef should know is horribly overpowering. 4. Falafel was fine. In fact, it was the only thing fine that I feel like they must've sourced it from another restaurant. Listen, I can make a decent ""herb crusted lamb"" and shouldn't have taken as long as it did at a professional kitchen. And it really not that hard to make great lamb chops. And even harder to screw up. Congratulation, the London! You did!""Truffle Fries""Most consistently good thing on the menu. They use truffle powder flavor. Not truffle oil. Which was a little loss in class for such an expensive place. But at least it was enjoyable.DINNER -- yup. Back again. Simply out of convenience. ""Glazed Salmon with seaweed salad, wonton crisps""I feel like salmon shouldn't ever be marinated. It just prevents you from appreciating the beauty that is a good salmon. But hey, that's just me. Couldn't quite get past the salmon. Is was fisher for some reason even despite the marinade. Something was just off. Perhaps it wasn't as fresh as one would like, but hidden behind some subpar marinade. But my boyfriend enjoyed it enough to eat the 80% of it that I couldn't. Seaweed salad was good. I didn't think the two items complemented each other at all (just like lunch), but I just ate them separately and enjoyed the seaweed salad. The wontons were piled high. And didn't seem to add anything but it's existence to the dish. It didn't highlight or complement any flavors. It was just. There. ""Blueberry Corn Bread with Bacon Chocolate Ice Cream""This is where I lost it. It sounded great! Blueberries? Cornbread? Bacon chocolate ice cream which is reminiscent of what so many LA restaurants have been doing. And it's hard to screw up dessert!Well. I couldn't have been more wrong. I have never been more put off by anything more than this. It tasted, not like bacon... But like those Beggin' Strips dog treats puréed and frozen. One of our friends said they must've used those prepackaged salad bacon. Not actual fresh bacon. In fact. I don't think there was a HINT of chocolate in it. Couldn't even do more than one bite. And I passed it around to the group, trying to hide my disgust, and got a great laugh watching them all try it and almost vomit each time. Hahaha. Well, wonderful work, the London, in being the most traumatizing restaurant experience (not just in New York) but out of ALL the places I've ever been to. Very sad that you also provide the room service food. Oh, the bread and butter was good though!Yup. That's it.",,,
18,Patrick B.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,410,11,3.0,6/20/2016,"I like the London Bar.  If you are in the area...or staying at the hotel, it is nice to know you have an upscale choice when looking for a cocktail to kick-off your evening... or a nightcap to wrap it up.  I guess I was a bit disappointed in the food selections, but understand it is a bar... not a full service restaurant.  The crowd feels very midtown ""business"", and the service is solid.",,,

20,Gene B.,"Saint Louis, MO",135,16,17,2.0,1/17/2016,"I used to love this place and would visit it every year when I was in town for an annual convention, but it has changed dramatically since last year.   We sat down and it was 10 minutes before anyone came over to take an order.  Once they did, it was another 15 minutes before the drinks were delivered.  My glass of wine was corked, and when I asked the server for a new glass, he took my glass an dissappeared.  Five minutes later another server came over to check on me and got me a different glass. The second server was the only reason I am giving two stars rather than one.We all ordered the London burger, which was a favorite, and it was very disappointing.  It took 50 minutes to get our order and wilted lettuce and green tomatoes were served as a garnish.

We came for dinner and there was really nothing on the menu. Just a few options. The food we ordered was ok, nothing amazing. Our servers name was Vincent. He was a disgusting excuse for a human being. Never met anyone as rude as him. We asked him things and he ignored us. We ordered our meal and he took our order and mumbled under his breath. Finally we wanted some drinks so we ordered a few glasses of champagne. Before even saying what kind he ran a got us two cups. The bill came and it was around $120 for a few drinks.

29,Steven L.,"New York, NY",4,4,1,1.0,1/25/2015,"The London hotel management and Gordon Ramsey should be embarrassed .Would not recommend this place  to anyone either for New Yorkers or out of town guests.Simply put it is clear the manager chris only cares about getting home early and following  corporate policy.Here is our experience last night ...We got to see a great concert at radio city .we then proceeded to fill the London bar with 100 people which included the band that played radio city and its management and vip's.  Think impromptu concert after party . You would think the manager /hotel would welcome and say thank you for all the business !! Not once did we hear a thank you!!Everyone is starving it is only 10:45  so we are ready to order food with our drinks .the  waiter comes back and Advises he asked his manager who said they won't serve food anymore . Several people were staying at hotel as well so we asked manager then if could we have hotel room service delivered to restaurant . His answer was we could order it to the room and then wait in room and bring it down ourselves . Now that's a manager who is trying to help as long as he has to do nothing. Then the icing on the cake is with a completely packed bar at 12:30 they proceed to turn the lights up as bright as possible to get us out.This just angered every customer in the place. We actually then gave the worst manager ever a tip just to have him turn down the lights slightly while we finish the drinks we have already paid for . he took the Money and did not even help to turn the blinding lights down a bit.We are New Yorkers and I have never been to a bar on a Saturday night that basically has no interest in making money or its customers !!This is the city that never sleeps except at the London bar where they clearly are not in business to make money and just want you out of the place as fast as they can get you out.You would think that at a place with $19 drinks, at an upscale hotel that it would be all about service and how can we make your evening enjoyable .

On top of that, I had to argue with management to pay my bill while I waited 35 minutes for the criminal guest to come down and bring my jacket back. Not cool. This is supposedly a 5 star hotel but felt more like a Motel 8. A victim at this type of a hotel should have been treated much better.  I left feeling like I did something wrong. All I did was come  to this hotels a have a glass of wine. Never again and on top Of it, I was with clients.   Never again. Stay away. Killed my deal. Blackstone needs hire better employees who actually take care of their real customers.",2,,
44,Kristin W.,"Fredericksburg, VA",42,13,0,1.0,3/9/2015,"Awful.   Food was dried out and tasted like it had been sitting all day.   Very disappointed.  Tried to contact the managers of the place - no response.  We went for Christmas dinner.  The staff was rude - made me sit in the middle of the room to wait on a table that was clearly ready.  So, there I sat, (I'm disabled) for all the world to look at waiting for the slow service.  We were seated at a table where it was obvious I couldn't get in and out of easily - didn't seem to matter.  The food was AWFUL!  I emailed Gordon Ramsay's HQ in London to tell them I paid $300.00 for a cocktail and a gingerbread cookie since the rest of the food was dried out and bland and inedible.  No one did a thing.  Ruined our Christmas.  Not even an apology - nothing.  I tried to ask for our money back - but they just ignore that too.",3,1,
45,Corrina C.,"Saint Paul, MN",52,31,1,3.0,4/2/2016,Meh.  I had a noodle salad with the grilled flat iron steak.  The steak and my husbands French fries were good.  The staff is attentive and the modern theme is swanky.,1,,
46,Zlatan B.,"Manorville, NY",351,236,125,1.0,12/9/2014,We came to this restaurant after watching the radio city christmas spectacular!We were In a great mood and looking forward to the restaurant for a long time! Being English I was keen to go with my wife! So we arrived and was seated by a very nice lady!! It was 11:58am and our server refused to serve us anything alcoholic. So it begun!! We asked him to see if they could make us scrambled eggs and fruit to my daughter our waiter who spoke very little English looked at me like I had two heads!! I was overall very disappointed!! Sorry Gordon!!,,7,
47,Gnewey W.,"New York, NY",0,37,2,1.0,10/30/2014,"""You can get that from the buffet""was the answer I got from my waiter when I wanted a croissant. This restaurant is run like a fast food joint. The table next to me, was screaming at the waiter because he never paid him any attention. He finally placed his order, and I placed mine. His order never came, he stormed out, I had to ask the waiter to check on my order after it took a long time, I ordered toast, btw. It was ridiculous, the hostesses couldn't care less... no welcomes, no smiles. DISGUSTING.",2,2,1
48,Jose G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,14,1.0,12/3/2014,"Aweful service, tasteless food, those are some of the things to start with.... We arrived at the hotel and decided to go eat at Ramsey's restaurant to avoid walking around in the rain. Big mistake!!!!.. They sat us down and they didn't gives a menu. The arrogant waiter asked us what we want to drink and we ordered ice tea. He never offered us a menu brought the ice tea and I have to ask him for the menu. We ordered the burger ($25 over priced) which it was the size or smaller than a Big Mac. I'm sure, foid was tasteless, ice tea tasted like a Lipton tea... I can go on but I'll leave it at that. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!!",1,1,1
49,Andrew O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,0,2.0,5/5/2016,Just got in on a business trip so am in the bar alone. 5 minutes in and the waiter is obnoxious and the food looks over priced.,,,
50,Alec L.,"Mountain Lakes, NJ",1,18,0,1.0,12/20/2014,Garbage.  Steer clear.  Gordon Ramsay would FLIP OUT if he tasted the food here.   Chicken breast is the equivalent of 2 McNuggets.  Cavatelli is plasticky.  Yuck,,1,
51,Meredith Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,1.0,4/26/2015,"This place is a mess. I went for brunch with a friend; not only was it absurdly overpriced (even by NYC standards), but the food was subpar at best. On top of that, the service was DREADFUL. We waited twenty minutes just to get coffee, and seemed to have three different servers. But the biggest issue is this: I accidentally left my credit card in the payment folder. I called that afternoon to let them know I'd come get it, and (after being transferred twice, and hung up on once) was told they didn't have the card. I knew they did, so I asked a friend who worked nearby to go ask. THEY GAVE HIM THE CARD. He didn't even know the account number and they just handed over my credit card. He could have been anyone, asking about any lost credit card. This place needs to get it together.",,,
52,Rose J.,"Deer Park, NY",67,23,10,1.0,12/2/2014,I am appalled at the service and lack of food at the Thanksgiving Day brunch.,,1,
53,Ju L.,"New York, NY",8,75,153,4.0,11/22/2014,"I thought the food was perfectly cooked. It's what I expect from a gordon Ramsey restaurant. But I didn't like the little extra topping, what ever it was, on my risotto. It's just not my taste but that's a personal preference. I also tried their beef wellington. It was perfectly cooked once again, but I've had better. It was probably too much to expect gordon Ramsey's Christmas special beef Wellington. Haha. Great service and a romantic setting. Prices are very good for the fantastically cooked food. I may go back but not anytime soon.",,,
54,Jennifer J.,"Acworth, GA",33,20,7,1.0,12/13/2014,"While staying at The London, we stopped by for drinks and appetizers. The service was the worst I have ever encountered. After waiting 30 minutes with empty glasses and a table cluttered with dirty dishes, I complained to management. Server came by and refreshed our drinks then disappeared for another 45 minutes. I had to ask management for our check. For the first time in my life, I refused to tip and made sure to leave a note on the receipt to explain why I did so. My group spoke to the table across from us on the way out and they were experiencing the same atrocious service with little response from management.",,,
55,Imran A.,"Patchogue, NY",939,26,2,1.0,7/19/2015,"I couldn't stand the guy on TV if I ever saw his show as others watched it. But I had no idea the person RECEIVING the cussing should be Gordon Ramsay himself. I had been wanting to write a review of this atrocious place for a long time. By the time I got to it it had closed down, and so I do not have to point out all the lousy experiences my friends and I had there. Good riddance.  WORST and among MOST expensive food a group of us 4 #Pakistan high school buddies living in USA had at one of our annual reunions of food, fun and friendship was the horrible food at Gordon Ramsay's London New York. Each one of us has extremely different tastes, 2 of the group drink, 2 of us do not. 2 eat pork, 2 do not. We do a 3 day annual thing eating at great places and NEVER had we been to a place where EACH one of us hated EACH item EACH of us ordered. Just checked Yelp to confirm the name and was not surprised to see it closed down. Apathy, bad food, lazy manager, lousy experience providers get run out of NYC fast.",,3,
56,Sera S.,"Cheshire, CT",0,15,0,4.0,11/26/2014,"The food is great. We ate a risotto and a fish and chips and they were all very good. However, the interior design wasn't like I have expected. It was too simple for a restaurant like that. The waiters were definitely bad. They weren't friendly and they gave us the check when we didn't want it. I felt like they wanted us to go.",,,
57,Sami S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,27,24,2.0,8/10/2015,This place has really collapsed in quality. I don't understand how they can justify their prices. There is barely anything left on the menus and breakfast is equally unimpressive. The London needs more food options because this place is a miserable failure.,,,
58,Glenn K.,"Williamsburg, VA",14,14,0,5.0,10/25/2014,Second year in a row my wife and I celebrated our anniversary on 9/11.  The food and service would compare favorably with any Michelin rate restaurant in Europe.  Service is superior and the food is perfect.  I have an unusual diet and the chef accommodated me with no fuss or confusion.  As good as any in Napa!,,,
59,James S.,"Glen Cove, NY",2,2,0,1.0,11/27/2014,"I have dined at Maze by Gordon Ramsay in the London on several occasions.  All excellent experiences.  Just wrapped thanksgiving buffet  dinner with a large party.  It was the worst dining experience I have ever had.  Buffet ran out of food on several occasions.  When the turkey finally came out, gravy took another five minutes.  Mashed potatoes, when replenished, were nearly inedible.  Staff didn't clear plates, or refill water glasses, unless asked.  Spoke with the GM, who was very apologetic and immediately said he would make an accommodation on our bill.  Bill came and it was not adjusted.  I asked for the GM and he took care of it right away, but even with the adjustment, I can't believe I actually paid anything for that meal.  Seriously Gordon Ramsay?",1,1,
