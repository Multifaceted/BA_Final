0,Tomaito E.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,41,58,3.0,7/1/2018,"I came to Cafe Water a lot when I first started working in the area because my coworkers ate here. I've since found places with much better food, especially for the price, hence the 3 stars. There are a lot of options here however, and I have not tried everything.The buffet, 3/5: It really is hit/miss. Some items are great (japchae, roasted eggplant, brussels sprouts) some make me feel iffy afterwards (basa fillet). The ""Korean"" section in the back, 5/5: The guys working are really nice and friendly and they have awesome veggie options on the menu. My favorites are the pad thai and the kimchi ramen. The small plastic container of kimchi is free, but $1 each if you take more than 1. The two guys in the cash only section are really unfriendly but that line tends to be way shorter.",,,

They offer everything you can possible think of, i think...sandwiches, prepared food, soups, bottled drinks, Seating area, lots of food i would like to try. I don't think they have pizza i could be wrong. The one time i did go i got egg and cheese and avocado on a bagel, hubby ordered a sandwich (idk what kind of sandwich) but it was enough to fill him for 5 hours, a bottle of water, i got a dunkin donuts espresso drink and he also got snapple the bill was $22, i believe my sandwich by itself was $4.",,,

I waited with my co-worker and he arrived and asked our order. While I was ordering, the guy went and grabbed the frozen udon noodles (with his bare hands) and drops it into the water. I asked him where are his gloves and he shows me his tongs. I told him that he touched the udon noodles with his bare hands. Again I ask where are his gloves. He makes it seem that it's not a big deal and then saw the look on my face and proceeds to grab gloves. I left immediately! Never again. He could've just come back from the restroom. The fact that he didn't see ""cross-contamination"" as a big deal, I will no longer be a customer.",,,

It's $9.49 per pound and there were a few different tray options: styrofoam and plastic with varying sizes. I walked in right before lunch time so there were plenty of seats.

If you go to the hot food bar in the middle, you grab a box and fill it with whatever you want, there are many options, from Asian to wings to salads. They price it by weight. There are also ready-made foods like sandwiches and Korean bibambap and other dishes on the side bars, but I haven't personally tried them. The place is very busy during lunch hours but the lines move relatively quickly. Ok place to stop by for a quick takeout lunch if you're working in the Financial District area. There are a few tables on the side but due to how hectic it is I would recommend eating elsewhere.",,,

I was delighted that you guys opened in my neighborhood and was looking forward to a long relationship with your deli. As a deli, my expectations for service is already at an all time low, but to experience what I had at 10:30 AM, June 7th, was unimaginable. Needless to say, it doesn't seem that the manager or the cashier woman cared to have my business so I will not be coming back nor will i recommend any of my co-workers, neighbors or the drug representative that buys my office lunches to partake in your morning manager's disrespect for customer service. If you are going to charge me the same price for a meal that I order in the evening and not give me the same order (with soups and sides), then you should charge less! Would you charge for a combo plate of burgers and fries and not give fries simple because I bought it too early and your oil wasn't hot enough to make fries? It's a gesture of good will, take 50 - 75 cents off, not say sorry you have to pay same price, disgusting!Telling a customer after they waited 15 minutes for a meal that they didn't fully received, that they need to pay full price, because they came too early is POOR customer service! You could have told me before making me wait that you didn't have the soup ready and let me make the decision on what to do, I happen to enjoy soup the soup and sides the most. Since I live and work in the neighborhood, I truly wanted to make you my  deli of choice amongst the hundreds of deli in the area, sadly you failed your company and the owner and I hope someone will show the manager that being fair to customers are important ways to grow a competitive business.",2,,

The fact that they have a good variety of food options is great but the price on the other hand makes you think is it worth it. Being that it is in the financial district may be why prices are so high. It is clean although there was a period of time where people would take food and ask someone if they could pay for them.

15,Michael R.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,128,1854,2.0,9/20/2016,Breakfast bar is $9.00 per pound. Cash only. There are food trucks on most corners who offer a similar selection at a fraction of the cost. I could have eaten at a full service diner for what I spent on a small serving of eggs and a hash brown. There are no signs at the food bar other than cash only. Buyer beware.,2,,2
16,Mari K.,"New York, NY",0,17,0,2.0,2/12/2018,"Disappointed, I go here almost daily but the new prices that went up today are just too much for the food you're getting even if It is fidi.

17,Alex L.,"Bristow, VA",167,78,27,1.0,2/27/2017,"TL;DR: Raw meat gloves were used to handle my already cooked food!!! NO BUENO.I was at the deli counter being served by someone who was handling raw bacon and cooked food. He was wearing gloves but when I asked for onion rings, he just grabbed a bunch with the same glove without taking the glove off or putting on a new one after touching raw bacon. The onion rings were put in the fryer so I wasn't worried, but as soon as they came out, the fry basket was set down on top of the grill top on top of the bacon that was still being cooked and the onion rings. Okay...that's definitely NOT SAFE. It's a fry basket, not a plate. The raw bacon face up can most definitely come into contact with bits of the food in the basket.The guy then proceeded to handle the container with the same gloves he was touching raw meat with and then handed it over to me to take it to go. Same gloves were worn for this entire interaction. He was handling raw bacon in between taking my order and seving me my food. I was afraid to eat the food after it was given to me so I made sure to microwave it for a few minutes at my office just to be safe and even then I chickened out a little and tossed it after eating a few.That's all sorts of health code violations and they can make someone seriously sick!! I'm not that shocked, but come on cross contamination over gloves? That's elementary. Please fix this immediately or enforce your rules, because I won't be coming back here anymore, and I will definitely tell others to be careful. I've been going to these guys for months and the food is actually good if you're looking for something quick, but it's not worth getting some food-borne illness that can easily be prevented from something as basic as changing gloves.",3,,
18,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,3.0,3/22/2016,"Otherwise known as the ""Dirty Water"" at my work, this place is one of those mediocre, yet edible places in the Financial District. It's really more like 2.5-Stars, but I rounded up cause of the convenience factor and cost.I work a block away on Wall Street, so I end up coming here when the weather is terrible outside, or for Oatmeal in the morning as that's one of their better things, along with the roast or fried chicken by the piece from the buffet counter.  If you do opt for the chicken, they bring it out at 10am, so I'd get it around then, otherwise, if you come at lunch (12pm-2pm), it's been sitting out for almost 4hrs and a ton of people have hovered over it.  I usually get it with my oatmeal and eat it then for a big breakfast or save it for lunch and reheat in the microwave.  Just my two cents.The Dirty Water is basically your standard New York Deli with a lunch buffet, but on the lower quality side.  Made-to-order breakfast items, wraps, sandwiches, etc, are all ok, but nothing to write home about.  I wouldn't go out of your way to come here, but if you're in the area and looking for something fast, hot, and relatively cheap, this is a good option.",7,3,4

However, tonight I bought a cookie and a milk, got to my room and preceded to take a drink, it was most horrible taste I have ever tasted, the milk was bad it was almost vinegar. I spit it out and almost puked. I took it back and got my money back, the date on the milk was August 15. The guy gave me my money back but offered no apology. They never give you a receipt so that when I found out that cookie was $2.50, the sticker on the cookie said best by 10/2/2016, I don't think so, it's 8/21/2016 and it's borderline now, wait another month and it will be dust.P.S.

Considering how many shitty/ok places there are all over the place that offer the same thing (hot bar, soups, asian, sushi, salad) this play is a gem. First everything was constantly being refreshed and the hot food looked amazing. I got ramen, more like noodle soup with kimchi then ramen but i'm not dining at Toto so i'm okay with this. And the ramen was 6.95.. wtf!! amazing. I also got 4 individual pieces of maki roll from the food bar, the full rolls are around 10.00 but let me tell you, they are humongous, so totally worth the price over the lame lunch specials where your spicy tuna looks like pureed red goo.

Updated review","This place has really come down. I know they got knew owners and ever since then its just been down hill.  It used to be my favorite breakfast place. Ordered from it every morning!!! Literally!  The lady even started to recognize me and would always say ""want you're firewall wrap?"". Then they replaced her and whoever they hired said I couldn't order what I order because it wasn't on the menu. It was a firewall wrap, it consists of Whole wheat wrap, egg whites, jalapenos, avocado, and red salsa. So I asked the guy if they had those ingredients. he said yes! but that they couldn't make what wasn't on the menu anymore. do you know how ridiculous that sounds coming from a deli?  Not only did he tell me that but all their prices went up! everything is so expensive in there. Found a new deli down the street that has the same stuff and prices water café used to. Sad day it was when I realized I was breaking up with my morning deli. I really tried to give them multiple chances this last year and each time I'm more disappointed.",1,,

33,Mysti W.,"Garden City, NY",0,17,8,2.0,2/1/2017,"The stars are only for the food selection, especially the Ramen soup. The customer service at the registers is TERRIBLE. I can understand a little rush during busy hours, but not during off-peak times.  They rush you by yelling ""NEXT"", often don't include appropriate utensils in your bag (I've been given a knife for soup), snatched your money from you and throw back your change, and don't hand you your food after it's been bagged, and force customers to rush others out of line by yelling ""NEXT"" once the previous order has been rung (not even paid yet).  Some may consider these to be little things, but little customer-friendly gestures go a long way.",,,
34,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4999,1699,3181,3.0,12/8/2011,"I don't touch the salad bars at joints like these out of the sheer fact that my lunch would definitely be on the upward scale of $20.  I settle for the deli sandwich and to be more precise, their low fat tuna on whole wheat bread.  I hate that they charge you for lettuce and tomatoes.  However, on the plus side the sandwich is accompanied by free pickle spears and a free bag of chips (which you can forgo for more pickes).  We are taking about $6 and change.  DO NOT BUY drinks here!  They charge you an arm and a leg for anything in a bottle - soda, water, juice. I'm talking about $3 for a water, $2 for a bottle of soda.  Run over to Duane Reade and pick up some beverage option if you are thirsty and want to save a buck.I don't hate this place since it is one of the better options at the end of Wall Street.  They do have way better sandwiches then their neighbor...Subway.",5,2,2

41,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2671,3521,16559,2.0,4/29/2010,"Way back when, coming to Cafe Water was an excuse I'd blame on frugality and efficiency.  It was also the only place that had a real (per pound) buffet in the area that included more than 10 choices of food.  But as prices went up, people began crowding up the joint, and the food going to crap, there is really no reason for me to come here.Their service deserves a hat's off for being fast, polite, and diligent.  Lines here are rarely a problem, but during their peak lunch hour times the wait can be staggering.  The Korean couple that owns this place are nice people, but once the lunch hour hits, they're always all over the place cleaning tables and manning cash registers.  It's a good thing there isn't much seating here, or the place would really get too stuffy.The food is nothing to boast about by any means.  Sure, there is a nice sized buffet with decent potpourri of items, but I can't find one thing that isn't bland or mediocre.  Soups, salads, sandwiches are essentially of the same subpar mold, there is not one outstanding element about them.  What made them edible was the fact they were inexpensive but due to food costs, the price hikes have resulted in a 30 cent increase in sandwiches and a 50 cent jump from $6.99 a pound in the buffet to a semi-city standard 7.49 a pound.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was closer to $9 by the end of this year.If being cheap is the name of the game, shoot for the food carts along Wall / Water Street.  I'll wait in line for any of the Halal carts before I come back here.",,,

I don't know why they keep it in such a discreet area. You can order ramen or udon to go. They make it right in front of you, fresh with mushrooms, broccoli, tofu, etc. There is also free kimchi and daikon. There is also a sushi bar with sushi being made fresh daily. The sandwiches are also pretty good. They are definitely better than subway, blimpies, etc. I come here at least once a week for lunch.",,,
50,A C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,42,16,1.0,3/19/2013,"Come here if you like egg shells in your soup!  The manager thinks its normal.I work nearby and have been coming here because its close and convenient and the food is ok.  Usually I would get the Udon noodle soup in the back of the restaurant.  Recently I ordered ramen soup and while i was eating, I noticed something very crunchy.  I spit it out and found a piece of egg shell a bit smaller than a penny.When I went to return it, the manager, who clearly didnt want to give me a refund, offered a few excuses.  ""It was an accident.""  ""When you cook at home, sometimes you might get an egg shell into the food, right?""  ""You ate half of the soup"".  I countered, 'so an accident makes it ok?  If a hair is dropped into the food, its usually an accident, that doesnt make it ok?  I'm not cooking at home, I'm at a restaurant paying someone else to cook.  Yes, I ate half and then discovered the egg shell.  I would like to eat the entire meal.In addition, i can't tell you how many times the Udon station cook has messed up my order.  ""Vegetable udon, no tofu no mushrooms please.""  The chef grabs a cup, throws a fistful of mushrooms in the cup.  I tell him no mushrooms and he starts picking out the mushrooms.  ""Id like a new one"".  He takes a cup and throws a fistful of mushrooms in the cup.  ""I dont want mushrooms"".  No joke, again he starts picking out the mushrooms.  ""I'd like a new one"" I say again.  3rd Try, he puts his hand on the mushrooms again and I say ""NO MUSHROOMS"".   Then he turns around puts his hand on the chicken and asks ""Chicken?""  ""No chicken, just vegetable.""  He puts his hands on the tofu and I say ""No Tofu, just vegetable udon, no tofu no mushroom"".  I might as well order beef udon and maybe I will get vegetable udon.I wont be going here anymore -- if you want something good nearby, check out Yorganic just 2 minutes walk on 3 Hanover Sq.  The food is much much better and they actually listen to what you order.",2,1,1

It's pretty much a block away from where I work and they serve decent food once in a while. Seriously overpriced but nonetheless acceptable. I see myself coming back for the mushrooms (which is extremely salty), broccoli, noodles, fish, and whatever seems fresh that day. But if I were given the choice, I would rather lunch elsewhere unless you need something quick or you're really indecisive.",2,,
52,Harmony I.,"Palmyra, ME",40,344,7,2.0,12/27/2011,"Expensive! It is a clean place and their drink selection gives a grocery store a run for their money, but I cannot believe what the prices are for in here for food. I ordered 2 scrambled eggs - no bacon, no toast, no homefries, no cheese - just 2 eggs.$2.50! I know that you are paying for the convenience, I understand that this is New York, I understand that they have to pay their rent...I get all that. All I am saying is save yourself the $2.50 and go to the grocery store one block away and buy a dozen for the same price.",,,

It's always busy at lunch hour, but the lines move very quickly.The udon and ramen here always hit the spot if I'm in the mood for it (esp. in the winter). They have delicious sandwiches as well, and a pay-by-weight buffet island in the middle (huge selection, but I've never tried it).Breakfast here is great too. They have the norm: bagels (veggie creamcheese!), bacon, eggs, english muffins, etc. - All very good.",,,
55,Patricia S.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,109,0,2.0,8/8/2010,"Is it sad that I come here like twice a week for lunch and I only gave it 2 stars??  I'd say both of those stars are purely out of convenience (it's like 2 blocks from my work buliding) and also the fact that yes, indeed, they do sell food.  It's edible, yes, but it's also terribly overpriced (thanks, Wall Street) and one time I got some meatballs there that tasted like glue and cardboard.  My old standby is the sandwich combo, where you can choose your sandwich (anything with sun dried tomatoes is fine by me), and it comes with a bag of potato chips and a pickle.  Sometimes my bf behind the deli hooks it up and throws in like 4 pickles and when I get back to work and open up my sandwich, I'm like WHOA LOOK AT ALL THESE PICKLES!!!!!",3,,1

One area that could use some help however, is the Ramen soup kitchen.  The soup is amazing and their line demonstrates that.  Get those guys some help.  The soup is a hit!",,,
58,Anton P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,0,5.0,4/8/2011,"After changing jobs to midtown, I have come back to comment on Cafe Water. There is a reason the sandwhich line is always 10 people deep, and CONSTANTLY moving. You won't wait on it for more than 15 minutes for a special order.This place is well priced, generous on portions, clean, quick and of course TASTES GOOD. I don't expect much from a lunch cafe sandwhich at under $10, but this is just right at about a $7 avg per sandwhich. They handle 3 orders at once with never an issue. Heck, for a good year I stuck to their grilled chicken wrap and lost weight thanks to it! I miss this place dearly. Take advantage of it you Wall & Water worker bees.OH, and anyone eating at buffets should not comment/rate. Ever.",,,
59,flora h.,"Plano, TX",0,3,6,2.0,3/10/2011,"I stay in Holiday Inn Express and this place is next to my hotel and very close to my company (2 blocks). I have tried this place 3 times. I really think they over price everything. If it is not rain during my lunch time today, I would prefer walk to other place to have my lunch.Their food is too salty for me. My lips always looks bigger after eat their food. The cashier next to the beverage refrigerator can not do simple mathematics. If you try to give them few more coins after they put the number in machine, they may give you wrong change. Be careful to make sure you get the right change.I hope I can find better place in this area soon and not come back again.",,,

This is a hidden gem of the downtown scene, and a surprise discovery-- you walk in, and have to round a corner of this vast run-of-the-mill salad bar to find the noodle line. Everything is made to order-- cooked fresh right in front of your eyes. And don't forget to help yourself to the complimentary little tub of daikon. I have to say, there's nothing more satisfying on a cold blistery day, no better way to bounce back from a heavy night out than a steaming bowl of spicy ramen...",,,

No matter how cold it is outside, I'll trek the 4 or 5 blocks to Cafe Water just for that hot tofu stew. Inside, the buffet, grill, and panini station taunt me and my attention is diverted for a quick second, but I bypass the masses and make a beeline for the back counter. After I place my order, I patiently wait off to the side for 10ish minutes while my seafood soondubu is stewing in a pot next to other pots filled with either tofu or ramen. When my order is called, I happily bounce over to the counter, take my container of soondubu and a little container of kimchi and bounce back to my office to enjoy. Sidenote: put the kimchi in the soondubu before heading back to the office because kimchi REEKS.",,,
62,Carla B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,1.0,2/4/2013,"For a business that serves and delivers food, they do a shitty job. On several occasions, they delivered the wrong order - even though I repeatedly asked them to make sure they send the right order. When I called to complain about their oversight, they had an attitude. When I asked to speak to the Manager, they hung up on me. When I called back several times, they refused to pick up the phone. Reading the other reviews, it looks like they have a problem with getting orders right. How hard is it to look at the order form and make sure the right food goes to the right place?  Hey, Water Cafe, It's not rocket science. If you can't get it right, or if you don't care to get it right, maybe you shouldn't be in business. Also, your food isn't all that. The only reason why people go there now is because all the other places around there are closed due to damage from Sandy.",,,
63,Chris H.,Hong Kong,173,603,2140,4.0,3/1/2009,"There's something insidious, yet alluring about the lunch buffet at your average deli.  For example, Cafe Water has a smorgasbord of Chinese style sesame chicken, pasta salad, fruit, veg and other vittles on display for the FiDi luncher.  The sheer variety is tempting, and an overly zealous gourmand may be lured by the buffet's siren song, grab a tray and go to town.I was lured into this trap on my first few visits, but found the food to be really greasy, overly salty, and seasoned with the microbial trail of passing diners.If you're a first timer, avoid the steam table, and go straight to the sandwich line, or for the more adventurous eater, the soondubu jigae (tofu stew) counter.  The sandwiches are made with precision, sliced to order deli meat, fresh bread and overall satisfying.  However, if you have a few extra minutes to spare, check out the Korean tofu stew station.Soondubu jigae is the treasured national dish of Korea.  A bad soondubu jigae is akin to a bad bowl of feijoada to a Brazilian, a subpar serving of moules frites to a Belgian or an inferior soba to a native of Japan.  Made in the back counter of a deli or not, my tofu stew should meet a certain level of quality.So I was pleasantly surprised to receive a steaming hot container of soondubu jigae, served with white rice (somewhat dried out), that was uplifting in the spice category, generous with the tofu, and lavish with the portions.  In fact for $7, it was way more than I could finish for lunch.  Given the location, price point and quantity of the portions, Cafe Water's soondubu jigae is quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch options.  A satisfying alternative to the normal regiment of Subway, Chipotle and Europa Cafe.More Cafe Water Coverage: midtownlunch.com/downtow…",4,4,3

They have everything you can think of from grilled chicken, to stuffed fillet fish, to slow roasted turkey. They have seafood: calamari, squid, shrimp, etc. They have tons of salad options, toppings, and dressing, as well as the standard chinese takeout buffet food. It's easy to watch those calories, or be a little indulgent if you feel like it. There are a lot of people down here during lunch time, but the staff is usually really quick at taking orders.",1,,

They make the sandwiches right in front of you and the ingredients seem pretty fresh. It's usually $7 or $8 for the sandwich, chips, and a pickle so pricing seems about average. The grilled chicken udon is delicious. They pack it with broccoli, mushrooms, tofu, carrots, scallions, etc and add spice if you like, for $7. The buffet is pretty average quality but it is quite large with sections for salad, fruit, meats, vegetables, etc. I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch.",,,

71,Tom M.,"Portland, OR",167,58,1,3.0,1/9/2008,"If you work on the east side of the Financial District, and need a decent place for lunch, then  I would recommend trying out Cafe Water.  If you get there at the right time, and pick out the ""reasonable"" looking selections, you can have yourself a great tasting, and mostly very nutritious lunch.  However, note that you can only really get the reasonable food probably between noon and 2pm.  I went once at 3pm, and there wasn't much at the buffet outside of the so-called ""Chinese food"", aka the soaked-in-some-variety-of-sugar breaded chicken and other similarly undesirable items (sorry, I have no place in my heart for dishes trying to pass off something that is mostly bread as an animal).  I ended up getting the last of their prepared 'chicken Caesar sandwiches' which was probably sitting around there since lunch, and was actually okay.  While I can not recommend you go around eating caesar salads (in a wrap), for the sake of your health, I can make the recommendation that if you were going to eat one, I think doing so at Cafe Water is a reasonable thing to do.  Going at 7pm one time, I wondered why they were open.  (They have some random things like drinks like a regular small market, in the back, so I guess that's what they could sell at that time.)  The price is reasonable.  $6/pound.  There is a good selection of ""real food"".  It seems that they always have large chunks of real turkey, which is the standard protein source for my Cafe Water lunch.  If you're a vegetarian, don't worry, they have beans in a bean salad that is not soaked in any creamy fats or any junk like that.  They have a pretty good guacamole which has chunks of avocado in it.  Also present is a random selection of cooked vegetables (I don't know how they are prepared, but there are chunks of bell peppers, mushrooms, egg plant, which are somehow cooked with an oil, hopefully not in a pan), and some raw vegetables in the salad bar.  One thing that really distinguishes their buffet is their selection of fruit at the end.  There is usually a ton of fresh and tasty blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, orange chunks, and I didn't notice them before, but I got some last time, but also, mango slices.",3,,1
