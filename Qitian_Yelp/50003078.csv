0,Olivia C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",81,35,7,5.0,11/6/2018,"I would definitely come back! I reserved a table, and had no problem getting a reservation the day of. We were seated outside, which had amazing views. My visit was during the middle of October, so the outdoor patio was covered, but they did have a small section that was uncovered so you could get an even better view! I only ordered wine, so I can't comment on the cocktails, but the glass was fairly priced (considering) and our waitress was friendly and attentive. Everyone I interacted with there was equally as gracious. Hopefully I can make another visit here during my next NY trip!",,,
1,Jerry M.,"San Diego, CA",73,100,11,5.0,9/7/2018,"This is our favorite rooftop bar in NYC with a unique, open-air view of Central Park (looking north). They have fans, heaters, rain guards, and an indoor area, so it's a year-round place. It gets a healthy after-work crowd, so get here before 6 to avoid the crush and maybe score some seats, but standing next to the railing gets you the best views. There's a separate elevator entrance, so don't go into the hotel. Drinks were very good but not amazing (not for craft cocktails). The spicy margarita was initially too strong and then walked back to be great. The second was also very good. The rosé wine was meh.Fwiw, rooftop places are like helicopter rides: don't do them if you're price-sensitive. The 3 dollar signs and ""rooftop"" should tell you a stop here isn't going to be cheap. That said, the prices here aren't bad and are well worth the view and ambiance.",,,
2,Athena C.,"San Francisco, CA",975,1589,723,4.0,8/18/2018,"NYC is not short of rooftop lounges and the Roof has the view of Central Park so it is definitely one of the top ones for me.The rooftop is beautiful and drinks are pretty delicious. I also got to try their finger food and everything tasted great. I didn't pay since it is a corporate event so I don't know exactly how everything costs. knowing NY and midtown, I am sure it costs an arm and a leg. Just like any rooftop bar in NYC, it is trendy, upscale and full of well dressed people. It is a fun place to pregame and experience NY rooftop with a nice view.",1,2,2
3,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,2.0,7/30/2018,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this place.The view itself is amazing. There's nothing to complain about there. The decor is also very nice and trendy, and the space looks pretty cool.That's about where the good things end, though. The service is awful. Awful! The bartenders are snarky and look annoyed no matter what you order. The drinks are small and overpriced. I don't mind paying a lot for drinks, but the quality (and size!) should match the price. These cocktails were weak and the kind of small that is finished in just a few sips.I originally planned on staying here for many hours and having a few drinks but left after one. It's a shame, because the view is great. I'll give it two stars for that alone.",1,,
4,Eric C.,"San Francisco, CA",148,48,97,2.0,6/21/2018,"This place has a fantastic view of Central Park but that's pretty much it. Drinks are very expensive (~20 dollars for a Tito's + soda) and god forbid that you order anything that isn't a mixer + liquor. Bartenders are rude and don't even hide their disgust if you order anything that requires them to do more than pour two ingredients in a high ball glass over ice. We saw one bartender serving a couple in front of us hand over the check and not-so-subtly point out that ""tip is not included"" after pouring them a glass of wine and opening a beer. This place gets super crowded after work in the summer as well as weekends and they try and cram as much people as possible onto the relatively small rooftop area. There are plenty of other rooftop bars in NYC that treat you better for less $$",3,1,1
5,Kristen T.,"New York, NY",613,129,507,3.0,7/15/2018,A bit pricey but great views and good service. Expect to pay $16 for a glass of wine and mixed drinks starting at $19. Did not try the food but looked like a decent selection.,1,,
6,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,2.0,5/14/2018,So this is probably an unfair review because I was there for five minutes but as soon as we walked in we saw that:1.This place is super small and was super crowded on a Saturday afternoon2. The crowd seemed quite pretentiousSo we left.But the view of central park was really nice.If I ever return I will update review.,4,4,2
7,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,248,947,3.0,5/20/2018,"Not one of the best rooftops in the city but still quite decent. It's not too spacious, has a decent view of Central Park. The cocktails were good but I felt they were a bit too pricey. I also ordered the fries which were really fresh and crispy. I really loved it! I really wanted to get a seat in the outside area but I guess the way table system works is you need to keep standing and wait for someone to get up rather than the server keeping a track of who comes first.  Would I be back here, maybe not. I think the city has a lot better to offer for these prices.",,,
8,Jacques I.,"Bellevue, WA",100,1311,2074,3.0,11/1/2017,"We came here after looking up rooftop bars, since there aren't many of them in Seattle and found The Roof.  Located in the Viceroy Hotel, we went up the elevators and were immediately greeted by staff once we entered.  On a Tuesday evening, all of the couches on the outdoor patio were taken yet we were able to snag the last empty table.  The view looks out over Central Park, which was nice.  And the experience here reminds you that you're in the big city, with dim lighting and modern furnishings.  Other than the view and experience - there's not another reason to visit The Roof, as drinks are expensive.  We all ordered a cocktail, which is priced at $19, so you're paying a pretty penny for the view.  For me, I had The Grand Spritz cocktail which was Grey Goose vodka, St. Germain, fresh lime juice, mint and prosecco.  I love Grey Goose, so was happy to find this cocktail on the menu, but was disappointed by the outcome.  I tasted more prosecco than anything else, and the drink seemed to be watered down with the lime juice, as I couldn't really taste much vodka.  I wouldn't order this again, especially at $19.  Overall, this is a fine rooftop bar that knows you're gonna pay more than you should for drinks because location is everything.  I'd most likely find a different rooftop bar to check out, if in the area again.",,,
9,Cece J.,"New York, NY",4,59,99,2.0,4/5/2018,"This is an OK rooftop bar if you're in the area. The actual view isn't spectacular but since it's in a less touristy area it's usually never too crowded, at least the few times I've been. The beers are way over priced even for NYC standards and a few of the waitresses have a bad attitude. The bus boys who were working extremely hard and were sweet ended up taking my order to deliver to our waitress a few times because she was avoiding us. Bad day maybe? Not sure since I've had the same experience a few times coming here. At the end of the day I will be returning though mainly because of convenience and location by my office for post work drinks with coworkers. Otherwise walk down the street to one of the other million bars in the city.",,,
10,Caroline Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",92,66,17,4.0,7/27/2018,"This place is great! A nice location right by Central Park, with a beautiful view looking over the park. This bar is very intimate, with candles and big, low couches. The only downside is that my first here gin&tonic was made with club soda instead of tonic water. It always upsets me when this happens because they're not the same and the bartenders shouldn't try to trick me!",,,
11,Dimitrios D.,"Queens, NY",71,372,407,3.0,1/31/2018,"The Roof is a decent rooftop bar.  It doesn't have incredible views, but the ones that they do offer are pleasant, and I liked that it was fully enclosed during the winter time.  The drinks were simply okay however, and at a high price point.  I had ""The Roof G + T"", and I can assure you it tasted like a gin and tonic from any other bar- perhaps just with less alcohol.  One cocktail also sets you back $19, which is just insane.  All in all, not a bad place, but I doubt I'll ever come back due to the price and utterly forgettable drink.",1,1,1
12,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",115,87,43,4.0,12/18/2017,This is a pretty nice spot to host a get together!! I don't usually come to bars close to 5th or 6th ave but this place was pretty nice with a some healthy appetizer options. Our friends hosted a birthday party and the service we received was top notch!! The drinks were made well and contained a fair amount of alcohol. The music selections was a mishmash of 90's with some current tracks sprinkled in...Give this place a chance...,4,1,1
13,Tonya J.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",48,404,5238,3.0,5/17/2017,"It's a Scene from the top of the Viceroy Hotel, packed tight with lots of socializing and very little real estate space for the outdoors which is mostly roped off and reserved for the high rollers who paid a premium to be seated on the roof deck. A small corner rooftop bar takes up some of the viewing space. From my point of view...Between the outdoors bar and the premium reserved space there really isn't much space to get a great view overlooking Central Park or to even stand around comfortably to schmooze, sit and or relax on the actual outdoors part of the rooftop especially during the warm weather. There's more space inside which is shrouded in dark wood, comfortable seating and conversation  tables for cocktails and lite bites. Their signature Cocktail  ""Without Fear"" is poured with strength. Very nice. In Summary....The scene is mobbed, rooftop outdoors real estate space is quite small, congested and at a considerable premium as is the cocktails, the interior seating is very dark and does nothing to lighten the mood. I'd consider going elsewhere if your seeking out Rooftop scenes, fabulous views, comfortable standing room for great conversations and awesome cocktails.",39,33,40
14,Amit J.,"Jersey City, NJ",1600,197,543,1.0,5/15/2017,"Visited The Roof as one of our stops during a night out in the City with some friends from out of town. We were in the area on a Saturday night and thought we'd check out a rooftop bar we haven't visited yet, so decided to check it out. - Atmosphere: The main attraction here is the rooftop, but unfortunately since it was raining, the outdoor patio was closed. We were hoping there was an enclosed area on the roof we could hang out on like some other rooftop bars do, but this one didn't. Not sure how great the views here are either judging from the view we saw from the window. The space was generally fairly small, and it was pretty dead when we arrived around 9:30 pm but picked up a bit later on. Nothing really stood out (music, atmosphere, ambiance, service, drinks, etc.) and was a fairly flat/ underwhelming experience. - Drinks: Drinks at The Roof are expensive, even for rooftop bars. I got a Moscow Mule (Absolute Vodka, Lime, Q Ginger Beer) ($19), which wasn't bad but certainly not worth the price. We certainly won't be coming back here again. The price of drinks, atmosphere, music, etc. is certainly subpar and frankly underwhelming compared to other rooftop bars such as the Press Lounge, Mr. Purple, RareView, 230 Fifth, etc. that have much better views, drinks and music all for a cheaper cost.",6,1,4
15,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,11/4/2017,"As far as NYC rooftop bars go, The Roof is just another one.  The space is pretty small and the view of Central Park is obstructed by 2 city blocks' worth of high-rises, many of which were eyesores under construction.  Plus, it's only on the 29th floor, so really you're not able to see much more than some treetops.That being said, there are many things I do like about The Roof.  Firstly, it's not crowded with tourists or B&T coming into the city for a sloppy night out.  I came on a Friday around 5:30pm and it was mostly suits just off work.  The atmosphere was energetic without being obnoxious.  Getting a drink with the bartender was easy, there was no pushing or need for shouting over too-loud music, and the staff didn't seem like they hated their jobs.  The drinks were expensive, but on par with what you'd find at most other rooftops.Getting a table outside on the patio furniture was a bit difficult, especially during the last weekend of nice weather in NYC.  We sat at an indoor table firstly (full service only), and then relocated when a spot opened up.  As the night wore on, the locals cleared out and tourists filled the place, but even then it wasn't obnoxious.  Overall, cute place for after-work drinks with friends or even a date.",5,1,1
16,Courtney C.,"Medford, MA",309,268,142,3.0,2/23/2017,"As far as rooftop bars go, this spot hits the mark. The view is incredible, even at night, and overlooks Central Park which is amazing.That being said, the view comes with overpriced drinks and a large crowd. We were told to wait downstairs until it cleared up a little. We ended up waiting about 20 mins, then headed upstairs through a pretty sketchy looking elevator. Once upstairs, the bar is amazing, and makes you feel pretty exclusive.This spot is a great place to take a date you are trying to impress! Worked on me, at least!",6,3,5
17,Lauren F.,"Boston, MA",51,283,71,5.0,9/7/2017,"This bar rocks!The drinks are expensive as a typical NYC rooftop bar (~$20 per drink), but delicious and worth it. My co-worker said he has the best Moscow Mule he has has here. Everyone was happy.Service was good and efficient.We got a bunch of appetizers all which exceeded expectations and were delicious, the crispy tuna was unreal and we ordered another round after the first order. The guacamole and the hummus were also incredible. Strongly recommend any of these.It was nice for a small group and it looked to be dog friendly as there was a pup sitting in a chair next to the couch.  I would totally come back.",,,
18,Alissa J.,"West Jordan, Salt Lake City, UT",23,90,57,1.0,6/12/2017,"The one star is earned because of the view. I was on a work trip and staying at the Viceroy, which I loved, and was told I had to check this place out. At this point I already knew that everything in the area is more expensive, and this placed followed suit. The lady bar tender was a snot and a half. When I told her I like gin and asked what she recommended I literally got nothing back from her besides annoyance with a gin and tonic recommendation. When I proceeded to not pick the most expensive gin I felt like she looked down on me. If I am paying over $17-$20 per drink I expect a real bartender who is into mixing and who is pleasant.",5,,
19,David T.,"Washington, DC",435,163,411,3.0,7/31/2017,Very dope view of Central Park from Midtown. It's a nice high rooftop bar on top of the Viceroy hotel. Don't plan on getting a ton of drinks here unless you're willing to shell out $$$.,,,
20,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,9/29/2016,I have been coming to the roof for awhile. I found out about this rooftop bar from my friend who's dad relegated the viceroy hotel  she told me that they put a rooftop bar upstairs. I like views. So I figured to give it a try. Here is my review. So the roof is located at the viceroy hotel. The door man James is amazing always hooks me up and takes really good care of me. I can text him when I'm about to leave and he has a car all ready waiting for me. People like him make places like this stand out. But anyways back to the bar. So this is like a rooftop lounge there is a inside and a outside. There is ping pong table inside. On the weekend there is a DJ inside spinning light music. They have a indoor and outdoor bar. Just a tip! The inside bar the drinks are a dollar cheaper than the outside bar. Lol. The roof gets crowded quick. During happy hour forget about getting a table or lounge chair. You have to ether reserve or come really early. In my opinion. The roof has the best public views of Central Park for a bar hands down. I have been to some private roofs on the UES. That have amazing views. But for a public roof it's one of the best. The drink selection. They have everything you can want. I think the drinks are expensive here. I usually get single malt here. The mccallan 12 yr old is $22 a shot. That's more than most places in midtown. They do have the 18yr and the 25yr as well. The bartenders and very nice to me. Security. Sometimes moves people out of the way for me. I come here like once a week maybe. The crowd is mostly young 21-29 years old. It's a combo of locals and people staying st the hotel. It can get loud and rowdy. If you get a table by the edge of the building. Just be prepaired to have people bumping into you. Or saying excuse me because they want to get a picture of the view. Or in my case a group of people want a photo and you have to get up. LolOverall. If you are looking for a decent drinking spot with some of the best rooftop views of Central Park. I would recommend coming here. I will be back,9,7,7
21,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,4.0,2/23/2017,"Very nice rooftop at the top of the Viceroy, with great views of Central Park and NYC buildings  including the back of the Essex house.The seating is comfortable both on the roofdeck and the lounge just inside.  I've been here a couple times with friends including recently on a record warm day in February and enjoyed the views and vibe both times.  My experience both times was off peak hours and sans any heavy crowds which I prefer.Drinks were great and so were the appetizers.",5,2,6
22,Elenie P.,"København K, Copenhagen, Denmark",0,6,1,1.0,3/24/2018,"I have stayed at the Viceroy hotel at least 6 weeks over the last 10 months with 70 colleagues and as such we have all visited The Roof almost every night over this period dropping significant cash each time. But today will likely be our last visit. The staff and manager at this bar have the worst customer service approach I've ever experienced. It is astonishing and as a 'NY local' I am embarrassed that my colleagues who fly in from around the world get this kind of experience when visiting the states! Further, after this many visits the staff still make minimal effort and serve us with such attitude and disrespect and clearly do not even recognize that we are return visitors even though we have been here this often (ie tonight was the 6th night we have been here this week). We definitely will be finding a new place going forward! Avoid the roof and goto the bar in the lobby at this hotel instead! Ps- my group wasn't allowed to move the tables together just now which was the final star and propagated this review, instead we need to sit with this gap between them because that's the 'floor plan' and we cannot move the furniture...‍",2,1,
23,Milliee F.,"New York, NY",391,43,75,5.0,8/26/2017,Amazing calm rooftop. I loved the type of music they played it was all fun music ! Me & my girlfriend definitely enjoyed ourself here.,2,,5
24,Naisha B.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,16,1,3.0,9/22/2017,"When you hear you're going to happy hour at The Roof your mind wanders to a rooftop bar with a phenomenal view, good drinks at decent prices. If that's what you're looking for do not come to this place! You'll spend $25 for an okay martini with an okay view. Most of the buildings within eye sight had construction. The crowd is a mix of tourists and wannabe executives. The bartender had no sense of urgency to serve myselfOr my boyfriend (could be that we were dressed casual as we both work remotely and don't always have to be dressed up) nonetheless I was not impressed. Literally not worth the $ unless you were looking for for half assed drinks with a mediocre view.",,,1
25,Vicky L.,"Houston, TX",151,557,3980,3.0,5/25/2016,"This rooftop lounge gives you a 180 degree city view experience atop the Viceroy Hotel at the 29th fl. penthouse. The elevators take awhile as it was shared with the hotel guests and all those who visit the lounge. On a Saturday night, the penthouse was packed but not to the point of uncomfortable. The drinks were typical city priced. A simple vodka lemonade was $20 while a coke and Jack was $16. There were tables both inside and outside with reserved signs but no one ever asked before taking one of the seats and no one was ever questioned either. The view outside was subpar, as the 29th fl. did not seem high enough. We also noticed the age group seem to fall somewhere young adults to middle-aged adults. None of us were afraid to mingle and the atmosphere was quite chill. The downside to the bar was that most of the drinks were not that inspiring...and the view really wasn't that great. Next time we might opt to try another rooftop lounge in Midtown or lower Manhattan instead.",1,,1
26,Joelle G.,"New York, NY",289,763,71,4.0,8/5/2017,"I came here with my cousin & best friend. Amazing place to chat & the view is spectacular.

27,Lucy C.,"New York, NY",131,1173,43,3.0,9/15/2017,"A very upscale rooftop bar with lots of space in a central location. A great time, great drinks, and great view. What more can you ask for? Maybe a better crowd.",,,
28,Barnik S.,"Dallas, TX",175,7,0,1.0,6/18/2017,Yeah this is your classic midtown douchey bar. Drinks are overpriced. Doorman was asking if he could let the girls in and leave the guys outside in our group. (Thought he was being funny but was actually just being a dick). My gf went to get a drink at the bar and the bartender was super rude. Gonna give her the benefit of the doubt and say she was having a bad night but this chick made a scene. Whatever the view the was nice. This is classic manhattan right here. Come bring your friends if you have a low self esteem and have a ton of money to blow for people treating you like shit. Good day!,6,5,
29,Jennifer S.,"Mountain View, CA",70,505,20,3.0,9/6/2017,"We were staying at the Viceroy and this was the bar at the top of the hotel.  Amazing views during the day time.  We came around 4pm and all the seats were taken so we had to stand which was fine as the views made up for it.

30,Carol L.,"New York, NY",729,392,1367,2.0,12/24/2016,"The occasion: my birthday! Myself and a few girlfriends were looking for a day time rooftop bar experience for a nice girls afternoon out, but the original rooftop we were hoping to go to was closed for a private event. We did a quick yelp search and found the Viceroy Hotel's ""The Roof"" in the area. We arrived in the hotel lobby around 4:30 PM on a Wednesday. It was swanky and very typical UES, so as a group of grad student girls coming in with our backpacks fresh from school we were given a few up and downs. It was rather disconcerting, but we gulped down our pride and moved on. The roof was on the 29th floor, and our ride up the elevator was fast since it takes you straight up. It was a pretty bar, with leather bar seats and plush couches inside and out. There wasn't very many people there, and we had a bigger group who did walk in but they let us take one of the outdoor couch table seats near the balcony even though it was reserved for another group later in the afternoon, which was nice. There were even blankets to use, since it was a bit chilly! Prices were typical Manhattan rooftop hotel bar, $13/$18ish for wine and cocktails, respectively. We split a bottle of rosé among the four of us, which was $52 (and probably one of the cheapest on the menu), and enjoyed the view. The view of Central Park was beautiful, and the tall buildings made stark contrast with the roads below. The service was kind of slow, and the wine was just ok. The crowd seemed to be mainly people who stayed in the hotel, veering on the younger end (late 20's, mid 30's). It just seemed kind of a cold, steely environment with the wait staff (seeing that we were students) seeming to not pay as much attention to us since we probably weren't as rich as some of the other patrons. It wasn't a very welcoming environment and I probably wouldn't seek out this bar on my own, but if I had a big group who strongly wanted to come I wouldn't be against it.",3,,1

32,Mandy N.,"New York, NY",1,5,14,5.0,12/27/2017,"I've gone to the roof many times. I've brought friends and business associates. I read the negative reviews and yes there are servers that will make you wait. However, if you ask for Tiffany you'll have drinks poring in until you tell her to stop. With that said to avoid all the aggravation of waiting over 30mins to get a refill, i strongly suggest you  immediately ask for Tiffany and if they push someone else on you just simply say no! Dear management please pass this on to Tiffany.Dear Tiffany,Thank you for going above and beyond. Demanding patrons like myself appreciate having a server they can trust. I'm coming by this week with a VIP client and I look forward to trying your cocktail suggestions. To the management of the roof:Your establishment has the perfect ambience. Please take people's complaints seriously. Having the wrong staff can make a break a business. I love The Roof and will continue to frequent there as long as you have servers like Tiffany.

33,Christy W.,"San Francisco, CA",1648,388,1584,3.0,12/18/2016,"As the name suggests, The Roof is a rooftop bar over-looking central park. I suppose the view is 100x nicer during the day because at night you can't see central park and the view is just so-so because of all the tall building that surrounds the Viceroy hotel. Three friends and I came around 11pm on a Thursday night and stay until 1am--there was an OK amount of people--enough to fill the small outdoor area. This bar is great for talking and catching up because the loud music is only in the inside area, so as long as you're outside you can't really hear the music. However, if you want to snag a seat I suggest coming around 10-ish or else you'll be standing. The drinks here are quite overpriced but it's totally expected from a hotel rooftop bar. I tried to order a Jameson tonic but, to my surprise, they didn't have Jameson. The bartenders don't seem to friendly either. Meh.",2,2,1
34,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",216,448,2742,3.0,3/20/2016,"My friend and I came here for drinks on Wednesday afternoon around 5pm and it was already so busy! The outside space was a lot smaller than I had expected and all the seating was taken. The bar is also fairly small and it took a while to get served. I understand that it is a rooftop bar, but I felt that prices were a bit higher than typical Manhattan prices at $18 for a cocktail and $15 for a prosecco. There was standing space outside, where we perched and took in the view. It would be helpful if they have a bar or shelf that you could put your drinks on while you stand, as if you need to do anything you have to keep hold of your drink or try and balance it on a plant pot! The view however, is pretty nice! Overlooking Central Park, it felt very open and relaxing. I would love to return when the leaves are green and the sky is blue, as it was a bit overcast on our visit. I bet it is a popular haunt in the summer and gets rather busy. It is however a cute little find and I'm glad I was able to go. Access to the rooftop is not through the hotel, but through what resembles a service entrance, further down the block from the main hotel entrance.",1,,
35,Amit K.,"Clifton, NJ",2,736,0,2.0,1/29/2017,It is on the rooftop on a small hotel. Not overlooking the park but decent view of park. It is open high but in winters it is shuttered and pretty warm.Lounge atmosphere and upscale look. The prices to match.The drinks were watered down and cocktails not really good. The bartender does not match what you would expect from a place that wants to be a destination.Good place to unwind if in the area or to impress tourists in the area.,,,
36,Mathilda L.,"Stockholm, Sweden",150,295,1418,4.0,11/16/2016,"Great hotel bar, not a rooftop but the view over Central park makes it equivalent to a rooftop bar. Same price range as any hotel bar, eg wine $14 and drinks €18. Since there is a shortage of these places around this area, I would guess it would become kind of stuffed in the summer/outside weather.Cozy inside area with low ceiling, leather stools etc. We came early in the evening looking for a quiet place where we could have a glass of prosecco, with a baby in a stroller. The doorman graciously let us stay until 7:30, and I guess it's around that time where the volume starts picking up..Would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a glass of red wine at the bar while reading a book. I know I will come back alone, and do just that.",2,2,2

First things first, you are paying for the view but, goodness, what a view you are paying for. The vista over Central Park is absolutely incredible, and you begin to see why people are willing to pay prices in the upper seven figures for apartments with views like these.The cocktails here are actually pretty good; I had the ""Without Fear"", a bourbon and apricot liqueur cocktail that was delicious and something I'd like to try at home. My friend and I also split some fries and sliders which were pretty good.Given the atmosphere the crowd was pretty friendly as well as cosmopolitan and we spent a lot of time talking with people-- at places like this people often can be a little snooty (or more than a little snooty), so that was a pleasant surprise. Aside for a lucky few, this is obviously not an everyday spot, but I'll be sure to return when the mood strikes for a good drink with an amazing view.",,,
40,SL H.,"Manhattan, NY",15,28,45,1.0,5/6/2018,"This review is for the Rooftop lounge only. I came here this past Wed night with my friends for a drink.  The rooftop has a beautiful view of Manhattan, the space is decent, was pretty crowded around 10pm. The drinks were okay, the service was horrendous. This is shockingly one of the worst experience i've ever had in this part of town, considering i'm paying $18/drink. The servers were dismissive and rude. At the end of the night, we asked the girl behind the bar for the check. First she completely ignores us. Then she told us we have to go find our waitress because they don't share the same duties. Wtf? I was so confused, i asked her if all the credit cards were held at the bar register, she told us she doesn't work with the waitress and she doesn't know where she keeps her checks (with eye roll). We finally find our waitress, asked her for the bill and to speak with the floor manager. She ignores us and goes behind the bar, the exact same register by the bartender, to get our check. Shoves the bill at us and walked away, thanks Chelsea. Good luck working for your tips girls. Friendly message to the Viceroy management team: if you would like to be considered a luxury establishment, please find some higher caliber staff. Im disgusted.",3,2,
41,Erin N.,"Southborough, MA",5,80,152,3.0,7/25/2017,"If you're looking for an upbeat high energy bar this isn't it. This was the first bar I went to on my 21st birthday. When we got there we were called over to the hotel door where there were 2 men checking ID they were nice and funny. Once we went upstairs it was practically empty, it was dark and so loud. We went over to the bartender and she recommend a beer and rosé to us. She told my boyfriend the beer was $10 and the frozen rosé was $20 when we checked the menu afterwards it said the beer was $9 and the wine was $19 she charged us $2 extra plus we gave her a tip. Normally no big deal but she didn't even make the drinks. Everyone who was there looked unhappy or bored, mostly couples. We left after one drink we because it was so lame. 3 stars because of the amazing view, and the drinks were good. If I ever visit New York again I'll probably go elsewhere.",,,
42,Michael P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",14,53,20,5.0,1/27/2018,Got an old fashioned and it was really good. Kinda of love getting a classic drink at a bar to see how they can make a traditional drink. Good environment and vibe overall. Loved it.,,,
43,Caleb F.,"Manhattan, NY",289,68,75,3.0,6/30/2017,Came here on a Tuesday at 6pm. The rooftop balcony was jam packed to the point where you felt like you were in college again at a frat party. Cocktails were definitely pricey at $19 but I was more than satisfied with the strength of my manhattans. You are definitely paying for the fantastic view which overlooks Central Park. The waitress was attentive and frequently stopped by our table to take orders.,,,
44,John W.,"New Orleans, LA",15,7,0,2.0,3/13/2018,"A nice enough hotel bar, but very overpriced for the drinks you get. It is warm and confortable, however, which is pleasant when the weather outside is blustery.",,,
45,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",140,204,438,4.0,6/27/2017,"I went here around 7pm and the crowd was a nice laid back mix; the view was really nice, it wasn't overcrowded, and the drinks were good (the drinks are expensive at $19 each but the waitstaff and environment made up for it, AMAZING service which includes the bartenders and the host/hostess as well). I'd definitely go back, especially considering most cocktails now cost $16 in NYC anyway so you might as well have a nice view and deal with a great staff. I will note that at night time (10pm and later) this place is probably much different as I'd imagine it's more of a lounge.",,,
46,Kathleen B.,"Lockport, NY",45,258,301,5.0,9/24/2016,"We came here for drinks and they had many options to choose from. I got the grapefruit tonic. It was very good and not too sour. The drinks were pretty pricey, but worth it in NYC to get the view you see from the outside of the bar. you are up 29 floors and at night it is breathtaking you can see central park and a wide view of the city. For the the view alone you should come here and get a drink.",1,1,1

48,Jan B.,"Newark, DE",38,76,682,4.0,7/23/2016,Had a great time here. Was conveniently located atop the hotel we where staying at. Drinks where ok. We ordered about 4 Old Fashions and 4 glasses of wine. However had to send a Whiskey Sour back because it tasted nothing like a Whiskey sour. Didn't really like how bartender tried to defend herself and made it a point to tell me she made it from scratch which in all actuality translated to me is she doesn't know how to make a drink. Other than that normal rooftop pricing. Great view. Good music. Nice decor. *Disclaimer* security will flag patron who seem to have had a few to many drinks as I seen a few people get handed their check complimented by a glass of water instead of another round that they anticipated.,3,2,2
49,Tony N.,"Syosset, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/25/2018,For some reason or another we end up here many times and every time it's never disappointed.

There are a couple tables outside, so if it is busy you will likely be standing.They have a good assortment of mixed drinks and alcohol. The pricing is a little high, but it is worth it for the environment and views. We had great service from the bartenders.

Not too loud so you can still have a conversation. Beautiful views of the city. Nice location. I was here on a Thursday night and the place was full, but not crowded. I'd definitely return! Beware of the cost of drinks though. This is a classy rooftop bar in the city - be prepared to spend $20/drink.",,,

The biggest downside was the super loud pumping music which really didn't fit in with the rest of the vibe. If that was toned down a bit, it would make it way more enjoyable.The views however make this place a must visit!",1,,

61,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1255,4.0,1/30/2016,I had this placed booked marked for awhile now so since i was having dinner in the area I came here for some after dinner drinks. The outside part was closed since it was a cold night but it was still a nice lounge. I really liked how chilled this lounge was and the DJ was playing some good tunes. I ordered a cocktail from the menu and it was pretty tasty and well made. One thing that I loved was that we were allowed to sit at one of the tables and just ordered drinks instead of having to get a bottle like some lounges do on a Friday night. I found that everyone that worked there was very nice.,9,3,5
62,Bo Y.,"Houston, TX",1155,461,338,4.0,4/29/2016,"On initial glance, this rooftop bar is gorgeous. Completely open terrace with a 180 degree view of the NY skyline, with a glistening bar in the forefront of your view, backdropped with rigid giant office buildings in the far distance. On a beautiful day, the scenery alone is worth a visit.They also have an inner bar lounge with leather sofas and cocktail tables. Reminds me of a country club lounge back in Texas. (I'm a Texan at heart, if you can't tell) I had a great time chilling for 2 hours here on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. They had a wide variety of whiskey including Basil Hayden, Blanton's, and the list goes on.$18/cocktail. Small space but then again, every aspect of NYC real estate is small, unlike Texas mwahaha. Crowd is mostly hotel guests on the Saturday afternoon I visited, but going towards 6pm, the young professionals and party go-ers started streaming in. It was hawt. Great place, stop by if you're in NYC.",1,,1

The drinks were good but the service from the bartender, Alexia, was miserable. We were intentionally trying to be nice since we've worked in a bar either as a server or bartender and she was awful. I personally had no desire to stay at the bar because of her attitude. i don't believe she is affiliated with the bar, but i've never had as horrible as a service as i did when dealing with Alexia. I don't recommend this bar to others if looking for a good time. She literally ruined the vibe for us and I don't intend on ever going back to this bar again.",1,,
64,Abe J.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/23/2017,"Upon arrival three of my friends and I were greeted by Alexia. She was the most rude bartender I have ever encountered. Let me also say, of the four of us, three are also bartenders in NYC. We each ordered 1 drink . Our bill was $100 for 4 drinks which was expected, because it's a rooftop in Manhattan. We left a $25 dollar tip for 30 seconds worth of service. Why you ask? Well, because we understand the industry. Because of her service I will NEVER return and will NEVER recommend anyone to come to this bar.",1,,

Nice place to go to any time during the day (around 5pm when they open when it's lighter outside, to late around closing time). Bouncers are knowledgeable about the different buildings in sight and are great at making people stop smoking. Every time I've been here I've had a great experience. Bathrooms are clean, which is always a plus. It's comfortable inside AND outside. They will also make a mimosa for you if you want one at 1am! Classy but casual to some extent.",2,,2

Outside, the actual roof is nicer in warmer months with the same patio seating year round. Winters in NY mean heat lanterns are needed. Sat outside in my sheer top ( didn't know we would be on a rooftop) 3 glasses of malbec kept me comfortable. Its breezy up there, some people had their coats on. I wish they would had a better, more attractive insulation system. The plastic/material they used as ""windows"" to shield the cold air reminded me of a construction site. nice space for a casual drink- Waitress was nice!",2,1,2

I told him I was drinking Jameson and beers. He recommended a cocktail called ""without fear"" I was skeptical at first. After a few sips I realized it was a balanced dink.

I feel like The Roof was the underdog of the summer. Located inside The Viceroy Hotel, you walk inside this beautiful hotel and go up an elevator to the top, get out and you feel as though you are walking into a cloud above Central Park. Amazing... Breathtaking views of Central Park, NY skyline and plenty of space to either sit and get cozy or stand by the ledge and dream. I found this spot to not be as pretentious as some of the other well known rooftop bars (such as 230 Fifth). Bartenders were chill, complimentary pretzel bites at the bar, decent prices for Lambrusco/champagne. Love their matchbook design ... Great spot that I can't wait to return to.

We ordered: Jalapeño margarita, cucumber margarita, a spritz-y drink and two Manhattans. Service was very quick. They were all nice and polite. Manhattan: well first of all, why didn't anyone tell me how strong these are??? Apparently this was a good Manhattan but I am just 21 and need to be gently welcomed into alcohol. I also had the spritz drink.... I don't remember what it was called but it was much better suited for my taste (basically bot being able to taste the alcohol haha). The jalapeño drink was just spicy enough. If you don't like spicy, don't get it. Cucumber was refreshing and not too strong. The views were wonderful. Granted, we came when it was raining so they did cover the patio. Thankfully, inside it was warm and cozy enough to shed some layers. Would absolutely come back.",,1,

92,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,3.0,8/2/2014,"Occupying the high ground is always an important tactic in military strategy. Battles are won and lost depending on who can secure the little round tops of combat. On the 29th floor of the Viceroy Hotel, The Roof provides its patrons with enough visual stimulation of Central Park and the surrounding environs that the space could very well be called ""The View"". (Enter the lawyers and lawsuits...)The after work scene is very different than the Saturday afternoon one. I've experienced both recently and each has its charms, along with a constant stream of charming attractive waitresses. While the necklines aren't plunging as much as at Haven, the waitresses are certainly part of the scenery.So what do you drink while atop The Roof? Despite the recent tensions between the US and Russia, I opted for a Moscow Mule, which has yet to be renamed a la ""Freedom Fries"" in the early 2000's. Served in a proper copper mug as it should, the mix of vodka and ginger beer was refreshing and light buzz-inducing enough for a summer afternoon. The drink menu is divided into a classic cocktail side and house cocktails where you'll find assorted creations like..margaritas and mojitos. Be prepared to pay for this God's like view over Manhattan at $18 a drink. It's a place where a quote from the Orson Wells' movie ""The Third Man"" seems appropriate.""Look down there. Tell me. Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?""Escaping the bubble of Olympian hubris and exclusivity that places like The Roof cultivate for a moment, there are far better cocktails concocted elsewhere and places with much more (indoor) space for the after work gatherings. If you do need a nibble, I recommend the grilled three cheese sandwich with ham, perfect for sharing. Such perfection had to be ordered twice when I visited last Saturday.Escaping the noise and pollution of Midtown by taking to the skies, a retreat to the Roof is in many ways an escape from reality, an ""Elysium""-esque split between two worlds that mirrors the split within the psyche. I'll certainly return for the views, nurse a cocktail and contemplate the laws of power as I gaze out upon the little ants that such heights and perspective turn us all into.",3,6,2

This bar was not up to par with our expectations of the Viceroy.  Service at the bar was terrible, the cocktail waitresses ignored us until we went to the bar ourselves to get drinks.  Then, when we wanted additional drinks, the waitresses again ignored us and stood around the bar.  They were doing nothing but standing around, I saw several other guests walk to the bar also.  I guess they thought they weren't working that night.  The drinks were good, but expensive.  We did manage to sit outside for a few minutes before the staff told us that they were closing the balcony.  On the plus side, the view is to die for, if you don't mind people ignoring you for service.",1,1,2

Although the ambiance and view of this rooftop bar was very nice, the service we received from our server was subpar. Lauren B, our server was very rude. Not only did she take her time getting to our table while she chatted up the tables around us, but when she finally reached us, she was very unwelcoming - almost as if it was an inconvenience for her to take our drink orders. When she did bring our drink orders, she slammed them down in front of us. We were pretty annoyed at that point but decided to give her the benefit of the doubt that she was having an off night; however, as we observed her interactions with the tables around us, we could see a clear difference in how she interacted with them - she was friendly, chatty, and very bubbly - not at all like the cold indifferent service we were given. Upon time to check out, she returned with my credit card. In a short and condescending tone she said, ""your credit card got declined"". (I received a fraud alert from my cc company due to all the shopping I have done this weekend in New York) Her tone and body language when telling me my cc was declined was absolutely disrespectful. She stood next to me and tapped my cc on the table as I got a different card out of my purse. I do not appreciate being treated like my presence was an inconvenience nor do I appreciate being talked down to and disrespected by my server.",2,1,1

97,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,4.0,6/6/2014,"The Viceroy tops off their lovely hotel with a classy rooftop bar, ridiculously good looking people, expensive booze, and an exclusive feel. The evening my party showed, there were three different prestigious asset management firms with reservations and closed off sections (including yours truly.) With a reservation/ generous tab minimum, the staff takes very good care of you. They have the menu memorized and are happy to give recommendations (which were spot on). Drinks were refilled every 20-30 minutes. Finger foods kept you munching and happy with a good balance of salt, fat, and heft. Messes are cleared quickly. Staff defend your reserved spots so you don't have to talk to strangers. They do amazing jobs of keeping you happy and inebriated. The view of Central Park is nice - but there are better places to go for the view. This is more a place to schmooze, see and be seen, and blow lots of cash. Drinks and food are tasty. But without a reservation and an expense account, I would have a hard time wanting to be here at popular times. The space was incredibly crowded, and with drunken trophy wives teetering in six inch heels and glasses of red, I'd watch your toes and your white shirts. If you can get here at an off hour, it would make a great day drinking date location.",6,3,2

Ultimately, due to the rude bartender, who I gather from other reviews is a mainstay, we will not return.",,,

Yup Central ParkThe the middle age women show up, now the place smells like desperation and white diamonds Oh have I mentioned that we haven't seen our waitress in a half an hour but heck who need overpriced drinks we can see Central Park I guess if hanging out with mid level executives and desperate women are your thing you will love the horrible service and the view of Central ParkFor the rest of the free world ..

100,Adi R.,"Los Altos, CA",56,115,8,2.0,11/13/2015,Apart from the view this roof top cocktail lounge/bar is pretty average. You might end up waiting 40 mins for a cocktail waitress even though the place is empty. Drinks are pricey... which is fair because it is a rooftop in Midtown but the quality of cocktails is worse than an average Pig'n Whistle Irish pub.

It is basically a tiny box. Once we stepped out of the elevator it was extremely underwhelming. I was excited to take in the views, but was informed that the patio was closed for ""construction"". Another staffer said it was closed because the ""floor was slippery."" We ordered a beer and a Kir Royale which was $29.  I understand this is New York, but where in the world is a Kir Royale $20?? The bartender was less than friendly. He looked bothered. I feel that as guests of the hotel we can at least grab a seat. This is not so. We were asked to move for a reservation.

My friend Q and I were in regular clothing, but was still treated kindly. One gin and tonic was 16 bucks, but worth it bc of their top tier liquors. It wasn't overly packed for a primetime late night Friday, which is always good, in my opinion, as I can't handle overly packed arenas and much prefer more intimate environments.Yes, the music was a bit too loud and the drinks may seem a tad expensive, however the view was phenomenal.

No hoity toity dress code, breathtaking views of the city + the vastness of Central Park, and refreshing libations. The drinks are NYC-priced but they are delicious. The Roof is split into two sections, one indoor and one outdoor. The tables can seat 4, comfortably but here's a tip: if there are just two of you, you can invite another 2 to your table so that they have a better experience sitting vs. standing waiting for you to finish. The tables are big enough for you to have your own conversations and also share :). People are vultures when it comes to snagging a table, so be ready!And once you do get a table, be mindful about the time you spend there -- photos, check-ins, instagram hashtags...they all add time and other people are waiting.Snap pics, post em later, and be in the moment!Have fun! :)",1,,
111,Corey C.,"Astoria, NY",30,117,4,3.0,6/1/2015,"What you see is what you get, but is The Roof worth the price?The view is beautiful. The Roof can be found at the top floor of The Viceroy - when you get out of the elevator you get an indoor bar where the northern end opens up to an outdoor patio that gives you a lovely view of Central Park. I went on a Thursday night where it was moderately busy (since it was the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend I imagine it was less crowded than usual). We appreciated the view for a bit but had trouble finding a regular place to cram ourselves in the outdoor area, so we spent most of the time at an indoor table right next to the patio.Based on the limited amount of seating (which was basically all reserved) I would not imagine an opportunity where you can happen to go there and the place would be empty enough where you'd be able to sit down whether you're indoors or outdoors, so plan on standing the entire time. The service was slow. I believe there were only two bartenders on staff, and both times we went for drinks we waited roughly five minutes before we got to talk to either of them. There were a bunch of people waiting by the bar, but not enough to constitute a long wait, especially since the cocktails were mostly pre-mixed. Another odd thing was that they didn't have any menus available or any cocktails posted up for people to see, leaving you three options: wait five minutes to ask for a drink menu and then five more minutes to flag down the bartender again, order a standard drink, or (in my case) hope you read the menu online ahead of time and can remember what they offer.I ordered The Walking Dead, a tequila cocktail that was okay. All of their cocktails are $18 (fun fact: they're only $16 if you order the same thing at Kingside, The Viceroy's ground floor bar where you're more likely to get a seat). The rooftop environment is beautiful, but the slow service and lacking of seating in my opinion don't justify the higher price. If I were to re-visit The Roof I'd at least just stick to the beers, which are in the much more reasonable $8-$9 range.",2,1,

I don't think I've ever sent back a cocktail in my life, but this one went straight back to the bar. The server seemed surprised, she said it should be good... because they batch them. That's right, a ""cocktail bar"" that evidently batches their negronis and who knows what else. I was actually speechless. As a bartender myself, I was shocked at this admission. I ordered another cocktail, I don't even remember what, and it was equally as terrible, so I got a bottle of beer instead. How disappointing. On top of all that, they had the nerve to charge me for both cocktails... one of the girls I was with convinced me not to make a scene, but I was pissed. We got half off the bill because her friend works there so I guess it was a push. I cannot immediately think of a worse experience at a bar in the city, and when the price is considered... it goes without saying that I'll never be back",2,1,

Instead, there is flirting and drinking and smoke breaks. Just like the patrons. Not cool. I've worked outdoor bars; it sucks to watch other people have fun, but it's the job you signed up for. The last time I was there, empty glasses were ignored for so long, they lost out on another round. The space itself is silly - there is probably more space indoors than out, so outside is packed and the dark, cavernous interior is empty. And sort of smelly. The view is alright, but as others have noted, it's not the tallest building in the area.Are you looking for a view? Go hit up Press Lounge. Thank me later.",,,

142,Nishan K.,"New York, NY",258,199,6,4.0,3/12/2014,"I got a chance to attend the grand opening of the newest rooftop bar in Midtown Manhattan yesterday.  The Roof, which is located on the penthouse level of the new Viceroy Hotel (opened in October 2013) is undoubtedly going to be one of the hot spots this summer. As with all rooftop bars in NYC, the atmosphere is generated by the tremendous views of the skyline.  The Roof is fairly unique in that it also has beautiful views of Central Park. It will be a great place to be in the Spring and Summer because the expansive greenery of Central Park will be on full display. It will also be beautiful in the Fall when the leaves start changing colors. While Central Park is certainly the main attraction, the Roof also has great views of the Time Warner buildings and the new One57 condo building (which is still incomplete, but nonetheless a very distinctive skyscraper).  My friend and I were literally the very first two customers, so that's kinda cool.  We sat down on the terrace outside, which has several couches and table tops. The terrace is fairly small, so that's one downside.  It lends itself to an intimate environment, but I can see it getting very crowded once the word gets out and that means it will likely be very difficult to get inside without long waits.  But we shall see.  There is a sizable indoor area as well, which is very nicely decorated. But when it's beautiful outside, everyone is going to want to be on the rooftop terrace.  The staff was beyond attentive.  Our waitress came over numerous times to make sure our cocktails were to our liking and also made sure that we didn't have empty glasses throughout the evening.  The managerial staff also came over several times just to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  Granted it was the grand opening, so that level of customer service is expected.  But it was very much appreciated and I hope that level of attentiveness continues throughout the year.  The cocktails were delicious. I tried the Spicy Paloma and the Manhattan and they were both very good. My friend had a Dirty Martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (called the Chicago).  She said it was excellent.  A second downside is that cocktails are very pricey.  $16 for a cocktail (that is not made in a speakeasy) is quite a lot in my humble opinion.  However, it's Midtown Manhattan and the Viceroy Hotel is a swanky new hotel, so those kind of prices are not unexpected.  If you're on an expense account and taking clients out for drinks after work, the Roof is a great place to go.  If you're not, well, just be mindful of the tab you're running because it's easy to guzzle down several cocktails while sitting outside and taking in the beautiful views.",2,,1
143,Logan A.,"New York, NY",97,44,25,4.0,3/28/2014,"This could be my new go-to rooftop. I stopped in today for the first time for a glass of wine with a friend, because it was so beautiful outside, and I enjoyed myself. There were two bartenders working, a male and female, and while the male wasn't very friendly or approachable, the female was delightful and knew her stuff. When my friend asked her about the Monkey Shoulder Scotch Whiskey they use to make a specialty cocktail, she gave the entire story behind the name of the brand. Pretty neat. We didn't eat, so I can't speak for the food, but the beautiful views paired with a nice glass of wine can't be beat. The prices are NYC prices ($13 for my glass of Sauvignon Blanc) but you're not just paying for the drink, you're paying for the experience. They are still fairly new, so the rooftop wasn't too packed. It may be a little selfish, but I'm hoping it stays that way through the spring.",1,1,1

We had the chance to sit down at a table (even though it said reserved, they let us sit), the server was amazing, the environment was a little more tame which was nice because the six of us were able to have a good chat. The staff in the lobby was super nice as well. My only qualm with this place is that it really wasn't busy but it took 30 minutes two separate times to get our rounds of Moscow Mules, how is that possible? If it's because there was only one bar tender then that's awful management and staffing by the bar, if it's the bartenders fault....well, then it's still the fault of the management for either not training properly and maintaining inadequate people employed in a high stress, fast result position. Oh, the rooftop closes at 2am, so you're hearded back inside for the last two hours the bar is open. So no late night cap drinks outside if that's what you fancy.",,,

Needless to say, the experience wasn't a very good one because I think I met the worst waitress in NY! Lauren B seemed to be very bothered by our presence. As if we were disrupting her busy service for all the other guests! She seemed very nice and chatty with all her other guests while she barely spoke one or two words to us. It made me wonder, was it because we looked younger than the other guests? Was it because we were Asian? She definitely had a problem with us as soon as we sat down!

This one star review is a reflection of our server and not the establishment.We were here 10/23/16 for appetizers and drinks. Although the ambiance and view of this rooftop bar was very nice, the service we received from our server was subpar. Lauren B, our server was very rude. Not only did she take her time getting to our table while she chatted up the tables around us, but when she finally reached us, she was very unwelcoming - almost as if it was an inconvenience for her to take our drink orders. When she did bring our drink orders, she slammed them down in front of us. We were pretty annoyed at that point but decided to give her the benefit of the doubt that she was having an off night; however, as we observed her interactions with the tables around us, we could see a clear difference in how she interacted with them - she was friendly, chatty, and very bubbly - not at all like the cold indifferent service we were given. Upon time to check out, she returned with my credit card. In a short and condescending tone she said, ""your credit card got declined"". (I received a fraud alert from my cc company due to all the shopping I have done this weekend in New York) Her tone and body language when telling me my cc was declined was absolutely disrespectful. She stood next to me and tapped my cc on the table as I got a different card out of my purse. I do not appreciate being treated like my presence was an inconvenience nor do I appreciate being talked down to and disrespected by my server.",,,
152,Paul K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,46,0,3.0,8/4/2014,"The place is quite small (both outdoor space and indoor space). Usually the indoor part should be a lot bigger but for some reason, they are both the equal size, roughly 1000sq ft each. So think of a one typical manhattan one bedroom condo with a decent terrace that you tend to find in a lot of new developments that are being built around the city. The hotel isn't tall enough to have an obstructed view... Only glimpse of Central Park is about 30 yard space between the ESsex house and the similar sized co-op building on Central Park South. This isn't a place you mark as favorite as just go. It's more a place you fumble into or end up going only bc someone requested to meet you there.",,,

They never texted us, so after about 40 minutes we went back and they let us in no problem. When we told them we never got a text, their response was ""oh, the phone died and is charging."" ... What? Anyway, we made our way up. The space was crowded and a little tight but not terrible. I suppose most rooftops get like this during the after work hours. Half of the rooftop was sectioned off for a private party and there's not much space up there to begin with. The views were pretty good but I've seen better. Cocktails go for around $18 and beer and wine for $13-$15. Glad we went, but not sure I'll go out of my way to come back.",,1,

What I didn't like was that the place was packed with suits, tons of business people who looked like they got off work and wanted to clog the lounge. We didn't get the luxurious lounging experience we expected. At least they don't charge a cover. But what really did it was the fact they had a DJ playing some decent tunes, but once two of us started to dance (no contact dancing meaning we were not getting ratchet) we were asked not to.

166,Michelle G.,"Miami, FL",67,48,2,1.0,6/22/2014,"Where to begin? My fiancé and I are staying at the Viceroy in New York for exactly seven days. We have traveled here from Miami but are no strangers to the so called 'High life'. THIS SO CALLED LOUNGE IS APPALLING. It is hard to tell if it is Viceroy downgrading themselves due to the changes they have made at the Miami location or if it is simply wannabe elite staff members. We visited the roof earlier this evening to relax. When we arrived we were shuffled to a different table even though the one we had seated ourselves at had absolutely no reserved sign, we were notified that we had to move. Once moved we opened a tab and were planning on dropping a substantial amount of money here. We began ordering their poor excuses of cocktails and bar food. Shortly after we were told, along with everyone else that we must go stand by the bar by a snooty red head. Apparently their was a party of greater importance arriving that needed the whole balcony. Not only was everyone caught off guard due to failure of notice, everyone seemed insulted. This 'important party' was a giant group of 9 - 5 employees. I'm sorry, but when you push out the residence of the area, and clientele that is self made for some group of employees, your priorities are not straight. Due to the attitude of the staff I will not be returning at all during the rest of my stay. Not only do they need a reality check, their bartenders need to learn how to make a decent cocktail. They are counting on the view to bring them business but all they receive is wannabes.   Do yourself a proper favor by forgetting this place and going downstairs to Kingside. Not only are the cocktails much stronger, the food is absolutely delicious!",4,,1

It's dimly lit with candles in a very romantic way, and we would have sat there if it wasn't such a nice night. I could see it getting crowded easily, but we went the summer it opened so not that many people knew about it yet. There's an indoor and outdoor bar as well and the bartenders were very helpful. Outdoors there are cushions and low tables as well as high tables and chairs you can sit at. It was cozy and romantic. The drinks are definitely overpriced but the Old Fashioned ($18) was really good and had a lot of flavors I wasn't used to. This made the drink interesting. The least expensive drink you can order is a local beer ($9). I wouldn't order more than 2 drinks, but it's a great spot and they also have bar food like hamburger sliders.",,,

171,J. S.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",4,6,9,1.0,10/22/2015,"On June 26, 2015, my coworkers and I decided to meet at The Roof after work for drinks because it was my last day on the job and a few of my co-workers wanted to treat me to drinks. I spoke to Caitlyn the manager (who I would soon find out was actually the hostess). Since it was a group of us she offered me a table for $1500, which I declined. She then presented to me the idea of getting a table for $1000, which I also declined. I explained to her that my friends were here to support me and we would be buying drinks from the bar. Caitlyn came back and says she wants us to be comfortable and she has a group leaving and we can sit at their table. We began ordering through the waitress and some people from the bar. Our waitress seemed confused when some people went to close out their tab on what they ordered. She said she thought it was all going to be on one bill. I told her Caitlyn sat us here and that we were all doing this separately. An hour and a half later Caitlyn walked over with a tall gentleman with medium shoulder hair and asked to speak with me. She asked if I was having a good time and introduced the tall gentleman. She began to tell me that our waitress was new and having separate cards and bills was overwhelming for her. I told her again in front of the gentleman that everyone was buying me drinks and that I was not paying for anything but we can try to minimize it and that some people were going to the bar anyway. One of my coworkers asked if I was okay and I explained what Caitlyn said. So he said give her my card to order the food that we wanted to order and they would give me the cash for it. I gave Caitlyn my card and she said thank you for understanding and walked away with the gentleman. Throughout the night more people stopped by, some left but they all were buying me drinks from the bar. Our waitress stopped by our table and she asked if we needed anything else to drink and suggested we buy bottles because it would be cheaper. I said no we are fine and pointed around stating that everyone is drinking something different and ordering from the bar so there was no need to. When we were ready to leave my friend Fabiola requested the bill. She brought it over to me and said Jae this says 1300 dollars. I looked at it and told our waitress it was wrong. She said that there was an open bar minimum of a 1,000. I told her but we didn't order any drinks from you and we did not commit to an open bar. I told her I did not agree to this and asked to speak to the manager. She pointed to the manager Eric who was already on defense as I approached him. He told me the only way I could have been sitting at that table is if I had a minimum bar tab of 1000. I explained to him what took place and told him Caitlyn sat me here earlier that night and I made no such agreement. He said I had a group of people and they normally do contracts for the open bar but I did a verbal contract with Caitlyn and he was right there when I did. I said no you was not there and told him get Caitlyn. In his presence I asked Caitlyn her about her sitting me at the table she answered honestly about our previous coversation and that she sat me at the table and I did not agree to a table minimum. She even stated that he Eric wasn't the man standing with her. He said it does not matter what she said he is the general manager. I told him to give me my card I will pay cash for what I ordered which was food only. He said no and told the waitress to swipe my card. He then said to me it was too late and I should dispute it with my bank. I told him it was illegal for him to swipe my card without my permission.  He then said take it up with my bank then asked security to escort me to the elevator. I came back the next day to speak to a manager and I met with Russell who said that he wasn't there but that he would follow up as to what happened and to see if he could try to get me an itemized receipt. He called me a day later and said he was told that I had agreed to it. I said I did not and explained everything that happened that night. He told me call Monday and request the bill. I called and Caitlyn picked up the phone. This was the manager Caitlyn who went on vacation and just got back not the hostess Caitlyn like I was lead to believe that night. She said she was sorry to hear that and she asked me for the date, the estimate time and my email address. She took down my info and said she would send it to me via email. To this date I have not received anything from them. The perceived prestige caliber of the establishment somehow does not transfer over to management. The way the General manager treated a few of my coworkers and I was disgraceful, humiliating and dehumanizing.",,1,

175,Rachel C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,46,0,2.0,3/21/2014,"The Roof just opened. Its located on top of Kingside Hotel and has great views of Central Park. Its small and rather loud inside but has a great outside area that should be great once the weather gets nicer. While all the articles I read/pictures I saw indicated that they would have heat lamps/stands outside, they didn't have them out last night and said they didn't actually have them yet but would soon. The blankets they provided didn't really warm us much so we ended up ditching the outside area to huddle around a tiny table inside. Getting the attention of the staff was difficult to do. The food was not good. They don't have a lot of plates to share and the ones they do have offer tiny portions and most of our food was burned e.g., kettle chips and grilled cheese. It also took forever to get the food. They had full sized burgers-they didn't have fries? and salads on the menu but no sliders etc. Drinks were expensive, $14 to $16 for cocktails, but thats to be expected in NYC. Overall, it seems like once the weather is nicer it will be a great spot to go to and enjoy some cocktails. But unless they revamp the food items, not great for a group happy hour.
