0,Saehee Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0.0,4.0,10/23/2018,"Decent all-day brunch place where you can feel 'American nostalgia'.I visited this restaurant for a brunch plate with a friend at 5 pm in one windy evening. This place is a typical America all-day brunch place which I saw in movies but I was pretty excited because I am not an American. Everything was as I expected. Servers were nice and cared about my empty mug. Big red signs saying FRESH&DELICIOUS and yellow pendant lightings evoked a retro mood. Music and atmosphere were lively and warm.    We ordered typical diner brunch menu - Lumberjack (Pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs) and French toast with additional fried eggs, plus a piece of apple pie for a desert. I liked their way of using chunky apple slices. If you ask for whipped cream, a server comes with an aerosol whipped cream can and spray out the cream on the plate. It was fun. Food was overall delicious and authentic, and portions were generous.I'll have 'egg cream' for my next visit when the weather gets colder and darker.",,,
1,Joseph M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,41,2,1.0,11/1/2018,"#1I eat breakfast, and lunch sometimes, here everyday when I visit NYC each year. It's fine and I'll continue. But they need to remove the boldly printed sign at the register asking customers to use cash, not credit, for bills under $20. I don't carry cash when I'm visiting - anywhere. And the reason is obvious they want more cash to keep ""under the table"" at the expense of customer convenience. Remove that sign! #2They make SURE you know the tip is NOT included in the bill. Good grief....stop it already! We know that!",1,,
2,Brittany C.,"North Branford, CT",0,5,0,1.0,7/25/2018,"NOT VEGAN/VEGETARIAN/ALLERGEN FRIENDLY!I went with a friend to the Metro Diner. I'm vegan, so when I order I make sure to ask a bunch of questions. I ordered the pasta primavera and Matzo ball soup. Asked if either was prepared with dairy, butter, chicken stock, etc. The waiter went to the kitchen to ask and came back and told me they use veggie stock. Great!When I got the matzo ball soup, I could tell it was chicken broth based. So I gave it to my friend. When the waiter delivered the pasta I double checked, no dairy, butter, chicken stock? Nope! So I ate it and found multiple pieces of chicken in the dish! Chicken wasn't even on the menu! The waiter insisted that it was garlic.... I decided not to finish the meal to be safe. When I went to pay, the manager was standing there and I asked what the matzo ball soup was made with and without hesitation, he responded, ""chicken stock"". I said I was told differently. So I mentioned that I had found chicken in my supposedly vegan dish. He said, ""well maybe they used a little bit of chicken broth. What do you want me to do about it?"" He became a bit angry and eventually agreed to take $4 off my $16 meal... I asked if he thought that was fair considering his wait staff lied and completely disregarded my dietary preferences and he just walked away in a huff.I wouldn't have minded if there was nothing on the menu for me. I'd rather the wait staff be honest with their customers. It was just a really disappointing experience especially with the restaurant's manager.",,1,

If you're looking for a typical diner with everything that that included - like refill coffee (served in a robust mug), breakfast all day, huge portions and loads of choices of less healthy food - this is your place!! I'm not a huge fan of places like that, but sometimes this is all you can manage. Plus, Metro Diner is 1 block from my apartment, so it's very easy and convenient.. Prices are fair, service is fine.. For a diner; I like this place! :)",1,,1
5,Emily M.,"New York, NY",127,93,138,3.0,2/3/2018,"I ordered from Seamless. Delivery was on time, although the milkshake was melted. Unsure if that's because of Seamless or Metro, but for $6, I'm not thrilled about it. Fries were so-so, but the veggie burger was large and the toppings were fresh. They threw in a ton of ketchup as I requested. It was fine, but it's still $18 for an okay burger, bad fries, and a melted milkshake.Pros: Large portion of veggie burger that is made in-house, on time deliveryCons: I am reaaaally not impressed by the previous reviewer's experience regarding kitchen accountability. Until that has been address, I will not eat here again. Fries are mediocre at best, milkshakes are overpriced.",1,,

The place is really nice and pancakes are awesome! Again, not an expert but I really liked them and they were huge, with lots of butter and corn syrup to be added if want toStaff is nice and friendly, they refilled my coffee and service was fast and efficient. Prices are fair for New York, I had pancakes with coffee and orange juice with the breakfast deal and spent around $10 + tip, but you can have cheaper and smaller option if you're not interested in big breakfast; there are muffins and scones which looked really good for 3 bucks. Of course there's also eggs, bacon etc. but I haven't tried it.. So go for it, it's a no brainer! Just note, as someone else said, there's probably no vegan/vegetarian option and I'm not sure about gluten-free for people with celiac disease, ask before sitting!",,,

25,Paul S.,"New York, NY",128,87,1285,4.0,3/5/2016,"It's a solid breakfast, lunch or dinner place in this Upper West Side neighborhood. Metro has always been my go-to-place for breakfast or lunch with friends or family. Their breakfast items and blue plate specials are standard selections.The space is huge and there are some great booths in the back with the cool retro decor. Last time I visited for lunch with a few friends I sat close to the entrance in a circular table sitting six people.The menu is huge. For any classic diner, you can order anything under the sun in regards to standard diner fare. I suggest people to look for the blue plate special which is an American diner's standard low priced daily special item. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl…I am not sure if they have blue plate specials on the weekends because I usually go to Metro on the weekdays. My sister-in-law who visited from outside of NYC loved their pancakes. Over the years, I have taken many out-of-town relatives and it has always been a hit.Service is spotty. They can have attentive servers and there are also some bad ones. Most of my experiences have been positive. It is a diner so my expectations are usually pretty low. This past lunch was relatively friendly and efficient. Finally, the food is always pretty large portions. My blue plate special, eggplant parm was very tasty and I even took some home because it was such a large portion.Very solid option. Hopefully I will be back soon.",5,3,

27,Truc N.,"San Francisco, CA",196,227,744,2.0,5/24/2016,"The atmosphere is homey, vintage, a traditional no-frills American diner. Cream, butter and smuckers jam comes in self serve packets. I know it's breakfast, brunch, diner food, so I don't expect bougie but the quality isn't that great at the price with most mains being $12+. The menu is extensive but perhaps they'd do better at paring it down and nailing a few dishes. The food tastes really bland and flat in flavor. Waiter was fairly nice and refilled my coffee quickly.  They were fast at getting the food out quickly with no errors after we ordered. I didn't experience any sourpuss waiters, he was quiet, not too pushy, and nice. I ordered the special lunch, goat cheese, and asparagus egg white omelette. The portion size is generous with a heaping pile of sweet potato fries. Ingredients tasted dull and not fresh or flavorful. The best part was the goat cheese filing inside, savory light but very salty and perhaps too much of. My friend's frittata seemed overcooked and similarly flat as well. Egg dishes aren't that overly complicated and if I'm paying for convenience, there's got to other diners on the scene that can nail the basics.",1,,

Updated review","Rude angry uncooperative staff who take delivery orders. Will never order from here or eat here again. If you ask for separate checks ( charge cards) they are angry. And from first contact over phone the men who answer are gruff and in a bad mood. Unacceptable! Worst and last experience was man who took order did not know how to run a perfectly valid credit card! Kept insisting it was invalid. Checked with bank, nothing wrong with card. Tried one more time to ask card be run again ( we were a party of three making a substantial order) and the man REFUSED to run it again! We cancelled all orders already placed and ordered from the Manhattan Diner. What a difference! Polite patient professional. Ran card with NO problem!  Food much better than Metro. I called the Metro manager when he was in and told him of our experience. He knew who was working that shift by the time we called. Naturally took my name and number, apologized, and never followed up. Goodbye Metro! Not only is the staff a joy to deal with at the Manhattan Diner but the food is superior in taste and portions. Lesson learned: the customer is always right. It's your money and you are the boss. Never put up with rudeness and incompetence   Take your money and your business elsewhere!",1,3,

37,Rosey A.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/8/2018,"One of the waiters here is so rude. He literally said to my friends and I that he ""was getting complaints [about our noise]"" and that ""this isn't a club it's a restaurant"". He proceeded to slam several menus onto a table, for added effect I guess. Firstly, there are about 2 other people in this DINER, and there is no reason to smack the menus in such a fashion. Other than that our waitress was very kind and caring. The food is average, I've definitely had better diner food than this.",,,

40,AP A.,"Manhattan, NY",3,42,5,1.0,8/7/2017,"It's a diner, so my expectations were not that high to begin with, but I've decided it's not just worth the trouble (and money) to try to eat here. I've gone a few times, and every time, the service was mediocre, and there were issues with the food. The waiters/waitresses act bored, impolite, unhelpful and/or are not able to communicate well in English. If you try asking the other staff for help (e.g. they were out of soap in the women's restroom - why are you out of soap?! Don't you check the restrooms? Clearly they don't care...), they speak NO English. Re the food: we've had our share of undercooked, overcooked, sloppily presented dishes, and honestly I trust nothing that happens in that kitchen. Yesterday I had the fried chicken wings, and when I started to eat, I discovered they were basically raw inside, complete with blood on the plate. When I called the waitress over (with great difficulty, as she preferred to chat to another table about her pregnancy), she said she would tell the kitchen to ""make it with less blood"". I didn't know if to roll my eyes or yell at her stupidity (HELLO, raw poultry is a danger, health-wise!! Jesus, people, you work in a restaurant...), but then she added ""they don't care, in the kitchen, cause it's us that have to deal with the customer."" HUH?! ""They'll care if they get slapped with a lawsuit because someone gets Salmonella!"", I said, hoping to shed some light on the matter. She looked bored and replied ""No, they still won't care, cause it's the owner who will get sued, not them"". So basically, the kitchen has no professionalism, know-how or ACCOUNTABILITY, so why should I risk my health and my money going here? Also, the management clearly doesn't care about feedback - negative reviews abound on Yelp and Google, and no reply from the restaurant. Never again, Metro diner!",2,,

If you're waiting for a friend (as I was this AM) the owner, told me to wait a few minutes,  and left me standing there WHILE HE SEATED ANOTHER WOMAN who came in behind me but asked for a table for one.  He could have seated me as well at one of those tables, and it would've been fine. Technically they are for two but most of the folks seated there were alone, He was rude to me when I asked him why he'd NOT offered me to sit at one of these tables, and he said that it was the busy part of the weekend and that for a booth BOTH members of my party needed to be there.

The waiter brought us bread and butter on a plate that had empty butter cups..gross. Fine, didn't say anything, maybe he just grabbed a plate with those accidentally. Two minutes later, walks by and drops napkins like we some animals. Spills water while refilling. Ordered ""southern fried chicken"", super overfried, lettuce was old and gross. Came with fries, which were okay. Total $16.95, like wtf. I eat only fries and ask for a check. Everything comes down to a total of $50.05. We ordered a cup of coke too. As I approach to pay, I noticed he charged us $17.95 for the chicken. Cashier says to go check with the waiter. He made a mistake, made changes to the grand total. Notice they bill you $7.50 for their ""excellent service"", I guess that is the reason they dont give a shit. I pay the bill and leave. Very rude, very unprofessional, bad food, bad service.

Easily the blandest burger I've ever had, and I sincerely didn't think burgers could be this bland. Fourth, the cole slaw tasted nasty and was very watery. All this for around $18 delivered. The only reason I'm even giving a star is because the delivery was very quick and the fries weren't terrible. I'm not ordering from here again, and neither should you.",1,,

I'm a person that almost always cleans my plate, and I couldn't even stomach half of it. Sitting here on the train, it feels like a giant rock slowly moving through my digestive system. Fiancé got the Lumberjack breakfast and he said it was very ""meh,"" but he was able to eat it all. Only reason this isn't 1 star. Service was terrible too. He came by with the check (after we sat there 10 min with the plates pushed aside and our phones out, clearly done) and asked if I wanted to box up the rest.

The first time I thought it was just an error or a mistake, but the second time the truth came out. The place is DIRTY! The plates and cups from which they serve the coffee are dirty and even have egg yolks around it. The severs can't speak English. If I go to France I expect to speak in French and when I'm in America I'm expecting to interact with people English. This was clearly a mediocre service and terribly overcooked eggs and bacon served on DIRTY plates. I am now wondering of the plates were even washed at all. This place should really close their doors. It is way below any standard. Feels like throwing up just thinking about the experience",1,,

If I'm up at 9 on a Saturday, I want coffee STAT!2) no sweetener, and I could not get waitress's attention to get some. 3) waffle I ordered came lukewarm at best. Butter I put on the waffle never melted. How do you mess up a waffle? 4) Never was offered a refill. I had to stand up, look over a half wall, to ask another waiter to refill my cup.

(Mysterious, I've not harmed him nor his loved ones.)  I've also drawn a very nice female server - but now I realize that was just the pure kindness of her heart, and not reflective of how management wants its staff to treat customers.  It's a real shame, because diners generally have the same menus and price points and the thing that creates regulars is consistent, friendly service.",,,

We went for breakfast, and I had a smoked salmon bagel deluxe thing, and he had a pastrami sandwich. I also went for a chocolate milkshake, which, to my delight, turned out to be melted Häagen-Dazs ice-cream! Sooo good...The portion sizes were plentiful (though, that said, being European, all American portions seem to be huge), and there was so much salmon spare to put in the bagel that I couldn't physically fit it all in the bagel - the helping was really rather generous. The pastrami sandwich was also packed full of meat.It's only a diner, and there isn't going to be any culinary wizardry that knocks your socks off here. But for a good, hearty, filling breakfast in a fun retro setting (and a chocolate milkshake that will make you drool for hours before and afterwards), this is a cool place to go.",2,,

One or two times it would be a coincidence, but every time I go? Last time I went as we started to be walked to the back by the hostess I purposely looked at the empty seats, looking to see of any reason why she couldn't just sit me in the front, angered I stopped and politely asked if I could sit here pointing to an open and clean table to which she said yes, but her intentions were very clear by then, I was going straight to the back again for the I dont know how many time.",,,

This was the most uncomfortable meal I've had in the longest time. We get there around 11PM on Valentine's Day (Saturday) and the place is pretty slow. Maybe three tables were filled. The hostess is at the bar cleaning silverwear and doesn't even greet us and tells us to sit wherever. Then our waiter, an older man, salt and pepper hair with a mustache comes by and asks us what we want. We give him our drink order and for the next 10 minutes he comes by repeatedly to ask what we want, over and over again when we are very obviously still looking over the menu. Then I get the cheese ravioli and the plate is HUGE while the portion is TINY. They should have at least plated on an appropriate plate, I wish I would have snapped a picture. While we eat the waiter stands by our table twice without saying anything and just hovers. WTF? My partner had to ask him for a coffee refill once just to get him to leave. Incredibly awkward. Not to mention this man didn't smile once, introduce himself, NOTHING. All the while we were super polite and thanking him. There was also this awkward family of four with a child that kept staring at us and the father had to tell him to stop then the mom looked around and kept glancing over too, even though it meant she had to turn in her booth! (this isn't being factored in to the rating of the restaurant but it definitely gave the place a Whites Only feel to it)The rude ass waiter begins to hover again and I just ask for our check and he literally throws it on the table--not exaggerating! WTF?!? I seriously feel that this man was racist! I got ONE smile the whole time I was there and it was from another customer leaving. Never ever coming back and I'm calling tomorrow to complain. Overpriced and the food is mediocre. Only upside? Free refills--apparently a rare luxury in this city!",4,1,2

It was unbelievable. I had to get up to get the manager since our waiter was not coming back it seemed. The manager didn't look surprised or concerned about it or my girlfriends health.

When the waiter returned, he acknowledged that the menu was unclear and that there was nothing he could do about it. When we went back to the hostess, (the one in the Tommy Hilfiger necklace) she needed my friend and I to instruct her how to separate the check.

Tried and true, through and through. Always busy but super efficient and bustling. The line around 11 a.m. on a Sunday snaked from the door all the way along the bar seating until it reached the two rows of booths. We were about 7 parties deep but still were seated in about 20 minutes.Get ready to fight for elbow and aisle space. There's no ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry!""s thrown around here. Just ""Get the hell outta my way I gotta get this order in"" attitudes, but I love it!The food is bomb, a tiny bit on the pricey side for diners but after all, the food is very fresh, the menu isn't ginormous so I'd like to think nothing is frozen here, and it's on the UWS, so the prices shouldn't come as a shock. It's bright, modern but still old school.I've been trying to eat super healthy lately (making it very hard to visit great places and write reviews) but it gave me a chance to try their egg white omelet and fresh fruit salad. I'm weary of eating out at restaurants because although a dish may SOUND healthy, you have no idea how it's prepared (what oils, condiments they use). I asked the sassy waitress, who seemed like she didn't even have enough time to take our order, but she answered all my questions before I even asked them. ""They're cooked clean, no oil with the peppers, onions and mushrooms cooked in."" Perfect.The eggs were good, but they needed a bit of salt and pepper. My friend ordered a quesadilla so I stole her guac to put on them and it tasted bomb! Egg whites are healthy but not always the most flavorful, so you need to (healthily) compromise when you can!The fresh fruit bowl was $5 but could have easily fed two people. The fruit was fresh, bright, juicy and so so so yummy, the perfect appetizer. Full of pineapple, grapes, honeydew, cantaloupe and strawberries. Definitely the best fruit salad I've ever had while eating out!My friends had the quesadilla, bacon egg and cheese sandwich and a tuna melt. Not one of us finished our meals and we were completely stuffed. It was about $10 a piece for an entree, so it really wasn't bad.This is my go-to diner spot, even though I live in the depths of Harlem. It's worth the trip!",1,2,2

We tried to clear it up while paying at the front, only to be sent back to our table, only to be told that we were charged because we got a mimosa. Even the waiter admitted that it was unclear.

So, at this point I'm fed up and ask him to get the manager. He stands there like he doesn't understand English. So, I repeated myself slowly. Then I saw he was just being insubordinate. So I get out of my seat to tell the host to tell the manager to come to my table because ""the waiter is f*%$ing RUDE."" I also told her I dont want him to serve me anymore, but nothing was done about that either!When the Manager comes he explained that I, the paying customer, probably misunderstood what the waiter said; that I should've asked for pastrami on the side because if I only ask for pastrami, it is assumed to be the sandwich. I told him I never said anything about a sandwich. I just want a waffle with strawberries and a side of pastrami. Meanwhile, Antonio and the host are starring at me snickering in the background, so I give them the death stare right back, especially Antonio. Let me just say, I work in customer service myself, and my co-workers and I NEVER treat the customer with disrespect. HELL NO I did not tip him. I thought about tipping the manager instead, but then I thought about it and said..""Hold up, he didnt even apologize and own up to what happened."" The customer is always right...

She asked for it to be heated. Ten minutes later, she came back with hot apple pie and a puddle of hot vanilla cream next to it. (In good conscious, I can no longer call it ""ice cream"". Ha!) Truth be told, that incident was more funny than annoying. The waiters are so accommodating and charming. How CAN one get mad?It's also very bright and clean with some good tunes in the background.

It took them 20 minutes to confirm that they had an order from us.Not only is this food late by an hour and 20 minutes but when I called Metro diner the guy who answered the phone was clueless as to where the delivery guy was.

We didn't even want to get dressed all day so we ordered in, since we live 2 blocks away. The person who took the order estimated at a half hour, which is pretty spot on. The hash brown potatoes were barely fried so it wasn't oily, which is good for us health nuts. They seemed baked. If you like them well-done/crispy, you should special request that. Omelettes were exactly what you'd expect, so we were pleased. They came with the hash browns & toast.$8+ French toast is not worth it. We felt like it was just two pieces of Texas toast, and they charge an extra $2 for the good syrup. No toppings or anything noticeable other than the thick bread (didn't sense cinnamon, etc...)",,,

The waiter was annoyed that we were going to continue working there bc he either ignored us for long periods of time and then threw the check at us. Yes, we had books open, but we also ate a lot of food! He was really upset when we only left him 10% for his crappy service. Worst service I have ever received. The food was good but I don't think its worth it for that kind of service. The waiter was a hispanic male in his 30's.

So last night I thought I would give Metro Diner a chance, yet again. I have eaten at Metro before, and while the food is usually passable I always leave feeling like the food was too expensive and the service severely lacking. So although I have lived in the neighborhood for 20 years I rarely go there.Last night was the last time I will be back. It took forever for them to take my order -- and I was sitting at the counter. Like a weirdly long time. The guy next to me got his soup ordered and eaten before I even placed my order. And I think I had at least two waitstaff people -- one guy who kept sidling up to me from the side who eventually took my order.The cheeseburger deluxe was adequate but it wasn't worth the hassle -- or the $11.50. And although I stuck with water (I was too annoyed to order a drink / coffee / tea because of the delay) no one refilled it.I'm a pretty easy customer -- I like to eat and I am always a guilty over tipper. Like $5 minimum any time I eat, even a check like that, cause I know the job is tough. And I was hoping to treat myself to dessert or a nosh. But this was one of the few times I left a minimal tip. Honestly, I didn't need the hassle and negativity when I go out to eat. I don't understand this kind of thing when the economy is so bad and it's expensive to eat out and every business seems to be hanging on by a thread.Maybe Metro has a monopoly on clean diners, but I will be going elsewhere for my diner fix.",6,2,2

I ignored that comment. When the meal came it had American cheese I asked for cheddar.  There were no fries which I asked for too.  Also my Miss asked for cheddar cheese, it was American.  I told the waitress that she messed the order up and she proceeded to ask me in a smart tone ""are you ok?""....I told her she was being rude from the minute I sat at the bar top, she argues with me so I ask her to bring the manager over, she proceeds to tell me he is across the room and I can get him myself! I told her she is the one who is working here so can she please get him, then she points at the clock and says ""I actually am off work now""... Finally I had to get the manger MYSELF and he was apologetic but made an excuse for her behavior and says ""it's hard to find good help these days."" At that moment I had enough, will never go back to this diner, I can't attest for the food because I lost my appetite when I noticed she was more involved with being a nasty server then actually getting any part of my order correct.  So disappointed in their display, I don't suggest anyone to go there if they expect at least a standard level of service.",1,,

He immediately got irate, and claimed that I never ordered the either. He then went to a cabinet grabbed a cream cheese and jelly and abruptly threw it into be handed it back to me and rudely demanded and additional $2. Shocked I requested a refund while asking why the need for the attitude? He then proceeded to register, opened it took out my refunded, slammed the register closed and loudly told me to ""HERE, GO, HAVE A NICE DAY!"" When I told him that the attitude was really uncalled for and unnecessary he proceeded to rudely yell. ""GO, GO, PLEASE GO HAVE A NICE DAY"" in a tone that's sarcastic and disrespectful as it can get. All of this for simply ordering a bagel? Last time I ever go there.

A lot of New Yorkers have caught on to this because this place is anything less than crowded on weekend mornings and with good reason.In my eyes you can't go wrong with a big, juicy, burger. However, if you want your burger well-done, make sure you specify that to the waiter or else it'll be medium rare.

Ordered food, took 1 hour 30 mins to receive order, when arrived part of order inedible, called & complained looked for credit for one item of the order which had to be thrown out, told me ""need the food to issue a credit"". No credit issued. Will not be needing any credit in future!",,,

164,Betsy F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,3.0,1/14/2016,"I've gone to Metro diner occasionally over the last 25 years and I always want it to be better than it actually is. Today we had a lovely waitress who was attentive and efficient but more often you get indifferent service. The food comes quickly so I am always amazed when it arrives lukewarm. The omelet was okay but the hash browns were room temp. A side of bacon ordered ""well done"" was limp and greasy and way too much--5 rashers. I found the prospect unappetizing. My niece ordered the lumberjack, which could feed 2 people easily, and she was enthusiastic, but also overwhelmed by the portion. I guess many American diners prefer such portions but it pretty much means that lukewarm food is definitely cool as you work your way through. Still, if you can remind them you want your food hot and are aware of portions, this is a nice place for breakfast. Coffee is just okay.",,,

Updated review","This diner offers the usual fare with a side order of filth. Next time you go, I dare you to run your finger along the divider between the booths. Your fingertip will turn black with ancient dust and grime. If they don't care enough to wipe the tables, what makes you think they clean the kitchen? FILTHY AND DISGUSTING. Also... they manage to routinely screw up the staple of diner foods: the cheeseburger deluxe. The only thing deluxe about this burger is how bland it is.",6,2,

This is one of her favorites, and after a single visit, I can easily see why she likes it so much.The interior has the classic diner look, but everything is clean and modern enough. Our server had a thick New Yorker accent and acted as though he'd already had five cups of coffee by 9am. Everyone was friendly, and we didn't feel rushed or pressured. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it blew my mind or anything. I had the Denver omelette (ha!) and a big glass of fresh OJ. Yum. I'll definitely be returning the next time I get the chance. Bottom line: the Metro is a great, non-touristy diner that serves up a solid breakfast in a comfortable atmosphere.",1,1,

I was able to calm down from the dangerous ride I just experienced.  They don't take checks, but the manager took a check from me (my bank was right across the street).  I was so relieved.  I would go back if I were in the area again.  They really saved me on a horrible night!!!!",,2,1

To which a very rude guy named John told us he would take the order back but NOT refund it, that was an issue I'd have to take up with Grubhub. Took about 10minutes of arguing and searching for change before he finally decided to let the extra$1.50!!!!!!, yes that right all this over a dollar fifty, slide and leave the food........which of course was now cold and subpar.    On a side note the delivery guy was very nice and I sincerely hope they didn't take it out of his money",1,,

For the location and what it advertises itself to be, which is your traditional, pleasant diner, it lives up to its name. Would I travel from any other neighborhood to come to Metro Diner? Nah.

Updated review","So...after years of great service, today was the one day to fall short.  Luckily for me, it was during brunch when my mother was in town visiting for the holidays.  So after I tell her how the food is lovely and the service is great...The Belgian waffles were nice and fluffy.  The coffee was average but heart-jarring as usual.  The eggs and sausage were tasty.But...the servers all seemed to have burrs up their asses today.  The best two words I could think of are ""surly"" and ""curt"" to describe their attitudes.  I should have known when I heard the woman in the booth behind us complaining loudly to the manager that the server disappeared and never came back to check on her coffee or check that...20 minutes later, I would be in the same boat, only with a different server.  We were completely dry on coffee and asked two other servers, who told us flat out that they were not our server and walked away.  A third just completely ignored us as if we were not speaking to her.  Then we had the same treatment in attempting to get the check.  The table was completely bussed excepting two women and their waters trying to make eye contact with anyone who works there.  Eventually yet another server asked us what we were waiting for and when we told them it was the check they disappeared.  Three minutes later our server ran by, muttered under her breath that she had changed stations and threw the check on the table without any apology.Needless to say, my mother was thrilled.  It was a fun walk home.",,2,

Breakfast is very popular, particularly the waffles. Lunch is pretty standard but dinner lately has really risen to a higher level with very good specials.  Tonight I had the flounder Francese and it was delicious.  The saute was perfectly done.  The sauce was both lemony and buttery as it should be while the fish itself was super fresh.  The portions are huge. I usually end up bringing home enough for a second meal.  This is a well above average but classic Greek diner.  We are so very glad they are in our neighborhood.",1,1,

However, I ignored the sleep deprivation and asked Sean to bring me to the best, greasiest diner in close proximity so we could grab some grub. That is how I ended up at Metro Diner for the very first meal of my 5-day visit to New York City.I ordered the cheapest thing I could while still hitting all the bases of cholesterol and keeping it simple for my queasy stomach: two scrambled eggs, Canadian bacon, seasoned potatoes and toast for 7 bucks.They took our orders quickly.They brought out our food quickly.Breakfast, albeit nothing special, tasted as it should--gratifying, greasy and good.They took our bill quickly.They were nice!So this place is nothing out of the ordinary, but as far as diners go it was top-notch.
