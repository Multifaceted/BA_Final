We've been to three of Bruce Springsteen's concerts which were wonderful three-hour parties. This show is more a bio of him talking and singing. It lasted two and a half hours. His talented wife joined him for a few songs. Security was tight, maybe because Nancy Pelosi and Jimmy Fallon were there that night? They were militant about no photos or phones in use during the performance. They had merchandise areas in the back of the theatre and outside in the alley. There was a crowd waiting to meet Bruce after the  performance. He signed a few autographs then left. The seats were tiny even for me, an average woman. My 6'6"" husband had to have an aisle seat for legroom. We were about 25 feet from the stage which was nice.",2,,2

2,Michael P.,"Lewes, DE",1,43,1,2.0,11/15/2018,Not worth the price of admission 1200.00 a ticket to hear 15 songs . He's a singer I pay to hear him sing not talk. If money is no object then knock your socks off.,,,
3,Trace V.,"West LA, CA",57,349,247,4.0,10/31/2017,"Probably the smallest theater ""Broadway Theater"" at 950 seats. That's why Bruce Springsteen choose to do his extended run here and the show did not disappoint. Got the highest seat in the place (2nd row balcony for 75 bucks vs the $850 front of house seats).  But you could see and hear everything very well. Even when Bruce wasn't miked -- you could hear every word, piano note, and guitar chord. Every show on Broadway should be seen this way -- intimate setting.Billy Joel, Howard Stern, and Jimmy Kimmel were in the house the night we went (of course THEY had those expensive orchestra seats they didn't pay for. Freebies for the famous (sigh).",2,,

Springsteen does not take an intermission so be prepared if you are going to the show.   I was up in the balcony and I was able to see and hear everything perfectly.  The architecture was just beautiful in this theatre.,5,,1

I saw Amelie in the front mezz, row C, seats 113-114. The seats were good - I had an unobstructed view of the stage - no heads in my view. There is no orchestra pit - they're in the balcony on each side. Leg space is a bit crammed. If you want to go to the bathroom, best to go elsewhere.",6,1,2
8,Annette J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3787,1564,6335,3.0,7/12/2016,"Like most Broadway theatres the Walter Kerr is on the older and more opulent side. The latter is great because it's a gorgeous, intimate theatre (less than 1000 seats, I believe) but the former prevents it from really being a comfortable night out, at least in the mezzanine/balcony.We've been to a couple of shows here now (The Crucible and A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder) and sat in front mezz both times (thanks, TKTS!). Neither my husband or I are particularly tall but we both felt pretty darn cramped both times. In fact, most recently at The Crucible, the woman behind my husband kept kneeing him in the back of the head. Not the most relaxing way to take in Arthur Miller. The seats are also on the smaller side width wise, it was luckily fine for both of us but I could tell the huskier gentleman in front of us was not exactly comfortable. But the quality of the shows presented to you here transcend all the quibbles. It's definitely not enough to make us skip a show here. The views are great (the smaller house makes ever seat a winner) and the gorgeous architecture really takes it to a new level. Just plan ahead and skip the bulky clothes, shopping bags, and wear flats so your legs are shorter and get ready for some incredible Broadway theatre!",11,,4

10,Jamie E.,"Wayne, NJ",144,138,473,4.0,11/25/2016,"Front row center - how can I complain? Well, I can say that front row can be terrible in certain theaters. This isn't one of them. There was only one scene where my view was very partially obstructed.  The show you see dictates what's obstructed really but the fact that you're lined up well with the stage here helps. A good front row, not straining your neck too much at all. Snack stand guy super friendly and poured a good drink. PS Falsettos is FABULOUS. PPS I hear the balcony is terrible here (only 2 rows).",2,1,1
11,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",1032,172,59,4.0,12/27/2015,"Even though this is a really small theatre, I absolutely love it! I've watched Gentleman's Guide around three or four times with different people and I just die laughing every single time. Perhaps it's the show that makes the theatre seem better, but this is probably my favorite Broadway theatre because it's so intimate. Most of the time I'll get the balcony seating which offers nearly 0 leg room, but is on a really steep incline so you never have to worry about the person in front of you blocking your view. Even when you're in the farthest seat in the theatre, you still feel like you're really close to the action because it's that small and that's definitely something that I enjoy. All in all, this is a theatre where I've had some really great experiences and is one that I'd recommend to others as well! Too bad Gentleman's Guide is going off Broadway soon :(",1,,1
12,Mendy Y.,"Austin, TX",547,534,421,4.0,12/6/2015,"Definitely one of the more interesting theaters I've been to. The space is extremely small by Broadway standards, but it kind of has its own charm because the intimacy makes everything feel cozier. All of the seats are also extremely elevated. I grabbed last minute discounted tickets and sat at the very top level of the balcony. I thought that this would make me have to continuously peer down at all of the actors but surprisingly I could see very well the entire time. The theater was designed such so that audiences from all angles could see and hear well, which was amazing. Had a great time for at a very reasonable price!",1,,1
13,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1116,19810,3.0,1/14/2016,"Three stars because I've been to so many theaters they all look the same. I've never had an obstructed view when attending a show. Believe me I don't always get the high end seats! In fact I find if you sit up top you get the best view sometimes. If I have a friend visiting I try to sit center stage. I almost always want one of the seats to be on the isle. I want to be ready to exit!At the Walter Kerr I saw A Gentleman's a Guide to Love and Murder. It was funny and moved quickly.  Very good show. The tickets were a gift from my daughter for Christmas 2014. I advise you to purchase tickets for shows on line using Telecharge. It's so handy to have your ticket, get in line and go right in. They use a scan to scan your printed bar code. Seats were comfortable, exiting after the performance was easy. I enjoyed my present. But then, I'm easy to please!

The seats (on the second level and balcony) are very steep which is actually a big plus because you never have to worry about not being able to see over someone's head! The staff was very friendly. We had balcony seats on a Wednesday night show and were able to sit in the mezzanine for the whole second half because there were empty seats. Talk about great deal!2 beers (small 12 ounce cans poured into a sippy cup) came out to $22. Rip off, but that's expected - and you can take the sippy cup home as a souvenir.

Updated review","My initial review was written over two years ago, based on orchestra seating, and well before I was able to frequent enough Bway shows to really have a good comparison.I'm still fine with the WKT...but, having now experienced a show in the mezz?  It would have to be a show I'm dying to see, or an unbelievable price for me to sit anywhere other than the orchestra.This has got to be one of - if not the - steepest theater on bway.  I had to double check my ticket, and ask if I'd gone up too far, as I couldn't believe I was at such a height and rake for mezzanine seating.  And, for those performers who don't compensate for the space, viewing just isn't as enjoyable.Very cramped seating, and not just for big guys like me.  I was looking around to nearly every body type sitting in some odd angle to accommodate for the lack of leg room, and to keep from the over flow of human parts from chair to chair.Even when I moved at intermission to a nearly empty row, with no one near me, I still had to sit side saddle.Not my favorite theater by design or functionality.",4,1,
17,Taia C.,"Hatboro, PA",53,6,6,4.0,4/9/2017,"First time at this theater today to see Philippa Soo star in Amélie. We enjoyed the show. The theater is small but lovely. Built in the 1920's. We sat in the center mezzanine, Row E. The view was great. Nothing at all to obstruct our view. The downside is that the leg room is very tight. Nearly 2 hours in the chair without an intermission was tough for my 6 foot tall husband. Others have complained about the cold temperature in the theater, but I remained completely comfortable in my t-shirt and jeans. Overall, I would definitely come here again for a show, but I would probably try out the orchestra seating next time.",,,

19,Adrienne G.,"San Francisco, CA",125,2395,2374,3.0,2/10/2014,"Lucked into the Broadway Week 2-for-1 tickets for the showing of Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder & Walter Kerr Theatre was the hosting venueHad 1st Row Mezz seats & could not believe there was *zero* legroom.  Our legs totally hit up against the wall & the man behind me had his knees in my shoulders ....& he was average heightWe were thankful for the intermission of this 2.5 hr performance, to stand up & de-cramp our legsEven so, the seats themselves were comfy & sightlines were obviously perfect from center front row.....although it did seem a bit like we were looking at the tops of the actors' heads - I imagine sitting in the Orch would be even better - these theaters are so small that sitting downstairs would be my future preferenceThe Play itself was totally 5-Star worthy......completely hysterical & the actors were campy, comedically well-timed & the main character's costume changes were mind-blowing.....SO talented!!",7,4,6
20,Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",183,2015,3152,4.0,7/22/2016,"Aside from air con being set to full blast, I really enjoyed the Walter Kerr theater. (Discomfort level was low; in a game of ""would you rather,"" I suppose I'd rather be too cold than too hot.) It's a medium-sized Broadway theater, which means our rear (but center!) orchestra seats still provided an awesome view of the stage. We saw ""The Crucible"" here starring ""Brooklyn's"" Saoirse Ronan -- a wonderful telling of Arthur Miller's work about witchcraft & a flawed justice system. Intense because acting was so believable, & because for a few precarious seconds, a wolf on stage stared out into the audience!4 stars for both the theater & the play!! Plenty of stalls in the upstairs bathroom, line moved quickly.",3,1,2

22,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",357,144,37,3.0,1/17/2016,"The Walter Kerr Theatre is one of the smaller, more intimate Broadway venues, seating less than 1,000 (975, to be exact). It has maintained its old, antique look and charm, constructed in early Prohibition-era Manhattan in record time (only sixty days!). In 1921, the building opened as Ritz Theatre, retaining its title until 1990, when it was renamed in honor of renowned Broadway critic and playwright Walter Kerr.But despite its historical qualities, the theatre's condition is dingy and slightly musty. I was there this past Friday night to see one of A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder's final performances, so naturally, the house was completely packed. Seating is cramped, but that's mostly due to the original architecture, which didn't leave much breathing room between audience members. I had orchestra section tickets, but based on other reviews, it sounds like the space situation is far worse in the mezzanine and balcony.Luckily, the tininess of the theatre allows for some great views, regardless of where you sit. Even from the far left or right side, there weren't any obstructions, primarily because of the curved structure of the exterior rows; the seating chart provides an accurate representation of this design. The chair elevation also slowly increases as you go further back in each section.The best aspect of the Walter Kerr Theatre, besides the preservation of the original interior, is the efficient, professional operations. Although there was a massive line wrapped around the venue when the doors opened at 7:30, it moved extremely quickly, and pretty much everyone in attendance was seated at the start of the sold-out, evening performance.",,,
23,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1132,1290,6797,4.0,1/2/2015,"I am giving this theatre 4 stars because (a) it is classically old and beautifully restored... and (b) it is now home to the show, ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder,"" which is absolutely wonderful.  However, it is one more theatre that, because of its 1921 construction, is ridiculously cramped with small seats and even smaller aisles.  While we had amazing seats in the first row of the mezzazine, our knees smashed into the retaining wall.  It was somewhat comical, albeit painful too, to see everyone, and I mean everyone jockeying for leg/knee position, and half the time, knees were touching the person seated next to you...... and you didn't dare move an inch so as to not lose your leg space.  Also, for some strange reason, the row we sat in was sloping at an angle, so we were tilted, AND we had to deal with the leg space.  It was not fun.  That all being said, we still had a wonderful time with ""A Gentleman's Guide,"" and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Being a lover of live theatre, I wouldn't miss the opportunity to see these wonderful shows, but boy, it's sure tough on my body.  I walk out totally cramped up every time.  I love how intimate these theatres are and how well one can see from pretty much anywhere in them, but oy, they are such a challenge to find comfort while inside.",4,3,4
24,Jim C.,"Tampa, FL",146,363,2025,4.0,5/20/2015,"Built in 1921, it takes you back to the time of old Broadway.  It was restored in 1990 to beautiful condition.   Bette Davis among others performed here.  The mezzanine seats are a little short on leg room, but otherwise we had a great experience in the theaterLa Masseria Italian restaurant is about 75 feet away on same side of the street.  It is a good pre-show stop.  Be sure to make reservations or you may end up in the balcony like we did.",1,,
25,Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",34,747,435,4.0,3/15/2015,"Old fashioned, classic theater right in the middle of New York's theater district. This smallish theater doesn't seat thousands like some of the big barns in other cities, so you will have a much more intimate experience here. The ambiance of the Kerr Theater is much like the smaller theaters you find in London's theater district...and I say that as a positive. We saw A Gentleman's Guide to Murder when we were here. It is still playing, and should be at the Kerr through September 2015. The play was wonderful and the theater was too. We had front row balcony seats and enjoyed the views and music. I think the intimacy of the theater is what really carries the day. See something here and you'll be glad you did.",1,,1
26,Stacy P.,"Denver, CO",86,669,1117,4.0,7/20/2014,"It's another of NYC's beautiful theaters - I had front row seats to see A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder, and there really wasn't good leg room - and I'm only 5'4"". So, be aware of that if you're tall and thinking of purchasing in that area. As usual, the bathroom line was incredibly long at intermission, but I heard one of the staff members calling out that they had 11 or so stalls. The line did seem to move quickly and everyone seemed to be back at their seats with time to spare (can't say the same for Cort). Still, for these shows, it's always best to go ahead of time. The view of the stage should be great from anywhere in the place - as usual, you probably want to stay out of the front rows that are on the extreme right or left as you'll get some view obstruction. Overall, beautiful theater and a great show. I wouldn't mind going back!",5,,

Once in a while you get to see a play that is amazing and the experience being in that theater is playing was just pure surreal.

We arrived to see A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder (you can read my review for that on the musicals page!) just a few minutes before curtain. There was no wait to get in.We took the first staircase on the right to the mezzanine, but we weren't sure where our seats were because they were on the balcony. We asked the usher and he pointed us in the right direction, up more steps. However, before ascending we crossed the theater to the other side where there were no ushers. It was a little strange but we eventually found our seats. I also managed to track down a couple of Playbills. The seats did seem like they could be cramped for someone bigger than me. I'm 5'4 and just had enough comfortable leg space. I had some extra space in my seat as well. I do not recommend bringing big bags or coats into the theater.The balcony seats weren't too bad. I had to lean forward to catch some of the action occurring at the tip of the stage but most of the time I was relaxed in my seat. The show used a lot of sight-gags and I did not miss any from where I sat.",,,1
29,Biota M.,"Hartford, CT",268,169,312,4.0,2/2/2014,"This was my first Broadway show, seeing A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder. The show itself was fantastic, and I loved the set design. The ushers were really helpful in directing us to our seats. We had seats 14 and 16 in Row B on the Mezzanine level (which was the first balcony level). They ended up being really close to the front, and because the stage was small, I didn't even notice that we were seated on the far right. For other theaters, it may be nice when buying tickets to try to pick the more expensive seats that are in the center, but this isn't a theater where that really matters.The seats themselves were very comfortable, but I docked a star because the seat arrangements made me feel a little claustrophobic--like if you took two big guys and seated them next to one another, their shoulders would be pressed together. Most of this wasn't too bad for me (because I'm 5'5"") but would be much more of an issue for someone taller. My boyfriend who is 6'1"" and the tall man sitting next to him were talking about how little leg room there was, almost as if their knees were going to hit the heads of the people sitting in front of them. And if someone needed to walk by your seat, either you were standing up or they were going to have to climb over your lap. Since this was my first show, I don't know if super cozy seating is typical of Broadway theaters, but it's worth mentioning.The sound during the show was perfect the whole time from where we were sitting--not too quiet that you couldn't hear but also not too loud. Good acoustics in this theater!They had a lot of stalls in the bathroom, and it was very clean, but the line during intermission for the women's restroom still wound all the way down the stairs. My recommendation would be to go before the show if you can.We ended up taking the train into the city, so we didn't have to deal with parking. If possible, public transportation is definitely the way to go.The tickets for this show were purchased online, and on the ticket print-out, we were given 10% off a nearby restaurant for dinner, which we ended up taking advantage of. Despite the tight seating, at the end of the day, it was still a great experience at this theater.",5,,1

38,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,3.0,12/1/2012,"What a piece of Krapp!Herbert J. Krapp, that is, notable architect who was involved with the design of various theaters of note in the early 20th century, including the Walter Kerr.But Walter Kerr was only eight years old when the structure that now bears is name was completed. Originally known as the Ritz Theater when opening in 1921, this building was also used for radio and television broadcasts.I don't think it was one of those theaters that doubled as a seedy adult cinema spot in the 70's and early 80's but I'd need to research that a bit more. I do know that for 10 years, when Manhattan was inspiring movies like Escape from NY, this theater was shut and probably a total wreck occupied by squatters, pimps, addicts and all the other characters that brought ""authenticity"" to the city. Thanks to declining crime rates and economic revitalization, people in the early 90's considered it safe enough to reopen and rename the theater the Walter Kerr, in honor of a New York Times critic. (I suppose one day there will be the Ben Brantley theater if this naming was any precedent)Last night we watched the revival of the 1947 play ""The Heiress"" based on the novel ""Washington Square"" by Henry James. What first struck me about the interior of the Walter Kerr is the painstaking attention to detail...on the ceiling. You'll see what looks to me like an idyll of Pan and his flute. Directly above the stage observe another painting of what appears to be a woman by the moon. A muse of the theater perhaps?Our seats were in the mezzanine section and there was no difficulty hearing the dialogue thanks to the on point acoustics. The only interruptions were the sounds of sippy cup sodas dropping to the floor and people hacking up phlegm. The phlegm crowd I expected- they seem to dominate events where the average age is over 60. (I'm looking at you Lincoln Center). The sippy cup dropping was a new phenomenon for me as these cups are not for babies but rather adults who like to guzzle soda like a '78 Eldorado downs gas. Perhaps chronic dehydration is a genuine problem in theaters like the Walter Kerr.The theater is generally more intimate than other venues. That's realtor talk for small. Expect to be caught up in a swirling current of confused theater goers unsure as to where to proceed once the show has ended. The sidewalk in front of the theater cannot accommodate half of the Walter Kerr's interior but that's what it felt like once the curtain was drawn. Furs and liposuction altered faces abound if that's your thing.None of this is in any way under the control of the theater, of course but is part of the experience of seeing a show in NYC, where the real show may very well be the art of observing others. The Walter Kerr dutifully preserves a tradition that will continue on, adult sippy cups and all.",2,2,3
39,Mark B.,"Thiells, NY",0,17,34,3.0,7/20/2016,"I came here to see The Crucible before closing and the theatre was overall really pleasant. It is nicely decorated on the inside and had a good view of the stage, but it was not exactly one of my favorite theaters as it did not really have too much character as others tend to. Also, while the view was good (I sat in Left Orchestra Row L Seat #9), it felt a bit further to the side than in other theaters I've been in, and I wouldn't really go farther than this seat in the future. The left wall could be blocked if something in the action is occurring there. Overall pretty good theatre for an OK recent production of The Crucible.",,,
40,Stephanie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,0,4.0,9/3/2014,"Went to see A Gentlemans Guide to Love & Murder last night at the Walter Kerr. Since I am on a budget, I bought 2 balcony tickets. After reading some reviews I thought I would be outa luck in seeing anything since I would be so far up. I was actually pleasantly surprised.  My seats were the back row balcony (there are only 2 rows) and if I am not mistaken, the seats felt like they were slightly elevated or had extra cushioning. I was able to see and hear everything during the show. You do miss a few bits here and there - mostly if the actors go downstage or any suttle facial expressions but overall I was happy with my balcony seats. Since it is an 'intimate' theatre, there is no lobby to hang out in nor is there a ton of room when waiting in line for the bathrooms or concessions. They do make it easy for you regarding concessions and show merchandise. They have a small concessions stand in the back of the mezz with everything the main bar has with the exception of alcohol - you can get wine & beer. On the orchestra level, you can get your show merchandise right next to the main bar - so while you wait for concessions, you can get your show program and such. Kudos to the bartender at this theatre. The line was almost out the main door and I was able to get my stuff before the 2nd call for the 2nd act.  He had his system down! After the show, it took about 10 minutes to exit the theatre and onto the street. I highly recomend this show - it was funny, dark and catchy.. 'I've Decided to Marry You"" is still stuck in my head. Kudos to Jefferson Mays for his talented performaces of all the D'Ysquith family! Everyone was great and I would see this show again.",3,,

The  Walter Kerr is another one of those old and historic playhouses on the Great White Way. Which means, of course, that the seating is tight and a bit cramped, but still comfortable. Maybe it was a bit better for me since I has an aisle seat and was able to stretch out a bit. As with many others it has been restored, and is very ornate. It is one of the smaller auditoriums in the theatre district, as it seats only 975 patrons.Bathroom is in an odd spot on the upstairs before entering the mezzanine area, and is kind of small, but the line seemed to move fast. There is a small bar on the main seating level selling over-priced drinks and snacks. Staff was friendly and helpful enough. From where we sat right in front of the stage the acoustics were totally fine. When I walked to the back and looked around it seemed like the sight lines are very good no matter where you are seated.Overall, seems like a nice intimate venue to see a performance.",6,3,7

I had tickets on the end of the aisle in the center close to the back, I thought my seats were fantastic and I could see everything clearly. I loved how the set was really part of the show and the actors definitely use all of the stage.See my previous review for info on the show I saw, A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder.

You don't think about it until you are stuck on line for over 20 minutes waiting for a bathroom to use at a Broadway show when it starts in T-Minus 10 minutes! The lines in the bathroom at Walter Kerr Theatre are FAST! YES!!!!! I saw Lysistrata Jones at this theatre. I was on the 2nd row. AMAZING. The sound system is great too. The theatre is beautiful.

However, Elaine Stritch was literally still learning her lines and the lyrics.  It was outlandish and even funny.  However, the audience LOVED her and would shout Bravo even after she had to ask for a line.  I guess if you are a fan, you're a fan.Read all the reviews and make your decision carefully before you buy tickets to see a play here.Caveat emptor and then some.",2,2,3

It's a plus because my view was not at all obstructed by those in front of me but make sure you take caution when you're walking down.

The theater, built in 1921, is very small. Seat size and leg room are like those found in the airplane economy cabin. The rise from one row to another is quite steep so it could be a challenge for seniors coming and going out of the seat.I also found the person in the box office lacks communication skills and insensitive. I felt insulted when he told me that I will not get good seats because I am using show's promo code to purchase the tickets.

Believe it or not, I liked the balcony seats better! This is a beautiful, small, historic theater, and seats in the orchestra are indeed cramped. Although the balcony seats are WAY up there, I never felt claustrophobic from being so close to the ceiling or dizzy from the height. And strangely enough, you get a bit more leg room the way the two balcony rows are staggered. We sat in the front of the two rows, and yes, our view was partially obstructed by the lights. We joked with fellow balcony-mates that they sure put a lot of trust in their audience, since there were lighting cords and outlets within our reach, should we have chosen to fool around with them! We spent most of the show leaning over a bit to catch the action in the front of the stage, but otherwise, we could generally see the projections on the screen at the back of the stage, and we could hear just fine. The performers definitely sing up, so we never felt disconnected from the action, and in fact, there is an entire sequence of the show when the balcony audience is used for humor (I loved that!!). We didn't need the bathroom and didn't buy concessions, so I can't attest to the convenience or lines.

I was shocked that a play featuring Ben Stiller, Edie Falco, and Jennifer Jason Leigh could not sell out on a Saturday night.  And not just that, I'm betting it was half-full at best.  More than one row was empty.  But that worked for me because it gave me space to eventually enjoy the show without being distracted by pain.",1,,

From an artistic perspective, I really feel removed from the show when watching from the balcony.If you sit in the orchestra, you're guaranteed a wonderful show.

The man at the box office called Telecharge and said I hadn't completed the order.Despite this, the true gentleman in the box office sold me orchestra seats, for the same price I would have paid online--even better seats that I'd purchased.This man, who's name I wish I'd gotten, was so kind and helpful, that he really helped make my theatergoing experience a great one.

Of course, the show is extraordinary, a gentle work of genius unlike any other musical you'll ever see.The production is beautiful, the cast superb, and Peters and Stritch are both legends--spectacular in their roles.So, thank you Kerr box office, Stephen Sondheim, Peters, Stritch and the rest of the cast and crew for a great evening in the theater!",1,,1

I mean they really really didn't fit... and Allah was looking out for me bc the seat next to me was empty.. so I sat sideways which was fine by me....I think the night as a whole was an amazing experience... from the theater charm.. to all the employees... to the play that got a standing ovation from the crowd... it was a total combination of a perfect Friday evening....",,,

81,Russell B.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",298,199,415,2.0,1/9/2012,"This place was yet another one of those ""aw man this is too tight man!!!"" kind of places. No biggie, I had a great time hanging out in the official ""yelp elite and guest"" event. The seats were located very close to the stage but they were very cramped...I don't know if this a norm for broadway venues since I've only been to only one other broadway show but... I guess it is. I actually saved reviewing this place because I thought it wouldn't be fair to review and compare but since i've visited another venue I can honestly say this place was ""more cramped"" then the other venue i visited... which was still cramped. The room temperature was kind of off, and because I was so cramped I decided to skip going to the bathroom, and go when I got to the bar to avoid the whole... ""scues me, excuse me, scuse me, sorry, pardon me"" etc... Anyways, the production was good. The place wasn't funky or anything when it came to the seats... I want to give it 3 stars but.... thats ""A-OK."" when really I'm feeling like ""Meh. I've experienced better."" The show was for Lysistrata Jones...",,2,
82,Althea A.,"Manhattan, NY",243,704,466,4.0,11/14/2011,"This is a beautiful, traditional theater. Built in 1921, but definitely recently refurbished, it has beautiful, ornate ceilings and decor, and Greek mythology-themed murals on the walls.It's a two-tiered theater. We were seated in the upper section. The lines of sight are fine, but it's at a very steep pitch, so if you are extremely sensitive to heights, I would recommend being sure to sit on the lower level. The seats are also quite small, something larger people might want to be aware of. Sound and lighting were all up to current standards, and I very much enjoyed the show we went to see here!

84,Renee C.,"Vancouver, Canada",401,613,115,3.0,4/17/2010,"I LOVE Broadway and I LOVE Catherine Zeta Jones...I would think it would blow off my pants when they both come together....but it was just good and nothing too special...you know what I mean? Maybe I'm just a muscial theatre snob...but I wasn't blown away. It really saddens me to give it 3 stars....I think it could have been the way the theatre was set up where the orchestra is not in view for the audience. I really like seeing the musicians playing while the show is going on, and that is one of the reasons why I love musical theatre so much because it comprises of live music, real singing, dancing and acting. The costumes were SO BEAUTIFUL though, I couldn't take my eyes off of the ladies dresses! These dress are what make me feel like I was born in the wrong era, I really wouldn't mind wearing them on an everyday basis, where I could sport grace, sophistication and femininity with minimal skin exposure.",4,2,4

I thought the play was very good and thanks yelp for the tix.  It was definitely worth a night out coming into the city on my day off.  I got a ride in and at least we got some really cheap parking esp compared to what most manhattan places charge.The theater itself was pretty nice. I was like row S in Orchestra section, Bernadette Peters did a great job on her performance. I did not expect the play to be that long but it was still ok.

Luckily, it was quite orderly because of the restroom attendant.",1,,

I went to see The Heiress here and I got Rush tickets the day of for $30. The seats actually were not bad. I feel like the only bad seats in the house are on the very end. I was in the 5th row and enjoyed it very much. I had a good view of the stage. The staff at Walter Kerr are very friendly and helpful. The inside of the theatre is very pretty. The only thing I was not pleased with is the bathroom is a bit inconvenient to get to, but it's no deal breaker. I will definitely come back to this theatre when I return to New York.",,,

It seats 975 but doesn't look that way.I came here for a dress rehearsal for an upcoming show (opens December 14th) called Lysistrata Jones. The sound is subjective. I sat in the mezzanine yet the speakers made the singer sound like she was right in front of me. Again, this is subjective so some will like that and others will not.The theater is owned and operated by Jujamcyn Theaters and designed by Herbert Krapp. The seats are very comfortable yet I felt like the mezzanine seats slanted down to the left.",2,2,2
90,scott s.,"New York, NY",59,453,0,1.0,5/28/2011,"Came Here In The House Of Blue Leaves.This theater needs to have a warning about it's balcony seating.We arrived at our seats which were extraordinarily high and steep, my friend who is afraid of heights could not bear sitting.She was not the only one, as a family in front of us was also freaking out as they were sitting right above the ledge looking down.The Staff was rather rude and told us we could upgrade by buying higher priced tickets, then told us we couldn't.Keep in mind, there were nearly 100 free seats the floor below.We finally received better seats for free. This shouldn't happen at all",,,
91,Nikki G.,"New York, NY",34,7,0,1.0,4/7/2013,"NEVER buy balcony seats at the Walter Kerr!  Terrible experience - and I know that you 'get what you pay for' but it's a crime to charge someone even $50 for a seat that is much higher than the ceiling of the stage (no kidding) and make the viewer afraid for her life to just be sitting in her seat!  I have a mild fear of heights, and I was instantly terrified to be on this balcony. The seats are situated at least several feet above the railing, so you really can just tumble down to your death onto the mezzanine below from there. Aside from the fear these seats instilled in me, I could not see the actors faces AT ALL...we were literally 5 feet above the stage's ceilling - so basically my nose was actually bleeding just looking at the actors. Should have walked out...My friend and I almost did walk out after first seeing the ridiculously terrible seats we were shown to. But we really wanted to see The Heiress, so we braved the not-for-the-faint-of-heart seats. I will never see a show here again. Any theater that sells seats as dangerous as those in the 'balcony' as that deserves my boycott.",,,

93,Deborah R.,"Riverton, NJ",1,132,0,4.0,12/20/2012,"What a lovely theatre. My daughter and I saw ""The Heiress"" here yesterday, and we felt as if we were actually part of the parlor room scenes due to the intimate design of the theatre. The play was very, very good and we got to meet Dan Stevens after the play. (Matthew Crawley on Downton Abbey). He's playing the role of Morris Townsend     in The Heiress. He's very friendly and kind-he signed the playbills of all who were there, and was good-natured enough to allow us to take photos with him. My daughter was so excited, since she's a huge fan. He's even better looking in person! I'm told that Jessica Chastain (The Help) also comes out a few minutes after Dan Stevens. We didn't hang around to meet her because we had a train to catch, but maybe next time....",,,
94,Vanessa T.,"Honolulu, HI",155,448,14,3.0,11/14/2011,A small intimate theater with somewhat tight seating arrangements. I can only imagine how uncomfortable a tall or wider person would feel.

96,Julie C.,"Manhattan, NY",27,126,134,5.0,6/23/2012,"1st row Mezzanine seats are perfect spot in this vintage Broadway theatre.  Clybourne Park is poignant, infuriating, offensive, charming & devastatingly spot on in its assessment of our halting progress to equality, and understanding of human diversity.  You laugh out of recognition, shock & embarrassment as often as mirth -- if awareness is the first step toward any meaningful change, here's hoping that the message continues to resonate long after the graffiti paint dries.",,,
97,Karen P.,"San Diego, CA",108,183,22,5.0,4/26/2010,"Simply stunning. $27 for student rush standing room that turned into fourth row seats at intermission. $27 for complete sondheim bliss. this show is classic, and simple, and beautiful, and pure classic musical theatre. so basically like an orgasm for me. sondheim weaves his most beautifully composed score. From the opening night waltz to every day a little death to the miller's son, i felt like butter. the witty lyrics are so intriguing and so classically sondheim. It's just exquisite. the simplistic set, while criticized by critics, added to highlighting the music. I find using the space uniquely equally, if not more interesting, than having a massive set. i thought every calculated gesture eloquently enhanced the story and each musical number was executed beautifully. while catherine zeta jones might be too young to play desiree, she brought a sort of bold beauty to the role. aaron lazar is hilarious and sexy at the same time while erin davie's charlotte is painfully tormented and elegant. leighann larkin steals the show with her bold petra though. i found myself waiting for her next stage appearance. the theatre itself is an A+ too. basically, i feel like people who work in the houses of theatres are sad and pathetic and use the little power they have to torture patrons of the show. however, in this case i found myself treated with respect and kindness. The ticket booth men were not only super nice, they were hot. The guy that sold merch was really nice too and happily engaged in intelligent theatre discussion. the night definitely smiled on this show.",,,

It's one of those mid-size theaters that pepper the Theater District. It doesn't have too many distinguishable qualities, and stands out only when it presents a great play by a great playwright, or starring a famous actor or actress. Its prices are also typical for Broadway. There are three levels of seating. The floor and the front of the second level are in the same price range, since someone finally figured out that it's much better to sit in the front of the balcony than in the back of the floor.",1,1,
