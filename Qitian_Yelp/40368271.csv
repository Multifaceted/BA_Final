1,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11026,4.0,4/3/2017,"Juke box, pool table, an actual refrigerator for beers and mixers instead of a commercial grade cooler? Yep, definitely a dive bar.And it's a damn good one. We came here right at opening, and were welcomed with open arms. Bartender was funny and friendly.They have PBR + shot deals (add a dollar and you can make it a pickleback). At happy hour, well drinks were $4!!!They actually also have pretty good beers too.",2,2,1
2,Mic N.,"Oakland, CA",1,6,1,3.0,6/24/2018,This place breaks my heart. I really like it but honestly the bartender and bouncer have some sort of deep emotional problem and hate anybody who is having fun at their bar. Plenty of other dive bars to go to if you want to have a good time minus douche bags. The bouncer has no problem touching women so take that as you will.On the plus this side made for a great podcast episode. Check out my podcast Asian not Asian podcast on iTunesHave fun and stay safe,6,6,5
3,Sion C.,"New York, NY",1,1,0,1.0,6/17/2018,"Came here with a group of friends. My friend takes a photo of our group. The following interaction occurs:Bartender: ""hey, no photos allowed. You can't take photos of strangers.""Friend: ""the people I took a photo of are our friends.""Bartender: ""you can't take photos of strangers. You know what? Get the fuck out. Leave your drinks and get the fuck out of here.""No attempt is made by the bartender to come to terms about this being a misunderstanding. He cuts hard to using insulting language to tell us to leave.Friend and I leave in a state of confusion, and wait outside the bar for our other friends to join us. A moment later, the bartender appears on the doorstep and starts taunting us. We again try to explain to him that the photo was taken of our friends. For some reason he refuses to accept this, and keeps telling us to get the fuck out, even though at this point we are standing on the sidewalk, waiting for our remaining friends to come out of the bar so we can leave as a group.Our friends finally come outside, unaware of why we left the bar. At this point, the bartender is still taunting my friend. Words are exchanged between my group of friends and the bar staff; a stand-off has formed outside. Then, in a pathetic attempt at showing force, the bartender shoves one of the female members of our group.Don't give this bar your business. It's run by degenerates.",8,5,1
4,Gina I.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/18/2018,"If you want to be taunted and harassed then accused of starting a fight by the owner manager then go here. He started a fight with my husband who took a photo of our friend and kicked them out because he thought my husband took a photo of him. Why would we want a picture of him? We don't. Really not sure why he singled out someone just to bully. Also he pushed a woman.Sad, it was one of our favorite dive bars.",6,3,2
5,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,634,4.0,1/30/2018,"This place is a true dive bar. There are so many qualities of this bar that are great though that I drag my non-dive bar friends here! First, there's a pool table. If a bar has a pool table they atomically become a good bar. All the drinks are very cheap and they have great specials too. The downside is that it's cash only so be prepared! They have a juke box although it already comes with their own set of CD's so you can't really choose anything you want. The place isn't usually crazy crowded too so I usually like to come here because getting a game of pool isn't pulling teeth! The bartenders are also very nice. The bathroom is super dive bar though so, beware!",4,1,3

8,Nathan L.,"Spokane, WA",418,5,0,4.0,6/16/2018,Absolutely loved our bartenders. They were very kind and   appropriately talkative. Drinks were as cheap as you will find them in the City!,1,,
9,Oscar H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,40,0,1.0,8/30/2018,"Cherry Tavern is bad.  The (formerly good) jukebox has either not been working or has been turned off for many years now.  Someone was playing an awful iTunes playlist through a single speaker.  Whoever said this place gets crowded on weekends is mostly wrong.  It *occasionally* gets crowded on weekends.  I don't know what happened to this place, but it sucks now.",,1,

And the drinks are cheap. Go for it!",3,1,1
12,Monstra M.,"New York, NY",25,34,60,1.0,10/7/2017,"This place is gross, they only take cash, and the bathroom doors don't lock. The pickle back brine is disgusting and clearly from some cheap jar of pickles, and they have nothing to offer unless you're sh@tfaced and need to end the night with grimy bad decisions. Also the bartender and owner completely disrespect women and gay men. We overheard them tell a female patron and her companion to ""get out of here b..ch and take your f....t friend with you"". I would never go to a place like that anyway- let alone a completely waste of space like that.",6,5,1
13,Alexandra S.,"Brooklyn, NY",191,3,0,5.0,6/18/2017,"Happened to stumble upon this place the other night after my group left a super crowded bar down the street. It's definitely not like the other bars on the street but if you want a cool place with a homey feel, good drinks, maybe a quick round of pool, and some good conversation I would go here. The drinks are fair priced. I got a couple rounds of Mojitos and they were great. The place is small but once again if you just want to find a nice place to chill with your friends, go here. Also, they have available outlets (god bless!) my phone was practically dead. Loved this place and I'll be back again.",1,,
14,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,254,318,5.0,6/4/2016,"My OG dive bar in NYC. What I love    $5 tequila/tecate specials... Decent jukebox. Snarky bartenders. Who aint shy about buybacks if you are belly up to the bar for a night.I've spent a handful of Birthdays and Thursdays at the Tavern. ( what's the difference) I got nostalgic when I seen the Cherry Tavern while binge-streaming NYPD Blue (Season 3)      I miss the Cherry Tavern, and it's time to go back .",3,1,1
15,Alex B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",45,79,0,5.0,10/22/2017,Hands down the best little bar in the east village. I've been coming here for several years and it never disappoints.

16,Diane G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/17/2018,"This place is really dirty and quite expensive for a dive bar. The worst is their choice of music, always the three songs on repeat!",,,
17,Jonathan E.,"San Diego, CA",412,1154,1806,4.0,2/9/2016,"This a great bar... kinda divey, but totally ship shape.  Good prices, nice barkeeps, and festive, friendly clients.  This is where you go to have a drink and talk with whomever the fuck wants to join in.  There's no secret password, sliding wall, metal cups or ice cubes the size of coffee mugs.  Go in with a $20 and leave with a good buzz.Anything else is wrapping paper.",3,,1

All the people I talked to there were pretty nice, normal, and friendly.. definitely a good crowd. The only drawback was it got too crowded after 10pm.Bonus points awarded for the pool table and Arcade Fire in the jukebox.",2,,2
19,Daniel M.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",142,123,421,5.0,4/1/2016,"This is the place i go to in order to pre-game, before going to Death and Co... I personally enjoy it a lot... I always feel kind of sad when i leave to go next door.. the drinks here are cheap the way anyone should like it.. last night i was drinking three dollar rail tequilas and 2 dollar Miller Hi Lifes... What a deal in Manhattan, what a deal most anywhere... Last night, the jukebox was broken but, other than that, things were fine.. The music on that thing is pretty outstanding.. pool table is always a good thing... I arrived and opened the place up around 6 I believe, it did take me a while to get use to the strong smell of urine but, after that, i was pretty happy..",2,1,
20,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1076,1948,46,5.0,10/14/2014,"This bar is in a convenient location and it is wedged right in between Death & Co and Amor & Amargo. This is a dive bar, so be forewarned. You won't get a sexy interior or mixologists with handle bar moustaches to tell you about all the different bitters. But you will have a good time and this is why. Of course, my hottie date is late, this has been the pattern for awhile, but given the specimen, well worth the wait. I walk into the bar, scanned it out and decided to sit at the bar. The bar had a few people, but it wasn't packed. Two people ordered up 2 bottles of Amstel Light and tried to pay with a credit card. Bar maid declined the card, this is a CASH ONLY establishment. They walked out saying they would come back, but she didn't believed them and offered me their beers for FREE. Now, on the one hand, Amstel light is usually a deal breaker,  but on the other hand, it was FREE. So I politely accepted, took a few gulps and checked out the draft list. Everything here is incredibly cheap, no beer over $7, which is great! And of course while you wait for a date, interesting things happen. For one, two girls to my left clearly were on a date and one started talking to me. A striking beautiful blonde she was. We chit chatted a bit, talked about JoanJett and the good jukebox music in the bar, offered up definitions for SNAFU and FUBAR, and before you know, it, she bought me a fireball shot. So for the half hour I waited for my date, I was offered 3 FREE drinks. Not bad at all if you ask me. And guess what? Those two people that ordered up the Amstel light came back! They got another round of beers, made out profusely and quickly left the bar...Ahem. Thirty minutes passed, the hottie walked through the door, mesmerized myself and the hot blonde and the drinking ensued. Not bad for a Tuesday school night.",6,7,3
21,Thomas M.,"Peekskill, NY",39,38,16,4.0,9/3/2015,"This place is pretty awesome. It's a total dive, but the kind that is pretty open to anyone except jerks. I came early on a Wednesday night. I was looking a little clean cut (since I was waiting for my date to show up for a UCB East show nearby) but didn't feel out of place. Ironically there is a bitters cocktail tasting room two doors down where you can't get a drink for less than $15. This place, as my bartender informed me however, is not classy. He said, ""basically it's a shot and a beer happy hour special"". I preferred a gin and tonic, which wasn't very strong. That's okay, a weak drink was what I was hoping for, not wanting to get too sloshed before my date. She and I grabbed a disappointing sandwich from next door and ate it in the back of Cherry Tavern.I loved that there weren't oppressive speakers in that little nook in the back where we sat; we could actually converse and ponder the trash heap visible through the back window. As we finished our meal and cheap drinks, we noticed the place was starting to fill up. We headed out to our show. I already felt like I knew the staff a little. The place feels like a comfortable little anchor in the East Village. Definitely recommended, mostly for the unquantifiable quality of the people and the good vibes.",1,,1
22,Travis J.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,5/20/2016,Five stars because it is what it claims to be.  They don't have food.  They don't have nice bartenders.  They do have cheap drinks and a pool table.  Sat in the booth in the back after ordering some PBR's and didn't leave for six hours.  Metal Juke Box!!!  Appreciate this spot!,1,,
23,Steven C.,"Raleigh, NC",3,59,1,5.0,3/12/2016,"This is the hallmark for dive bars. Cash only, cheap drinks, dingy Old New York feel. Great place to be over dressed at waiting for your spot at Death and Co, a meer 20 feet away.",1,,
24,Ripan K.,"Philadelphia, PA",44,6,0,5.0,2/1/2016,"Great cocktail bar focusing on amaro and fernet drinks. Had a great sold fashioned and sazerac. I went on a Monday so it wasn't as crowded, which was great. Bartender was nice and served us great cocktails. It's on the pricier end, but worth it when you combine the atmosphere and quality of drinks.",1,,
25,Anthony S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",8,30,0,3.0,9/11/2015,"The good: Price, price price. You're looking at $5 and $6 beer and shot specials. As of last month they get $5 for an ""Old Glory Special"" which is a can of PBR and a shot of house whiskey. Then you got the almighty $6 ""Tijuana Special"" which is a can of Tecate and a shot of disgusting ""Montezuma's Revenge"" brand rack tequila. I can't speak for the mixed drinks' price or quality because in 10+ years of going there I've never ordered anything but Tijuanas. This is a beer and shot place. The bathrooms are grimy. The walls have the classic ""dogs playing poker"" artwork amongst a few other kooky pieces. The lighting is dim red which is great if you're trying to cover up some blemishes or a few extra pounds. This bar has been around for many years and hopefully will be around for many more. It's owned by an old Ukrainian woman with a big fluffy dog who owns the property which is why I think they aren't going anywhere. They have a purple felt pool table that charges about a buck in quarters for a game. The table is all banged up and the cues are about as straight a Washington politician but it matters little because it's just a conversation piece. Most of the rock and rollers in there are friendly. The bad: As usual, the low price tends to attract some unsavoury clientèle. I've seen crust punks and homeless in there. Back in the early 2000's the crowd was usually all young rock and rollers but in the last 10 years there's been an influx of bridge and tunnel rats, thugs, and NYU trash. Often times the d-bags waiting to get into nightclubs will hang out in here in the meantime. They jacked the prices (probably in response to that) several years ago. It used to be so easy to lay out a 5 and a single but now you need to dig for that extra single unless you want to stiff them. I was in there not long ago and the (maybe) 21 year old kid bartender didn't know what a Tijuana special was. I thought they were joking but as it turns out it wasn't a joke. That's like working in McDoodle's and not knowing what a Big Mac is! As others have mentioned, this bar can get VERY crowded after 10PM. There was a few times we went to walk in and the door didn't budge. Confused, we pushed harder only to reveal a definitely illegal WALL of about 200 people squished into there like sardines. It's hit or miss though because there's been times not that long ago when I stayed in there for hours and the place was dead when by all means it should have been standing room only.Protip: Some underground rap collaborative uses the place as their de facto base once a week. I forget when it is but unless you're into arrogant Slim Shadies with attitudes stay the *&^ out if you look through the windows and see all sideways baseball caps.The ugly: I've found things swimming in my drinks and seen stink flies near the cutting boards but for this price it's not that serious. If you're not with that, then I suggest you and your snooty 6 foot faux Amazonian over privileged white princesses go get on the waiting list for Death and All His Friends or whatever that stupid d-bag bar is called down the block. I'll keep my dirty ass hipster girls with questionable morals who pound tequila and have unprotected sex on the first or second date.In conclusion: Like I said in my Lit Lounge review, going to Cherry Tavern is like watching Robert Plant during the 2007 Led Zeppelin reunion. There's definitely still something in the tank but it's bittersweet. The place is full of memories and there can be no denying it was once legendary. However, much like Robert Plant, you can't overlook the fact that times have changed. The thrill is gone but it can still be a decent bar if you hit it on a good night.The bar has definitely been on a downward slide since Rodney and Jessica stopped working there around 2009-2010. There's always new faces working the bar every time I go nowadays but those 2 were long time legends in their time; they were the AC/DC of bartenders. They didn't bother trying to woo you with anything complex like $20 cocktails that look like the blue stuff the barber cleans combs in. They were the quintessential meat and potatoes dive bartenders who gave you shots, beers, rock, and good convo. Nothing will ever be that good again.",2,4,1
26,Edward F.,"Brooklyn, NY",857,18,102,4.0,2/7/2014,The Diet Coke @ Cherry Tavern was pretty damn good. It got the job done and was followed by a Sprite of equal quality.Cherry Tavern reminds me of my ex girlfriend who could tie a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue. I thought this was pretty cool till I realized she was treating the penis of one of my co workers like a cherry stem too.So I am single and Cherry Tavern was the destination for a date I made on Ok Cupid. The date was pretty much a dud. It started out with us both agreeing that it was really cold out and after that not much else. Well I guess the search continues and I shall move on to the next.  I have been going on a lot of dates lately and people keep telling me that I am a serial dater and I should slow down.... But I disagree. I am not a serial dater. I just really like uncomfortable situations in a dive bar atmosphere.,6,29,4
27,Darwin G.,"New York, NY",277,966,67,2.0,2/2/2012,"I prefer my dive bars when they're spruced up a bit. Some decorations, lighting, theme, or just anything to give it a personality. I don't have much of a problem with a hole in the wall, but having friends with different tastes, concessions need to be made. It's quite small, which is made worse by the pool table in the back, and extremely dark for some reason.However, if you're looking for just cheap beer or a tequila and Tecate deal. Knock yourself out.",2,1,1
28,Michelle W.,"New York, NY",520,1155,48,3.0,12/12/2011,"Literally a hole in a wall. If my friend didn't stop me I would have walked right pass it. If you are looking for this place, just look up and find the sign that says Cherry Tavern. This is as dive bar as it gets. One pool table, not much else. Cash only, just drinks. Don't expect anything fancy at all...you get exactly what you ask for and nothing more. One person taking over the bar and that's about it. I don't think I'll be coming back here. It wasn't awful, just something about this place didn't sit well with me. I just felt a little creeped out and couldn't wait to get out of this place. The people there are a great crowd who are really there just to have a good time, but I couldn't make this place work.",2,1,1
29,Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",272,331,315,3.0,11/24/2013,"Here's the thing about Cherry Tavern...I went many times as a 20-something living in NYC and my friends and I would always have hit or miss experiences here, but the positives outweighed the negatives enough to keep us coming back. The bar would always be hoppin, with a diverse mix of folks swinging back cheap-O pickleback shots and beers! Returning last night as a 30-something - I admit that I went into it doubting I could ever re-live some of Cherry's more magical moments, but the thing of it is- this place sustains itself by being a solid dive bar. It's not pretending to be anything more than it is, and that is reflected in the insanely cheap drink prices ($4 for my beer!???), the grungy pool table in the back, the jukebox (which played pure awesomeness last night, by the by) and the rickety old wooden tables and chairs scattered throughout the space. We came early because we are old people, and the place was pretty empty, but it allowed us to commandeer the back. By the time we called it (12:30) the place was packed and seemed to be just as popular as it was 7 years ago! So there you go- they must be doing something right. My major complaint would be that it's waaaay too inconvenient for me to get to, so I wouldn't go out of my way to frequent the place (since it is a standard dive), but if you're a local and you can't get into Death & co, then walk 2 doors down and stop in! PS- it is CASH ONLY, so bring some!",1,,2

Made with Newman's Own Lemonade, not some generic/off-brand crap! Such care and consideration was unexpected when we walked into this grimy-looking establishment. They were also playing some kind of American Gladiator/Battle Dome knockoff show on TV... which is actually a great bar show if you think about it.Will have to come back to give a fuller review.",,1,

I'm not a fan of dive bars but I came here drunk from another bar so this place seemed golden upon arrival. It wasn't crowded and had ample seating in the back by the pool table. We had a swell time playing pool and feeding the jukebox the last of our pesos for some Jay Z and Weezer songs. All was well until some dude/chic dropped some bombs in the poorly ventilated bathroom. With no where to go, the ever unpleasant aroma of 5-day old Chinese take-out excrement, snuck its way out into the main area. That's when I quickly downed my G&T and the night instantly became a blur.Good for groups, bad for taking a shit!",,1,

Despite these considerations, this bar has a pool table (a purple one!), a juke box that usually works, and a big bar with lots of cheap alcohol.The crowd is completely tolerable and low stress (no bar star sightings) with a propensity to drink heavily.

I felt like I was back in Chicago.At around 11 or midnight we easily snagged a booth for our group of 7. It was pretty packed but easy to grab drinks and (shocker!) the bartender actually seemed to enjoy talking to people.Plus, I didn't feel like I was sucked into the east village hipster vortex.Great place to go with friends.

Updated review","The beer & tequila shot special is now $6 bucks, Obama's lousy stewardship obviously to blame. The Che's Ice Tea was awful. It was supposed to be a mojito type of thing. It tasted like a Doublemint gum urinal cake (wintergreen) thing. Again, Obama's sucky-ness probably to blame. The Moscow lemonade was actually good, Cherry vodka and Newman's lemonade. One could easily get banged up drinking a few of these lemonade things, so don't lose count.",,,

The only downside, if you want to call it a downside, is how unbelievably dark the place is. You can't tell if it's 2pm or 2am from the inside. Which might be the point.

Cheap beer and cheap shots are reasons enough to come here, but wait -- there's more...The pool table in back is a major draw and the old school-style jukebox is chock full of great albums from Radiohead to Jay Z to Tom Petty with plenty in between. Sure, this bar is kinda stinky but the men's bathroom has a full-length urinal. Can you really beat that? It's a very laid back place, and a fine alternative to our usual cheap go-to in the neighborhood, Blue & Gold. I think you can also order food to be delivered here -- if I recall (again, consider 6 hours of cheap PBR) they've even got a binder full of neighborhood delivery menus available at the bar.Overall impression: you just want to sit with friends, drink booze, not spend a lot, listen to decent music that you choose from a jukebox, and maybe even shoot some pool... if so, this is the place for you, assuming you can withstand a dirty bar.",,,

We headed over there and not only was the bar (weirdly) empty but the bartender and his buddy had actually locked the door. When they saw my friend and I peeping in they let us in too. We ended up hanging out there all night, and now we go back all the time. David is a great bartender, the bouncer Mr. Adams is equally as easy to kick it with.  The best part about Cherry Tavern? They serve (NYC) cheap PBR and Tecate out of a fridge behind the bar and they don't even open the cans for you. For $1 extra you get a shot with your beer.

The staff are incredibly friendly, quick to serve, make your drinks strong, and provide good conversation when they can. They might even give you a drink or two on the house if you're lucky. The prices are dirt cheap, so you barely have to break a $20 to really get the night started. And when they make a drink, they will literally just top it off with tonic, soda, or whatever is the mixer. Music is a whole range of rock and rap and usually pretty good if that's what you're into.

102,Daniel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,50,0,4.0,4/7/2007,I'm giving this place four stars based on the reason that they have Bad Brains and the Melvins on the jukebox AND the pool table is purple.  :-),2,,1
103,Brent B.,"New York, NY",46,59,0,5.0,10/26/2007,"The Cherry Tavern has had that certain type of old skool NYC charm forever. I usually avoid it on the weekends as it is tiny and can get really crowded. In fact, if I remember correctly I met my third wife at the Cherry Tavern. Total sweetheart, unbelievably charming and completely old skool . The jukebox is top notch and the Mexican drink special of a shot of tequila along with a Tecate reminds me of my first 12 drinks after escaping from that Tijuana Corrections Facility. There is a pool table in the back and always a friendly patron willing to participate in a drunken game of eight-ball. Bring your ID and your American Express card. Cherry Tavern might not accept credit cards but membership still has it's privileges.",1,2,1
104,Matthew S.,"Chicago, IL",46,159,0,4.0,1/19/2007,"Stopped thru here while wandering on a business trip (was waiting for the underwhelming Death & Co. next door). Great hole-in-the-wall bar, one that I would love to take back to Chicago. Tiny, tiny, tiny, but the locals were nice, and played some doubles games of pool with a few people (on their hideous purple pool table). ""I'll be back""",1,2,
105,Nik N.,"Oakland, CA",115,343,82,4.0,5/9/2009,mmmm. cherry. one of my new neighborhood crushes. i give you only 4 stars to keep you under the radar. but you know you have 5 stars in my heart. you have everything i need when i am on the prowl for cheap libations and the opportunity for trouble. straight forward no frill digs with straight forward no frills offerin's. and the bartenders do just that.... tend to your thirst and treat you right....,,,
106,Russ V.,"New York, NY",11,26,0,4.0,9/1/2009,"It's when I first opened the front door and it swung into the bar, I knew I struck gold.  From then on my love affair grew with every $3 can of PBR straight from the cardboard case and I found myself staggering out of this lower east side dive bar happily happy and less than $20 poorer.  On the weekends you might find your name on the sign up sheet for the purple pool table has moved from 2nd to 3rd by some hooligan who squeezed his name before yours and cleverly changed the numbers.  The naked photo hunt machine is one of the only sources of light and can serve as a beacon as you emerge from the bathroom where aiming is optional.  You can also listen to your ipod instead of the jukebox, but then so does everyone else.",,,
107,Liz B.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,4.0,12/18/2005,"One of our standby bars-- can't beat the special: a shot of tequila and a can of Tecate beer for five dollars.  Gets you drunk quickly and cheaply.  (I think there's a four dollar weeknight special of a similar combo, but I can't remember what of.)  I read in an old '90s Zagats Nightlife book that this bar was a really ""hip dive"" where Liv Tyler & models used to hang out, which is funny.  It's hard to still be a real ""dive"" in the shiny new East Village, but this place has absolutely no pretentions.  It's never too hipper-than-thou or preppy-come-downtown: just cool people doing the tequila wobble.  I guess they could replace the pool table with a few more seats.",1,,
