However, there's a great variety of craft beer on draft, the back patio is a great chill spot, and their chicken strips are quite possibly my absolute favorite chicken strips of all time.",,,
1,Carlos O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",93,350,749,5.0,4/8/2018,"Came here for brunch today what a great time I had. This is one of the places I had to check in the upper West side of Manhattan [INWOOD]  after hearing friends and great reviews of this place I had to experience It myself. I did not get the servers name but she was nice, the music was nice and low to the point u can talk and communicate. What i order was delicious I'll post some pictures up. Will be coming here again thanks guys.",,,
2,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,3.0,7/21/2017,"Hump Day was rough especially a sweltering hot day that need a cooling as I was succumb to heat exhaustion.  I desired indoor seating away from the blazing sun in the comfort of air conditioning environment.  Inwood Local was outside my time as a intervention to my travel reaching home and certainly outside of space - very distance from home but I always give the opportunity for a try.  In the passage of time and space of Inwood this bar appealed to me for Happy Hour for one peach Sangria $5.00.  It strongly tasted like lemon- NOT peach.  It surely did not contain any elements of Sangria- no fresh fruit.  This drink written on the menu should be change to ""Lemon Sangria!""  Furthermore, I was not greeted with a warm welcome upon entering as apparently the heat has injected a negative energy to the male bar tender and female waitress whom appeared busy cleaning or arranging the bar rather than serving me.  No smiles.  Rude scowl looks tossed at me as this is customer service!  It was not busy as it was very early at 5 pm and the business was not packed with customers.  Obviously, they prefer to do anything else to evade my presence.  With utter dismay for such a business as the food was rated good reviews from previous Yelpers which was another reason the attraction for my visit.Ergo, no gratuity granted.  No return visits - only fast exits.",3,2,2
3,Monet H.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,3.0,8/2/2018,"Oh, Inwood Local. How the mighty have fallen. I've been coming here for over 6 years and it feels very mediocre now. The food is just meh. Prices are average. Service is... well, it is. The staff is always bordering between wildly helpful and wildly annoyed. They have a great selection of wine and craft beer, which is really the only reason to come back continually. I like the idea of Inwood Local but service and menu have to change to push this local bar over the top again. It just feels like the entire place is resting on their laurels.",,,
4,Sarah R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",103,136,1,3.0,3/15/2017,"A generous 3. Fried chicken tenders with magical chipotle mayo is my favorite. Most of the food I've had is well done and priced appropriately.The service leaves something a little bit to be desired. My favorite Inwood Local bad service moment is when we were seated in the tiny two top table right across from the cash register, 2 feet from the bartender. Here's how most of the evening went.""Hi we've been waiting 25 minutes for menus...""""Excuse me but I could I just..."" (as waitress walks by and ignores me)*Desperately trying to make eye contact with waitress at cash register*""Hey when you're finished with that table do you mind...""*Sad wistful look toward bartender, bartender pretends not to see**Awkward, hungry waving*""DEAR GOD PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO ME"" in a starving Chris Farley voice (not an exaggeration. OK, maybe a little)""If we reach the 20 minute mark waiting for our check, does that mean our food is free?""*Taps pretend microphone* ""...Is this thing on?""I would return more often if I could be assured that our menu, drinks, and food would be served in a timely manner and if we would see the waitress more than two times during our stay. Please Inwood Local. I want to love you. You don't make it easy.",4,3,1

Not really, I like where I live but this is a great place.  I've been twice, most recently when my beer club met here.  This is a great space with tasty food and a terrific beer list.  Plus, the service is wonderful.The bartender we had was really efficient and kept all 40+ of us in our beers and Brian who was taking food orders and running food and drinks did an outstanding job of keeping up with us.  They have an enclosed back room that is good for groups and their garden is nice.  Can't wait for warmer weather to hang out there.It's a quick trip uptown on the A to this place, so if you haven't been, get yo-self up to Inwood, stat!",20,5,8
7,Nadine M.,"New York, NY",340,25,0,3.0,4/28/2018,This is my brunch review for today.Food was good. I had the French toast but they try to hard with all the extra wheat cereal dipped and stuffed with a cream cheese filling. Just give me a good French toast and it wasn't hot off the grill. Just a good warmth to the food. Turkey sausage a bit overcooked. Cheddar biscuits were ok nothing to brag about. It's a good neighborhood spot all in all. I'm just not crazy about the brunch.,,,
8,Meghan G.,"New York, NY",455,71,11,5.0,7/5/2017,"My favorite local bar. Very nice inside, good music, bartenders are awesome. Beer selection always has something new. The black bean burger is probably my favorite thing to order in the neighborhood. Fries are great too. The chicken fingers are delicious and so crisp. The nachos with pulled pork is awesome--huge portion so either order to share or only order if you're hungry!! Happy hour specials are good too, I think they run 4-7pm. Most things I've ordered off the menu are really good. Intimate seating in front, open picnic-like table seating in back is great for groups, and there is also a yard area (no service outside, but you can order in and sit in the yard). A lot of room for you and your group. But also, a chill place to go solo.",2,,
9,Sarah M.,"Bronx, NY",0,28,12,3.0,7/16/2017,"I used to really love this place but I went last night and was pretty disappointed. We ordered sangria and it was definitely not as good as I remember. It wasn't mixed well and just tasted like a light juice. I ordered the lamb burger. It was a little dry but overall, pretty good. On the bright side, the service was great and we didn't have to wait for a table!",1,,1
10,Caroline R.,"Manhattan, NY",133,194,246,5.0,6/25/2017,"The Inwood Local is a great addition to the neighborhood, with a very diverse menu. Service is always excellent and they have a fantastic cheese board to go with your wine. They only serve wine/beer and sangria.",,,1
11,Ashley P.,"Bronx, New York, NY",1,15,1,3.0,2/26/2018,"Many selections in beer and wine, the food was okay but could be better, sometimes if  you mention something they aren't sure about like a specific wine or or beer they look at you strangely, other than that a great atmosphere to socialize, in the night super intimate sometimes have live bands and that's pretty cool, not a place I'd care to go back to but wouldn't mind",,,
12,Jose T.,"Jerome Park, NY",61,15,3,5.0,2/26/2018,"I love this place, they do have about 20 beers on draft! Environment here is nice and chill, I Had the pork sliders here, they were good, I would like to try their brunch, a couple of friends told me that i hav3 to, I can't wait for it, the only thing I can complain about is the restroom, only one for the hold restaurant",,,
13,John C.,"Springfield Township, NJ",30,155,145,3.0,9/11/2016,Ate here last night with a friend that lives in the neighborhood. They have a nice selection of beers on tap. I ordered the sliders which were okay but they don't come with anything so order a side if you want fries. My friend ordered fish tacos which looked delicious. I would definitely come back if I was in the neighborhood but I'd also try other places. Service was good. My only reason for not awarding four stars is that the bathroom was dirty. Wastebasket was overflowing and gross.,1,,
14,T L.,"New York, NY",9,73,0,4.0,6/5/2017,"Really nice waiter, not much of a wait for our food even on a Sunday afternoon.  The table was clean and even had a hook for bag/umbrella which is a nice touch.My friend had peach sangria and a bacon/leek frittata of which was a surprisingly large portion.  I had a pineapple cider (tasty!) and a burger which was delicious, with cucumber salad on top.  Overall, would definitely go back.",,,
15,Catherine T.,"New York, NY",1388,204,624,3.0,3/22/2017,"Stopped in for happy hour with friends yesterday. These guys have a great happy hour deal. Our serve was awesome he was attentive funny, and good at recommending things of the menu. My friends each got a sangria pitchers I had their mule which was awesome. So good I had two :). The food on the other hand wasn't the best. Wings were dry, the Mac n cheese wasn't the best. The burger sliders were good can't complain. I'll probably be back for their happy hour but won't be eating here again.",1,1,1
16,Briget A.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,22,5,5.0,10/17/2017,Had a quick snack here. It was a very casual vibe and I walked in because of the half inside/half outside type of seating that was available near the bar. Decided to get the caprese for $11 and it was so yummy! The seasoning on the tomatoes added an incredible amount of flavor and the bread was toasted perfectly! Also liked their selection of beer and cider.,,,
17,Eugene O.,"New York, NY",425,430,1619,4.0,1/17/2015,"16 beers on tap, 14 of those are local.  You can fill your growler here also you can buy one for filling.  Prices are very good as their happy hour.  They offer beer flights and let you taste beer and wine prior ordering if you aren't sure.  I love the people and the atmosphere in this place, however you need not order food here,  I have sampled pretty much the entire menu and it leaves much to be desired.   Stick to the basics and you wont be disappointed here.   Anything other then the sliders and the french fries is terrible here.  They do try but it would be best if they just offered beer burgers and fries.Happy hours is daily from 5-7 pm, and they do have special nights for wine and also poetry here.Come thirsty not hungry to this place!  Cheers!",6,1,3
18,Ravi R.,"Bronx, NY",578,12,7,2.0,11/19/2016,"I was reluctant to leave a review of this establishment, however this isn't my first rodeo with this bar. I find that the majority of staff lacks knowledge of beer and wines. I will say that the waiters are more that accommodating to all needs of patrons.I am a big wine drinker and enjoy all types. I made a few attempts to drink the waitresses suggestions; however they were all terrible. The storage of opened bottles are horrendous! I asked waitress what else she suggested and her recommendation was for me to get up and refer to the Bartneder. The Bartneder that just got back from smoking three cigarettes, I thought to myself.I reverted to some seltzer water and no ice to avoid issues. I love the fact that this is an uptown lowspot; however I challenge the owners to do better.Step the wine list and knowledge of your staff. Lost drinks is equivalent to lost money...Step it",4,2,1
19,Jeruen D.,"Berlin, Germany",35,1316,810,4.0,1/6/2016,"My sister, her partner, and another friend went here together with me the other night for dinner. They have great beers here! They also have a rather good selection of pub food. I personally liked the burger, which I ordered rare and with stilton cheese as well as yam fries. That was good! I am glad that they didn't overcook it, yes, there was pink, but it was definitely tasty. The yam fries were also delightful to munch on.They might have a small front area, but the back area is rather spacious and they even have heat lights in case of cold winter evenings. The only thing I don't like which prevents me from giving them a full 5 stars is the bathroom. It wasn't clean, and they didn't have cold water. Washing hands with hot water wasn't fun!",1,,1
20,Heather W.,"Manhattan, NY",36,391,890,1.0,11/10/2014,"I'd really love to love this place, too, but:The service is GLACIAL.  Last time I went, it took 45 min (!!!) JUST to get menus.Once we finally got our food, the ENTIRE plate was cold.  (Both plates we ordered!)  I had ordered a cheese omelet.  We know what cold cheese in an omelet is like.  The sides included in the dish were also cold (cheesy potato square; biscuit?)  After I'd sent it back for a fresh one, they'd tried to re-microwave it, but the potato thing was still cold inside.  I think it's all pre-made, in the fridge, microwaved.  WHY BOTHER going to a restaurant when you can just do it yourself after going to the prepared-food counter at the supermarket?This is a regular experience upon dining here.  So, if you have hours to kill and aren't really that bothered by cold food, this is the place for you.It's also VERY VERY VERY loud.  Think club volumes at all hours.  If you want to actually have a conversation, look elsewhere.  Bring earplugs too.  If you're not really speaking to your dining companions, great!Note:  they are friendly.  At least they are friendly.  But really, the SLOWNESS and cold food issues are huge for me, and I just can't afford to return, psychologically.",3,1,
21,Kat R.,"Bronx, NY",39,30,67,4.0,12/19/2015,"I really like this place. The bartenders are super friendly!!! Great beer and wine selection. They usually have about 16 beers on tap and many bottle selections. Keep in mind they don't have any hard liquor. They only carry wine and beer. The chicken fingers are yummy and very filling. Great ambiance. Dimly lit and the music is not overpowering. They have outdoor seating in the back which I have yet to utilize because I really like sitting in the bar area. Overall, a great place to have a glass of wine or beer, catch up with friends and enjoy a good meal!!",1,,
22,Joe P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1,38,18,2.0,9/5/2015,"I really wanted to like this place more but the food just isn't up to par. I ordered the pastrami sliders. The presentation was great, but the pastrami was very tough to the point where I couldn't take a bite. I had the chew the small slab as one piece. The flavor was decent, and kraut was good, but no excuse for tough pastrami in NYC. I tried the apple crisp next. Again excellent presentation. The first few bites were warm and tasty but as I worked my way to the center it was beyond cold. It was actually frozen! I don't mind that it wasn't freshly made but it needed to be heated properly. I enjoyed the wide beer selection, but they were out of Kelso so I settled for a substitute. There is no beer offered below $6 which would be a nice option for locals on a budget. The outdoor seating appeared not to be set up as chairs were stacked high in the garden area. I sat in the back room and watched the U.S. Open which was a nice option from the noisier front room. I was enjoying the vibe until a couple brought in their two children, one whom shrieked through most of the meal. No fault of the restaurant, but why do parents bring young kids out after 9pm? The bathroom needed attention. The sink had some green slime in the corners and the trash can appears have taken a beating. Easy fixes with a little attention. There is one shared restroom. I will say I did enjoy the service. They have a great team of servers and staff works together. They all smile and are happy doing their jobs. I am going to give this place another chance  because it's close to where I live. I like the atmosphere, service, and food presentation, but they need to up their preparation game before I put Inwood Local on my weekly list.",3,1,1
23,Ramona R.,"Sacramento, CA",194,115,68,4.0,5/5/2015,"I keep on forgetting to review this place but it's definitely one of my weekly hangouts. Usually a Friday or Saturday night I'll meet up with my friend and we will grab a beer and Pinot. Food is great! The menu is a little obscure and random but once you've seen it a few times you know how to maneuver around it. My go to is the cheese board (feeds like 2-3), wings, and nachos. Can't go wrong with anything there for food and craft beers. Ok so this is why they don't get 5 stars...they run out of food ALL THE TIME. If I'm craving something it's out. That's annoying. Second there's one waitress there who acts like a ditz but she's just passive aggressive...sorry if I'm inconveniencing you with my order. Lastly...the live bands are GREAT, however do not allow sloppy garage band kids to play in there. I do not appreciate a fucking trombone or whatever in my ear while I'm having dinner and girl talk at the bar. Anywho minor tweaks would give this place a 5 star rating but overall a great go to local bar.",2,1,
24,Lea K.,"Shinjuku, Japan",47,42,49,5.0,9/2/2016,This is a super cute place to get your beer and wine on. Great happy hour specials. Love the guacamole. Small menu but everything we had was yummy.,,,

Updated review","My second visit to Inwood Local, four years later...one less star. Dinner time. Wasn't even that busy, but the service was annoyingly slow. The food was a major disappointment, too. Calamari were rubbery and chewy, while their burger was overcooked and flavorless. Above-average beer selection; servers and staff are friendly; I would steer away from the typical bar food and just drink here.",1,1,1
26,Lorraine K.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",1,5,3,4.0,5/24/2015,It's not my 1st experience here .. The wine selection is by far the *BEST* I have only tried their wine selections and never been disappointed . But Really the Shiraz with Malbec  what a Good surprise..        The piazzete appetizer .. yummy n light to get my tummy for a Fried chicken salad .. Oh how Tasty the Chicken with blue cheese .. This could be a salad to share for 2 . Mi hija loved the chorizo appetizer n the pastrami sliders are tasty and filling( enough to eat 2 and share the other 2 sliders)Overall Inwood local is a 4 star neighborhood restaurant /bar that has interesting atmosphere a great wine and food selection and did I mention an outside garden with some tables .. In back .. Only down size is service .. But it's not easy to hire waiters esp enough in this up n down economy .Thank you ! to the owners who took a chance I will be back again n again with amigos n family,1,,1
27,Jose J.,"Bronx, NY",77,44,27,4.0,7/10/2016,"A beer fan will love this place, tons of beers from all over the world and wines.the food is good, but it takes a little while to come out, but don't let that or the other reviews stop you from coming here. Ambiance: very chill place to relax, read a book, watch a game or enjoy some live music. Inwood Local offers you all that plus a back room and a patio.Most of the time the service is very good, I have no complaints about them.I think the only con with this place is not having a liquor license, but remember: beers and wines get people drunk too ;)",,,
28,Lou M.,"New York, NY",21,23,0,3.0,4/9/2017,So the cooks all quit today. Believe it or not the staff is handling this pretty well. Now I might think this because I'm 5 pints in but this is all I got.  I'm so hungry and everything is in black and white... but I guess it's all OK.,,,
29,Aisha M.,"Manhattan, NY",34,18,2,2.0,6/4/2016,"Don't order any food from this place. I placed my order via seamless.com at 9:37pm and I still don't have my food and it is now 11:05pm. I LIVE 4 BLOCKS AWAY. Due to a sleeping baby, I can't wake her up to pick up my food myself. The only reason why Inwood Local gets 2 stars is because their beer selection is wonderful and the option of outdoor space is nice. Update: my food arrived at 11:07pm and it was cold. After an hour and a half, 4 blocks away, for a sandwich & sausage, I cannot believe the food was cold. Make an effort Inwood Local, geez. Or just don't say you offer delivery.",,,2
30,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,5.0,1/15/2013,"It took me a while to check out this place but once I did I knew its the kind of place I've always wanted to have in my neighborhood. The owners have a couple of other establishments in the neighborhood but this place is the only one I really liked. I've been back multiple times since and on different occasions. It's a great brunch spot as well as a wonderful casual drinking spot with friends. The menu is solid and for brunch I really enjoy washing it down with their beer mimosa. The beer menu is stellar and the draft selection is excellent. And when I don't feel like beer then their wine selection is also decent. The front area gets louder just because of the space configuration so I prefer hanging out at the back on one of the communal tables. It's never been too crowded though so my friends and I have always had the entire table to ourselves. The staff is nice but if you are sitting at the back area then service might tend to be a little slow. But then, why are you in such a rush anyway? Relax and enjoy!",7,,2

While I do love the uniqueness and the beer selection, I was left a little disappointed. The prices don't match up to the food, drinks or service. I went on a Saturday night and the ambiance was pretty dead and boring. Not much going on so we left after 2 drinks. This place might be different on weeknights, but I'd stay away on Fridays and Saturdays.The staff is very friendly and the customers seem decent and kinda hipster.

36,Jaire Q.,"Houston, TX",615,1110,1165,3.0,3/31/2013,"I was meeting some friends for Brunch on a Sunday morning. It was actually St. Patrick's day. My cousin and I got there early and (of course) got us some Bellini's and white peach sangria to start our day. The place is cute and they even decorated a little for the occasion, my cousin and I got plastic clover necklaces from the bar.. Our bar tender was good, served us quickly and effortlessly. Once our group of about 15 arrived we were seated towards the back in something like a picnic table. I thought it was kind of cool to be seated on a picnic table in the middle of Washington heights! lol. The food was delicious. I ordered the Kobe Burger and the apple pancakes. My issue with this place is in the service we received. The server who tended to my group must have been new. I was surprised at the fact that he really just did not get that with a large group, you have write things down and just pay attention. Now, before I continue let me say there were probably 5 tables in the entire back room and two servers taking care of them, so it was not that he was too busy. It took him 25 minutes to bring me a Bellini, another 10 for me to even order my food. I had to ask the other  server for water because our server was M.I.A for a while. It took about 35-40 for me to get my food, once I got the pancakes and burger my friend volunteered to get me the syrup and ketchup so it would not take another 25 minutes!! He actually went to the front to get it. After this ordeal, when the bill comes it says: suggested tip on the receipt of $18, so I am thinking this guys sucks, I'm leaving him $14! He is once again M.I.A so I go to the front to pay and they actually manually add the tip w/o my permission. I asked them why does it say suggested tip if you are just going to put it in without my consent?! I left it at that, whatever. As I am walking out my first bar tender asks me how everything was and when I tell her our server sucked, tips are added without consent  in this establishment,  but at least the food was good... she just looked at me dumbfounded and confused. I told her: ""if you didn't really want to know you should not have asked!I am giving them three stars because the place is cool and the food is good. If I ever go there again I will just eat by the bar. No matter what anyone says, this place is NOT GOOD FOR BIG GROUPS!",1,,1
37,Denise F.,"New York, NY",4,81,101,2.0,4/18/2016,"A group of 4 of Us decided to meet up on a Sunday afternoon for some beers & food. I had about two years without visiting this place & I must say it was an OK experience. The place seemed to be understaffed on a busy Sunday afternoon & we def suffered because of it. I lasted a while to even get the staffs attention to order my food; we waited a very long time for the food to arrive & I was very disappointed with my meal :/ I ordered the chicken sandwich & the bread was so HARD that I had to remove it in order to be able to eat the chicken/ avocados.  In general, I know this is a cozy spot in InWood however, they should have more staff working to avoid ppl waiting awhile to order drinks/ food & even get napkins lol",,,

He brought me menus but I sat for probably 10 minutes completely ignored.  Then another waiter came up and asked me to move again.  He was apparently reserving this space as well!  Being hungry and a little hormonal I almost started to cry.  (I feel silly about it now). The waiter told me I could sit at the bar and waved me off.  I ended up just leaving.  I'm leaving a review because this just isn't what I'm used to at Inwood local and I thought it was sad.

40,Rebecca Z.,"New York, NY",246,136,421,4.0,7/29/2014,"Great restaurant in the neighborhood. Can have a hipster vibe at times. They have a lot of beers on tap and the selection changes frequently. They seem to like to focus on local and US craft beers, which I'm not a huge fan of, but they do always have a German or Belgium beer on tap as well. I am crazy about their version of caprese salad because they oven roast the plum tomatoes to perfection. Chicken wings and burgers are great too. The portions at brunch are huge. French toast is sweet and crunchy because it's crusted with cornflakes. The BLT sandwich is served with avocado on a big piece of crusty French bread.",3,,2

Updated review","I go to this place a lot and they have been pretty consistent. But for some reason this time was not as satisfactory.They had more people working than they usually do but the service was slower than when they are short.I usually order boardeux by the glass for  me and my wife because 4 glasses cost the same as 1 bottle and thats usually what u get out of a bottle. However our first round of glasses wasn't even close to a serving. We complained to the waitress Isabel who is great by the way and she relayed the message to the bar tender Harry who refused to add some more. It's not that I wanted extra because I am a regular but a little loyalty for customer retention goes a long way. None less, next time we will just order a bottle if there is a next time. Which I think there will but just not as often.We ordered our normal Nachos, Wings, Fries, and added a pizzette.Nachos weren't bad but weren't their usual. Wings were still great. Fries were not cooked evenly. Pizzette was over cooked.",2,2,2
45,Melissa W.,"New York, NY",190,334,422,4.0,4/20/2014,"This is one of our favorite places to go when we want to do something different, but still not be too far from home. Great beer selection & bar area. I've always found the bartenders very nice & helpful. Menu is unique & I've had some very tasty items here as well. Food: I've had the cajun crusted catfish sticks, cheese board, sauteed spinach, a few different pizettes, and a bunch of other things. I've liked some things more than others, but all were pretty good. Atmosphere: cool area, but it is a bit small. It can get crowded. There is also a back area that they open up in the summer, but have heaters in the colder months. I also have to say, I know this is so creepy, but I love the bathroom here. Which is crazy, because there is only one! The line can get long but it's just such a relaxing room.I will definitely be back to IL in the future!",3,,2

Several hard to find craft beers on tap, a nice brunch program, cool music, hip decor, and a general ""downtown"" feel to an area of New York City often known for its homey, modest attitude.

57,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,1/15/2013,"Went there for brunch on 1/13/13Ambiance: We sat in the outdoor area which is covered by a panel in the winter but allows you to get day light. The only had one TV so if you weren't sitting on the side of the tables that faces the TV you couldn't watch the game; I suggest placing a TV on the other side of the room.Food: I had the avocado BLT which tasted delish , it was $9 but didn't come with fries so my friend and I shared an order of fries and they were good. My friends seem to like their food as well (chicken fingers , burger and lamb sandwich).Drinks: they had $4 brunch drinks, which included bellinis, peach sangria, and coco loco. I had the coco loco which was a mixture of coconut syrup , savignon blanc and pineapple juice. It tasted like a virgin piña colada, just  too sweet. My friend got a pitcher of some beer for $15 and that was supposed to be a special but it's $15 for a pitcher really a special?Service: Our waitress was a bit sarcastic and not the most attentive. Sarcasm is something I don't mind in my friends but i don't necessarily want from the person serving my food. I wouldn't object to going back but I am not begging my friends to go back either.",2,,

65,Stacey S.,"New York, NY",36,60,8,3.0,9/20/2014,"I want to like this place, I really do. And I kinda do. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally mustered up the courage to venture inside. It's pretty small, and a little intimidating, but it actually ended up being more friendly and spacious  - there's an enclosed ""beer garden"" in the back, as well as an outdoor space, which is really disappointing. They should totally make better use of it; it's currently just a pebbled yard with a few chairs. Anyway... my first experience was actually post-brunch drinks on a Sunday afternoon, and there was a sweet brunch drinks deal, with really cheap bloody maries, mimosas, etc. Service was pretty terrible, but we had lots of time to kill, and didn't mind. (I would have never considered the place for brunch, but the menu looks pretty good, and we wished we hadn't just eaten elsewhere so we could try.) I returned for drinks and snacks with a friend another night. Sangria was OK, fries were good. Their focus is definitely beer, and there's quite a selection; otherwise it's just wine (and sangria the night we were there), not a full bar. A little pricey. Service was pretty horrible again, even while perched at the bar, directly in front of the bartender.Returned a few times for dinner, and was disappointed. Tried the fried fish. Meh. Tried the mini pizza. OK, nothing special. Husband was equally unimpressed with his choices (burger, I believe?) and once they forgot the fries (and his beer) and we gave up after 20mins waiting for them. Service again was pretty terrible, and each time we get the bill we wonder why we bothered - totally not worth dropping $40-50.",2,,

Second time I wanted to stray from getting the same thing but my stomach wouldn't let me go too far. I compromised on the lamb burger which is served in a pita and is very similar to a gyro. The cous cous was forgettable.  The service is accurate but less than personable and normally would dwell in 3 star land, but there is rarely a venue with so much space and a sizable backyard for summer sitting in Manhattan.

I watched a family enter and leave in the time it took me to see my waitress again. When I did see her, her body was already starting to turn away from me and walk away before I could even open my mouth. So I didn't. I will try it again, but not alone. Who are they to judge how much I may or may not spend? And I was going to spend tonight. I'm rather disappointed and turned off as I sit here waiting for my check.

I've had my birthday there, and have taken dates there - the environment is appropriate for both.ESPECIALLY if you're a hard liquor lightweight like me. This place only serves wine and beer, so if you're looking for ""shots shots shots"" you should head elsewhere. I had a bad vodka incident on my previous birthday so this worked well for me. The place is cozy and chill inside with a large back porch that is heated in the fall and winter. There's a wide selection of wine and craft beer as well as some decent food. DJs often set up there playing their specialty - depending on the night, you can hear Motown, 90s hip-hop, or 80s top 40. I do miss some of the specials they used to host. There is no longer $35 open beer bar on first Saturdays, nor is there evening happy hour after 10pm. Perhaps these specials will return to compete with some of the new venues a few blocks south on Broadway.",1,,
70,Emily H.,"Bronx, NY",188,12,13,3.0,3/5/2016,I stopped by for brunch. They have a good alcohol selection but I was just sticking to food. The garden vegetable frittata was a bit underwhelming but the cheese biscuit that came with it was delicious. Our server was very pleasant.

We basically did a group thing and paid a set place which included unlimited beer/wine and also some apps that were delicious! Apps included, different types of wings and dips, chicken fingers, sliced cold cuts, cheese and fruits. The music was great. it changed from 80ps to awesome 90s as well as current favorites. But most of us preferred the 80s that we were very familiar with and nostalgic to our hearts. Later on in the evening, it was changed to latin music which was great. we all gone on the floor - eventho space was sort of tight.We all had a great time here. It's definitely a cool place to have a gathering. They have an indoor tent sent out in the back with heaters so you wouldn't be cold at all. very cute place!",,,

Yelpers, thank you for leading me to this absolute GEM inside of Inwood.At the risk of sounding cliche, ""It's like, you're in Inwood, but you don't feel like you're in Inwood. You know what I mean? It's like...you're not in Inwood! But you are! AWESOME."" (You know what I mean?)Nestled into a cozy nook on Broadway, right at the end of the line of the A train, there is so much to love! The ambiance is just right: brick walls coupled with dim lighting and candles. It's a perfect place for a date or to chat with your friends over a glass of vino. The wine and beer list is extensive, and the items on the menu were vast and scrumptious. I went for the lamb burger, served in a warmed pita, with cucumber-yogurt sauce and the lentil-cous cous mix, and was pretty much blown away...it was almost too rich to finish, but I still can not find fault with that. The tomatoes were red and ripe, and the lettuce was green and crisp.The waitstaff consisted of two people this evening, but they were ever so attentive and personable the entire time.I'm already thinking about what I want to eat there the next time I go...and the time after that...and the time after that...and, well, yes, even the time after that!

Both were tasty and reasonably priced. Waitress = started at 4 stars, but gradually decreased to a 1 by the end. We pretty much never saw her again after she took our food order, which made drinks ordering difficult. She was busy chatting up some dude at the end of the bar. We had to hunt her down for both additional drinks and the check. Food runner/bus guy = 5 stars. If it weren't for him, we'd have had no food.

Updated review","Certainly my favorite bar near my home and rivals favorite places from all over the map. The head barkeep here is extremely good at his job and I hope he never leaves. He is friendly and keeps everyone well served and an atmosphere of complete relaxation and intense happiness among all the clientele. There are big long tables in the back for celebrations or for people having a family meal. They have ""teacher Tuesdays"" and overall the place seems popular with them. The decor is unusual and nice, and the wide selection of beers always terrific. You can also get wine, but I think cocktails are not permitted because they are on the same block as a church. A bar rather than a gastropub, the menu is nonetheless creative and extensive, although I sometimes wonder about who is on duty in the kitchen.  They are quite accommodating to sports fans, too, without actually being a sports bar.

You may even get good conversation going from the friendly bartenders.There is a great variety of beer and I like the wine selections as well. For bar food, their food is pretty good too.

Although it's very small and narrow, there's a larger area with picnic tables towards the back. It gets really cold back there during the winter months but it's the only area where you can sit together if you're with a group larger than 3.  They seem short staffed on weekends bc the folks in the back won't see the waitress for large periods of time so plan for a table in the front area. The wings & fries are great. Zoe Muñoz plays here on Sunday night, which is a lovely touch to have some nice live music because I come here for that reason.

He also mentioned another stout that he thought I would like and will try in the future!The food is also fantastic - never disappoints. Friends have had the schnitzel and adored it.

I've been there several times and always very relaxed, friendly service. The bartender makes excellent recommendations and will let u try many samples as well. You can tell they really enjoy caring for their customers.I had brunch here and had the best BLT ever! Ive also tried their hot pretzels and zucchini fries.

Folks new to the 'Wood and passing through often seem impressed with the place, and there are some good reasons. Their beer menu is diverse and great. The service is very attentive without being over-bearing. They've hit a decent stride at being a little trendy without being overly so most of the time...BUT...The menu is a bit thin...especially brunch. When you'd like a good old fashioned omelette and some potatoes...it's not really there. It's more like appetizer food, which tastes fine, but doesn't do much if you're hungry.Also, the music...ugh! Some weekend times walking in here is like walking into a club. LOUD! And there's no real reason for it other than the people working like it loud. It's good music, but the atmosphere often lends itself to a loungy vibe you can hang out in for hours. That doesn't need a ridiculously loud old school hip-hop soundtrack to it. I do go back though. Largely because it's one of the few nice places in the neighborhood, but also because the people are so friendly and nice. Great place for happy hour or after work drinks. I wouldn't recommend it for early dating, but not bad for couples who've been together for a while. (The seating is mixed, but sometimes uncomfortable. And the volume isn't conducive to long ""getting to know you"" conversations.) All in all, it's a nice place though.",,,1
92,Amelia Z.,"Bronx, NY",274,403,14,5.0,6/16/2013,"Can we just take a minute and talk about the miracle that is the sweet plantain sundae made by the chefs at Inwood Local?In an expression of cultural diffusion, mixing the traditional Dominican sweet plantain with Belgian chocolate and vanilla ice cream, this sundae was a life-changing experience for me as a diner. The plantains were fried in a way that I've never had them before, just slightly crisp, hot and sweet. The ice cream did melt beneath the slices, but it made it into a creamy, cold, warm mix of flavors. The fresh strawberries, crunchy cashews, and caramel invited a mix of textures that has never been matched in any dessert I've sampled around here.I am so glad this beer garden is a quick Bx12 ride away. I can easily see Inwood Local becoming a hangout for me (at least it would if I actually had friends that weren't terrified of venturing above 96th street). It's a low-key spot with friendly, relaxed service and a cool selection of craft beers. I had a tasty pear hard cider that paired well with my main dish, the chicken mole with jalapeno cornbread.I also sensed a slight Indian influence in some of the dishes. The chicken's texture reminded me a bit of tikka. The yogurt and cucumber mix served with the kobe burgers triggered memories of raita.I think Inwood Local avoids being a hipster joint by its ability to blend cultures and maintain Inwood's modest reputation. I hope it stays that way!",4,,

The craft beers and wines are all reasonably priced and you can try any beer before you buy it. I LOVE, LOVE the charcuterie plate...it brings several meats and cheeses along with delicious bread. Favorite beers- La fin du monde and Golden Monkey. TRY THEM OUT.Servers are great, there's live music, great crowd.

97,Kristin C.,"New York, NY",9,90,0,4.0,1/18/2013,"I initially posted a rather intense and emotional review of my experience at Inwood Local this past Friday night, but I am now back (with a lot of hindsight) to edit it.  My friends and I heard something in the music played (a particular word with racial significance...admittedly on an advertised 90's hip hop night; we hadn't come with that in mind, but rather discovered it upon arrival).  While I understand that the use of certain words (this one, in particular) has become mainstream in certain cultures in genres, we are still upset and offended by their use, remembering the history and original definition of this one particular word.I was most upset because I have had so many wonderful experiences at Inwood Local (as well as its sister restaurant, the Garden Cafe...a few doors down) over the years with friends, neighbors, and colleagues.  The word I heard repeatedly in the music came as a shock and not something that aligned with what I knew of the establishment and how it presents itself.  So, I posted a review here...likely in haste and right after it happened.  I was angry.However, I had the opportunity today to sit down with Gus, the owner and discuss the whole incident (which created, thanks to my haste, quite a bit of buzz in the Inwood community).  I appreciate his willingness to talk in an open, honest, and frank matter.  We clearly ended on a (friendly) agree to disagree position (since even while understanding its place in hip hop music, I will always have negative thoughts with regard to certain words).  He did say that now he knows that some folks are offended (My friends spoke with him as well), he will be addressing the issue with his staff and contracted DJs (though he did admit, he can't promise, based on the content of the genre that something won't slip out on a subsequent hip hop night; this is OK.  Like I said, I'm not normally there then).Gus was willing to meet in the same spirit that he conducts his business in the community.  It's a great, neighborhood place (though I generally sit in the back since I think the front is too loud for me).  The beer list is one of the best in the neighborhood.  And I love the (relatively new to the menu) pheasant sausage as well as the plantain sundae.It hasn't been an easy experience, but I want honest businesses to thrive in our neighborhood.  Gus' attitude and openness in this situation reminds me, that despite this unfortunate misunderstanding), he and Inwood Local are good for Inwood.  I wish them success for many years to come.",16,8,3

But I must say I'm thankful for it because otherwise I doubt that I would've had the chance to get to know this place as well as I have.I really love the ambiance and the vibe of this place. I definitely get that great ""out and about and having a nice time"" feeling without the shoulder-brushing crowds or too-loud music you get at most bars in the city. In fact, I've often seen people sit here on a Thursday night just to read a book with a glass of wine. It's a really relaxed, laid-back bar with all kinds of people and an excellent wine and beer selection. I have to say I'm not a big fan of the food here; I've tried the lamb sausages, cajun cat fish sticks and pulled pork slider but all three were pretty underwhelming in flavor.

I love the ambiance; it's usually pretty chill (not ghetto) with dimmed lighting & usually a DJ. Sometimes there's a local artist, but not very often. IL just landscaped its back yard, so one can enjoy a smoke or beverage outside. The ""beer garden""/tent could be better, but it's more for larger parties. Growler specials all day on Tuesday, yet the bartenders still are unaware of the actual specials - I've been quoted different prices, but at most it's $20/fill, unsure of how much the actual growler is by itself.All in all, you CANNOT go wrong with this spot.",,,

We noticed they have an eclosed, possibly heated, outdoor area in the back, but it was still too chilly to enjoy. We sat at the bar, since all of their 5(ish) tables were taken, and ordered a bottle of moderately priced chianti. I got the lamb burger, which was surprisingly delicious. The right-out-of-the-package whole wheat pita added nothing, but I removed it and knife and forked the crap out of that lamb burger. Juicy, well seasoned and cooked just right. It was served with crispy and fresh lettuce, tomato onion and a huge side of tzatziki sauce. I make special note that it was huge, cause often I find restaurants provide a yummy sauce in a small dish, leaving you with that embarassing moment of having to ask for more. The kind folks at Inwood Local figured they'd give you more than enough to spare you the fat kid compex. Sauce was garlicky, chock full of cucumbers and perfectly creamy. The side of raisin and almond couscous was a bit bland up against the other elements on the plate.Left full...and possibly deaf. Overall, I think I may start craving that burger.

Emily was irate, unrelenting, and she caused a scene the entire time she was there. I just read her review. If her food was taking an inordinately long amount of time to arrive, she could have politely addressed the issue. Instead, she was determined to make the staff at Inwood Local miserable. Even Emily's fellow guests were trying to calm her down but she would have no part of it. As far as the manager joking about the matter with bar patrons? I did not see this. All I saw was a manager that was shell shocked, sober, and who was trying to do the right thing. I do not know the details regarding the incident but after what I saw and heard, I do not give credibility to any part of Emily D.'s review. As for my experience at Inwood Local?

When we mentioned that he had sat down at the table next to us to eat his meal while we were waiting, he said, ""I was hungry."" He then proceeded to make excuse after excuse. Was I angry by this time, absolutely. Did I raise my voice? You bet. I have never experienced such inappropriate response from the manager of an establishment. He then went out front and joked about us with the bar patrons. This place started out great. Is it now becoming an embarrassment for Inwood?I was able to have another discussion with the manager, who it turns out is also the owner.

I've been for dinner several times and brunch a handful more. Dinner definitely has the better food options and everything comes out well prepared, well seasoned and hot. Brunch has been hit or miss. My omeletts are almost always bland and I find I need to have a much heavier hand w/ salt then I like. Seriously guys - a pinch of salt and pepper when your scrambling the eggs goes a LONG way! Also - last time we went our eggs came out cold which is never fun. Still the food is innovative and dinner (especially the lamb sausage, lamb burger and bacon wrapped scallops) is always great. Beer list is outstanding with more than fair prices and I am especially partial to their list of brunch cocktails. Wheat Beer mimosa? Who knew? :) My other issue with this place is that the music inside can be way too loud. You want it loud enough that you can hear it over the din but not so loud that I'm shouting at the person across from me. It's definitely quieter outside in the back but the ambiance is so much nicer inside. I can tolerate it being louder in the evening but during brunch when there are only 8 people inside there's NO reason for me to be shouting across the small tables.

Besides my favorite beer ""Delirium"", they have quite a tasteful selection of beer, and have not large but nice list of wine (starting at around $30). My burger came with delicious yam fries(as long as I remember, there's an option of taro fries too), it maybe because of the Latin neighborhood. But basically their menu is I assume American Italian.I usually go to the backside of the restaurant for a bit more outdoor feeling and less loud music so I can talk comfortably with my friends. Yes, they got a bit too loud music in the front area... Please turn down the music a bit... other than that this is a perfect place to hung out with friends..!",,,

If anything just for their back area, which is totally separate from the bar itself, way quieter with big long tables you can really settle in on. There's a little outdoor area but it's only got like one table...? Maybe they'll expand once it warms up again? I mean, sometimes the music is clubby and kinda out of place, and it'd be nice to order a liquor drink but if you get there during a happy hour time it's worth it, I think. Favorite menu items: whatever that salad is it was the greatest salad ever, reliable chicken fingers, fantastic burger. Also a fun place to get yerself some of that fancy Belgian monk beer.

I went for Brunch on a Sunday afternoon and the place was entirely busy yet they only had one waiter. We waited quite a LOOONG time for just a menu and a simple ginger ale.. I thought the food would be forgiving... The Lamb Burger was pretty flavorful but the tzatziki sauce that accompanies it.. not so much.. Couscous was bland.. The Kobe burger I ordered was overcooked (I asked for medium raw).. and was overwhelmed with the taste of pure charcoal. I felt like I was eating a burger at a regular barbecue. I can tell that our waiter was pretty overwhelmed and did the best he could under circumstances SO I am hoping it was just a management issue... Overall, I think the place in general is completely overrated. I don't think I will be going back for sure.",5,,

I like a good beer and Inwood Local has a great selection, you just have to know them. You will not find hard liquor or your everyday beers. In other words no Henny or Corona at this place. Straight wine and craft beer. They also have a food menu. I did not try any of the food but it def looked good. The space in the front half of the establishment is a little small if you have a large party. Seating by the bar and seating by the wall with ample room to stand around in between. Could get tight again if you have a big party. The back is set up like a beer garden. Tarp up in the winter, I heard it comes down in the Summer. This particular night I drank Six Point brew Bengali Tiger. Really good beer. At $6 a pop you can't go wrong. Gf stuck with wine the whole night. She did the wristband till 12 or 1am open bar.  Don't know if this is a norm or if it was because we went for a bday party.

It can be a bit too kid friendly (noisy) for my personal taste, but that's really my only complaint. Omelettes, and burgers are excellent and the cheese biscuits are fantastic.

156,Thomas L.,"New York, NY",2,12,0,4.0,10/13/2011,"Brunch here is tons of fun in the outdoor patio area when there's good weather. Though they don't have a liquor license, the beer and wine cocktails are very tasty and well-done. The menu tends to be a bit busy as they specialize in small- to medium-sized dishes, but I've already been through most of it and it's all been good. The dinner menu has even more than the brunch menu, and all the choices are interesting and well-executed.The beer and wine selection is as good if not better than many similar bars further downtown, and it's priced similarly, though the convenience in location for Inwoodites and the friendly atmosphere makes up for that. The design of the place is quite well done, as there's a section of the bar where patrons get to sit on both sides. Good for mid-sized groups and for interacting with the bartender. Can't wait to get more outdoor seating in the large brick patio that right now only has wood chips and trees planted there, and I'm holding out hope that the giant white wall they painted can be used for projecting games or hosting movie nights. The bathroom is also clean and spacious. The servers are very friendly, and, for the most part, well-versed in the alcoholic offerings of the establishment. So far I've been pleased with any recommendations they've given. This has quickly become one of our go-to places to take people when they first come in from out-of-town (or even from south of 96th St, for a certain breed of New Yorkers). Great downtown atmosphere while maintaining a chill and fun Inwood feel.",1,,

I came here for brunch once (and mind you it wasn't busy at all) and I ordered a veggie omelet, and it was so poor quality, it reminded me of school lunch! Another time I ordered the veggie sliders, again, dry and bland! Just bad. If you were starving, I'd suggest the grilled cheese, nothing special, but not completely awful. I only come here once in a while cause it has a good space and an outdoor area. I'm not a very big beer drinker, but they have quite a selection. However, there are plenty of places in inwood that have just as good a selection, if not better (Indian Road Cafe, Bronx Ale House), and they actually have great food too! Their wine selection is pretty average. Staff seem okay, but also sometimes kind of like they dont really give a sh*t about their job, which is fine, don't get me wrong, but I shouldn't be able to tell that just by looking at them. It's such a shame too, since I'm a really good tipper too, working in the business myself. Aaand what is up with parents taking their children here??

184,Will M.,"Manhattan, NY",24,65,0,5.0,11/7/2011,"Soon after moving to Inwood I began to lament the lack of beer selections. Craft bottles are available but sometimes you just crave a freshly poured pint while sitting at a dimly lit bar. Luckily things have changed. Inwood Local (formerly the strangely named Ouva) has arrived. There's a lot to love about this place; a nice wide selection of drafts, a decently priced happy hour and some tasty food. Yes, some of the drafts can be a bit hard on the wallet if you're there during non-happy hour prices but that's understandable- they've got the beer bar market cornered in the neighborhood.The service is extremely friendly and efficient. The food is excellent. The menu can seem a little baffling when you first look at it, since there isn't exactly a breakdown of different options in the manner you'd usually expect.In truth that's because there isn't really a major difference in portion size. They have a lot of standard pub fare; burgers, buffalo wings, etc. Generally it's safe to order one item per person. The pizettes are simple and satisfying, the burger is excellent. The bacon-wrapped scallops are delicious, if a bit rich; I'd suggest ordering those along with something a little lighter to share between two people. The corn dog is fantastic.",1,,1

We were impressed with the atmosphere, the food and the drink. The wine list isn't huge, but has a nice mix of reds, whites and roses. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my date was pleased with the list of craft beers. Foodwise, he ordered the lamb burger, while I got the cumin meatballs served with a sliced baguette. Okay, I got the yam fries, too (I told you I was hungry!). We ate at the bar, which was spacious, although the chairs could have been a teensy bit more comfy. All was forgiven when the food arrived, though. I tried a bit of the lamb burger, and hot damn! That was some good stuff, served in a pita so as to let the lamb take center stage. My meatballs were tremendous. They were sweet and spicy, and the sauce was plentiful enough for serious bread dipping. And the yam fries? Salty enough for my liking. The bartenders were laid-back and sweet. One of them was using her iPod playlist for the bar music, which was a nice combo of pop, hip hop and R & B spanning about a 30 year period. Once I tasted those yam fries and heard Alicia Myers' ""I Wanna Thank You,"" Inwood Local had me hooked as a patron for many visits to come.",1,,

188,Philip C.,"Manhattan, NY",193,1,0,4.0,9/10/2012,"Thank god this place changed its name from Ouva to Inwood Local.  When 75% of the letters in your name are vowels, you have a problem.  I used to try to tell my friends to meet me here.  They either spelled the name wrong in a Google search or pronounced the name in their own unique fashion.  Nonetheless, the name is changed and Ouva can be forgotten.As an establishment in Inwood, it is very good.   The space in the back can be very social for a big group of friends.   The space in the front can also be good, however, the music can be too loud at times.   For a place like this, it doesn't need to be like Dyckman or Hashi and result in permanent ear damage.I am a beer man and the beer selection is superb.  Though, a frequent and fresh rotation of taps would greatly improve the feel.   As for food, it's either hit or miss.   Some selections are great, while others are infantile.   I have yet to determine the consistency.  In sum, if you live uptown and like beer, stop by.",,,
189,Susana C.,"Manhattan, NY",60,19,0,5.0,1/27/2013,"Every time I step into this place it feels like I'm right at home and today was no exception!  The staff is courteous, friendly and incredibly accommodating.  They have a great beer selection, the music is eclectic and fun but best of all is the weekend brunch!  The french toast and fried chicken salad are two of my all-time faves!  One example of how stellar the IL team is how they managed to accommodate my 16 person/ no reservations brunch party just an hour before we walked in!  I wasn't even aware that they took reservations but called only an hour in advance to let them know we were coming and to my delight they put aside two huge tables for us! I was totally expecting to wait but they were nice enough to help us out.  Our waitress was polite, prompt and--as always-- incredibly helpful!  This place is an awesome spot for everything from dinner dates and family brunches to grabbing a couple of beers with friends or casual business meetings. No doubt one of my favorites in the neighborhood!  Keep up the great work guys!",2,,

192,kelly m.,"Bronx, NY",28,138,44,4.0,7/26/2012,i really like this place.  the food is sooooo good for lunch and the drinks are great. i like their selection of beer.  it can be a little over priced but it's worth going at least once.  i hear their wings are really good too.  i like the back patio they have which is very casual and homey.  it is a bit of a narrow space but it's a nice environment overall.,1,,
193,Gaby F.,"New York, NY",1,3,0,3.0,5/24/2012,"I'm a regular here, and would have given them 4 stars until I saw the bartender make sangria. Three-quarters cranberry juice and a splash of wine. SMH.",1,1,
194,Janet K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,9/3/2013,"excellent menu, good food, one of the best values for decent food in inwood, great beer, ok wine, HIT AND MISS SERVICEsome of the staff members are too busy being cool to really help customers, meanwhile some of the staff (like the Sunday brunch staff) is excellent, top of their gamemanagement is clearly not keeping an eye on the staff and doesn't reward good vs poor performance would be super awesome if the wait staff would just check to make sure customers that are dining have silverware, water, basics... just that one check back after the food is placed on the table that most restaurants offer would be so nice... but some of the staff is just busy jamming out to tunes behind the counter or talking to their fav customer or whatevs, being so chill they just can't be bothered",,,
195,Kate F.,"New York, NY",62,9,0,4.0,8/30/2012,"I really like this place. The beer selection is great and the bartenders (and wait staff) seem to really know their stuff. Nice, laid back atmosphere.",,,
196,Andrew G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,0,5.0,2/19/2012,"Inwood Local (formerly Ouva) is a real find in Inwood--it has the menu and quaint feel of something you'd expect to find further downtown, and the friendly service and laid back atmosphere more common this far uptown. The menu is surprisingly good and inventive, and everything I've had has been excellent. Great beer selection, although my one complaint is that the tap selection is limited and I have been twice when the tap wasn't working at all. This is made up for by the extensive selection of craft bottle brews (and more than decent wine selection as well). This is where I take my out of town friends (or south of central park friends) to impress.",,,
197,K S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,0,5.0,9/23/2011,"Stopped by for Craft Beer Week and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I'm so excited to see a place like this up here. Prices aren't really that different from a similar place in a 'cooler' neighborhood, but these guys are local. Looking forward to making this a regular spot.",,,
