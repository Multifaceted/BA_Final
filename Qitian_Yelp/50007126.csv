0,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",74,346,2615,4.0,11/1/2018,"Glad to have this place near work that offers rather healthy lunch options if you can resist the temptation of all the pastries that stare at you when you first walk in. There are stations for many sandwiches options, a salad bar as well as a soup station. The wild ginger was okay. Perhaps I won't ask to have them chopped next time as all the ingredients lost the texture. The smoke salmon sandwich was very good and pretty filling. There are seatings in the back as well as upstairs. Although a bit pricey, i plan to visit often with the 10% employee discount.",,,
1,May C.,"Cupertino, CA",75,58,0,5.0,8/14/2018,"LOVE IT.  FANTASTIC.  Great variety of health-conscious food. Visually appealing. Plenty of tables. Courteous and efficient staff with lots of smiles. Opens super early and stays open until super late, making it super convenient for early rush breakfast to go or late night healthy munchies.The sandwiches are beautifully made and wrapped for to-go efficiency. The salad bar choices are all fresh and colorful, as are the pasta choices.Everything is yummy and fresh.As for those yelp reviewers complaining about the price...have they noticed the location and thus the probable cost of overhead?The prices are justified.  A buck or two more than at a cheaper rent location, with all the freshness, cleanliness, convenience, and vast choices.",1,,
2,Larry L.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,12,0,1.0,6/23/2018,"I walked in there around 9:30 PM, picked up a can of Pellegrino soda. Waited there for about 3 min while this Indian looking girl came to ring me up. She said $4.20, with the shock at the price of the can of soda, my jaws dropped. And I said to her, pardon me, but did you say $4.20? She in a rude and condescending way said to me ""Yea! And?"" I looked at her and said no thank you and that I would not pay that kind of price for a can of soda. Bottom line is. This place is way over priced. I have never ever seen anybody attempt to sell a can of soda at that price inside of a restaurant/store ever. This is not even in the airport and is more expensive than the airport. Just cant believe they sell sodas you buy for $1 for 3 times the amount! Smh!I Also didnt appreciate the attitude I was served by the lady behind the counter. Don't go here unless you want to spend $20 for a meal that should only cost you $10 to $12 tops! Place probably won't be there in a year with prices and service like theirs.",2,,2
3,Eddie K.,"Washington, DC",24,110,191,4.0,2/21/2018,"You want something fast and tasty in the morning? Then definitely stop by this place. I stayed at the hotel next door and just wanted something tasty and inexpensive for breakfast. I don't believe what I ordered was advertised on the menu, but they had no problems making it for me right there on the spot. I had a bacon, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich and I took back to my room where I devoured it. Warm and tasty so there wasn't much room for complaints. I also noticed that the restaurant itself looked very clean and appeared to have plenty of seating. I'd go back the next time that I'm in town.",1,,
4,Angela S.,"Stony Brook, NY",202,1,0,3.0,10/28/2018,"It's ok. I was expecting more though of the food. I always care about Customer Service and the cashier couldn't even say ""good morning"" back. When I finished I went back to her to kindly ask for a bag whenever she could and she just put it on the counter instead of giving it to me. I felt like never going back. The place is beautiful though.",,,
5,Austin O.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",258,145,178,3.0,8/2/2017,"3.5, rounded down. Stopped in to grab a late dinner while at work (i.e. the meal wasn't coming out of my pocket). The Grand Central location is open till 11pm, but they start breaking things down earlier, so by 10:30pm their only options are whatever sandwiches are already prepared in the display cabinet. The salad station was already broken down. I had a chicken sandwich from the ""Favorites"" menu that was pretty good, albeit a bit pricey ($12.95), although I'm always a bit put off by toasted sandwiches with avocado in them (not a big warm avocado fan). I also had a green juice mix, pre-made in house with ginger, I think carrot, and a couple other items, for $7.95.The main reason for the lower review is the lack of posted prices, which is a pet peeve of mine. The sandwich board did contain prices, but I couldn't see posted prices for drinks or snacks anywhere. Next to the register was a plastic bag of 4 or 6 Amos-sized chocolate chip cookies. I examined the label and couldn't find a price anywhere; the cashier confirmed they were over $4. This holds true on their website - they list their sandwiches with no prices. If they had locations around the country I could understand that, but there are only two locations, both in NYC. Maybe their target customer is so wealthy that they wouldn't think twice about spending more than $4 on a couple cookies, but Grab and Go-style restaurants are not fine art galleries - there shouldn't be a ""Price Upon Request"" situation for any item available for sale.",1,,
6,Sammy G.,"Manhattan, NY",26,132,64,2.0,6/8/2018,"A fair warning to people passing by during lunch hour... even though the food in the display fridge may look appetizing, do NOT fall into this trap. Why? Well...let me tell you why.I stopped by a couple days ago to get a quick bite during lunch hour. I've walked by this sandwich place numerous times and decided to give it a try. I looked at the beautifully made sandwiches in the display fridge and was excited to taste them. Without thinking much, I ordered a chicken salad sandwich a cup of pre-made peach ice tea. When I arrived at the counter, my total came to a whooping $18! EIGHTEEN DOLLARS FOR A SANDWICH AND (most likely low quality) ICE PEACH TEA? What a rip off!Since it was lunch hour, it was too embarrassing and humiliating for me to say NO to the already packed sandwich. I paid for my overpriced lunch unwillingly and prayed the sandwich would be exceptional. Unfortunately, it was not. It wasn't bad but it was just not $15 worth. A complete rip off in my opinion. I don't think I'll be returning here ever again.",2,,
7,Ryan B.,"Nashville, TN",120,429,18,3.0,6/22/2018,"My party of 4 came here for breakfast when we were staying nearby. We had no idea about the ordering process as there wasn't a clearly obvious system other than to watch the natives.The food was just fine, but the prices were too high for what we got.",,,
8,David F.,"New York, NY",19,1,0,1.0,6/1/2018,I ordered a salad with chicken but it came without chicken ! I would appreciate a partial refund on that . Thanks,1,,
9,Brian S.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",74,271,110,3.0,10/7/2017,"The food isn't necessarily bad, although you're better off looking elsewhere if you want a bargain. The base price for a pasta dish is $9 and change and then increasing prices for meats, cheeses and veggies. For example, a pesto dish with a small amount of grilled chicken and fresh mozzarella was $20. It would be one thing if you're getting a heaping serving of pasta and chicken. Or if you're getting a restaurant quality dish. Neither happens to be the case. This would be a great option if it was half the price or at most $12. Another example, I grabbed a ""fresh"" lemonade to go. It did not have a price but I assumed it was no more than a couple of bucks. It was $5!!! Five dollars for shitty lemonade. Be careful of items without prices; more often than not they're going to be on the expensive side rather than reasonably priced. They're banking on tourists on 42nd street overpaying for their food.",3,,
10,Anna Y.,"Queens, Queens, NY",285,24,59,2.0,1/7/2018,"I honestly wish I could like this place more because it's right across the street from my work place, but sadly it wasn't up to par. I got the classic salmon sandwich that they have, by the way it's $15 for that individual sandwich. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it weren't for the fact that the sandwich was super salty. I wasn't sure if it was just me, but my friend who also went the day after said it was really salty. I had trouble finishing the sandwich. Additionally I waited a very long time for the sandwich, given they did tell me there would be a wait because they make it fresh, but it seemed way longer than the time they told me it would take. (Could be because I was hungry, so just a heads up don't get one of those freshly made sandwiches if you're hungry)Pros: the place looked clean, but very much a casual dining place. They had a variety of options. Maybe I'll try something else from there next time just to give the benefit, but this visit wasn't very satisfactory.",,,

12,Michael G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/13/2018,"Love this place. Great service, tasty food and quick.Sure, it's not cheap. But it's located in NYC on 42nd and 3rd. It's not going to be priced the same as an outer borough bodega.Spoke with the owners on different visits. Very nice people. Learned it used to be a PAX but now it's family owned.Happy to support non-chain, family owned restaurants in mid-town. They are few and far between, but usually offer the best service and quality food.I've had the salads, the sandwiches and the desserts. All top-notch.",,,
13,Laura W.,"Manhattan, NY",148,243,9,4.0,12/16/2017,"Very good sandwiches, but the really great thing is their gluten free bread. They take great pride in having found the best gluten free baguettes... and they should. (You can also get the sandwich fixings as a salad, if you're staying grain free). The tuna niçoise is tres bon apetite!",1,,
14,Eileen F.,"Manhattan, NY",23,3,2,1.0,4/27/2017,Went to their new store on fourth Avenue and 13th St. signs all over any sandwich five dollars or a bowl with one protein five dollars I made it very easy I went in and ordered a tuna fish sandwich at 5:40 PM The girl told me $10.8oI said the sign says five dollarsShe say no that's only till 3 o'clockI said the sign does not say that...so the older manager comes over and instead of just saying no problemHe says give her back her moneysnatched up the sandwich & walked away...Smhthis place will not last six months,4,,
15,Ada R.,"Washington, DC",0,16,3,5.0,6/23/2018,"I was attending a conference and staying next door at Westin. Enjoyed stopping by this place for a quick breakfast bite the days I was in NYC. It's clean, has seating and food was good. Yes, a little pricey but that's what's expected of NYC. I'm sure I would have paid double at my hotel for same meal.",,,
16,Shanjida B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",7,51,36,3.0,6/13/2017,"Soooo, basically at this place you make your own pasta! You get to choose what kind of pasta, the shape of the pasta and such. It was an alright experience, I honestly didn't like it much. Moreover the portion is a bit too small and it's pricey; I paid about $15-$17 for this bowl. The shrimps were quite big and juicy, plus the ingredients were fresh. But I wouldn't recommend coming here again.",,,
17,Rina O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,0,5.0,7/15/2018,"This amazing sanwich place is located near the Westgate hotel. The food is decently priced for what you receive - high quality and relatively fresh. The shelves are lined with the fruit and vegetables they use in their products, which surprisingly gives it a farmer's market feeling. While in New York, my friend wanted to try the famous New York Cheesecake, so he bought a slice here. While it was very good, we are unable to comment on how their cheesecake compares to other stores in the area.I ordered an immaculate ""Turkey stack"" sandwich with turkey, cheese, avocado, veggies and ranch dressing. It was very high qualtiy and tasted fresh. Would highly recommend to eat here.",,,
18,Jennifer S.,"Phoenix, AZ",998,4190,50,4.0,10/2/2017,"I stopped in for a takeout dinner last week after my yoga class.  The staff was so friendly and even offered to make me a pasta from scratch even though they had already shut down the station for the evening.  I took him up on the offer and ordered the penne vodka and enjoyed it with a peaches & cream smoothie - odd combination, but surprisingly satisfying.  Reasonable prices, great selection, quality ingredients and all around great experience.",1,1,1

20,Ken H.,"Matthews, NC",35,87,29,4.0,9/29/2017,"This place was already high in my book as it was literally located right next to our hotel. But the staff were super friendly and helpful, the food was as good as advertised and filling as well. It was not the most authentic NY place but it was a good quick breakfast. Definitely recommend for a quick breakfast with not a whole lot of decision-making.",,,
21,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,2.0,12/21/2016,"Typical office lunch spot, slightly dressed up and simultaneously trying to market to tourists staying at nearby hotels.There are your typical salad and sandwich stations. The decor is modern but it doesn't justify the silly prices. Many of the basic pastries (croissants, muffins, cake slices) are $6-7 each, which is a little ludicrous.I ordered a latte and was automatically given (and charged for) a large size - $6, yikes. Who orders a large latte when it's the same amount of espresso as a smaller size, just more milk?! The latte was not very good: watery and like any ""latte"" you'd get from a local deli.They have a well-heated, relatively quiet upstairs space with plenty of seating, and it doesn't seem to get too crowded during the lunch rush. There's also nonstop Christmas music playing in the background this time of year, if you're into that. (I am.)",8,7,6
22,Julien H.,"Queens, NY",0,39,3,4.0,7/18/2017,"An apparently new spot, valiantly attempting to inject some novelty in sandwich-making with a rather odd process. Points for trying something new (to me at least). Only went once and took out a solid sandwich. Will amend this review when I've checked it out once more, which I certainly plan to do.Note that it's a cashless joint, which may benefit the establishment but definitely not customers.",2,,
23,BihChuan W.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,18,6,5.0,4/8/2018,Trendy shop has plenty of room upstairs for additional seating.  The breakfast menu is made on the spot.  Price is standard for Manhattan.,,,

25,Rianna M.,"Morris Plains, NJ",337,20,2,3.0,7/25/2018,"overpriced - the sandwiches only a little bit so;  but all the other items they sell (yogurt smoothies pastries) are way marked up. especially considering that the sandwiches are pre-made and pre-packaged. also if you're vegetarian there's only one sandwich which is average, not something i'd spend close to $10 on ever again though.",,,

27,Emily D.,"New York, NY",40,189,340,3.0,5/16/2017,"The set up is a little different you have salads on side and soup/ sandwiches on the other side, so make sure you are aware which side you are on. The food is okay they certainly have a lot of different options which I appreciate. The wraps and sandwiches are lined up in a glass counter so you have actually see what you are ordering. However it's about $11 for one wrap. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and they don't even ask if you'd like it warmed up. (Some of their sandwiches come hot but im not sure if they would press other items). The wrap (which came in a bright red coloring) was just okay. I deff would not pay $11 for it. I might try other sandwiches but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's mediocre food, and they're are a bunch of other places with better food for cheaper.",2,,
28,Mia P.,"Toronto, Canada",8,135,65,5.0,1/14/2017,"Absolutely our favourite place in NY thus far to have breakfast on the go! It's clean, organized and trendy. They have a ton of options which is fantastic and the food is super tasty! Staff is fast and helpful and nice. We got the gluten free breakfast bowls one day which were incredible!! The next got breakfast egg sandwiches that were also so great! The most real tasting food we've had in a while, super fresh and prepared on the spot! Smoothies were amazing and coffee was good! They were fast and efficient and even the takeout was setup super nicely with everything we needed packed up and ready to go. It is more expensive so don't expect a cheap breakfast but so worth it! We  got two breakfast bowls, smoothie and coffee for $40.",,,
29,Allen T.,"Queens, NY",290,185,395,3.0,7/7/2017,"Another average, adequately priced place to eat in midtown. The sandwiches aren't anything great, but aren't anything I would be dying for.",,,

32,Nicole R.,"San Diego, CA",460,46,51,2.0,9/6/2016,"At first, the chorizo burrito I got tasted pretty good. The second half of the burrito was chalked full of what looked like green bells peppers...instead it was full of extremely hot Serrano chili peppers. It was the spiciest thing I have ever tasted. I'm not afraid of spicy food and I can eat bags of hot Cheetos and frequently add hot sauce or red chili flakes to my meals...but this burrito made my eyes water so much it looked like I was hysterically crying. I would have gone up to the staff to ask them to remake it but I was crying from the spiciness and had to run home. The burrito was not bad quality at all but I was physically ill from the large amount of Serrano chili peppers. All I ask is that they limit the chili peppers or warn customers that it is extremely spicy. Other than that, the inside of the restaurant is well decorated and cute with ample seating upstairs.",4,3,

34,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",5,7,3,3.0,4/26/2017,"This is actually a review of their new Union Square location which opened today but there is no Yelp page for it yet so I'll leave it here & it'll be in two parts, first for the experience, second for the food. I would have given 3.5 start but there's no half stars so 3 it is (for now).Experience: greeters at the door handing out menus is good, prep people who also took my order (I think) were also friendly and really tried hard to be helpful, but it was very disorganized which I am attributing to it  being the first day so it's somewhat understandable. That's actually why this review is a 3 star (again for now). My order took about 30 mins, and my co-workers both got their orders and finished eating before I got my order. Cashiers were super friendly and apologetic as they know how long I had been standing there and also kept asking the prep station for my order for me. If not for the 30 min wait, I'd say experience would be a solid 5 stars.Food: I got the Chel-Sea which is steak, shrimp, a grilled(?) tomato and chimichurri sauce. Steak was done medium, sliced thin but not paper thin so it was meaty without being too chewy. The shrimp was awesome, you don't get the mini shrimps but three big plump ones and it was pretty much perfect. The tomato was good and the chimichurri sauce tied it all together nicely, The bread tasted fresh and chewy but needed to be put on the grill to get that crustiness for texture.I will definitely be going back most likely tomorrow to try their breakfast burritos as that was what originally drew us there!",1,,

It looked very fancy and nice on the outside. We decided to stop there before we left the area for a quick bite. The assorted cupcakes looked phenomenal. My friend's panini did too. The vegetarian sandwich I had though didn't quite do it for me (a little too dry). It's a pretty cute location though. A couple of place to sit.

I ordered 2 bacon egg and cheese on everything bagels with the cook. I paid, it came out within 6 or 7 minutes of my ordering. Bagels were pretty stale and too large relative to how skimpy the toppings were, so it dried your mouth out and just tasted like nothing... Except for an aftertaste of fish. Like honestly it was nasty. I only took a bite of mine and my boyfriend couldn't finish his. We couldn't stomach it. My guess is that they store their lox in the same container or in close proximity to their bacon and other meats so everything gets a fishy aftertaste. Don't recommend, probably won't return only because the food was so unappetizing. 2 stars for the friendly and helpful staff. Steer clear of their bacon.",,,

I've gotten the turkey chili which is so good and a #2 sandwhich which was my favorite. I am so displeased to find that they changed the #2 to a #10 AND raised the price of the sandwhich $3! The sandwhich used to be chicken w/ avocado, pico de gallo and a chipotle sauce. They substituted the avocado for poblano peppers, had less chicken and the sandwhich went from $8.95 to $11.95 plus tax! That is absolutely ridiculous! The food is good but not worth an increase.

Updated review","This place is offensively bad. I know tourists love it for some reason (is it in a guidebook or something??) but it's everything I HATE - a mediocre corporate deli that thinks it can overcharge rich, dumb NYers. The $10+ sandwiches are generic at best, and the bored underpaid staff won't even bother to ask if you'd like them warmed up. The scariest thing is the $4 room-temperature iced tea that's been sitting around for days. (Don't you think there should be ICE in an iced tea?!) I can't wait until this place inevitably gets shut down, it's prime 42nd street real estate for something better. For now, do yourself a big favor and go across the street to Pret for some fresh, reasonably priced options.",,,

Being from Philadelphia, the price tag was a bit shocking (nearly $18.00), but it was still cheaper than most of the restaurant menus I looked at on my walk. The quality of the food was pretty good for it being pre-made, and the soup was delicious. My two girlfriends got the ""make your own pasta"". The portion was small and price tag just as steep. This place is great if you're on the run but expect to pay around $15 - $20 for a meal and drink. They do have a soup/sandwich option that I noticed after the fact for around 10 bucks.

I got a chicken pesto sandwich on Italian bread that was fairly tasty, although a little skimpy on the fillings, and for $9 it's definitely not any cheaper than train station fare.

121,Jennifer S.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",0,6,0,2.0,4/29/2016,"The ""Crew"" are very friendly, hardworking, and helpful. The manager is officious, rude, and disorganized. The esthetics are very nice, lovely graphic signs for menu items. However, for a market located central to working commuters, the organization is dismal. A simple rope and stanchion would have delineated the order line from the pay line and rid any confusion. As mentioned, there were attractive wooden hanging signs for ordering and paying, which were not obvious unless you look up, and there was no demarcation between the areas. Another confused customer asked me where to order. A crew member very promptly took my payment, and noticed me waiting, and asked me if I had told the manager (in the un-obvious ordering area) my order. By then, there was an influx of tourists, which the manager was handling in a manic frenzy. Seeing this, to try and expedite my order, she told him my order, and he nastily said to her, ""You don't take orders, honey"". When I finally got his attention, I ordered the Breakfast Bowl, no eggs (Item 5A). This item is described as quinoa, a mix of vegetables, and two eggs. As I watched, he proceeded to make me item 5B, which has black beans, avocado, tomatoes, spinach, and goat cheese. So not only did he sneer at his crew for taking an order, he then got the order wrong. I pass this place every morning and could easily have made it a daily habit, but they will never get my business again. consider this place SandWONTerie.",2,,

Updated review",Disgustingly over priced cardboard flavored food.  I paid $11 for a small yogurt and small latte.  There's other shops in the area with a similar selection at much better prices.,,,
123,Beth G.,"Chincoteague Island, VA",0,4,0,4.0,12/12/2016,We had breakfast here twice and lunch once during our 3 day trip to NYC.  Coffee and breakfast sandwiches were terrific but my favorite was the smoked salmon sandwich I had for lunch.  Salmon was fresh and had all the usually accompaniments on pumpernickel.  Loved it!,,,
124,Dalia Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,0,5.0,11/8/2016,"Great place! Sandwiches were delicious. Very clean, very nice. Salads and soups great too. Very nice staff and so many options. Beat place for a quick breakfast or lunch.",,,
125,Giulia G.,"Ashtabula, OH",0,2,0,5.0,5/5/2016,"I was celebrating my friends 21st birthday in the city and we stayed at the Westin right next door. I never thought I would take the time to write a yelp review but this place was just that good. The atmosphere was very inviting and the cleanliness was top notch. I didn't expect this place to have much room but I was pleasantly surprised to see there was a second level filled with seating. After a night out with the girls we splurged on a huge breakfast (omelettes, pancakes, smoothies etc). Everything was delicious and the quality of the food was so worth the price. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area and I'll definitely come back here especially because the owner Gus was so helpful.",1,,
126,Jordan M.,"Freehold, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,5/5/2016,"There are no healthy breakfast spots around here so I was pumped when I found this place. Their quinoa bowls with potatoes, veggies, and over easy eggs are super tasty and filling without making me feel guilty about starting the day with a cheat meal.",1,,
127,Ivette H.,"Newburgh, NY",0,3,0,5.0,6/23/2016,"This is my go to place for catering. My colleagues and I absolutely love the freshness of their food, the variety available and of course their great customer service. I've worked in the past with Candi  but on my recent order in mid May I had the pleasure of working with Dino. He is as accommodating and helpful as Candi and the order was perfect. You cannot go wrong with catering your next office lunch from here!!",,,

130,Kiki L.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,7,0,5.0,2/24/2016,"I came here on a visit to NYC, i normally don't write reviews, but, i had such a positive experience i had to share. I came in and the first things you notice was how clean the place is, which is a huge plus. I ordered a sandwich, it was very good, but the best part of any sandwich is the bread, and this place definitely got that part down pat. You can taste the freshness, the texture was spot on, and the best part?! it was a whole grain bread. Ive tasted some whole grain bread, that made cardboard taste good. Anyway the place was clean everything was delicious, but i would come in just to buy the bread!",,,

132,B H.,"Arlington, VA",1,143,0,5.0,11/7/2015,"This place is awesome. And cheap. Best deli-like place I know of in the city. Food is wicked good: bagels, omelets, salads, desserts. All build your own! Omelets are best hangover cure.",,,
133,Cas L.,"Murrieta, CA",0,2,0,5.0,11/27/2015,My wife hates sandwiches and she would go back anytime. It is a winner! Lentil spilt pea was excellent and sandwich with prosciutto was superb. A bit pricey but I my family enjoyed.,,,
