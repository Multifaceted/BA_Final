0,Andrew S.,"Astoria, NY",5,35,12,5.0,11/6/2018,"Truth is, I hate to yelp about this bar. I really don't want to tell you how much of a hidden gem this place really is. An unassuming, downstairs dive where the French fries are tops. You know when you get the perfect fry in the bunch? Well this basket of fried freedom potatoes comes fresh piping out of the fryer and it's like they baptized each one. Look, it's kind of a dive but it's the kinda dive that you met your significant other at. The ""come as you are"" attitude mixed with the classically forgotten one hit wonder jukebox keeps the jerks quiet (or at least to themselves) and the party rolling. Their beer is cold, drinks are strong and their employees are aware. Don't overlook McKenna's for a down home NYC experience. All welcome just don't be a jerk.",,,

They apparently go all out for Halloween too, cuz that place could be a haunted house with all their decorations this October.They got the juke box and a lil pinball machine in the back too.

2,Peloncito D.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",55,13,92,4.0,9/24/2018,"Average Irish Pub with a huge dining area that was basically dark at 10pm. Not that much of a problem. Bartenders were very attentive and quick and they put up with my not so soberness! Mckenna's seems to go from 0-60 in like 30 minutes here. I entered with a friend and was shocked to get carded while donning a gnarly grey and black beard but that's the policy. In a matter of 30 minutes the place was packed! Something about a pub that has trap music on its jukebox makes me wonder about its patrons. (In a good way) Just the basics here. No flashy craft beers, Very inexpensive menu! $6 hamburger?  I don't think anything was over $20. Hand written receipts only! Dont't expect to turn that in for expenses! I will definitely return!",2,2,3

We had no particular place in mind that day, and we stumbled upon McKenna's Pub.We walked in to a busy bar. The place was packed, but we were fortunately able to find seating toward the back of the place. It was a booth, too, so all of us were able to sit together.One of their signature poker chips got us drink specials, which If I remember correctly was a 2-for-1 special. In spite of the bar being busy, the bartenders were on it. We did not wait long to get our drinks, and they had a good amount of booze. The place had alright air conditioning, and the place was kept tidy. This included the restrooms, which for a bar is impressive.The bartenders, security, and other staff were all friendly and cordial.",13,11,17

Looking around I notice that our drinks are in 10 ounce drinks and everyone else's drinks are in 16 ounce glasses.

But I'm a pretty low-key person, and I would much rather go to a small dive bar than a night club. McKenna's is the perfect little Irish pub (off of 14th and 8th) with a 12-2am happy hour - don't you dare say you aren't down for 2-for-1 drinks!

7,Zhen C.,"Miami, FL",566,127,86,4.0,7/26/2018,"TLDR - Couldn't ask for more :) McKenna's is what you want in a neighborhood dive. It's not expensive, the menu has exactly what you'd expect (i.e. sandwiches, salads, burgers, and appetizers you can get from the supermarket frozen section), and the bartenders were nice. I see a lot of people talking about the bad service in the other reviews, and I definitely didn't have the same experience. Yes, you will have to look past the mediocre air conditioning, the dark back of the restaurant, and a slight stale smell in the atmosphere. But that's what a bar like this is supposed to be! I'm not here for no 5 star treatment. I'm here to talk loudly with my friends, chow on a damn good meatball sub that I won't be ashamed of if some sauce spills on my shirt, and pound down a couple pints to wash it all down, all while everyone else is doing the same. Protip - really recommending that meatball sub, btw",,,

But hey, who can pass up a 2-4-1 drink special that starts when the bar opens? Although there were only three 5-8 people in the pub during my visit, I can imagine that this place has a more relaxed vibe than other places in the area. Plus the pub's jukebox was rocking all of the top hits from the late 90's and early 00's - one of my favorite ""eras"" of music. The food is pretty typical for pub-style food. You will not get gourmet-style burgers here, but they will satisfy your hunger. The burgers are HUGE for the price tag of seven bucks. My burger and salad satisfied my appetite, especially after running 13 miles. The bartender on staff seemed really cool and down to earth. Hopefully, other folks on the staff have a similar disposition.",1,1,

Updated review","I wrote a review on Allison the bartender at McKenna's pub and she lost her mind! It's not my fault she was drunk behind the bar drinking the leftovers from MY martini shaker. Ali exhibited horrible customer service after I tipped her very well giving me 1,000 napkins to clean a spilled drink on the bar, that's her job! I was very harsh in my initial review she had removed but the facts are the facts don't size up the customers and we won't have to write these reviews it's that simple, Oh and the food was nasty.",1,,

We sat at the corner of the bar so couldnt really see the tvs but bartenders were attentive. The bar has booths which seem like would be cool if you are with a group and want to get away.We only stopped for a quick shot on the way to standard hotel. I would definitely suggest to stop in if you want a quick shot or drink but not a place I would suggest for a night out.,2,2,1

Updated review","First time here, SERVICE SUCKS. NO AC & non attentive ! Food is ok, prices okay. But there's no refills. Bartender is horribly rude, she gave me a horrible attitude and all I did was place my order. I didnt ask annoying questions about the menu or for any modifications. Then when I found out there was no refills I ask for water and the guy bar back I'm guessing his position is , completely ignored me. I waited for a while and asked again. I understand if he was busy but he wasn't doing anything. This place isn't worth it, don't bother.",2,2,

Updated review","Omg! It was like I used to live here for a good 4 years of my life. I think McKenna's broke me into loving the dive bar scene. I can't tell you one bad thing that has happened to me here. The staff is amazing and definitely know how to help you unload if you are in here after work. Of course, the crowd is of all types....this can be a plus or a minus depending on who YOU are. Happy hours galore and plenty of people to talk to. The barkeeps are chill and non-judgemental and heavy handed on the pours. The food is delicious and can be had to go. What more can you ask for???Location is right, the bathrooms are clean and this place is a guaranteed good time. I've met attorneys, designers, restaurant owners, models and all types here.

20,Robin T.,"New York, NY",287,306,640,5.0,11/12/2016,"I am so glad I stumbled across this place yesterday. Was in the area looking for a good happy hour spot and their 2for1 happy hour that goes until 8pm cannot be beat! I got there and around 5 and it was already a little crowded, but after about 10mins I was able to grab a seat at the bar. I ordered a whiskey sour which was made pretty strong, and I ended up babysitting it for a hour (don't judge me). They give you a different colored token based on the price of the drink you ordered, and you can redeem it for a free drink. You have to redeem it before the happy hour ends, but I overheard the bartender tell someone that you can come back and use it another day so that's definitely a plus. When I first got there, they were playing a lot of pop music, but as the night went on a new group took over the jukebox and hip hop and rap started blaring through the speakers. Not sure if it's a jukebox you pay for or what, but I saw ppl hovering in that area. Drinks are reasonable, $10 for whiskey sour. The back has a lot of space where you can come with a group of friends. Will definitely be visiting this spot again.",3,,

In a way, it's grown on me, but it's not my first preference.The drinks definitely make up for whatever hangups i had and the Mexican taco truck right across the street is always good for some quick food. That said, the food here is still up to par and no frills, just how i like it. Prices are very good: I paid $20 for two Jameson/Ginger Ales. You can buyback in the form of drink chips, which you can always claim.The bartenders are friendly.

That didn't feel like a value to me, but hey. The place was PACKED! The food must be good. According to my friend who'd had a burger and some other folks I'd spoken to, yes, the food's good. I just had a drink. It wasn't good. Judging from the crowd, maybe my drink was a fluke cos if all the drinks were as bad as the one I had (some blue drink...a blue iced tea or something)...

Updated review","These are the reasons I give McKenna's 3 stars:1. The bartenders are pretty friendly. I can't recall ever receiving unsatisfactory service from a bartender.2. The prices are fair, especially for this part of Manhattan. Additionally, they run specials and also do buybacks in the form of drink chips.3. Their food is better than I normally expect for a $7-10 meal in Manhattan. 4. Their alcohol selection is expansive. They have a large variety of options as far as this goes.My complaints:1. Their security is not, and never has been, even remotely polite. There is a difference between acting like a bouncer and acting rude. Quite frankly, their security tends to fall into the latter category. Not every experience of mine has been negative, but it's the norm. For example, this bar was steady, but not chaotic, last night. Not only am I an easily identifiable person due to having naturally bright red hair, my seat at the bar was positioned quite near to where the bouncer was stationed. In other words, I was within the bouncer's direct line of sight, and seated closer to him than most other customers. When I stepped outside with a fellow bar patron while the person took cigarette breaks, the bouncer continuously asked for my ID upon reentry, but did not ask the person I was with. For reasons unbeknownst to me, I felt singled out because of this, and I find it extremely hard to believe that the bouncer did not remember me, but remembered the person I was sitting next to and having a conversation with (who told me they did not know the bouncer and that they also were not a regular customer). To be clear, I never mind being asked for my ID, even repeatedly. However, I take issue with the context in which it occurred.2. Getting a drink during ""last call"" is pointless unless you want to consume the drink within 5 minutes of ""last call"" - not within 5 minutes of receiving the drink, but within 5 minutes of the announcement. After that, you will be told by security to hurry up and get out. I think doing ""last call"" 15 minutes before expecting people to vacate would be much fairer.3. The jukebox does not work in a way that guarantees your music will play, and I'm not referring to when someone pays extra to have their music played first. Throughout the night, songs kept getting interrupted and ended early by other songs starting to play. When people pay to program music into a jukebox, they should expect to at least be able to listen to the entire song.",2,1,1

Updated review","Usually when I come here I'm already drunk. Today I'm visiting completely sober, and I've noticed significant differences. The Jameson & ginger ale I ordered tastes like shit. I actually asked the bartender for a shot of ginger ale just to make sure their soda gun was working properly. It's definitely the Jameson and I'm actually disappointed because that's my cocktail of choice, and I can't even enjoy it. It tastes like artificial whiskey... I am not a fan. Both bartenders (dirty blonde female with glasses, tall guy with medium length dark hair and hat) were pleasant, answered my questions, offered a replacement drink, and charged my phone. They were bomb. I just wish the spirits were as advertised. I'll still be here regularly because you cannot beat their BOGO deal!",,,

I thought maybe it was a grammatical error but he didn't correct it. I asked him about it,he got defensive and said you don't know the story. I said I don't care about the story. I told him he needs to move away from me.He was comfortable enough to go into the kitchen and speak to the owner. Owner comes up to me, I tell him what happened and he downplayed what I saw with my own eyes. Later, I had beer left and in my glass and it ""disappeared"". Asked about it and got an attitude from the bar staff. I thought maybe I was wrong. Asked for a charger to charge my phone, bartender lies and says it's occupied, I can see it isn't. 30 minutes later, dude is leaning on me hard, and I adjust myself and tell him to back up, bar wasn't crowded. At first owner is on my side, something flipped and he's demanding I leave.Wasnt drunk. I had 5 beers in 3.5 hours.

Good thing I did. It was a Monday, happy hour so had two for one beers. The female bartenders are very friendly and attentive. Would I come here though on a regular basis? Probably not being that it is not my first choice of bars, especially on a hang out night with friends and I don't really hang out around the 14th Street/Union Square area but if I ever have to pee before hitting 14th street while on the L, this is where I will be heading and if I am not fully inebriated, just might take part in a drink or two.",1,2,1
47,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,4.0,10/11/2016,"$13 for 2 beers, a large burger, and fries is a great deal. Burger patty was obviously premade and frozen but still enjoyable, it came with lettuce, tomato and onion. Fries were thick probably frozen steak fries but still enjoyable. This isn't a beer bar but the selection of drafts is good enough, I had a Sam Adams Octoberfest and a Brooklyn Lager. This is a great lunch spot for sure.",,,
48,Tara S.,"Roselle Park, NJ",165,303,67,3.0,7/6/2015,"I happened upon here with my friend while we were in NYC for the pride parade. We decided to grab something to eat, as it was raining and we were hoping it would pass over while we ate. So we ducked into this place, the word ""pub"" speaking to me. I love pub food. We looked over the menu and I kept coming back to the skirt steak sandwich. I have been DYING for a good steak sandwich, after a series of unfortunate events kept me from a prime rib sandwich a week or so earlier. So I trusted my instinct and ordered the skirt steak sandwich, with no onions, medium. What came out was shoe leather on bread. Ok, ok. It wasn't that bad. But you know how when you're expecting something to be one way and you're looking forward to it and putting it up on this pedestal in your mind and it's not even close, so you're so completely disappointed? That's how I felt with this sandwich. The steak was way overcooked and it was dry and disappointing and barely was enough steak to cover the sandwich bread.My friend got the mac and cheese, which was so much better and amazing than what I got. Thankfully she let me finish it when she got full. I did with zeal.We sat in the booths by the bar because the bar was way too crowded. Our experience suffered in service but we had the entire booth to ourselves. Give and take.",1,,
49,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25506,3.0,12/11/2013,"This is a decent cheap bar in a neighborhood with not that many great bars. I found myself here last night after talking myself (and Ingrid as my +1) into an open bar party that was serving 10 year and 15 year Macallan - I still don't know who threw this party or what they were celebrating - it was at the nearby Wired pop-up shop - but this party resulted in us getting quite tipsy and toodling over to McKenna's for an edible nightcap before we set forth to our respective boroughs.We sat at the bar counter corner right by the entrance and I was pleased to see soccer on the telly. This is definitely an Irish pub down to the awesome 90s grungy/alternative hits blasting that came to define my road through adolescence. If they would have played The Cranberries at one point then my musical experience here would have been complete perfection. As far as food goes here, it's a bar...kind of a dive bar...it's not the lengthiest, most diverse menu, but it gets the job done and features such bar classics as hamburgers, grilled cheeses, wings, salads (what?! ick, lol), hot dogs and more.We opted for their hamburgers which are only $6 and come with ""cottage fries"" - it was an extra dollar for cheese. Ingrid and I both went for the kill - I went for cheddar cheese and she selected mozzarella...and in hindsight (also in bed that night) it occurred to me that  we probably should have just ordered one cheeseburger and split it. The burgers turned out to be a surprisingly nice sized patty and both were medium rare as we had requested. AWESOME. Nothing peeves me off more then when I order a steak or burger medium rare and the chef can't get it right. Kudos to McKenna's chef.The ""cottage fries"" were really your regular steak fries. OH MANZ, I love steak fries! More potato than fried?! SIGN ME UP. Portions were also really generous, I barely got through half of my fries and so did Ingrid...another reason why I later wished we would have split one order.Our bartender was pretty aggressive, blunt and endearingly snarky. I liked her, lol - I didn't consume any alcohol here (my liver had already taken enough of a beating on this particular winter night) but if I had to bet on whether or not she mixes strong drinks I would err on the side of most definitely.Beer selection here is pretty meh - not bad, not outstanding - just meh. Woody McHale's about 2 doors down excels in both beer selection, food offerings and in overall atmosphere, but this place does have a certain dirty charm that works for it. Also, why on Earth is a burger and a grilled cheese here the same price?! This makes absolutely no sense at all to me. Really want to give this bar 3.5 stars, but until Yelp allows us to bestow halfsies, I'm gonna have to go with 3 stars.",1,1,

53,Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",647,921,127,3.0,6/30/2015,"My friend and I stopped here before hitting up the Pride Parade and I loved that they completely decorated for the event. The bar area was completely packed so we grabbed a booth. It took a bit for someone to stop by but I figured since it was busy. The waiter/bartender was super friendly. I had to use the bathroom, they had one for ladies, one for gentlemen, and one for handicapped but said gentlemen on it. I used it anyways since the ladies one was in use for a while. It was thankfully spacious and pretty clean. (Huge perk for me since NYC can be a deathtrap of hell when it comes to rest rooms.)I got the macaroni and cheese which came in a small crock pot looking thing and I thought it wouldn't be enough. But it was packed in! It was overflowing with cheese and there was a LOT of cheese in it, yay. I was fully 75% in and gave the rest to my friend.She had the skirt steak sandwich without the onions so it was just steak on bread. The bread was toasted a bit which is nice. However, she asked for medium and the steak was pretty well done. Meh. Not the best. Service took a bit again to get the check and paid out. We ended up taking the check up to pay since it was faster that way. At the bar, the bartenders were very attentive so I recommend the bar next time.",,,

The prices are the most reasonable I have ever seen in NYC.  My wife, daughter and I had lunch there today and the check was so low I thought it had to be wrong.  And the food was very good too. Nothing fancy - but very good pub food. And everyone was very friendly.  The best thing i can say about this place is besides the great food, service and prices is that despite the fact that I have never been there before - they made me feel like a regular. Definitely a blue collar crowd - which is my kind of place.  We will definitely be back. A great find.",,,
59,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10929,3.0,12/24/2013,"Their selection of beers on tap kind of suck. When in a pinch and attending an open bar on 14th street on the west side and trying to find a place to warm up, I'd suggest Woody's over this place. Standard drafts you'd find anywhere else here though for probably a little too much money unless you're there for their 2 for 1 happy hour. Which when I have walked by for and debated over, I couldn't see a clear spot on the bar to sit and walked away.We came here after our happy hour though when it was much more empty and ended up getting persuaded by the bartender into ordering cheeseburgers. She said it was their best thing. It was definitely quality and juicy and cooked pretty damn well. I think I got either mozzarella or swiss and Steph got cheddar. It's cheap as hell as well. $6 for a burger and $5 for a grilled cheese. Which we both found weird. But, still, that's a cheap as hell burger that comes with a side of thick cut wedge fries. And it was an enormous portion. Huge enough that I had a leftover box to waddle home with. The bartender was nice and sassy. The music was great. 90's Alternative. Yeah. But I also was very intoxicated and probably whining about life and important things. Lol. Decent dive bar though.",,,

73,Raven C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",637,105,165,4.0,5/4/2015,"So, i actually had a great time at this bar and I probably shouldn't have. Went here with one of my girls for happy hour after getting our nails done in the area. Place is kinda dark, definitely old, sort of yucky, doesn't smell that great.... but, their drinks are SUPER strong and their food was incredibly good which was such a surprise.We struck up conversation with some regulars and they invited us to join them at their table (the big long table near the front). The Happy Hour (2for1) was great, the bartender was making our whiskey/gingers with Jameson! Like, super strong, and Jameson is your house whiskey? Wut? That doesn't even make any sense! Give me a hundred of them! Ahhh! Also, they have this token thing where you buy one, and if you don't want your second right away, they give you a token. you can literally leave for 3 years, come back to happy hour, and present your token and get a drink for free. That's like.. the best idea ever.The place definitely had a constant dull roar of folks partying and talking, and I know there was music playing although I couldnt remember if i tried. As for food, we ordered mozzarella stix (greasy, juicy, crispy, melty gooey, everything mozzarella dreams are made of) and the buffalo chicken pizza which was so good! I was literally blown away by how good their marinara sauce was, and I KNOW MY MARINARA. I would shower in it maybe.Do not go here on a date unless that person knows you very well and loves you very much!! They will be horrified otherwise. Go here with your idiot friends, to get drunk at happy hour and eat delicious bar food and be in a gross dingy basement bar. I'll be back.",5,6,

A star and a half off for hufflepuff.So long story short, I intended to get the first round (and second with chips) and got three rounds for the price of four.  Needless to say, my great opinions of McKenna's were dashed with a bucket of hatorade.Otherwise, I think McKenna's is a decent dive bar for the area and great for the 2 for one.  It gets crowded sometimes and is close to the ACE train lines.  They also serve food.",3,4,3

It's a typical sports bar for your typical individual who just wants to listen to lame boring country music and grab cheap drinks at that!Never tried the food but I'm sure it's your typical sloppy bar food for fat people so if this is what you're into then it's for you but if not go somewhere else!,,,
84,Matt FX F.,"Manhattan, NY",225,11,0,5.0,11/21/2014,"I'll just come out and say it: Mckenna's is a New York treasure. A blue-collar worker bar in an increasingly designer-blanketed neighborhood, the pub I know and love is a true cross section of all that makes New York what it is in 2014. Quite frankly, I'd wager that venturing into Mckenna's Pub on a random Weekday night is as worthy a cultural expedition as a trip to any one of Tokyo's secret Sake bars or Barcelona's local tapas joints. A quick scan on Yelp will reveal a fair share of both positive and negative reviews, which leads me to assume it's probably difficult to get an easy perception of this place if you haven't been before. This bar is NOT new. It's not fancy, it's not forgiving, and it's definitely not part of Taylor Swift's New York. There is no 'signature cocktail list', no pork belly on the menu, and no house-infused anything. As for the naysayers, I get the general sense that I probably wouldn't get along with most of the people who have given this place a bad review, but that's ok. It's doing fine without them!For starters, the staff is warm, personable, and REAL. I can't stress enough how no bullshit this place can be. I wasn't kidding about the worker-bar thing, either; an urban strain for sure, but you'll see them all here: from middle-aged nurses grabbing take-out lunch to upscale meatpacking kitchen staff getting after-work drinks with off-duty bouncers, burrowing through plates of wings. Balanced with the out-of-borough rejects of the next-door-club 'Up & Down', and the nearby locals (everyone from low-key film directors to the lively residents of the nearby Chelsea projects) and you get a place that makes for honest and entertaining barwatching practically any night of the week.The drinks are poured strong to the point of poison here, and 2-for-1 drinks occur between the hours of 12-8PM and 12-2:30AM(!) every. single. day. The two happy hours work on a poker chip token system, with different color chips designating the price in which you paid for your first drink. The system works like a charm - you'll find yourself slowly amassing a small fortune worth of drunkenly forgotten Mckenna's chips - and these collections tend to pay off greatly during celebrations, or when trying to drag out that broke friend or two you haven't seen in a minute. Come here often enough, and you'll also find the bartenders throwing freebies your way in no time. Protip: If you like Le Bain, pregame here!Mckenna's is open for lunch (with table service!) and dinner, and the kitchen closes by 1AM. A half-pound cheeseburger and fries will run you a whopping 7 dollars (what!), and most of the other apps & entrees (Wings & Fries, Cheesesteaks, Nachos etc.) don't hover much higher. The food is surprisingly good, generously portioned, and extremely reliable; my girlfriend and I plan our calorie-splurge days around their crazy-spicy hot wings and their pepper jack-cheese steak fries. Like I said, the area's upscale chefs get their after work eats here. That's how you know this shit's good.The jukebox's natural flow is an eclectic mix of drake, sam cooke, and the violent femmes, with the occasional 90's hip hop or top 40 thrown in the mix. Late night, the place (and music) can get pretty ratchet (in the most positive definition of that word) and you might even hear a full nirvana album front-to-back if you happen there mid-afternoon. There are probably 5 or 6 TV's scattered around the place - 'the game' is usually on, regardless of which game it is, though it's in no-way intrusive to the non-sports fan.I struggled quite a bit at first with figuring out the right way to write this review, as Mckenna's is truly a one-of-a-kind place. In fact, writing a review to this establishment was one of the main reasons I made an account for this site; the three prior reviews I've written have merely been practice for this big kahuna. So, apologies if it's a little long. I'm new.No, the bar won't win any design awards, and it's certainly not up for cleanest or brightest lit, either. And let's be honest - besides the free Corned Beef & Cabbage on St. Patrick's day, the place is about as Irish as a plate of General Tso's Chicken. But the bar is something special, and I will keep coming back. If you find yourself in this neighborhood often, you should too.ALL THIS being said, the Men's bathroom stall doesn't have a working lock, always watch your bags, and don't come at 1:00 AM on a weekend expecting quick service. The 2-1 Happy Hour deal happens every night, so unless it's fucking freezing outside or it's the Monday after a National Holiday, the bar should be full enough to provide as much entertainment as you might need on a weeknight, anyways.",8,3,3
85,Jacqueline M.,"Hampton Bays, NY",8,4,0,1.0,8/21/2016,"Came here on a Sunday with my boyfriend. Not crowded at all, but it took the bartenders way too long to serve us. We ordered a Shocktop and Sam Adams Seasonal which both tasted watered down. Not a great experience here.",,,

If you add cheese on its 1.00 extra . The place is a dive. It's a typical Irish bar with locals. The music selection is cool because you can actually play the jukebox! It's amid crowd young /old, sober/sloppy wino. The bartenders are pretty chill. Some are more friendly then others .  The bar area is cool with tons of seating . Looks like they have about 10 beers on tap. I counted about 3 tv's incase you want to watch the game. Looks like the put some type of security guy there around 7 pm. I think they should hire more cultured bartenders. I'm not racist , but everyone was white (as far as the staff goes). It's 2016 we should be more diverse. They have small booths off to the side of the bar . The burger was blah. No seasoning, and kinda dry. The steak fries that come with are good. You can't mess fries up. I will be back for drinks .

I saw some older 55+ year old guys were creeping on a group of 20-something year old girls. Sorry guys, I think you missed that boat 35 years ago. Pretty sad and hilarious at the same time.",,,
88,Yves A.,"Jersey City, NJ",43,1,0,1.0,7/20/2016,"I signed up specifically because of my horrible experience at McKenna's Pub. Let's start with the positive. The food and drinks are cheap for NYC, the atmosphere is dive bar'ish (the way I like it), and I like the buy one get one free option. However, I was disgusted twice today. I found a roach in my drink which while disgusting, is somewhat expected from a place as dingy as McKenna's. What I found worse was the lackadaisical and dismissive attitude of the bartenders. The ""so-what it was a dead roach"" attitude they had clearly shown that it's a normal occurrence there, that they try to hide from their patrons.TL: DR: Found a roach in my glass. The bartender didn't care and just dumped out the beer then set the glass to the side, ready for another pour. Disgusting!",,,
89,Robert C. Y.,"New York, NY",54,328,18,4.0,5/11/2012,"WOW! I can't believe some of the negative reviews here.  Did these yelpers think they were entering Le Cirque and took a wrong turn. Duh, Irish pub means, gasp!, Irish pub. If you've ever been to a real pub in Ireland or England, you'd see this is close to the real thing.  The times we have been here we realized that the staff and management really were glad you were there.  Where else could you have two lunch entrees for 14 bucks, including tax. I often tip 30% because I feel less looks cheap.  Their 1/2 pound burgers at $6 are about half the price of other places.  Their Guiness is cold and perfectly drafted.  Many other drafts are available. They have a 2 for 1 happy hour(s) too, from 11am to 7pm and 12mid to 2am.  The clientel is a bit loud, but friendly.  Hey, it's a pub for god's sake.  The place is a ""dive"".  But a dive with soul.  Their St. Pat's day free corned beef and cabbage buffet was incredible.  Go, you'll be welcomed, sated and have a good buzz without breaking your budget.   McKenna's is becoming my lunch central.",3,1,1

And I was drunk when I got here.The first thing that struck me was it looked like your average Irish bar from the outside. I was with a date so I figured this place might help us loosen up. First, we walked in to see the dirtiest cliental. I don't know where they were from but I think they recruit homeless people in here. Second, the whole bar was wasted. It was 9pm on a Friday and it didn't look like any of the patrons would have been at a ""business happy hour."" The females were foolishly attempting to twerk and the men were checking out every female who walked by.On top of this, the prices are insane! We paid $13 for 2 coronas. Now, this is pretty average for New York City, but this place was far from classy. I don't mind dishing that sort of money for a nice ambiance and normal behaving crowd.  We had 6 shots of tequila which amounted to $88. Again, it was house tequila and the shots seemed watered down. There is a lot of seating around the back. When I was there someone had their ratchet birthday party catered in the back. But there was still seating for others. For that and that only, I'll throw em 1 star.",3,2,2

I once had to wait about 10 mins before getting acknowledged and then a few more minutes for just a beer. The most recent time I had a better experience. It was around 6pm on a weekday. We were drawn in with 2 for 1 Happy Hour and $6 burgers. We had to order at the bar and pay for it at the same time even though we were sitting at a table. The burger was not bad, came with nice steak fries. Not a bad deal at all for $6. And who doesn't like 2 for 1?Overall it give this dive bar 3-stars, this most recent experience helped.",1,,

Usually sat at one of the round high-tops by the front window (which was always available whenever I went) or at the bar. Now about the food... I don't think I'd eat here again.

I recently went with a friend who has never been and I warned her that it was a dive bar with an eclectic assortment of patrons.  There were a lot of men there. Some regulars. Some who just came from the gym. Some tourists. As it got later, more mixed gender groups of co- workers came in.I got there about 4 pm and the bar was full so we sat at a booth. I ordered our drinks and meal at the bar. Someone brought our food to the table but we got our own drinks.  We ordered chicken tenders and buffalo wings. Both came with steak fries.

It was a nice stop after attending a cancer benefit at 300 Bowling Alley at Chelsea Piers. My group and I headed in and the place was packed. I hit the back where a few acquaintances were already holding a table for us to come and sit. I wasn't expecting it to be jumping but the music was blasting (even at times it was a bit too loud at times) and the bar was packed. The ambience didn't leave much to be desired because it is a hole in the wall. It's a nice small bar and if you are looking for a stuffy crowd this isnt the place for you. It's diverse, eclectic and unassuming and I love it. What I like most about it is you get chips for free drinks (still holding on to mine). It is a good place to unwind and just kick back with your friends and let loose.Now I can give this place five stars with no problem. I went back to McKenna's Pub after retreiving my jacket from 300 Bowling Alley this past weekend (10/6/2012). I went a little before 3 pm and it was a far cry from that Friday night/morning I attended.The place had less than 10 customers, and the bar was peaceful. I grabbed and seat and Andrew took my order and then I was passed over to Katarina, who is the bar's manager. She is pretty girl, with a slim figure, long brown hair, and a friendly attitude. I ordered up some of their buffalo wings and I was disappointed. They came out in a large size (8 to be exact), I ordered mild and they had a sweet taste to them, with bar fries perfectly crisp and piping hotI had held on to my chip for a free drink after my first visit, and it was accepted (even though they have since changed the chips). For all the food and liquor/wine I consumed my bill came to no more than $23. Not bad for a day out for drinks and wingsAs I said before this place is kickback and I will be going again",2,,1

The strongest drink they have is the red devil. If your and alcoholic then 4 of those should do it two for the average person like myself lol.

The food is great--well-portioned and affordable.But I had a horrible time on Thursday (1/21/2016). My friend and I get there just after 6pm and make it for happy hour. We order drinks and take them to the back where there's seating. We see a long table with ""reserved"" signs on it and we thought that was a weird thing for a bar. We thought it was a joke. We sat down because there was no where else to sit. Plus there was another couple sitting there and they clearly weren't the ""reserved"" party. We order food and when it's brought to us, the employee (an older man) lets us know the table really is reserved but the party isn't here yet (they were supposed to be there at 6pm). It's about 6:30, so we (me, my friend and the employee) wonder if that group is even going to show up. Me and my friend take a chance and stay at the table. The party does show up...at nearly 7:15 and we have to move! C'mon! Isn't the rule of thumb that you have 15 minutes of leeway before your table is given away?! And since when did bars/pubs reserve tables anyway?!That's not the worst of it. When I got home, I noticed a huge ketchup stain on my Calvin Klein coat! The stain was 12 inches by 6 inches! It must have transferred from either the stool I first sat on or the chair I had to move to later. It's ridiculous that their furniture was that dirty at so early in the evening.

That is what I call, this bar's 'Living Room.'The Bathroom is vastly different from their Living Room. The floral smell forced me to close my mouth and not comment on the horrendous smell until afterwards because I was fearful of voming in the bathroom (which, arguably, may have improved on the current scent). The odors of this place were numerous, the people at this bar were not. However the bartender was adorable with her Poison Tshirt, pierced nose and the fact that she gave us 2-1 drinks was not forgotten.However, I almost vomed approximately 2-3 times during my time in this lovely establishment.

It is not the same as imported beer. LOL. But it tasted awesome, and the place looked great! The decorations were really haunting (for halloween), and the man sitting near the door looked like Uncle Fester from the Adams Family.The waitress kept asking if I was cold (and as she asked she shivered). She had on a short sleeved shirt, but I kept my jacket on. I felt a bit bad for her. Eventually they closed the door, but seeing a cold waitress, it made me want to hug her to warm her up...Anyway, I am getting off topic.

Their shot glasses are huge and if money is tight but you want to get drunk on the first shot, their Blue Long Island Ice Tea is all you need. It will send you to a whole new world and you'll still have money in your pocket for the cab ride home. Or you can hitchhike and save your money.  Your choice.The food is outstanding. My favorite thing to get is their mild buffalo wings, with their amazing blue cheese dressing and fries.  It tastes especially good when accompanied with a drink.  Lastly the music is always right on point.  They have a jukebo that plays music from all different genres and artists.I absolutely love it here.  After a hard day, or week, at work, I can lounge around like the true couch potatoe at heart that I am and truly unwind in a fun and live enviornment.",,,

And even better - you might not be able to buy any of the specials but you are allowed to order your ""chip""-drink after the happy hour (until 8pm). The food is not too bad either. It is regular bar food such as burgers and fish and chips. I have had the veggie burger which I definitely can recommend and I have had their mixed green salad, which was quite ordinary but the veggies were surprisingly fresh for a bar like this one. I have always had some good times here. The prices are really good which makes this place extra attractive.",1,,

Maybe because she knew the 50 year old guys at the bar were going to give her better tips than the 20 something girls (and let's be honest, they probably did), but when you're joking around with all your regulars it would be nice to glance around once in a while and you would see me standing there forever trying to get your attention.

It's that simple, think about it if you drink and you want to pay a low price in NYC getting the 2 for 1 happy hour is the best thing since sliced bread.  I don't drink but from what I have heard, the drinks are strong and aren't skimpy like 90% of the other bars in NYC.  The food as well is amazing, burgers so big and cheap I don't get why people even bother with McDonalds.  The steak fries are much better then those skinny things they serve elsewhere.   My favorite is easily the chicken sandwich, its grilled right there on the spot and is fresh as could be.

I had an interesting conversation with my fellow drinker on the next stool who said he was thinking about having another round. I told him drinking was supposed to impede his thinking and just to order the next round. He did.,,,

Now that being said I've been coming here for almost 20 years but recently things have changed. Ive always paid and tipped very well, other regulars all know me and my friends. But the staffing and owner have changed for the worst. At a group night, a reg bartender continuously asked me if I'm gonna tip well. I never ask for free drinks and ive always tipped well especially when im with a group of friends. She always harasses so i took a break from going at night. Strike 1. Had lunch and the owner served me my over fried food and barked at me to pay! I had no idea what happened and agreed...he knows who I am and i never start problems. I was informed by the bartender he was upset about something else. Strike 2. There will not be a strike 3 and im gonna find a different water hole from now on.",,,

So we went from drinking at one Irish Pub (Tir Na Nog) to drinking at another (McKenna's Pub). Yes, hardcore social drinking runs in the family. My uncle is definitely a role model.Drunk and ready to drink more, we ordered a round of drinks and since it was ""happy hour"" we were giving some tokens for each of us to come back for a free drink later in the evening (as long as it fit under the premise of happy hour time period that offered 2 for 1 drinks). Rad. By the way, happy hour in New York is often 12-7 or so. This is way cooler than the usual 4-7 in California. Lame.Another heavy Jack and (diet) Coke in my system made me really love in New York. And well, it is hard not to enjoy yourself at McKenna's Pub. Cool bartenders. Great vibe. Killer music. Good times.In terms of music, they played Van Halen, Journey, and the Darkness. I was thoroughly satisfied and singing along to all the tunes. La Novia was cringing at wonderful taste in music. But whatever, she was buzzing so she was happy even though this bar was smart enough not play crap like the Counting Crows, Keane, or Coldplay.Well, until she came back from the restroom and some random Spanish chicks came by and my uncle and I faked Spanish accents with them to start up a conversation and be friendly (and all the while work as my uncle's wingman). La Novia thought about my upcoming trip, to New York in November, with this same uncle and my dad (another hardcore social drinker). I could see her wheels spinning. I think La Novia was already drawing up divorce papers, even though we are not married.Anyway, I am a big fan of McKenna's. I'll be back in November for more whiskey, rock & roll, and good times.",13,12,9

A lot of regulars sat at the bar during their happy hour, and we easily snagged the seats in the back for our group, and we soon spilled over to the comfy couches.Downside to the place is that there is NOT any outside space...but it didn't seem to be too much of a problem that day - it was super muggy out, thanks to the crazy weather we've had this summer.Great location- I've always wanted a good spot to go to in that area.I'll definitely go back, especially if I am ready to get sloshed again!

Juke box is one of those infinite kind and can be alternately awesome or awful if hijacked by the right/wrong people. Cheap and great food!!Draft beers are about $6, 1/2 pound hamburgers are $5 plus $1 for cheese, are made to order, and arrive on a plate with lettuce, tomato, onion, and thick-cut fries. Salads are huge, and the grilled cheese sandwich ($5) is a hunger-slaying toasted baguette, also served with fries. Avoid the onion rings, unless you're into preformed rings.Service is always super friendly, can get VERY crowded on the usual nights (Thrs, Fri, Sat).

I ordered a grilled chicken breast with roasted peppers panini. It wasn't amazing but it was far from bad. I also had the French fries. I could have done without those. They were lying in grease. But what do you expect from bar food? I ordered a Long Island Iced tea and a Tequila Sunrise. The Long Island was good but they are definitely heavy on the alcohol (not that im complaining) The tequila sunrise was nasty but not at the fault of the bartender, I just don't like the drink.  The music played was good, I think the selection was purely based on people picking songs from a juke box thing. I like it. I would definitely go back here when I want to go out to a low key place for drinks.

Below street-level interior with a decent sized bar, innumerable and variably sized flat screen TVs, modern day jukebox, ATM, nondescript back lounge area with booths and kick-about old couches, limited and reasonable priced menu with burgers and other appetizers (thereby qualifying it for sought after ""pub"" status) and an old school Big Game Buck Hunter video game. McKenna's features a longer than typical Happy Hour, extending from roughly Christmas til Thanksgiving of the following year. Seven dollar drafts come with a nifty poker chip that qualifies the patron for a free next round and allow him to feel like he's tipping a blackjack dealer. On the particular Sunday afternoon I visited, the dealer was a pretty young thing with an easy smile and occasionally vacuous and confused demeanor. End-of-the bar regulars also out of central bar casting and provide more spirit-abused charm than Mayberry's Opus ringing up Sheriff Taylor's Vertical Bar Inn after an all-weekend bender in Raleigh. Solid joint when you're not in the mood for trendy Chelsea or West Village BS.",,1,1
185,Maite M.,"New York, NY",117,9,1,4.0,3/2/2011,I love this place. It's not upscale or lush.  This is a typical dive bar.  Cozy couches and a jukebox. Last time I went...my friend and I received a one free drink token.....which is great because I love free shit! The bartenders are cool.  Nice place to catch up with friends,,,
186,Marcelle C.,"New York, NY",1,11,0,3.0,9/13/2011,"Not a fancy place. Good for groups of friends. The service is hit or miss. There are a couple of nice bartenders who are good & then one or two who just hang around. Food, drinks & prices are pretty good. Everyone goes for the 2 for 1 happy hour. They have this on weeknds too.",,,
187,David N.,"Lenox, MA",99,66,4,4.0,3/7/2007,"My local, ""last stop"" before I stumble home.  Great music - though sometimes a bit loud.  The afternoon crowd are the working locals.  The evening crowd is a real catch all from frustrated clubbers, locals like me on the way home, local workers (office, restaurant) on their way home, Scandinavian tourists (don't as me why - it must be in some guide book) to some real fixture types who seem to be in there 100% of the time I wander in.  The bar staff is always friendly and you might even meet one of the McKenna family who live in the West Village and still own the place for the better half of a century.",,,
188,Jon M.,"Charlotte, VT",27,379,4,3.0,3/2/2008,"After a brief visit to McKenna's (only stayed for one drink, in between dinner and a comedy show), I can't really speak one way or another about the bar.  It was completely un-pretentious with plenty of place to sit down and grab a beer.  The townies were out in force on a Saturday night!  Shots were a-flyin and guys in leather vests were throwing serious game at the drunk ladies.  Plus, Skynrd was playing on the juke box.On the other hand, it was rather unremarkable and not as cheap as I would have thought for a place that sells itself as a dive bar.  I wouldn't make this bar my destination for the night, but its certainly a harbor of refuge from the pretentious crowds that inhabit surrounding joints in that part of town.",,,
189,Kate M.,"Jersey City, NJ",235,16,2,5.0,3/20/2010,My favorite NYC happy hour.  Awesome owners and best bar staff.  Jimmy is fun too.,1,,
190,Kelly N.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,4,0,4.0,3/31/2011,Amazing New York City happy hour! Two for one drinks...you have to order the sane drink however you can get one and they'll give you a token for the free drink that can be used until 8pm! Can't beat the price.,,,
191,Anders B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,57,0,3.0,9/22/2011,epic dive.... 2-for-1 drinks and prime location makes this one of the best pre-game spots in the city.,2,,1
192,Juv C.,"San Francisco, CA",163,259,13,4.0,8/19/2009,"2 for 1 every day till 7pm?  $2 PBRs and whisky back to back?  Dont mind if i do.  After packing up and leaving my home without a second thought, the anxiety started to kick in. (what the hell did i just do?!)  I needed a stiff drink.  McKenna's came through.  I came in two days in a row so this place obviously works for me.  No fancy pants dressed up bar, cool crowd and laid-back atmosphere, some friendly as hell bartenders, and good cheap booze.  No complaints here.  Not exactly secluded, but not in the open either.  I like that.  And the bar food aint so bad.  Could this be my new neighborhood bar?  Just call me Norm :)",1,1,4
193,Rich M.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",8,116,6,4.0,8/21/2010,"This has been my Sunday afternoon hangout for a while now. I love the two for one drinks at happy hour. The drinks are not watered down. The place has a nice, comfortable feel and the burger and steak fries are really tasty. The place looks small from the outside but has plenty of tables if you're coming with a group.",,,
194,Ian C.,"Clifton, NJ",0,7,0,3.0,1/12/2008,"This place is a bit divey but in a nice way.   Average size bar with about 10 tables and a small lounge-type area in the back.   There is a noon-7pm happy hour with 2-for 1 drink specials.  Couldnt stay long, so wasnt able to try the food.  Overall, a decent joint in a good location and the happy hour is definitely worth checking out.",,,
195,Thomas R.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,0,2.0,1/29/2013,"The burgers are really good.  Drink prices aren't bad.  During Happy Hour (12-7) you get two for one!  This attracts a lot of people though.  It is always so crowded after 5:00, especially on Fridays.  You can't even walk down the aisle.  Unfortunately the bartenders aren't very attentive.  Often the bar will be full of people holding up money to get a drink, but the bartenders are down the other end hanging out with friends.  It's tough to get a drink unless you know them - even then it can be tough.  The best time to go seems to be between 2PM and 4PM.  Unfortunately the music is always LOUD!  I go to bars to talk to people.  If I wanted music so loud that I have to shout out orders to a bartender, I'd go to a club.  Ok if it's not crowded and don't mind extremely loud music.",,,
196,Zane F.,"New York, NY",140,3,0,4.0,11/25/2012,"Great Bar. I've been visiting Mckenna's over the last 5 years and its one of my favorite bars in the city. Great 2-1 specials, friendly bartenders, and great owners. Location is good and easily commutable on 14th n 8th. The crowd is a mixed variety and you will definitely find some characters here. Bottom line, this is definitely a great bar  for happy hour or to pre-game before you hit the town.",,,
197,Ed M.,"New York, NY",71,27,12,3.0,4/24/2010,Haven't been there in a little while but I always have a good time there. The bar usually has a few seats and the crowd is generally a good group of folks. They have a great happy hour and $2 PBR if you're brave enough - LOVE the bartenders as they are super cool and very attentive. The food is good and never a long line to el bano...,,,
198,Gabby D.,"New York, NY",220,303,131,3.0,9/18/2006,"Crossed the street to come here after giving a big ""BOO!"" to Plumm.  Much better choice. We squeezed our way down the bar and ordered some fabulous beers.  Atmosphere was chill, music was good, and the company aka the patrons made the evening even better.  We didn't eat, but 3/4 of everything on the menu seemed to range from $3-$6. OH! And their Happy Hour runs from 12-9.  Not too shabby!",3,,3
199,Molly C.,"Milwaukee, WI",305,911,3,4.0,1/10/2009,"i have waited a long time to write this review and after much reflection, i feel that i can finally do it.so, my school is like one block from this place and my trustworthy classmate started coming here earlier in the semester. each week on tuesday he would convince another couple people to go out with him, and that's how i/we/most of my pratt LIS 652 class started showing up to mckenna's to drink 2 for 1 and $2 pbrs.isn't that a nice story? i think so.",2,,1
