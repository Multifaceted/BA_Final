Very beautiful spot with nice scenery.The food was a selection of salads followed by steaks and chicken and seafood. I picked the salmon, which was cooked perfectly with a crisp skin and flaky moist center.  Vegetables and light sauce accompanied.  I recommend this place.",1,,
1,Sheelz J.,"Vancouver, Canada",20,175,245,4.0,10/11/2018,"We visited the Loeb Boathouse for lunch on a Thursday afternoon after walking around Central Park, we were at the casual counter-service outlet since we have no reservations. As its name suggests, the Loeb Boathouse is located on the boating lake in Central Park. Our food was good and again big portions, surrounded by tourist and locals.",,,
2,Hana S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",395,583,191,2.0,10/8/2018,"Being that this is a very NYC thing to do, we brought my best friend here for a drink on her birthday. There was a 1 hour wait for the indoor / actual boat house seating so they directed us to the outdoor bar & patio area where seats were first come first serve. No big deal at that, but they told us the menu would be the same as indoors -- it wasn't, and our birthday girl doesn't eat meat. They weren't open to adjustments, or letting us just order a side of fries (even though the burgers all come with fries?) They also tack on the tip to your check automatically, maybe because the server is grumpy and wouldn't get a good tip otherwise... 15% tip is standard and not bad at all but tacking it on automatically is kind of obnoxious. Nice view but bad service and overpriced so come once and then never come again.",1,,
3,Nick P.,"Montclair, NJ",200,119,162,4.0,8/6/2018,"Spent a Saturday afternoon on the patio and had a great time!The outdoor bar is great but getting seating on the patio is hard to do! The view across the lake is fantastic! The drinks were very good (definitely pricy, but it is Central Park...). Really great venue for a sunny summer afternoon!",,,1
4,Gail T.,"South Portland, ME",123,94,319,4.0,10/2/2018,"I finally made it to The Loeb Boathouse in Central Park. This was on my bucket list (mostly due to the many scenes in movies from this place such as my all time favorite ""When Harry met Sally"" and ""27 Dresses"" ) We were promptly seated and served fresh sourdough bread and butter....the service was impeccable with water being refilled in a timely manner and nice white linens added to the ambiance. We had a table outside overlooking the pond and the boaters. It was a beautiful warm day. The chicken was perfectly roasted topped with a tangy green salsa and perfectly cooked yellow wax beans that still had a tiny but of snap to them.....",,,
5,Gabriella S.,"Arlington, VA",133,98,615,5.0,9/25/2018,"What an iconic restaurant! Eating here is truly an experience with the gorgeous views and amazing service. Today when I dined here it was absolutely pouring rain, which made it quite easy to get a reservation but honestly it was a beautiful experience. The way that the rain fell on the lake and the geese swam was gorgeous. They still had the doors to the patio wide open so we were able to get the crisp fresh air and smell the rain as we dined semi- al fresco on an otherwise dreary day.Unfortunately I was here on a business lunch so I was unable to take any photos but I will definitely be returning in the future, hopefully on a sunny day. The restaurant has a great atmosphere with even better service. It's just like the good old days here where the waiters carry large trays of fresh breads in a variety of flavors and offer you several pieces to try with their excellent olive oil for dipping. I truly believe the death of the bread basket is a travesty and I'm so happy The Boathouse is sticking to tradition.I went with the special leek and potato soup to start with the roast chicken as my main. The food was excellent and I noted that they had a great wine selection as well, even though I did not partake as it was a lunch meeting. Looking forward to returning for a leisurely lunch or dinner. It's a great spot for a meeting but I can also see it being very romantic.",,,
6,Elizabeth Y.,"Bronx, NY",138,484,256,3.0,8/29/2018,"Came here to celebrate a birthday dinner. They only take reservations for dinners only. I unfortunately had the this event on of the hottest days in the summer where it was over 90 degrees. This place is outdoors with no A/C and in the afternoon, the sun hits you at full blast. Everyone was dripping in sweat and despite all the water I was drinking I never had to pee once. Your entire party needs to be present in order for you to be seated. The food was ok, and there is a cake fee. The bread is pretty good. Overall I think this place is beautiful, just come on a cooler day. Food and drinks are expensive, but you're paying more for the experience. It was one of the places I crossed off my bucket list, but I would not come back.",2,1,1
7,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",412,1514,173,3.0,5/29/2018,"This review is for the outside bar.The outside bar is right next to where you rent the boats. It's seasonal and does not follow the same hours as the actual restaurant - so don't rely on their website. Quite a few tables and chairs to overlook the people that willingly struggle to row a boat in the murky water. Large drink menu. Wine is brought out on ice - which is great on a warm, muggy day.There was only one waitress when we went so service was spotty but she never forgot about us. Only a few umbrellas so if you hate the sun, try to find some shade. They just opened for the season on Memorial Day weekend and yet their bar food menu was not available yet? That's a fail considering how packed it was on a Friday afternoon. Prices are average. People need to stop bringing their babies to bar-like areas. Dogs are welcome so long as they're on a leash.Great spot for people watching and to have an excuse to drink in the great outdoors. Easy to find if you follow the curve in the park from the 72nd street entrance.",3,1,1
8,Taylor R.,"Dallas, TX",12,195,233,2.0,5/18/2018,"The food is great, service excellent, and you can't ask for a better location.However, there is no accessibility for wheelchairs; the main dining room can only be accessed via stairs. They told us they were constructing a ramp, but that doesn't really help me now.  No amount of great food can make up for this.",6,,
9,Lanyi L.,"Montreal, Canada",184,79,48,4.0,6/27/2018,"The view was spectacular. It was a sunny day and we sat near the water for brunch. The service was excellent. Food was all right as well. I had the raw oysters and they were fresh.  I ordered the fillet and eggs, which were good but my over easy eggs were very runny so my fillet mignon ended up tasting very eggy as well. Fillet itself was good too though. I shared the crème brûlée for dessert with my friend and we both agreed it was delicious. They also give you complimentary BANANA BREAD!! The bill was pricey but we had a lot of food and the view was great. One of my only complaints is that they were unable to split the bill--which I found common in many restaurants I ate at in NYC. Everything we shared had to go on one bill rather than being ""1/2"". Overall, I would recommend going at least once, especially if the weather is nice!",,,
10,Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",85,401,118,5.0,9/10/2018,I never in a million years thought we'd have the time or ability to eat here on our first trip to NYC. It's so famous I probably assumed it was reservation only and booked out months in advance so I didn't even look into it.We were passing through Central Park and on a whim my husband insisted we stop here for lunch. It was packed but I indulged him if only to prove we could never get in here. Well after barely a ten minute wait we were seated right on the lake in Central Park and I was eating my words.Our lunch tasted great and the chance to dine in that setting was another ultimate fantasy I had always wanted to experience in NYC. It was as perfect as I dreamed it would be. The only thing I noticed was one waiter would constantly turn away from his tables and turn from Mr. Hyde to Dr. Jekyll. He was loudly complaining about the day and wanting it to be over. Thank god he wasn't our waiter but it does kill the vibe a bit. It was madness for all the employees but at that kind of establishment you need to hold that in and decompress when your off the clock.,,,
11,Isabela F.,"New York, NY",29,9,22,5.0,8/15/2018,"Went there twice with my father when he was visiting me in the U.S and both times we had an amazing experience there. The crab cake was the BEST I ever had and the steak tartare was also incredible! I was having such a great time there that I didn't even take pics of the food but I'm sharing a pic of me and my dad there with you guys. Price was very reasonable for the quality of the dishes. Even though its located in central park it is NOT a touristy restaurant and you'll be warmly treated by the staff, who are really well trained and attentive to details. Make reservations if you wanna seat by the lake, its a really nice view.",2,,
12,Brooke L.,"Atlanta, GA",166,45,52,4.0,6/12/2018,"When the weather is right the outside bar is an amazing spot to have a few cocktails. Yes drinks can be a bit pricey, but you are in the middle of Central Park so it is assumed. We had several drinks and just sat and chatted over an amazing view of the city. I will definitely be back here for another drink when I return to gallivanting through Central Park.",,,
13,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,5.0,5/8/2018,"Iconic New York Spot. Even as a non-tourist I enjoyed the classic NY staple and peaceful setting. I totally ignored if there was any noise, but overlooking the pond brings me peace.First time I came here was for my company's Year End party and had a great time. The hors d'oeuvres in the first room and seated dinner in the second room were both great.Last weekend I came to grab a light bite with my boyfriend and had a very nice experience too. He had the jumbo lump crab cake which was delish (baked, not fried) and came with an amazing sauce. I had the Hamachi Crudo which was also great, it had that Japanese type of sauce that complimented very well the fresh fish. Bread service was also great and worth commenting about. Some people may find the place pricey for the portion sizes, but you are paying for a prime real estate location here (if you want a cheap snack, get a hot dog in the park).Not the kind of place you come often in your 20s (we young people spend our time downtown lol), but definitely a place I will bring my parents when they come visit.Tip: There is a free shuttle from E 72 and 5th Ave that takes you to the Boathouse. It is a very short walk otherwise.",1,,2
14,Shaeda M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",144,179,700,3.0,6/6/2018,Always seen the restaurant in movies so had to check it out while here. Beautiful view and location in middle of the park. Loved watching people on row boats ‍ enjoying themselves.Started off with the burrata which definitely recommend.The petite filet and asparagus shrimp salad were delicious. When getting bread ask for the pretzel one .... yummmm Wish we had room for dessert as they looked so lovely on other people's tables. Would have preferred the previous menu but I understand it changes and I didn't have too many options of food I like as I am allergic to a lot of different types of seafood. Wanted a table by the water but hostess ignored the request even though there were empty tables by the water. Still a pleasurable experience and will be back another season.,,,
15,Gene D.,"Mountain View, CA",3,861,79,4.0,7/22/2018,"What a cool place to take a break whilst making a day of Central Park!  There's the Outside Bar where you can have a drink and meal right by the lake.  It's always crowded so either get there early if possible.  The Express Cafe offers window service of food that has been prepared ahead of time.  Think of this as ordering food at most of the Disneyland eating establishments.  No substitutions or changes unless you want to wait 10 mins of so.  And finally, there's the hoity-toity Lakeside Restaurant which has elevated food at elevated prices!And after eating and relaxing, work some of it by rowing a boat!  What a cool idea at such a reasonable price ($20 per hour).",5,,2
16,Sheena K.,"New York, NY",327,79,96,4.0,10/20/2018,Had a beautiful evening watching the sunset enjoying an aperol spritz. The drinks were good and the ambiance was nice. One downfall is that the outdoor seating should have heaters. It's nice enough weather to sit outside but cool enough where there should be heated. I legit had my jacket on and his jacket on my legs.,,,1

Updated review","Great dinner place for a special occasion on a summer evening. Definitely try to sit by the lake, where you can see turtles& fish, along with the boaters. Service was professional and prompt. There was a good variety of options on the menu. We had the ahi tuna, halibut, salmon, and pasta, and crab cake. Everything was fresh and delicious. It did get a bit hot as it is open seating, but we didn't mind for the experience and views. They gave us complimentary dessert for my friends' birthdays!",1,,
18,Andre M.,"Glendale, CA",18,21,1,1.0,9/22/2018,"When you call them, they don't tell you there is a dress code (or publish it on their website(. But when you show up, apparently only women are allowed to wear tank tops, but that's not allowed for men. One would think that in 2018, they would not be telling different genders that clothing must be gender appropriate.Skip this place. There are many other options in NYC.",3,,
19,Ratna M.,"New York, NY",18,98,219,3.0,8/6/2018,"After reading all the reviews, I had a low expectation coming to this place. After arriving, we were seated by the window as per requested but it feels like the 2 people's tables are not part of the place. There were no table cloths and they are on the other half of the restaurant. Anyway, service.... we came first than our neighbor, yet, the server was way more attentive to them and not to us. To us, he was more ""I'll be right with you, ok?"" I mean yes, he was friendly but I felt forgotten. And another is the person with water and bread. I mean, would it kill to smile or not to throw the bread on our plates or not to spill water all over when pouring the water? But anyway, let's go to the food! As I said, I had low expectation.. So we ordered:Grilled squid - pretty good, although since it's grilled I wasn't expecting it to be kinda chill. I was expecting HOT off the grill.For entrees:Boyfriend got the jerk pork loin - it's pretty good, boyfriend and I are not on the bandwagon of eating pink pork so he asked for medium well and it was still pretty good. It's spiced jerk but it's not spicy. It has a good flavor. I got the bacon wrapped monk fish - as much as monkfish is a scary looking fish, I always enjoy monkfish because it's so meaty. I have to say, the bacon overwhelmed the fish itself but even after unwrapping and eating separately the monkfish still taste good. Though it would be better if the bacon part in the inside is cooked more. As much as the food was not as bad as some of the reviewers, maybe we just picked the right ones for our tastes. Would I come back? No.",,1,

He suggested the crab cake for an appetizer, the scallops and seafood salad as entrees and the pecan pie for dessert. All of his suggestions were spot on. We enjoyed them immensely.

Highly recommend.",,,
22,Anders N.,"Queens, NY",4,62,8,5.0,9/22/2018,"The food is exceptional, and I'd say it's well-priced considering you get an epic view and where it's located. I do find it obnoxious that they tack on a 15% gratuity even for a table of two so keep that in mind. I had the challah french toast and it came with a tiny glass bottle of warmed genuine maple syrup. This french toast was so GD good I nearly fell to the ground as if I were suddenly taken by the spirit of James Brown himself. Mom had the quiche, looked decent, she thought it was amazun. A+ would mom again!",,,

24,Maureen B.,"Dallas, TX",86,69,120,5.0,12/14/2017,"What a wonderful brunch experience! We came here 5/13/17. Even despite the rain and our canceled gondola ride, brunch was awesome. I loved listening to the piano the ENTIRE time we ate. (I am not a fan of places that have the piano guy leave before brunch is over.) The waiters were very nice and attentive. A waiter that wasn't our waiter offered to take pictures of my boyfriend and I. The food wasn't anything out of this world, but it was fresh and good.

25,Genie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,379,1473,4.0,5/13/2018,"Friday night,Juan Carlos our waiter, made our dining experience a very pleasurable one. The waitstaff  kept checking to make sure that we had enough bread and water. There appeared to be a man with a suit walking around but he never checked on us but if he was the manager his staff was awesome.The ambiance to be in Central Park sitting lakeside and watching the boats and the gondola was so relaxing. You feel so far away, yet you're in the middle of the concrete jungle, not too far away from over  8+ million New Yorkers. Even though it wasn't my birthday it sure felt like it was.The food was good but nowhere as good as the view. The salmon was salmon. The couscous was very plain. The asparagus we're fine. My mom had the halibut, she loved it and my sister had the roasted chicken and she loved it. I loved the view and the suggested wine by our waiter. All in all a great experience I hope to have again soon.",2,,3
26,Erik G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,46,18,4.0,10/30/2018,"Great location and food.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time.  My only complaints would be that the tables for 2 are close together and make it awkward when trying to enjoy the view/look out the window.  Also, the tight configuration resulted in the wait/bussing staff to kick/hit my chair multiple times.  Overall a pleasurable lunch.",,,

28,Rachel K.,"New York, NY",400,201,389,4.0,11/4/2017,"A great brunch location on a special day.I brought my visiting family to Central Park and we came to the Loeb Boathouse wanting to grab a light brunch. We were seated at an inner table and asked if we could move to the waterfront tables, but all the tables had been already reserved.My family of 4 wanted to share three entrees, but we were told that we had to make at least 4 orders because each person had order something. My stomach was quite uneasy, so I wasn't in the mood for anything on the menu and ended up choosing the Butter Lettuce Salad. I was irritated that I had to pay $12 for a sad looking salad (based on other pictures on Yelp). And to my pleasant surprise, the salad was pretty good; the dressing really completed the salad. The salad was exactly what I need for my upset stomach. We also ordered the french toast, omelet, and quiche, which were decent tasting as well.The expensive prices of The Loeb Boathouse are for the ambience of the location. The food is not bad, but if you're looking for a hearty, classic brunch, there are better options in the city.NOTES:- make a reservation in advance if you want better seating- it is not a friendly place for shared meals-- taste / 4aesthetics / 4vibe / 5service / 3price for quality / 3OVERALL / 4",1,,1

On our most recent visit (Sunday brunch -- got there at 11:30 and waited a half hour, which was much better than what it would have been at the time we were leaving), we got the macaroni au gratin (aka mac & cheese) to start, which was outstanding, and I got passion fruit salmon ceviche as a main (it's listed as an appetizer), which I also really liked. My wife got the quiche, which she said was fine but nothing special. In the past, we've loved the crab cake, but skipped it this time to try other things.Altogether, I really like this place despite the obvious tourist-trap nature of it, and the views really are amazing.",3,,2

The manager came to our table to tell us we must order an entree each or two appetizers each. We were not told this prior to being sat or we never would have ate there as we are not that hungry to consume a full entree. I personally work at a fine dining restaurant in Chicago and we would NEVER ask a guest to leave because they are we're not that hungry. I would have purchased well more than the bill of entrees in drinks. Unbelievably stuck up to remove paying guests. And on top of that they had the audacity to add gratitude to the bill.",,1,

Naturally we then made the brilliant idea to go for a walk in Central Park, even though we could see an ominous cloud approaching us. I'm always full of great ideas.No sooner had we got about 10 minutes in, we heard a rumble and felt a drop. ""Oh hell no."" I was not about to get drenched when I was nowhere near a change of clothes or a hairdryer. And then, the Loeb Boathouse appeared in front of us like a blessed mirage, only real. I didn't care how much a drink was going to set us back. I wanted in.Strange that I've never been to Loeb Boathouse before that fateful day in June. I've walked past many times, vowing to one day live out my New York movie moment, but never went in. I'm thankful for this storm, because it was a pretty cool experience.Except for the drunk woman who felt the need to accost my boyfriend. I had gotten up to check out the wine list (yes, they have a decent, affordable sparking option) when she tried to take my seat, not more than five feet away from the bar. She tried to get into it with him but luckily he sent her on her way (which was a few feet down the bar, but at least she was surrounded by a wall of people). Seriously, the scene in this place was something out of an 80s movie, what with the mix of bougie types and your average tourists looking to get out of the rain. I couldn't believe how many people were already drunk at 5:30pm. In New Orleans, this would be completely normal, but New York? I digress.So be it. I can't judge this place based on the clientele that day. We had our drink, admired the killer stormy views of the water and boats... the swaying trees and torrential downpour. It was seriously idyllic.",16,6,8

Updated review","With most restaurants, the better the view, the worse the food. At the Boathouse, however, looking over the boats on the Central Park lake, everything is exceptional, starting with the many varieties of delicious bread to choose from and on to the scallops, salmon and other dishes.With most restaurants, the better the view, the more expensive the food. At the Boathouse, this is true, with even lunch entrees in the mid-$30's, except for the snack bar, which is for picnic tables not facing the lake. Breakfast or weekend brunch is much cheaper.  In warm weather, the budget minded can have  a drink by the lake.Reservations are a must for dinner. For breakfast or lunch they do not take reservations; be ready to wait 30 minutes after 12:45, even in cool weather.",5,1,1

The problem is that they had a mouse running around and the waitress was not surprised. She explained they were close to nature. We were just finishing our meals but this left unappetizing thoughts. We won't go there again but are glad we went. Buy a CAT!!,,,

Definitely mind the time because you will get charged extra if you go over. There were so many turtles swimming in the lake and sun bathing on the large rocks. That being said... the only reason I wouldn't give this place a 5 star review is because the employees weren't all that friendly the employee in the ticket booth didn't even make eye contact.

We were able to sit right by the water as it was not very crowded which was very nice. The menu items are somewhat pricey and the food isn't that amazing when considering the price. Gave 4 stars due to experience and location.,,,

Ambience - bfulFood- nothing great, should be better .maybe they charge you for the viewNo reservations so u need to keep waiting with your pager right next to the place which is a pain. Makes me think if it's really worth the wait when you can just boat for $15 and soak the bful view in.If you are really adamant in trying this out , u can get some cocktails at the bar.However , it's super crowded always .",2,1,
46,Pamela V.,"Burnaby, Canada",7,144,81,4.0,5/25/2018,Beautiful setting of central park. Right next to the lake. Advisable to book if going to dinner. For brunch is walk in. The weather was bad so we did not have to wait at all although it was still quite busy. The service was top and they really looked after us. The food was delicious especially the quiche. Reccomend having dessert too as it was rather yum. Tea is served in a pot. A definate must come back in sunny weather.,1,,2

I didn't do any rowing..so i got to enjoy the scenery..hahah. We had a mini photoshoot on the boat for my preggo cousin..it was cute..lol.

48,Latha P.,"New York, NY",41,245,11,5.0,9/4/2018,"This is for the restaurant (not the outdoor bar). I met a bunch of new and old friends for a meet-up lunch. I had their only vegetarian entree - mushroom and asparagus with quinoa salad. The meal was decent but the bread was amazing. I tried their pretzel and sourdough bread and both were fantastic. My fellow dinners enjoyed their meals. I heard a lot of good things about the crab cake especially. While just the food would have made give this place four stars, the location and the topnotch service put it at 5 stars. It has a spectacular view and five-star service. When one of my co-diners found celery in their salad (they are allergic), they replaced the entire salad. Even though my friend hadn't told them in advance or anything. It is a bit pricey for a casual meal, but make it a special occasion and the view and service make the $$$ more than worth your while. I would love to bring my family here.",,,

51,Chelsea B.,"Brooklyn, NY",404,310,1149,4.0,10/22/2017,"I came here to get a few drinks and appetizers with a friend. This place had been recommended to me because they have a nice outdoor patio on the lake and it's perfect for grabbing some drinks.Most of the tables were taken when we got here around 3:30 on a Friday. We got lucky and someone had just gotten up to leave when we got there so we were able to snag a spot. But be prepared to wait for a seat and/or have to watch over the crowd for one. The drinks are fairly priced and really good. We got a margarita and a spritz with a cheese plate. We could have definitely skipped the cheese. It was really hard and you could tell it was in the fridge all day. What's best about this place, though, is really the view and ambiance. It's so nice and relaxing to have a couple of drinks and appetizers by the water in Central Park. Stop by if you happen to see it while strolling in the park.",2,,1
52,Tushar B.,"Chicago, IL",21,133,220,3.0,6/15/2017,"The view from the boathouse is just amazing considering the rich history of Central Park. Everything about the ambiance of the location resonates with what you'd expect of an upscale restaurant in the middle of Central Park. Unfortunately, the food does not live up to the expectations.A group of us came here for Saturday brunch. I ordered the fish and chips with a crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was good but a small quantity for the price. It would have been nice to get a bit more on the plate. On the other hand, the fish and chips was definitely a low-light. The breading easily fell apart from the fish and was just a big oily mess. The fish itself was good but it just got messy with everything falling apart so easily. Someone at the table ordered the mac and cheese au gratin, which was nice and cheesy with a portion size that could feed 2 people. I also ordered a bellini, which was decent. One high point was the service, which was excellent. Overall, the price you pay at the end of the day is for the view rather than the food.",,,

Also no reservations for brunch as it is first come first served. While the food is not outstanding, the atmosphere and view is great. You're here for the view not the food. Had the quiche Lorraine which came with a nice salad with an excellent dressing. Service was great.  It's a neat experience to be able to dine in Central Park. Will I be back on my next visit?

I've lived in New York for about 4 years, live close to the park and have walked by here dozens of times.  Having tried most of the city's tourist spots and usually disappointed, I went in for brunch not expecting much outside of a scenic view.  This place was great! The service was great and both waiters really friendly. We had eggs Benedict and the quiche, both were good. Like other people have mentioned, the drinks are a little pricey but given you are sitting in the middle of Central Park, to be expected. They don't take reservations on Saturdays so if you don't want to wait, they suggested getting there before 10 which we did and were seated immediately. They were on a wait by the time we left. Overall, if the weathers nice out, this is a cute little place to add to your NYC to do list.",,,
58,Chelsey F.,"New York, NY",66,130,44,3.0,5/14/2018,"Have been here on several occasions and most of the experiences have been favorable. The food is better than Tavern on The Green and the restaurant setting is very picturesque. It's obvious that this is a desirable dining destination so a wait can be expected. When we arrived today, they said it would be 45 minutes. We were understanding of the wait and decided we could grab a cocktail/ appetizer at the bar to hold us over. To our surprise they did not offer any food at all at the bar! Even if they offered a very limited bar menu- that would have sufficed. To expect guests to wait nearly an hour and not even have the option of ordering an appetizer is very unusual and would lead us not to return.",,,

Well, upon arriving, all the windows were open. NO AIR CONDITIONING !!!  It was extraordinarily hot. We spoke to the manager, who told us the owner would not put a/c on. We were soooo uncomfortable.

Both dishes were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The best thing about this place is the ambience, you are in the middle of Central Park staring out at the water and it could not be a more magical spot.

62,Ajae R.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,61,182,4.0,7/20/2017,"Came to Loeb Boathouse to rent a boat on July 15, Saturday night. On their website, it says ""open until sundown,"" so I wasn't completely sure when that was and decided to try my luck. Unfortunately they stopped their rentals at 7:30 that night. My husband and I came right before noon the next day and there was a line, but it moved very quickly. It is $35 up front for one hour, cash only, but you do get $20 back once you return the boat in one piece. We were short one dollar, but thankfully the person behind us gave us one (thank you, kind stranger!) If you go early in the day during summer, you should definitely remember to bring some sunblock. There will be no shade at all. It also gets very crowded, and some areas get difficult to steer through due to other boaters. The fountain and bridge make for a beautiful backdrop for pictures, and we had a lot of fun! There were also turtles swimming and laying on the rocks.Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to New York.",4,1,

I let the hostess know who in turn lets the waitress know what I said.  She comes to me with an attitude that she's busy and they have other sinks elsewhere to wash hands. I told her that I don't know that and I didn't appreciate her cutting us in the restroom. She said she's too busy and that's why she cuts us off.  She had a horrible attitude and I hope management takes note of this lady's attitude.,5,,

We had the crab cakes, beef tartar, burrata cheese, and octopus for appetizers-- Each equally delicious. As my main course, I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked at the right texture and the cheesecake for dessert.

My boyfriend and I were visiting my brother and sister-in-law, but they were still fairly new to the area as well having never been to this restaurant. Mariola recommended multiple places for us to go on our visit which was very sweet of her.

My girls loved the breads (and feeding it to the turtles and fish). I ordered a salmon dish that was quite good. Both girls ordered hamburgers and they really barely touched them. My only complaint is that I felt a bit pressured by the waitstaff like they expected us to order more, spend more money, get more alcohol, etc... I feel like it is a moderately priced restaurant trying too hard to be upscale. Just be what you are.",,,

(I usually eat things plain - no butter, no salt)Ole got the chicken with asparagus, peas and potatoes.  I had a taste of chicken and asparagus - very tasty. I glanced at everyone else's dish and drinks as they passed by and they all looked delicious and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves... not one frowny face in the crowd.It ended up being $65 for our food, including one beer, tax and tip.

We stayed at the bar for our drinks to enjoy the views and do some people watching but ordered burgers from the express cafe to go to enjoy it on the grassy knolls of the park. Burgers were tasty despite being made ahead of time and sitting under a hot lamp kind of like at a fast food joint. I guess this is to save time. I didn't realize there were other food options in the park (I'm not outdoorsy and never really do parks) but I'm pretty sure anywhere you go here will be on the more expensive side.

When we booked our reservation we were told that the restaurant was air conditioned. When we arrived at 7:30 PM it was a sweltering 93 degrees. We complained to the maître d' and we were told that the owner will not turn on the A/C system, it is too costly. Employees also complained about the excessive heat as well as fellow diners.

I think it's worth it for the great view and the good service. I had the eggs Benedict with the Irish smoked bacon and it was one of the best eggs Benny I've ever had. The egg was perfectly poached, the hollandaise wasn't too thick, the meat was tasty, the English muffin was perfectly toasty.

87,Jeff W.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,33,14,4.0,11/20/2017,"The Boathouse brunch is always good. Prices for entrees are in line (starting around $16) with other New York spots and better than some, and the view is great. The Boathouse doesn't take brunch reservations so in peak season, be there around 9:15 to get in without waiting long. It opens at 9:30. The Boathouse also has a casual side with indoor and outdoor seating. The best seats are in the more formal area overlooking the lake. The Loeb will close for renovations around Jan. 20, 2018, so check in advance around then before going. The omelet of the day is always a good choice and it includes a root-vegetable salad, which sounds a bit odd but is a good accompaniment. The Boathouse is a tourist spot, but that's not always a bad thing. It's popular with locals too, and the restaurant, the lake and that area of Central Park have been used in many TV shows and movies.",1,,

I had the monkfish Medallions and Seared Hamachi the Hamachi was definitely something I wish I had more of but it was a good amount to start off with. Definitely would recommend.,1,,
95,Mindy L.,"Boston, MA",152,757,302,4.0,6/13/2016,"Honestly, I don't understand the negative reviews. My sister and I had brunch here on a Saturday morning. We didn't have reservations, but there wasn't wait. We sat out on the beautiful patio overlooking the lake. There was a lovely breeze that kept us cool even in the 80+ degree heat. We shared the tuna ceviche appetizer. I would like to eat one of these every day. The ingredients are so fresh. There is just the right amount of acid and a little heat. Each bite was delicious.I decided on the smoked salmon benedict and my sister ordered the challah french toast. All the serving sizes are generous. We both cleaned our plates and couldn't find a thing that we disliked. For coffee fanatics like myself, they also have an iced cappucino that I would highly recommend. The service was attentive, quick and kind. The space was clean and airy. Our experience proved that there is quality going on in the kitchen as well. Great spot!",3,,
96,Ben W.,"Lehi, UT",228,185,171,4.0,11/4/2016,"CASH ONLYThis was a pretty fun little excursion with my fiancee. It was almost silly trying to row (TRYING) and watching others try as well. There were so many near misses and even direct hits between the boats, but it was funny all around.If you don't want to continue paying for time, but want to see certain parts around the lake, you'll have to traverse your way through the millions of other seafarers to get to the spots you're interested in. We went out into a main part of the lake where there were a lot less people (so many people near the rental spot and Bethesda Terrace!) and it was a bit more relaxed...that is until we saw the time and rushed back to return our boat!If you don't care about continuing to pay more money then just relax on a nice day out on the lake in the middle of a giant city!",,,
97,Terri Lee S.,"Ipswich, MA",1,132,1,2.0,3/3/2018,"While planning a short trip to NYC we wanted to go to the Boathouse for Saturday Brunch. After no success booking a table on open tables we tried to call several time as suggested by the website.  We assumed the place was booked but we went over anyway so see if we could get a table. When we got there there was a sign that said ""Closed for Renovations"". No where on the web site or on their phone message was it mentioned that the place was closed.  Might be nice if Loeb's updated their website.  The outdoor cafe was a poor substitution so we chose to find another place.

I must say the salmon was super fresh and tasty. Nicely baked and you could feel the freshness of the fish with every bite.My friend ordered the Omelette of the day with Market Vegetables with chives and she liked it as well.From a price standpoint this place is certainly on the higher side but for the overall experience food, ambience and view I think it's worth it.",5,,

A warm breeze greeted us as we looked at the other people rowing boats as we ate. The menu is pricey, but in my opinion, you get so much for your money. The dishes are lovely and delicious. Staff was nice. Even with the long wait and expensive menu, I am still giving this place a 5 star review.

106,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,3.0,4/24/2016,"Food was average, but very pricey. And that's not surprising because you're paying for the location and views. My shrimp pasta was heavy on the sauce and the shrimp were completely dried out, almost to the point of being inedible, but I ate it because I was hungry. The menu was very limited. Not more than ten options total between appetizers and entrees. My red wine was too acidic and maybe had been sitting in an open bottle too long. Views are definitely superior in the daytime - at nighttime, it's just completely dark and you can't see anything, so if you're trying to impress your date, bring them for brunch/lunch. Restaurant itself is classy, servers are very professional and courteous. They were kind enough to bring separate checks for every two people because we had a very large party. I wouldn't discourage you from coming here if you really want to, as it is a cool location and fun to do once, but if you're a discriminating foodie and want the most bang for your buck, then this may not be the place for you.",1,1,1

We decided to rent some bikes and head to central park. What better way to spend the day, than bike in the park and then gorge on the food at The Loeb Boathouse. The wait was for about 20 mins which was expected. We had some hot cider whilst we waited. The complimentary pumpkin, cinnamon bread was good. We had the Omlette of the Day with market vegetables. Well done the way i like it and toasted bagels. The Salmon was fresh and delicious. The view of the lake is spectacular and the soft piano playing in the background adds to the mood.

Updated review","Entered this restaurant 8/6/18 at 6 pm with party of 4 and a 2 year old for dinner. Idiot jackass guy at the door inside the restaurant told us we can't be seated unless we order entrees, and window tables were for reservations.  All the window tables were empty.  Did that jackass think we were only going to order water because we were Asians?  I saw a similar posting by another Asian about this restaurant.  I think that a bunch of racist work there.  We walked out of that outhouse of a restaurant....",,,
115,Tanya S.,"Garden Grove, CA",58,17,8,5.0,8/8/2017,The Branzino was wonderful especially with a glass of Sancerre and the walnut cranberry bread. The best place to spend a summer evening in NYC!,1,,
116,Tara S.,"Manhattan, NY",75,22,33,4.0,11/8/2017,"I came here for an early dinner in September. The menu is pricey but worth every penny. From the taste, to the presentation, to the atmosphere and beautiful views. This restaurant exceeded my expectations. It is sooo beautiful inside and outside. Our waiter was kind enough to give us seating right in the front overlooking the river. I ordered the salmon with roasted almonds in sauce with spinach and it was amazing. The only disappointment was that for the price you're paying on the meals, the portions are small. So don't come here starving unless you have a small appetite. Nonetheless, I loved this place and will be back.",,,

120,Edelyn C.,"Houston, TX",384,161,611,4.0,1/18/2016,"Crab cake. A must! It's probably on my top 2 list for crab cakes and I don't say that lightly. Delicious, filled with crab meat and mouth watering. The pumpkin bread that they initially  serve to you is also very good. It's not too sweet and would be perfect with an afternoon coffee.We tried their Mac n Cheese, which was also tasty. The amount of cheese they put in there is perfect.As excited as we were after the appetizers, the actual meal we had for brunch was disappointing. The eggs Benedict lacked flavor, their ""steak"" was not the steak we were used to (Texas native) and the omelet lacked flavor as well.Our appetizers really outshined our actual meals but definitely worth going back for! Not to mention, the view is amazing!",1,,1

124,Meg O.,"New York, NY",0,20,17,5.0,8/1/2018,"Hosting our reception at the Boathouse was one of the best decisions we made! From the moment we toured the Lake Room and the lakeside patio, we knew it was the place for us! It is truly an iconic, unique venue within the heart of Central Park and Manhattan. The Boathouse was recently repainted and the floors were redone, and it's never looked better! The views of the lake, Central Park's lush greenery, and the skyline is one not to be missed! Your guests will be in awe of the surroundings. We had the pleasure of meeting both Peter and James and ultimately used Peter for our wedding planning process. Peter knows his stuff - he's on top of everything (tastings, layouts, etc.). He had also worked with the majority of our vendors before so coordination between the vendors and venue was easy! Our guests raved about how amazing the passed hors d'oeuvres, appetizer, salad, and entrée were (thanks to the wonderful chef Ramzi)! Harold, the maître d, was on top of the timeline and coordinated the entire evening with ease. Every single thing about our cocktail hour and reception was perfect. I wouldn't have changed a single detail. I can't thank Peter, James, Ramzi and Harold enough for their hard work. It was truly the best night of our lives. Thank you!!!",,,

The food is good, but it isn't great. They come around with a very nice bread selection to start off (would be better served warm). The crab cakes are delicious. I had the salmon this year and that was pretty tasty, but the sauce was kind of odd. My friend ordered the vegetarian dish. Everything on his plate was the same color (white-ish) and we couldn't really tell what it was. He didn't eat it. I got chocolate cake for dessert and it was very dry but the other 2 were pretty good. Our server was excellent, attentive, and very personable. Besides the food not being 5 star, The Boathouse is really lacking in decorations. You guys should hire an interior decorator for the holidays! The inside itself is beautiful, but for holiday decorations they only had 2 large garlands hanging from the ceiling and that was about it. The place needs more lights, and considering how fancy NYC gets during the holidays I think The Boathouse really needs to step it up. The tree on the pond is also really dinky and should be 3x that size, again with more lights to make it a focal point. The view of the pond is beautiful, but when you look out of the window and see a dinky little tree that looks like no effort was put in to decorate it, it kind of ruins the view.",2,,
128,Zoë H.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,102,206,5.0,10/21/2016,"I went boating a few days ago with my boyfriend and OMG it was so fun! It's only $15 to rent the boat on the lake for 1 hour, any time after that is $3 an hour which is a great deal in my opinion.You have to leave a $20 deposit in case anything happens go the boat which is totally understandable. The line moves fairly quickly given how many people are standing in line I was surprised! Once you get on the water it's fun to take pictures with the lush scenery and green mossy water. The lake you boat on is alongside the Bethesda fountain and many bridges with people walking over the top. It's very romantic if you're looking for a good date, go for it, it's worth it!",4,1,1

The hour derves came at a good rate and have a good variety ..chicken skewers, smoked salmon, crab cakes, etc. The crab cakes were probably my favorite. The view is gorgeous at night, there are christmas lights hanging everywehre and a christmas tree floating on a boat outside.. how cute is that? It was a little disappointing that with such a big bar they didn't have mojito or amaretto sour, I ended up with a manhattan that was way too strong for me and gave that to my coworker. Evenutally after a few random drink tries i got a sex on the beach that was just right.  I can see why so many people come here for their wedding. If it wasn't so cold I would definitely step outside to enjoy the view. I took one star off because the hot dishes were pretty cold and i did not enjoy freezing salmon and asparagus on such a cold day..and another star for the limited variety of drinks... My company holds their annual christmas party here every year so hopefully next year will be better! CHEERS!",1,,

137,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",216,448,2742,3.0,9/23/2015,"I came here when my sister was visiting me from England. She had seen it in so many films and specifically asked if we could visit. I had reserved a table and on arrival We were seated immediately & one table back from the water so we were happy. We were given the drinks menu which included only wine by the bottle. I asked if they could do wine by the glass & was given the bar menu. Prices were reasonable considering the location. Our drinks arrived- mine with a side of pink lipstick!! I noticed immediately and requested a different glass. The complimentary bread was delicious, I had the cranberry bread, I would have loved a second piece! For our main dishes, I ordered the steak with potatoes and carrots. I requested the steak medium, but it came out well done and kind of burnt, so was difficult to cut and was kind of chewy. There was also a lack of potato, with about 2 wedge size pieces on the plate. I was really disappointed! The presentation wasn't great either, it came out on a plate filled with fat and meat juices. My sister ordered the twin burgers and seemed happy enough, although she requested the burgers be cooked rare and they were also well done, medium at best. From my view they didn't look like the best burger buns either. For dessert we asked our server for a bit more information on all the dishes as the descriptions were fairly brief. He couldn't really provide much info and when I asked about the peanut butter dessert he said it is just like a snickers bar?? Regardless, I did order the peanut butter tart for dessert and it was really good, the best part of the meal. I'm a bit disappointed with our over all experience, I had higher expectations. Service was fairly MIA throughout the meal, apart from water which was constantly replenished. The views of course were amazing, but the food just isn't up to par in my opinion. Maybe for such a beautiful and popular setting they don't feel like the food is as important? Or maybe they think everyone is a tourist and won't return anyway.",4,,
138,Jessica C.,"Bellmore, NY",191,139,238,1.0,7/3/2017,"First off, this is not the kind of places my husband and I can dine as we're both MASSIVELY in debt thanks to grad school (yay education!). HOWEVER, we wanted to celebrate our one month anniversary and my getting a full time job, and his. So we called and made reservations to sit by the window and we're assured the time slot would allow us to sit by the water. We arrived 2 minutes before our reservation despite pouring rain and walking up Central Park from midtown. We get seated at the inner region of the restaurant NOT the window as we specified. We asked if we could wait until a window seat opened up but we're told we'd lose our reservation. We told our hostess and she said that was considered a window seat -.0 .. to which I responded yea just like an aisle seat on a plane is a window seat, just because I can see the window doesn't mean it's adjacent to it. Anyways we ordered food and tried not to let the seating bother us. We had two waiters (one being trained and one training) and let's say the new waiter was a world of a lot nicer, whereas the old waiter ignored our request for additional bread (considering the prices I don't think we asked much). The new waiter told us of the fish we ate and is background and what dishes we're unique to the boat house. All in all we had a good time and tried new foods that were ok but nothing I would come back for and considering the attitude with the service we didn't miss much. I'd much rather spend my hard earned money on a mom and pop restaurant that treats everyone fairly and do their best to accommodate others than than go to a place that brushes you aside for old money New Yorkers in the area that frequent the restaurant",,,

It was a gorgeous sunny day, we put our names in for a table and had drinks at their outdoor bar while we waited. But oh the prices...watch out. It started with the $19 glass of champagne and ended with the $25 something mini burgers.If you're going to spend the money here, get the crab cake - all lump crab, no filler, simple and delicious. Probably the only thing on the menu worth the dollar amount they charge (though it's pretty small in the realm of crab cakes).

On a nice day, very picturesque with especially great photo ops near the bridge. There is a $20 deposit so be aware of that. You get it back at the end though as long as you're back on time - although I have no idea how they track time. Maybe it's the honor system but I never saw anyone jotting anything down or keeping any sort of timer. A must in NYC in the fall.",1,,

They made sure we were comfortable as we were traveling with our 7 month old daughter. They walk around with a tray filled with many varieties of delicious fresh bread! They also made sure our water was always filled to the rim. They recommended the crab cake and striped bass so we went ahead and ordered that.The view during our lunch is beautiful. We sat right over the pond and could see people paddling from the boats.

I visited the cafe this past afternoon, and was pleasantly surprised to find an affordable lunch in the middle of Central Park that was under $20! My friend and I shared an order of fries, a fresh turkey sandwich on cranberry-nut bread, and some turkey chowder. I drank a small hot chocolate in the process and found that the drink itself was not the best and tasted like it had come from a machine. The sandwich and fries were definitely worth a return visit to the cafe alone. It appeared to me that all meals were made to order, and that excited me! I'll return to the cafe in the future!",,,

Didn't bother to ask after the fact and was annoyed when we didn't want dessert. All made sense when we received the bill with a built in 15% gratuity. Unacceptable. I understand it's touristy location, but servers should be held to a high standard if they're guaranteed a tip. We would have happily added additional tip had he made any effort. Given his level of service we would have wanted to not tip him or maybe 10% at most. I was tempted to dispute the tip with management but such a confrontation would have ruined an otherwise lovely anniversary celebration. The bread guy was far more charming and classy by the way!Food was fine, tasty and well presented etc. what I expected so was pleased. View/ambiance can't be beat. Really lovely. Side note, I feel like a certain dress code should be required. It ruins the ambiance of this classy establishment. Should start offering a gluten free menu or be more helpful/accommodating. This could have something to do with our server though.",1,,
149,Christine K.,"Manhattan, NY",36,64,74,4.0,8/21/2016,"The Boathouse is beautifully positioned on the boating lake in my favourite part of NYC... Central Park. I love the park in every season and a visit to the Boathouse is a pleasure anytime. The usual visit involves visiting the cafe and enjoying a coffee overlooking the boating lake may it be full of people rowing in circles or covered in ice! Always a treat. The cafe area isn't as well positioned as the restaurant or the bar area but it suits my needs when out for a stroll. I have the restaurant on my wish list and will get there sometime, it looks stunning! The Boathouse cafe does well, it provides snacks at very reasonable prices and considering the huge number of people frequenting the place it keeps itself fairly up together. It isn't as smart or as organised as the said restaurant/bar but I like to relax there and now I can take my newborn all year round too! It's a great spot to pop into during a visit to the park to take the weight off your feet for a moment... Enjoy!",1,,1

Views of the pond are pretty and worth the extra $5-10 per dish you'll be paying to share this moment with 600 of your closest tourist friends. If you're thinking of boating, get yourself a dinghy and work those arms to earn your meal.It was a schlep to cut through the 30,000 people participating in the Aids Walk, but we got there eventually (thanks, Google Maps, for making me a tourist in my own city every damn day).Our wait wasn't too bad at 10:30 am (maybe 15-20 minutes until our pager went off), though I suspect it gets a lot worse for lunch and dinner. The service was friendly though food took forever to bring out. If you look around, you'll see why. It is just FULL. But it's full of out-of-towners, so they're for the most part well-behaved and won't disrupt your meal with strident nonsense conversations.We got coffees and juices as it was well before noon on Sunday, and survived without booze. For foodstuffs, I had the Benedict with lox, which was well executed. Among the bevy of plates on our table, one boasted scrumptious-looking French toast. Make that your second choice.",4,4,3

We had to manipulate order on expensive side for the kiddos. Once sat, ordered from 2017 spring menu.

My dessert while amazing was very chocolaty for my taste - but that was my problem in ordering!! If you go for brunch on the weekend - people this is NYC - you have to line up for almost everything in peak times. In regard to it being touristy - again - this in NYC - one of the most visited places in the world - so again yes there will be tourists - due to the picturesque location - people want to go here!!!

Me and my wife went here on a late Thursday night just before Sundown. Sitting by the water was very soothing and relaxing. However, everything went downhill from there. The servers were pretty rude, the bread was average / stale. Their ceviche was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. And then came the main course.  I ordered their scallops (which was the special of the day) my wife ordered some kind of chicken dish. The scallops were gross, seared incorrectly with a poor complement of vegetables. The vegetables tasted like they came from a can. The grilled chicken breast was good, but not as good as the chicken at Costco. To top it all off, one of the servers was pretty darn rude. Didn't refill our water, and gave us a rude look when asked for more bread. Honestly, I spent over a hundred bucks here, whats some bread really going to cost you. Geez. I'm sure if I had a friendlier server, I could have dealt with the subpar food.",1,,
158,Caroline K.,"New York, NY",164,10,0,1.0,8/23/2017,"Wish I could give this restaurant 5 stars, but the service was absolutely terrible. I have been here a few times, mainly for events/galas and I found the staff to be rather rude, but was willing to give it another shot as my cousin and his wife booked a reservation for dinner.First off, it took 15 minutes after our reservation time to get seated (and we were 15 minutes early before our reservation time). First off, no water for the first 20 minutes - asked three times for it. Then had to ask for bread three times (no exaggeration). Asked for a Rye Whiskey on the rocks - they delivered my cousin and his wife's drinks first (15 minutes after ordering them), then did not say why they didn't bring mine. I asked for my drink and the waiter said they're out of my whiskey. Why not say that when you place the drink order? Waited another 10 minutes for my new drink (a bourbon whiskey on the rocks). I get a small pour and it's neat, no ice. Then have to ask for ice - instead of bringing ice they remove my drink and bring it  back another 10 minutes later!!! So we order entrees with sides. Everyone's order comes with a side except mine - they drop the orders and leave in haste. I hail a waiter down and ask for my entree's side dish. They said ""it's coming right up,"" which is a lie since it comes 20 minutes later and I'm already finished with my pork loin. So irritating beyond words!!! Believe the terrible reviews - the food is mediocre at best and the service does suck. And if you eat there at night in the summer you will be eaten by mosquitoes and have them land in your bread butter - we had 3 alone! Not worth it - eat outside the park. I've lived in NYC for 7 years and by far this is the crappiest service I've ever encountered. Don't do it. Go elsewhere!",2,1,1

I can't even figure out what kind of octopus it is! It doesn't taste like octopus and yet it doesn't taste like anything at all. I did not know what I was truly eating aside from the fact that It looks like octopus. The pasta dish is horrendous. The pasta is soggy, and the cream sauce is bland and tasteless. You need to put a lot of salt and pepper to taste. Nice place horrible food. It's really catered to tourists. Because at the end of the day tourists pay anything for the location.

Updated review","I keep coming back to the crab cakes every time. I've tried crabcakes all throughout the country, including tiny fisherman villages, and still nothing can beat this place. Despite the cost for two medium sized crabs cakes and it being very touristy, they just do it right. I was disappointed when we couldn't get a reservation, so we crossed our fingers and tried our luck just before noon. Luckily we were able to get a table right away. We weren't right by the pond but close enough and we beat the crowd so I was happy. Husband got the chicken salad which was also a excellent choice. I wanna try other restaurants because there's just so many culinary adventures in the city and so little time. But with a solid experience at Loebs it's hard to pass it up.",,,

Almost all of the two-tops are across the aisle from the window seats, but we still could enjoy the iconic view.  The element you won't recognize from movies or pictures is the intense mildew odor.  At some point, food smells masked it, but they really need to gut the place or work on the air filtration.  Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food - my pot of herbal tea was made with a strainer of leaves, the bus/bread boy came by a couple of times with a generous assortment (none of which was warm), and the presentation was lovely. The Grilled Portobello Salad contained so many bleu cheese chunks, that I used some as a bread spread - good deal at $14, but the Jumbo Crab Cake at $20 lacked in size for the East Coast.  I liked the texture and sweetness the pumpkin added to the huge cuts of paccheri pasta in a braised short rib ragu.  They added on a 15% gratuity though the menu says that's for parties of 6 or more.  Nevertheless, the Boathouse could easily be a tourist trap, and we were so happy to find it a legitimate restaurant and wonderful NYC experience.",5,1,4
168,Anju M.,"Manhattan, NY",21,144,120,3.0,8/16/2016,"If you have time to spare for brunch, this is the place. The Boathouse doesn't take reservations on the weekend, so a typical wait time lasts about half an hour. Thankfully, our table was ready after the 15 minutes we spent grabbing (pricey) mimosas at the bar outside. They give you a buzzer for the table, but when you show up to the hostess desk, they seem frantic and disorganized. We waited a few minutes before one hostess took us to our seats because we were cut off by other people trying to put their names on the list. Kudos to their impeccable view of The Lake with gondolas mimicking those in Venice. The floor-to-ceiling Windows really illuminate the entire dining space with natural light. Also, their eggs benedicts come with a generous serving of steamed veggies that aren't your typical garden salad greens.Three stars for these two things. Otherwise, service was understandably slow during peak brunch hour, and their prices don't reflect that or the above-average quality of the food.",,,

When we sat down our friends had already ordered 3 appetizers: jumbo lump crab cake, hand cut steak tartare and the Berkshire prosciutto buratta. Wow, wow, wow! Everything was so, so good!! The 3 other people I ate with loved everything as well. The crab cake had large chunks of meat, the spicy mustard sauce that came with the tartare was delectable! Before the apps came we ordered our entrees. For our entrees my husband and I split the twin boathouse burgers with hand cut fries. This ended up being the perfect amount for us! A miniature burger with cheese and delicious fries. It also came with three different dipping sauces, one of which tasted like a chipotle ranch that was my favorite. The service was wonderful, our waiter was so nice and attentive. He recommended a chardonnay that my friend loved.

We stopped in after a walk through the park looking for a nice cold drink. We ended up at the bar and felt grossly under dressed (we were in shorts and t-shirts). There were an array of folks in fancier clothing as well as the mob of tourists and locals that were dressed like us. The staff didn't seem to discriminate.The place itself seemed to be un-air-conditioned. It was a hot day and it was pretty hot inside LB too.

178,Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",214,161,131,3.0,2/15/2016,"Classy, upscale restaurant on the banks of the Central Park lake. - FOOD: The food is honestly the biggest weakness of this restaurant, because you can't beat the location. I came with a group of colleagues here, and we all found the dishes to be less than expected, given the upscale decor and prices. I had the wasabi tofu, because even though I find wasabi repellant, it was just about the only vegetarian entree. It was essentially just a large piece of mostly unseasoned tofu, so it left something to be desired. The desserts were good - we tend to order and share as a table - and our favorites were the blueberry crepes and banana tart.- FOR THE VEGGIES: There are limited vegetarian options. I wouldn't recommend the tofu, as noted above, and would likely try a salad if I were to return.- SERVICE: Our service was attentive and quick, and very friendly.- ATMOSPHERE: This is the best part - if nothing else, you should come to the boathouse for the view and the setting.

So without going into too much detail, here's the overview. Brunch opens at 9:30 and is an a la carte menu- a little pricey but as expected. You're looking at over $20 per person assuming you don't order any of the usual brunch beverages...I had a pineapple juice. When we arrived it was pouring rain. We wanted to take our tourist friends from Germany figuring they'd appreciate a nicer experience versus the hustle and bustle in times square. We were all well dressed since we expected it be a nicer country club feel. The minute we were seated, he was asked to remove his new York cap in the dining room...this would have been okay if about ten minutes later we wouldn't have had a group of 7 runners all wearing gym clothes and baseball caps seated next to us...who never removed theirs! Only white linens so do not dare place on your lap if you are wearing dark colors... Portions are quite large and were tasty although the menu is not as varied as I thought it would be. View is a plus plus and table settings and ambience tends to be on the fancier side.After the meal we were told of a complimentary shuttle thats supposed to come around for a small tour of the park however it never showed up and we waited over 30 minutes outside for it meanwhile it poured rain. The girl in the front was clueless and lame. She did nothing to help and just gave us the um face the whole time aka the dumb look as she texted on her phone. This in turn weakened the experience for us and I'd probably not care to return. I do recommend however trying it at least once so you can say been there done that and check it off the bucket list.",4,,1

187,Allison B.,"Westwood, NJ",386,220,452,4.0,9/12/2014,"I used to come here all the time as a kid with my grandfather - the Boathouse was his favorite (probably because it has that country club feel, and he was the ultimate country club guy). He used to get a bunch of gin and tonics (great babysitting), and we'd spend hours there, then walk around the Park. It's not a cheap place, but come on - it's in the middle of Central Park, overlooking the water and the boats (which makes for some solid people watching). It's also not that expensive, given the experience that you're having (especially if you are going there with people from out of town, or if you're a tourist to the city!). I came in August with some blogging friends from out of town, and a few from the city (we were a group of 6). We first got some drinks ($14 cocktails, which again, isn't terrible for our location in the city) which were weak, but it is what it is (wine next time!). We waited for 5/6 of our party to come before we were seated, overlooking the water, which was absolutely gorgeous. The experience of the Boathouse is fantastic - you have your choice of bread from the server (seven grain, thank you very much), service is pretty good, and the ambiance is really special. I had to leave early that night, so I asked for a separate check, which they graciously agreed to do for me so that I could leave as soon as I finished. There weren't a ton of options of things that as a vegetarian I could eat, so I ordered a few different appetizers versus an entire entree. The kale salad was delicious - the dressing on it was really fantastic. All of the entrees were a good portion size from what I saw when my friends ordered, and most entrees were $25-35, which again, isn't terrible for being in the heart of the Park and the scenery around you. Overall, definitely a place to bring out of towners, or to visit if you're a tourist looking for gorgeous views of Central Park. I won't make it out of my way to go there though, unless I have friends/family visiting the city.",4,,3

189,James V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,3,5.0,10/5/2017,"Our first stop each year during our New York trip. Straight from the plane.   Peaceful setting even with many others customers present.  The pond with all the rowboats provides a visual activity that is pleasing.  Being met by Al, the Maitre d' is always fun. He has a wonderful presence and remembers your name.  Our server, Eddie, was conversant, friendly, and professional.  Both really make you feel special and welcome. The Seared Chicken with Grilled Brussels Sprouts and Potato Puree was filling and delicious.  My wife had the Vegetable Plate was a tasteful mix of Eggplant, Oyster Mushrooms, Butternut Squash, and Red Peppers.  Very Tasty.  We'll be back",,,
190,Ramin S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,0,3.0,4/6/2018,It's great if you wanna enjoy a beautiful view of the water and Central Park . The food is just average  and the prices are high .,,,
191,Cat M.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,83,185,5.0,9/19/2015,"A beautiful activity to try while in New York !Now that the temperature is cooling down its a perfect time to grab your lover/ friend/ mom/ dad/ grandma/ grandpa/ whoever and take a ride on the boats. It's cheaper than you'd expect for NYC and the scenery is breath taking. The line moved quickly as we waited to get on a boat . The assistance pushed us off after we showed our ticket. The fist couple of minutes are chaotic -- bumper boats. But other than that you're free rowing! My boyfriend and I rowed towards a concert that was playing on land and just chilled from the boat . There was also tiny turtles that would peak their heads up every so often. ( i know , you think how could anything live in that nasty water ) For children they give life jackets but for adults you're not obligated to wear it . I believed the boathouse is open till October and I recommend you visit now since the weather won't get you all sweaty as you sit drifting away. This was a perfect spot for a picture too! So if you're looking for a nice photo  this is  the place to go ! Put it on your bucket list nyc!",4,2,2

193,Angela K.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,25,12,1.0,10/10/2016,"This review is for the cafe on the side. Just witnessed two hostesses get in a screaming fight for about 10 minutes in front of customers. No one got the manager until us customers requested that someone get a manager.The manager proceeds to come out and yell at the two hostesses in front of us as well instead of pulling them to the back. The staff is only as good as the managers, I guess.",2,1,
194,Jan P.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",35,315,318,4.0,8/23/2014,"British colonial ambiance. Slow turning ceiling fans, wicker back chairs, white table cloths, view of pond, real piano player in bar area with leather armchairs. Such a lovely atmosphere open to Central Park pond. Service was wonderful. All extras accommodated. Here for brunch with fam. Had eggs Benedict with spinach, quiche Lorraine, smoked fish platter and challah French toast with gran marnier banana compote. 100% maple syrup-warmed-in boathouse personalized bottle. Everything was very good. I would definitely return. It was $140 with tip and cocktails, no dessert or coffee.",2,,
195,Natalie M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,55,10,1.0,7/25/2017,"This place is beautiful but the bar and cleanliness off staff areas are so disgustingly dirty. On top of it the customer service here is horrible. Asking someone for a menu gets you dirty looks and an attitude as if none of them wanted to come to work that day. Food is just ok, drinks are better. Could be a case of bad management, I understand because of the location they will always have business but treating customers as if they are nothing and acting bothered to serve is unnecessary and should be discussed with the board of Central Park!",,,

Updated review","FOOD POISONING!!! BEWARE!So sad I used to love coming here :( I took my mother while she was visiting from Florida. I was really excited to come. Unfortunately they've changed some of their policies. We came around lunchtime and were refused seating near the windows, even though there was adequate seating available. We proceeded to order an appetizer which was just absolutely tiny with huge price tag. I had ordered the cedar plank salmon, which came out completely RAW!! Uncooked! I realized this after I took a bite! Yuk!!! They took it back to the kitchen to re cook, which I hate! Did not remove it from my bill.... On top of that he had the audacity to add gratuity. Really???And to put the cherry on top of it I got food poisoning!!!! Needless to say I will be giving my credit card company a call! And filing a report with the health department!!!!Very unfortunate this is one of my favorite places in the city. Management you really need to step up your game, just because you're a tourist spot doesn't mean you need to neglect your patrons! Shame on you!",1,,
197,Foo D.,"Roanoke, TX",2,19,0,2.0,7/28/2017,"Despite attentive service and an amazing view, the food was meh and overpriced for what it was.   We had the salmon and the chicken salad.  I think my favorite part of the meal was the cranberry bread and butter they bring prior to your main course and the ambience.   It was fun to experience, but I don't think we'll be back soon.",,,
198,Cynthia L.,"Manhattan, NY",201,745,1300,4.0,7/8/2015,"BOAT ROWING PRICES:First, you give them a redeemable $20 for security deposit (don't worry, you'll get it back at the end).It's $15 for an hour (up to 4 people per boat). For every 15 minutes over the hour, you'll be charged $3.Let the person who knows how to row sit in the middle of the boat.  Two people who aren't as experienced with rowing but would like to help the middle person steer should sit in the back. As for the very front of the boat, you've guessed it! - it's for that special friend who just wants to sit down and enjoy the ride! But make sure you tell this person to take pictures (with a selfie stick) of the group and/or the scenery...I mean, after all, this person has the best seat in the house! Rowing boats is super romantic as well! Take your significant other rowing and I promise you'll both enjoy it! BIKE RIDING PRICES:$9 for every hour and $5 for every extra 30 minutes. Be careful when riding bikes in Central Park! There are so many tourists walking around with cameras and whatnot, as well as pedestrians...be mindful! Bike carefully.There are also horse buggys and carriages as well as other cyclists.",5,1,1
199,Jordyn R.,"Los Angeles, CA",490,59,21,4.0,7/14/2017,"Fellas take your lady here for a nice boat row in Central Park! I loved this experience although they need to upgrade to card and not be cash only. 5 minutes from reaching the window a guy says cash only, you give us $35 and we give you back the remainder when you return your boat. Right away I was trying to execute a plan as I never have cash on me. I ended up running like the flash to a chase right outside of Central Park to pull out $40 bucks and speeding back while my lady was standing off the side in front of the line waiting for me. I mean you guys could at least have an ATM machine handy. Other than the track race I had to do before enjoying my boat ride to get money to pay for it, it was overall a great experience and it made my girl happy.",,,
