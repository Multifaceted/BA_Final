0,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1723,604,7753,4.0,3/20/2018,"Anotheroom is my fave little low key bar to pop into before I head to a movie at the Roxy Cinema.And I was back again on Friday and this time I put on my glasses. It felt dark in there and I noticed everything! The menu had a great list of craft beers but also a house lager at the affordable price of $4. And then at the corner of my eye I spotted some tiny jars with lids. They sell individual snack jars of Marcona almonds that are seasoned and incredible. They were perfect pair for my beer. And hot tip: the best and cheapest movie theater snack! So happy I was wearing my peepers! The bar is narrow but has a couple tall tables, a group table, some front summer seating and a 10 seater like bar. The art is always kinda fun. This time it was a crushed soda can, some cigarettes and an expandable ruler. If you can make it to happy hour then you can really partake on the deals! *$2 off selected items! This place is CASH ONLY! So bring dough and avoid searching for an ATM and fees.",5,3,6
1,Solstice Travel S.,"New York, NY",40,21,57,5.0,4/10/2018,"Nice cozy place, intimate and dark.  Food is not served here but if you would like a nice place for a first date just to have drinks or to talk this is a good spot.",1,,

3,Frances H.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,38,0,1.0,10/17/2017,One weekend a very disturbed bartender literally ran me out of the bar and threatened me when I ordered a first beer.  I was the only person there and didn't even say anything other than to order.  He threw my money back in my face.  I see other people here have had the same experience.  He was so angry and unstable!  When he threw me out I asked him his name but he refused to say it.  So bizarre.  Beware.,3,,1
4,Chloe G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,58,2,5.0,2/19/2018,"I've been coming here for years and always love it. It's low key, chill and perfect for a date night, or a night out with fiends. I love it because it's not super loud, you can have a conversation with the people you are with, and it's a great vibe. It's a small place, but very cozy and great wine selection. They only serve wine and beer , so if you want hard drinks, this isn't the place for you. But I love it and always bring friends here. Not to mention it's a great hidden gem in TriBeCa",,,
5,Reg B.,"Cork, Republic of Ireland",95,584,75,4.0,4/20/2017,Decent looking bar... quiet the night we visited but the beer was a friendly price and the staff were really nice... kinda industrial interior with pipes and mental tables but it works. The big draw is maybe the outdoor seating where one can watch the world stroll by. An addition to the neighbourhood crawl for sure...,1,,
6,Deirdre L.,"New York, NY",2,56,11,4.0,10/1/2017,"I actually really like this place despite the variable service. I've probably been about 5 times and had one great bartender, the rest were just ok. But I love the ambiance and the music is always great. Pretty chill place to go with a friend and not spend a ton of money. Decent wine and beer selection. There's an outdoor patio, too.",1,,1
7,Nadia M.,"Chula Vista, CA",81,4,0,5.0,11/4/2017,I've only been once but loved the selection of beer and cider. I enjoyed the music and the bartender was very nice (let me charge my phone).,,,
8,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",226,387,698,4.0,8/6/2015,Pretty cool hidden bar out in TriBeCa. Dimly lit with a chill atmosphere. Come here if you're looking for a nice place to grab a drink and chat.BEER AND WINE ONLY! No specialty cocktails or food so don't come looking for anything super fancy.,3,,
9,Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",496,1574,1474,5.0,5/6/2015,"Love this bar. Dark and lit with candles. Great date spot *hint hint*.Went on a weeknight and I was able to get seats. There are couches at the back. I saw some women's legs, she was busy putting her legs across some guy.Good selection of beers and wines. WIll be back.",3,3,1
10,Alex O.,"Manhattan, NY",177,1,0,1.0,7/5/2017,"Long haired bartender was close to if not the worst bartender experience I have ever had in my life. Verbally abused and berated my friend who simply asked for a beer drink and paid with a $5 bill for the cash happy hour for a $5 drink, only to be told ""thanks for the generous tip."" When my friend attempted to explain he planned on getting another drink and tipping at the end the long haired bartender responded ""sorry, that's your last drink."" The bartender then proceeded to run outside after my friend, tear his drink away in public, and then crumple up and throw his money in his face, completely in view of the very few customers surrounding us. Could I give less stars I would. He was a complete embarrassment to the profession and disastrously tainted the opinion on the bar forever. Avoid at all costs. I honestly questioned the man's insanity in the way he responded to a customer who in no way meant disrespect.",9,4,2
11,Kelly H.,"Dallas, TX",51,34,11,5.0,9/28/2015,"This place is tiny, so it's easy to miss, but in the midst of the greatest, most hustle-bustle city in the world, it has an amazing neighborhood charm despite it's cool decor factor. Alex the bartender was adorably congenial, helpful in selecting what to order, and, well... just plain service-oriented! I am born and raised in NY and would recommend this hidden gem for anyone looking for a modern, chic, yet unique and understated gem in the heart of Tribeca!",,,2
12,Will R.,"Portland, OR",99,534,25,1.0,2/27/2016,"It looks way cooler than it actually is, that was my first impression. After asking about a few beers on both their tap list and bottles list I just walked out. They were out of so many beers, which is just frustrating when they leave them on the menu. They had something around 80 combined total beers, they didn't have one stout available. If you're going to have a craft beer bar you'd better have at least one stout on the menu. The people hanging out inside seemed nice, the super hipster bartender was however not in the least bit nice. She almost acted with disdain as I asked about their unavailable beers, and then went back to looking at Facebook on her phone. Given the combination of unavailable beers and poor service I won't be back. It's a pity too because their space looks so inviting.",5,3,
13,Katherine B.,"West New York, NJ",175,146,181,3.0,3/29/2016,Cute little lounge. Kind of too dark for my taste and they aren't open as late as other places in the area. Nice selection of craft beer but nothing out of this world.,1,,
14,Mai W.,"Fort Lee, NJ",81,12,0,4.0,12/31/2016,"It's a rather smaller bar, but it's dark and intimate (based on the other reviews I thought this place would be pitch black or something but honestly it wasn't THAT dark). Perfect for a date or smaller groups. Their music was good (The Smiths, Chvrches, etc). As other reviewers stated, they only serve beer, wine, and a few selections of sake if I remember correctly, as well as some non-alcoholic drinks. Only con was that the drinks that my date and I initially ordered weren't available and they didn't have any signs or marks to indicate that, which would've been helpful.",1,,
15,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,3/30/2014,"Definitely one of my go-to places in Tribeca for during the spring/summer. This is a mix between a dive bar and a low-key lounge, which is probably the best hybrid there is in Manhattan. If you're lucky enough to grab one of the tables outside on a warm, sunny day, you'll feel like you just hit the jackpot. Ain't nothin' like it. You'll have better luck with that if you get there around 5:30pm. It's never terribly crowded, but those outdoor tables are a definitely a hot commodity.The bar in itself is a small space, super dark, candle-lit and intimate, likely better for smaller groups. The crowd is very chill and you won't see There's usually only one bartender, and they don't serve anything except beer, wine, and spirits here, so you should go elsewhere for food. They play some pretty sexy music, and the beer list is pretty impressive. Prices are pretty average ($7-10), but they're nicer beers, so it's not so bad. Also, as there is usually only that one bartender, service can be kind of spotty sometimes, but they're usually very responsive with direct requests. Overall, definitely a spot I'll continue frequently during the warm weather months.",7,,
16,Nik R.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,83,153,4.0,8/1/2015,"Located in the corner of N Moore St and W Broadway. Quiet bar,  only for drinks. Only lighting is by candle light,  warm and cozy feel. Sat outside and enjoyed the view of WTC while enjoying a glass of wine.",1,,1
17,Joe B.,"Atlanta, GA",3,23,0,5.0,5/22/2015,"Loved it at Anotheroom, bartenders were knowledgeable abt their extensive beer list and occasionally laughed at my jokes.  would've given them 6 stars except for the fact that they didn't return my 27 voicemails.",1,4,
18,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,356,4.0,6/25/2013,"All of these Room-related bars have a) great selections, b) good bartenders, c) fantastic soundtracks.  This one is like that but also has some outdoors seating and an open front.  Swell.  - ~$8 for beers.  - $10 minimum for credit cards.",2,1,
19,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245,3.0,2/2/2015,"IN SHORT: Beer and wine are the only staples at this dusky TriBeCa watering hole, related to The Otheroom in the West Village. Nonetheless, the velvet benches and candlelit tables make it a promising spot for a pre-dinner drink with friends or a date in the area.THE STORY: While the drink menu in this dimly lit, narrow space is limited only to a few dozen beers and wine by the glass, guests for happy hour right after work or just before dinner will be able to find an exciting list of seasonal and European brews, in addition to a wine list appropriate to a more established wine bar. Somehow, the bar is never too crowded, and the decibel level is kept to a minimum, promising easier conversation. The result is a lovely corner of the neighborhood made for comfortably classic drinks with just a friend or two.",2,,1
20,Try N.,"New York, NY",1,34,38,5.0,11/3/2013,"My local hang. Bartender Adam's the best; incredibly funny and friendly, knows his beers, great playlist and is a total knowledge bank of anything music! Pick his brain when you're there.Vibe at Anotheroom is unpretentious and perfect for a neighborhood hangout and casual conversations with strangers; dark, industrial, candlelit, great selection of beers. Encountered a few celebrity spottings with their dogs.Love the outdoor seating!",1,,
21,Amelia C.,"Jersey City, NJ",281,248,376,5.0,5/3/2013,"Loved this place! Came here for after-work drinks on a Friday. Fantastic beer selection and a great vibe - unassuming and relaxed outside seating with two picnic tables (good for groups of 4-8 ppl) and a few small tables, and hip and candle-lit on the inside (great seating and standing room, with cute crescent shaped tables and comfy booths lining the walls). The music was great - not for dancing... but just loud enough to make things comfortable, and soft enough to have a nice conversation with your friends without having to shout. Definitely coming back.",2,,
22,Bill D.,"Portland, ME",3,13,5,1.0,11/12/2014,"I don't know what the other yelpers were thinking but this place was bad. The bartender was obnoxious to the point, I asked him if we did something wrong. I had come here because of the write ups on yelp about the happy hour. His response"" I do not control what people put on yelp but we have no happy hour"" the drinks sucked and food was ok. Be warned stay away!!!!!",5,2,3
23,Lori G.,"Danbury, CT",38,116,164,4.0,11/27/2015,"Decent size small bar. Big enough for 10-20 small groups but can still feel intimate. The dark walls, dark doors and low lighting create the intimacy. Hugh's selection of brewery beers and a decent wine selection. Like that they have non alcoholic drinks listed and the prices as well. Bar stool I sat on was broken.  And the service was without a smile that night but could have been an off night. Highly recommend the sister bar - the Other Room in the west village. Slightly small but has a lounge area in the back for groups or cozy dates.",2,1,2
24,Na-Ne M.,"Manhattan, NY",48,112,12,2.0,1/8/2015,"The decor and comfort of the bar is pretty damn good. The service and drinks, on the other hand, need work. The (bad pop) music tends to be too loud to have a conversation and it clashes with the atmosphere you think you have entered. The beer selection is decent but nothing special while the wines are barely drinkable and overpriced for what they're worth.  The bartendress couldn't care less and was very unfriendly.",1,1,
25,Alyssa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,542,28,4.0,1/24/2015,Love this place and its associated bar the other room. Great for meeting up with friends. Lots of beer and wine selection. Dim and cool but not trying too hard. The music is pretty loud so it's not great for intimate conversation.,1,,

27,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,9/17/2012,"I can't get enough of these Room-family lounges. Great beer, great wine, open-air front-end seating with little dark nooks in the back. This one looks busier than its sisters, probably due to its relative proximity to FiDIand the concomitant afterwork crowds. The only thing I could have done without was the smoking at the table right outside since the front of the place is wide open. It didn't bother me, but my friend was right in the path of the billows.Come earlier if you want to sit.",1,1,2
28,Justin W.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",89,252,475,2.0,5/24/2014,"Although they only do wines & beers, they don't seem to carry much stock.

29,Karyn K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,4.0,5/16/2016,Just happened upon this place. It's a lounge vibe with great selection of craft beers. They don't serve food or liquor. They do have wine though. Really chill vibe,,,
30,Kimberly S.,"Honolulu, HI",25,35,10,1.0,8/4/2016,"** BEWARE- Shady happy hour bartender added a $14 tip for himself after I signed my cc receipt (on a $6 beer which I added a $2 tip for)! He seemed high and confused the entire time. I'm not sure he was the only person running the bar during happy hour, which was fairly crowded. Luckily my bank was helpful in getting me a refund but it was a hassle I could have done without. Although this place has potential, it is VERY dark and rundown inside. Will not be returning.",2,1,1
31,Siv L.,"San Francisco, CA",189,822,44,4.0,2/17/2013,"Came here for HH with a large group of friends.

33,Jay S.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,2.0,6/22/2015,"I love this place! but I had a bad experience when I came here with my friends. The bartender wanted to keep my credit card like other places, and I gave her,,the bartender never explained about how they charge when customer deposits their cards. I closed the bill and it was under $10..after 2 days,I checked my bank account,,they charged me $20, so I went to the bar to refund but the manager was on vacation. I left my info to barterder(she was very kind) she told me the manager will contact me after his vacation. I couldn't hear anything from manager even I left my phone#, I went to there again with a receipt and luckily the manager was there. what a hassle!! He explained about their system...blah blah blah..He told me he will contact the company and will refund. yes, I got refund $20 kindly. However, this experience made me make yelp account.Be careful!

35,Chas K.,"Boston, MA",206,370,12,5.0,6/30/2013,"A fantastic list of craft beer on draught, sassy and upbeat bartender (Megan), charcoal grey walls that give the illusion that the bar is only half a deep as it really is and protects you from prying eyes on the street ;) , candlelight, avant garde music and a huge, clean bathroom. Very New York. Very cool. Very much on my ""must return"" list. I was there two consecutive nights. Please let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below. Thanks.",7,1,2
36,Jackson S.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,17,0,5.0,5/16/2015,"Alessandra (Alex) is the most attentive, kind,  and swift bartender I've ever seen working solo on a Saturday. I was wandering through TriBeCa killing a couple of hours and she was conversational without being invasive.The bar itself is cozy and modern. A large screen displays video along with music at the bartender's whim. For me it was surfing footage with Led Zep. I casually mention my two beers and an empty stomach made me drunk and she brought me ice water and popcorn.Outdoor seating and romantic indoors with candles. So good.",1,1,
37,Sara S.,"New York, NY",137,127,484,4.0,1/7/2014,"My initial impression of Anotheroom: a hip bar that is ideal for an intimate date - whether with 1-3 friends or a real datedate. I went recently with my bf to kill time before a birthday party and we fell into a deep conversation, enabled by the soft music and dim lights as we sat on the booth along the wall. Anotheroom offers a large selection of beer and wine, and the bartenders are nice enough to help you select a beer based on your likes. Clean bathroom!",,,2
38,Justin S.,"New York, NY",853,480,83,5.0,12/31/2012,"I was ambling around SoHo/TriBeCa with my friend recently with the wind howling and the freezing air going right through us, so we were on the lookout for a cool stop to duck into for a drink and some warmth. Anotheroom fit the bill and then some. When we went in around 7:00pm on a Sunday night, the place was quiet except for the bartender and one other person. A dim, cozy room lined with plush banquettes, lit with flickering candles and interesting art on the walls makes for a welcoming scene.The chalkboard above the bar highlights their offerings including about 12 beers on tap, many more in bottles, a nice selection of wines by the bottle and glass, and even sake, port, and few other random items. My friend went for red wine and the bartender's thoughtful suggestion of a 2007 Rioja was fantastic. I started with a Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weiss and moved on to a Blue Point Rasta Rye, both of which were great. I'd say I preferred the Rasta Rye more for its amber color and bracing, hoppy taste, whereas the first beer was a sweet unfiltered German wheat beer. As we whiled away a couple of hours, more patrons found their way in. We loved the awesome, but unobtrusive music as well. Overall, a great little spot to go for a drink with friends or a date. This is definitely my new TriBeCa go-to for a casual but stylish drink spot.",4,1,3
39,Alice M.,"London, United Kingdom",174,194,33,4.0,4/26/2013,"I am a bigger fan of the Otheroom on Perry Street.. but this one is equally cute and unassuming, with the same black matte exterior, and warmly lit bar...Anotheroom has a similar lay out and feel to White Star, which was on the Lower East Side, but less divey.I like Anotheroom for its speakeasy qualities, of being tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and its intimate space.. but I've come to associate speakeasys with mixed cocktails, and was a bit disappointed to find that their bar selection was not inclusive of any scotch. Their beer and wine selection however, is wonderful.",2,,
40,Joe S.,"New York, NY",330,578,37,4.0,12/19/2011,"I really like this place! It's definitely not what I would call a ""lounge,"" but not a regular old bar either. It's a small space, all lit mostly by candlelight. One bartender, so the service is a bit slow. $10 min on credit cards, huge wine and beer selection written in illegible chalk above the bar. I'd come here for an after dinner drink, or a drink date after work for sure!",,,

An unpretentious, inexpensive bar in TriBeCa that has a great selection, friendly bartenders, and intimate atmosphere without being too small. You cannot go wrong with this place. A perfect spot when it gets warmer, too. They put tables outside and you can spend all afternoon people-watching.",,,

Who does that ?""   Answer is : everyone.  This is a totally normal request --  just a super hostile guy.  I. was thirsty and waiting on a friend so I had a drink anyway , but only go here if you want an angry guy glaring at you for coming into a bar because he hates his life and this job is such a burden.  Go next door , go anywhere else, there are lots of places that are welcoming and care about service.",1,4,

While waiting for a show to start at the Canal Room, we were bar hopping and came across Anotheroom, open for business.They have an awesome selection of imported beers. We all tried something different and made ourselves comfortable. We didn't stay long because the show was gonna start. It's a nice, chill, dimly lit place to bring a date as well.

Although they only sell wine and beer, it doesn't look like they stock up in most of their beers because every time i ask for a beer they tell me they don't have it. This is one of the go to place for the summer, to me this place it like a low key bar just like maslow6. There are benches outside and hardly gets busy. Overall the bartender is super nice and friendly and i soon will be coming back for a drink and its also good for little meetings, get together's and etc.",1,,

52,Inna L.,"Jersey City, NJ",52,85,410,5.0,12/19/2014,"That place was super cute an cozy. Came here for a drink after work around 7. There were plenty of seats at the bar and an open table or two. It's a good thing we had a chance to get a seat at the bar because by 8 people were huddled behind us trying to get drinks. There's a big chalk board with the menu posted above the bar. I didn't enquire I to it but almost certain they only have beer and wine. Really small, incredibly dark, so if your makeup looks bad this is a good place to go because you can barely see anything. They were playing pink Floyd when we came in which I thought was interesting for background music. It was also really warm inside which is really noticeable when you step inside from 30 degree weather. Service was good, beer selection excellent",,,
53,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,3.0,6/3/2011,"A story before my review:I'll admit it: I do online dating. I don't go on a lot of dates, but it's a fun way to meet new people. Last week, a guy contacted me on OKCupid. He was terrifyingly forward, demanding to know if I was ""a professor."" He then said he'd like to meet me because, as he put it, I seem successful and he'd like to get to know me. On top of all the creepy aggression, he and I had 4% compatibility according to the website. Four. Percent. But he was insistent and, at the urging of my friends, I agreed to meet him, if for no other reason than to get a good story out of the deal. So we agreed: we'd meet at 8:30 at Anotheroom. He confirmed this the morning of.So at 8:25 (I'm a punctual man), I arrived. I grabbed a table in the back. I texted him to let him know I was there. He wrote back, ""I have to cancel.""I laughed and left to meet some friends for dinner. He wants to reschedule.

Great selection of wines, champagne, and beer. No food. No hard liquor. Romantic setting on the inside because it's cozy booths and dim lights.

I'm guessing by their similarites that they are of the same owner.My only caveat is that the space doesn't appear to have air conditioning except for in the very back corner.  I wouldn't recommend this for large groups, as the narrow length of the bar makes it difficult for the group to sit together in any one spot - half the group will have to stand.  That said, we went for a birthday get together on a Friday and it worked out OK - I suppose it depends on what you are looking for.",,,

Those biblical words have never steered me wrong in my college days so I wasn't about to stop listening to them now. Three rum & cokes and one gin & tonic later, we're well prepared and ready to meet up with more people at Anotheroom, a beer and wine only bar. It's a clever name for a bar, but not clever enough to account for my stupidity. Our only instructions were to meet at ""Another Room"" down in Tribeca. Seeing as we're in the smartphone age where information is right at our fingertips, I didn't feel the need to ask them for the address. On our way down I'm spending 10 minutes searching for the location of ""Another Room"". Doubts started surfacing, ""Does this place really exist?"" ""Should we just bail if I can't find the location in 5 more minutes?"" but alas, thanks to one yelper who used the keyword ""Another Room"" in her review, I finally found, Anotheroom.When we finally got down there, we were glad we didn't bail. The Wednesday night brought in a calmer crowd, there was ample seating everywhere, inside and outside the bar and the music wasn't that loud where you couldn't hold a conversation but loud enough to drown out any awkward silences. The perfect volume. Personally I only had the beers and the place has a very decent beer selection. I prefer lighter beers so for those who share the same tastes I do, I'd recommend the Hefeweizen on tap or the wheat. The bartender was extremely friendly and had a good hoot about how the misleading nature of the bar's name (He must get that a lot).

Maybe being located near the Millenium hotel, the notion of leaving off a letter seemed like the thing to do. Or! Do they like making up words? Your guess is as good as mine. I've been going to Another Oom for ages. Looong before Rashida Jones told The Post that it's her fave Tribeca bar. Maybe I'll run into her in there some day and chat her up, all casual-like. Or maybe I already have. Hard to say since it's darker in Anothe Room than the New York sky was on August 14, 2003. Anotheroom is not a place to hang in all night long due to the loudness of the music and the darkness. How will I amuse myself if I can't take photos of my beers with my cellphone?! But it is the best (and I think only) good beer bar in Tribeca, so as a stop before or after dinner in that 'hood, it's tops. My wine snob friends tell me the reds are decent. The beer list rotates often enough that there is always something new to try or at least a delicious fave not found everywhere.

Which is why I would recommend saving this neighborhood gem for later in your liaison. (That goes double for blind dates: She had better have one heck of a personality if you're opting to bring her there.)Like its sister bars, The Room and The Other Room, Anotheroom is a strictly wine/beer den. And, as with its sister bars, the lighting is practically non-existent. The rectangular layout is reminiscent of the former (sans couch-ed ancillary space, though), while the cushioned bench seats along the wall stir up images of the latter.Note: During my visit, the eclectic music was loud enough to strain the conversation between my companion and me. (I couldn't figure out for whom it was aiming to perform more of a service: for those patrons whose trite and mundane comments were thankfully drowned out or for those would-be lovers who found that they 'had' to inch closer and closer together (to better hear each other, of course).)",3,3,2

Not bad for a date spot.I got there early on a friday afternoon/evening. The place was pretty empty with about 10 people spattered between one high table inside and the two large picnic tables outside. The outdoor picnic table does take away from the trendy look, but adds a slightly dive-y touch to the experience. So, a happy medium.

105,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",51,754,127,3.0,2/13/2009,"This place has a pretty cool vibe, but if your group is larger than 2 people make sure you get there early (around 5pm) to claim one of the 2 corners large enough.   The beer selection is decent for a swank loungey place but if you're serious about beer you need to go somewhere else like d.b.a.",1,,

107,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,4.0,7/3/2007,"When you decide to play The New Pornographers at a bar, you are asking for me to drink. Because the New Pornographers at any bar is awesome. The great thing about this versus The Room is that it's a little more open, with the outdoor tables, letting a little more light in, and I like the layout of the place better. The Room has a cool second lounge room adjacent to the bar, but this place has a cool bar long bench/couch that's raised a couple feet off the ground, so it's like a survey of the place. I can imagine if it gets crowded it's a great vantage point to people watch and be seen. I love the idea of it.Although I felt the stool I was sitting on at the bar was going to break or snap at any moment.",1,,1
108,Linda J.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,44,2,3.0,2/26/2008,"It would be nice with a redesign.  I like the dark walls and high tin ceilings.  However I don't like that they are trying so hard to be quirky-creepy with all those distorted Victorian era photos on the walls.  Also the furnishing is bad.  The extremely small chairs and the very high booths w/ metal tables are all out of proportion, not to mention cheesy looking.Not sure if they have hard liquor.  The prices are normal to kind of expensive.  I had a nice glass of Malbec and enjoyed the music [Elvis, Smashing Pumpkins] but kept thinking about how much better the space could be.",1,,

Feel like drinking in a dark room again? Go to anotheroom. Anotheroom is a local Tribeca bar that is.. well, dark. Don't let this description misguide you, it has a great ambiance. In the summer, they have communal picnic tables outside that are fun to pour yourself a glass wine or a local Brooklyn pilsner. This bar is a go to in the Tribeca neighborhood for a casual night out.",2,3,2

112,April W.,"Dallas, TX",104,151,16,4.0,1/21/2009,"I am a fan of Anotheroom. Another great late night spot for the post-work crowd. Working in a restaurant, I drink post-shift and then the rest of us migrate and drink elsewhere. That's how we roll. Pros: Very dark, cozy seats, beer and wine only (which then prevents any temptation to hit the hard stuff! WOO), cool bathroom, decent prices (meaning you're not completely ass raped for a decent glass of red however it's not like Odessa cheap.)Cons: Music tends to get too loud and conversation ends up being screaming matches, not a lot of places to sit which is fine on a Wednesday night but not so fine on a Friday night. Bartenders have actually left a bar full of customers to go for a smoke (what?? But I've been waiting for you to stop talking to your other flockin' buddies so I can feed my alcohol monsters!!!) Overall, great spot, good beer and wine, and completely friendly for the non-alcoholic drinking buddies who are just as awesome, if not more awesome than you, sober.",,,

114,Mickey M.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",272,683,43,2.0,12/4/2008,"It's dark. Really dark. The furniture is dark too. The tables are cast iron I think. When it's late night, glasses and bottles smash with great frequency, because people can't see where they're going and bump into these tables, knocking over everything. The floor is concrete, I think. It was too dark to tell. Good beers, and the crowd is pretty friendly even if it's cramped..but like I said, it's dark. Works for some people, but I'd be more likely to be found next door at the ordinary, not dark bar.",,,
115,Irina L.,"New York, NY",2,15,0,4.0,7/14/2010,"Great little place to hang out with friends. Beer selection is great, and if you're indecisive, you can ask for samples. The bartenders are nice.

116,Evan M.,"New York, NY",2,7,0,5.0,4/7/2011,"Love this bar! Awesome beer selection, decent prices - $7 for most beers. Mostly in bottles though - they have maybe a dozen on tap, too.

I've been here many times, and will continue to come back.",,,
117,Jen A.,"New York, NY",4,22,0,4.0,6/9/2010,"Never had a bad experience at this place. I usually come here after 11:30 so I can't speak for the afterwork scene. The first few times I came here I don't remember the music being as loud as more recently, but regardless I tend to return to bars that have a good music selection and are completely absent of the ""I just turned 21"" /fratboy crowd. This is not the kind of bar to meet someone new, everyone seems to come in groups (including myself) and the seating contributes to this. I recommend Anotheroom for good friends/lovers who want to share a good bottle of wine (or 2) and getting lost in conversation amidst chill music. A big plus: you don't have to worry about the ""run-in"" factor. No one will find you here and even if they do it's so dark they won't recognize you.",1,,
118,Kristin P.,"Chicago, IL",14,26,0,4.0,12/23/2010,"Dark, sultry, candle-lit with nice beer and wine options.  This is a good pre-dinner or post-dinner drink place but don't come if you are sleepy because it might be just cozy enough for you to nod off.  I would come back here again, if for nothing else than the chill vibe and good tunes.  A great place for a small group to converse over a few drinks.",,,
119,J K.,"New York, NY",28,216,32,5.0,10/1/2011,"A great selection of beer (Cooper's Green is my recommendation) and wine, dimly lit by way of candles with light bounced off the beer glasses, illuminating a sort of orange-y gold. It's got that true intimate atmosphere with just the right amount of darkness - not the ""wait, what do you even look like"" darkness, but the ""hey, this gal is kinda mysterious"".

124,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,116,0,3.0,2/6/2010,"Tribeca can be surprisingly desolate when you're trying to get to a bar, so Anotheroom is a dimly lit, speakeasy-esque haven.  So dark that you are either a.) automatically tired, b.) automatically relaxed, c.) able to make out in public without making a display of yourselves, Anotheroom is definitely a place I'd go if I were ever in Tribeca and needed to seal the deal (IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LOLOLOLOL).They have an excellent selection of microbrews, if you're into that, but I'm not, so it'd be difficult for me to park it here all night.",,1,

126,David L.,"New York, NY",833,1138,1105,4.0,11/2/2008,"This place has the friendliest and most hospitable bartenders. They'll talk to you about the beer selection all night long. They'll tell you about the music that's playing, even offering you to plug in your Ipod. One time I asked where they got their Orval glasses, saying I couldn't find them anywhere, and I was told ""you can have it"" and they refused to take any payment. They're extremely dog-friendly. They're completely tolerant (even encouraging) of takeout food or even delivery... The beer selection is terrific, and very reasonably priced -- the same things can be found (if you can even find them) at other bars for a couple dollars more... This place is dark and cozy, the music is never too loud, the crowd is never very obnoxious, it's a great place to kick back and have a dozen really good beers. I like to sit outside, bundled up on quiet winter evenings... Definitely one of my favorite bars.",3,,2

141,Justin P.,"Richmond, VA",172,136,6,2.0,3/7/2009,"After a bunch of my friends and I had dinner near-by, we decided to go to Anotheroom. It was my first time there, and I certainly wasn't impressed. The space itself is pretty darn small. The actual bar takes up much of the right side of the space and the an elongated raised bench, albeit with comfy cushions, lines the left side of the space. And, there are small cocktail tables placed in front of the seating area down the line. When we were there yesterday, there was a big contingent of people taking up a lot of space, so people were packed pretty close together on the bench. It would be much better if there were partitions along where each table is for personal space purposes. Another thing I didn't like about this place is that they don't offer shots. What type of bar doesn't offer shots? Actually, I know the answer: a shitty one. Overall, I don't plan on going back to this place anytime soon.",3,3,3
142,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",686,1303,3044,4.0,3/10/2009,"I went here on Sunday night for a few drinks.  The place is somewhat small with limited seating at the bar and a row of cushioned seats along the opposite wall set up high with demilune tables in front of them.  So the seating along the wall is perfect for couples since you can sit side-by-side.  I was interested in the drinks, however.  The choices are only beer or wine, and they are all written on a very large chalkboard over the bar.  The beer selection is actually fairly good with a number of microbrews (some I have never heard of) and Belgian beers on the list.  The bartender was very friendly and laid back.  She even had her dog with her.  One of the customers had a dog with her as well, and everyone got a kick out of the 2 dogs playing with each other.  So, I can definitely say this place is dog-friendly.  The ambience felt good, and I really enjoyed the place.  I will allow though, on a busy night, the ambience would probably be a lot different, and perhaps not as nice since the place is so small.",2,2,2
