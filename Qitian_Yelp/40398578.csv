And did I mentioned happy hour all night on Tuesdays. Check and check. The only issue it's a long trip for a Brooklynite like myself to get out here. I know several places like this in Brooklyn as well. You wanna here some music drink some more while the rest of your group arrives. Whenever I'm in the area and it's happy hour I don't mind checking it out again. It is definitely a spot to try. PS: From their advertising in the establishment, I think the rest of the happy hour specials look like a good bang for your buck. Literally, when I wen here with a couple of people. the pitchers got one or two people in the bunch lol.",7,7,10
1,Ja'Ashley C.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",1,6,2,3.0,8/6/2018,"Literally my favorite spot like legit my GO TO. Preferably Friday Nights. HOWEVER, this ONE bouncer can be a bit of an asshole and racist. He will let all the Hispanic people walk right in even when he says ""it's crowded"" and clearly it is not. Drinks are pretty good. No complaints. But they charge 30 dollars to use card (minimum). Soooooo make sure you have cash. But overall you're sure to have a good time!",,,
2,Patriice G.,"Mount Vernon, NY",417,99,74,3.0,7/5/2018,"Very small, very crowded But that henny punch is probably the best i ever had It's very chill and relax opposed to many spots on the strip where girls where heels for god knows what reason. Anyway i can't say much i haven't really tried their food or other beverages and i ordered at the bar where the bartender could see me",,,
3,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,483,1949,3.0,6/7/2018,"This place will do, in a pinch or when you want to kill some time. I wouldn't say it's a destination spot, unless you live nearby and and just want to hang out without much effort.  However, it is a nice spot to end your night at which plays popular music and serves cocktails fairly quickly and offers some bar food to quell whatever ails your tummy.Stick to the basics/classics and you cant go wrong. This is where you hang with friends or a significant other that doesn't need to be impressed. Ideal spot is the bench style seating in the front, if it's available. The front doors can open on a hot day for an outdoor feel.  Service is friendly but dont overlook that the place is small. Bathrooms are located in the rear, with a communal sink for washing hands.",21,4,9

Night.We dropped in here to post-party after a Yelp event at La Marina this week and owned this joint.Pitchers of margaritas, sangria, and mojitos. Bar snacks to nosh on.

6,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,4.0,6/3/2018,"TUESDAY ALL NIGHT HAPPY HOURDyckman Ave. is hopping even on a Tuesday! I'm scared to see what it's like on a summer weekend. Dyckman Bar was the most empty bar on the strip but we were a large group and we needed empty. We pretty much filled the joint up.The all night happy hour was a pleasant surprise. Ignore the 5/$25 drink special. Get a pitcher for $20. They make them strong so it's the best value unless you actually want to mix drinks and get a wicked hangover. They have a nice app selection of fried goodies. Mozzarella sticks, fries and scrimps! Unlike all the other spots, there was no outdoor seating, but they had the front open. Plus we really needed the front lounge area anyway. I want to give it 4 stars but it really was only suited for our specific needs. If it were just me and a couple of people, I have to be honest... I would have passed it by. Maybe it's more live on the weekends. *Shrug* But 3 stars doesn't mean it's bad.... just that's it's A-OK. You know what... I'm going to give it a conditional 4 stars anyway. I had a great time with great people so it's a win.",10,5,8
7,Mercedes L.,"Bronx, NY",64,28,65,3.0,6/10/2018,"I happen to come across this bar by accident while coming back from the Puerto Rican festival. The music and their happy hour is what convinced me to go in. I had 2 strawberry margarita for 6 dollar each which wasn't bad. I also had some French fries and wings to go along with my drink which was very satisfying. I was in there for like three hour and the music selection was mostly throwback. They did like 3 modern song which had me dancing. Unfortunately since the music selection wasn't diverse i decided to go to Made in Mexico so I dance. Btw if you happen to go to the bathroom and don't see a sink, its outside,across the mirror in a very hidden area with no soap. You welcome",,,
8,Michelle J.,"New York, NY",103,20,17,3.0,8/27/2017,"I based this review on service and drinks. The drinks were good. We ordered a pina colada and orange mojito. The bartender was nice and polite and asked us if our drinks were good. To really enjoy a well-made drink, you have to go during the day, because it can get crowded at night and the service is not the best during the nighttime.The manager should try to be more friendly and accommodating to the customer.. after all, it's the customers that bring in the business.

The establishment is simply whatever goes to whatever consumer.Bartender Sussy charged extra for whatever she wanted, added gratuity to a bar tab and then sais it was bc my bill was over $50. Where does it say that on a menu? The wine tasted like it was from 1989. Would not recommend this place to anyone. They need training from door man to bartenders",1,,

Updated review","Second time at Dyckman Bar, the experience was a little better. We walked in when no one else was there and Fifi greeted us with energy on the 100th level. She was very engaging and enticing. She made us comfortable and happy to be here even if we were the only ones here. She made our drinks to our liking and also explained our vouchers and the happy hours special on a high level. She the type of bartender you want around on a Saturday night. When our wings and fries arrived it was hot and crispy as she described. The seasoning was food on the wings as she described HOWEVER the hot sauce was ginger with food coloring, the blu cheese was like mayo with cheese. I enjoying coming to this place for some of their local feel but they have a long way to go if they want to become a franchise. Throughout our night fifi catered to our every need made sure our glasses was always filled until the next Bartender came to in. She distracted Fifi from doing her job. POW spoke about paying  $80 for her lashes, about her eye liner, about the guy she dated. I think Pow needs more training in customer  service and courtesy around customers. All in all good experience just minor tweaks here and there.",3,2,2
12,Omar M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",2,17,0,1.0,6/14/2018,Did I purchase alcohol or a cup of water with a splash of alcohol? Another place I hope I never step into. Typical bs heights spot over priced with Scooby Doo Papa or scooby Doo Kaka  blaring in my ear.,,,
13,Melvin J.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,3,1.0,3/28/2018,I can't give this place any stars but had to. This place opens a tab then loses my cards. Then tells me I never gave them a card. So I ask how can you open a bar tab in the machine without a card. I ask them to find my card. They keep stating that I gave no card. I ask for the manager and surprise no manager was on duty. Then the bouncer start harassing me and pushing me demanding that I pay. I said no. I ask for the police to file a report.  Which resulting in me paying the $130+ bill and leaving with no card. Went back later in the week to speak to a manager my card never turned up and no apology was even given. This is the 2nd bad incident I experienced at this place and will never return. Not sure if it was a scam or mistake I betting on the scam.,1,1,
14,Olivia J.,"New York, NY",9,120,14,3.0,7/12/2018,"First time coming to this bar was a month ago with my two friends.  We came here on a Saturday night sometime around 9pm.  The time we went, it wasn't cramped but still a good enough crowd of people.  The drinks are pretty expensive ($12+).  Be aware, if you're opening up a tab or paying with a credit card, you have to spend $30 so please bring cash with you.  The music in there is pretty great.  Now, fast forward to about 2 weeks ago, I went with the same two friends, plus 2 other people.  We got to the bar around 12:30am.  The bouncer was telling us that they have reached maximum capacity and that there is a wait.  So, we stood in line.  However, we noticed that the bouncer was letting other people ahead of us get in, while we were in line.  I asked the bouncer why was he letting people in if we were waiting in line, he told me that they were already here and just had to step out.  That's when I noticed he started letting more and more people go in.  Now, what I've noticed is that the people he was letting in, were of Dominican descent, while my 4 friends that I was with, along with majority of the people in line were black.  So I asked the bouncer was this a race thing (supposedly the Dyckman area are racist towards people who aren't hispanic) and he told me no, that there are people inside of the bar who are black.  We just decided to go someplace else.  I am not exactly sure if they were being racist, or if in fact these people were already there and just stepped out.  I don't know.  I will give this place another try sometime soon and will update my review.",2,,
15,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,4.0,4/26/2017,The love for the uptown scene...Dyckman Bar is a cool little spot along the strip of Dyckman Street. Very chill vibe. Good drinks and of course in a neighborhood of very sexy looking woman. Looking to come here more often during the warmer months. Being that it's not that big of a spot though I wouldn't recommend it for a party type place for friends but more so if you are with one or two friends after work or a nice date night or even afternoon to chill. Still a very cool spot to come through to though.,,,
16,Dhalia L.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",17,1,0,1.0,8/10/2017,"Horrible place, bad service, Wednesday night 08/09, the bartender, a light skinned girl with a nose piercing, was incredibly rude from the minute we walked in to the minute we left. For some strange reason one of my beers smelled like weed. Of course the bartender denied my claim. Anyone who works in a position where they do drug screenings should watch out for this girl and this bar. Very untrustworthy    Cops, city workers please WATCH OUT!!",1,2,

The bartenders were great. The drinks are super good! I love hookah at bars, but I can say this is one of the few bars I enjoy without the hookah .",1,,
18,Kalieha N.,"Jamaica, NY",0,4,2,1.0,4/29/2017,"Let me just say this experience was so bad that it has me writing my first Yelp review. Me and three other female friends made a reservation yesterday, Friday, to partake in the happy hour specials. Their happy hour according to their website is from opening to 8pm and consists of their signature cocktails $8 and house specialties for $10. In addition, Friday is supposed to be ladies night where ladies get the happy hour deals all night again according to their website. After reviewing the website, we decided to give it a try. Upon arriving, we realized there was only one staff member on shift, the bar tender, after she rudely pointed us to our table. On the table was ONE menu, that had the house specialties drinks, the happy hour section which included house specialties $10, house beer/ wine, and sangria, and a few apps. No where on the menu did it mention their ""specialty cocktails"" or the ladies night $8 special so we figure to stick w. The normal happy hour house specialties LISTED ON THE MENU @$10 each vs. the normal $12. WE ALL HAD TO GET UP TO ORDER OUR DRINKS NO WAITER. NO HOST. So I ordered henny punch from the house specialties section which was supposed to be included in happy hour according to the menu that clearly shows that and their website. One friend ordered a patron margarita (was told that would be extra which is fine) and my other two friends ordered plain margaritas. After ordering a few rounds and some apps we started to realize the horrible quality of the bar and decided to go somewhere else on the strip. For example, we had a reserved table but had to get up and order our drinks and apps at the bar. When they were ready the bartender would scream over the music flailing her arms so we can get up to get it instead of just bringing it over. Also, 3 woman were allowed to come in w. Their kids younger than 2 yrs old, one was sitting at the bar they came at different times so this must be normal. THIS IS A BAR NOT A RESTAURANT, HOW DO YOU HAVE KIDS AT THE BAR AND LOUNGING AROUND ?!!!!We ask for our bill, when the bill comes. The bartender charged all of the drinks at the normal price $12 each. In addition, instead of making the one patron margarita as requested she apparently made all of them patron without asking or notifying anyone. I figured it was a miscommunication so I let that go. But the henny punch was clearly listed under house specialties which was covered under the happy hour deal. I approached the bartender who had an attitude about the whole thing and instead of apologizing and correcting the issue she told me that the small chalk board outside states what's on the happy hour deal and the menu is INCORRECT. . . . . Then after I brought up the website she said there is NO ladies night on Friday . . . . . . So of course naturally I ask to speak to a managerShe brings a guy who was probably the dishwasher and he confirms everything she is saying even after being confronted with THEIR MENU AND THEIR WEBSITE. He also tells us the website was advertised on purpose to bring ppl in but the deal did NOT actually exist. So at this point, another guy comes over who actual looks like a manager and tells the bartender to calm down and he would like to handle it. Long story short I walk outside to talk to this man who initially tried to tell me the menu was incorrect but after confronted with the website and his employee claims OF FALSE ADVERTISEMENT he now wants to handle the situation correctly by TELLING THE TRUTH. I asked him to lower the henny punches to the $10 happy hour price and we would pay for the rest including the patron drink mishap. He comes back w. A revised bill and removes all of the henny punches altogether ( nice gesture but after the headache of it all it really didn't matter )I have one thing to share even if you didn't read the whole story know that this place IS A SCAM AND THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET PPL THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. I could've just paid and left but this situation made me think they must be doing this to a lot of ppl and no one speaks up. ITS THE PRINCIPLE. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, and if you do I feel just as sorry for you as I did for us that we didn't just go to another bar on this strip. YOUVE BEEN WARNED.",5,2,1
19,Justin C.,"Forest Hills, NY",283,48,0,5.0,2/20/2018,"My favorite bar in the Heights, hands down.

To the bartender, hey hey heyyyyy.",,,
20,William Q.,"Chicago, IL",60,105,392,3.0,12/31/2016,"Great bar, for those one that appreciate hard liquor. I am more a beer kind of guy and their offering in beer is limited to just three: Heineken, Corona and their own beer (which wasn't available at the moment due to malfunction of the tap). It's not a big room so space can be challenging if gets crowed like last night to see UFC event. The customer service was excellent and the crowd was really nice too. No drama or attitudes here. The kitchen was closed by 9 PM which was a boomer.Overall, if you appreciate a good whisky and or vodka this is the place for you if you are looking not for a hard liquor probably you'll be better off somewhere else. The drinks runs about $13 to $15 which is more than most bars back in Chicago.",,,

22,Latoya W.,"Bronx, NY",241,159,410,4.0,9/19/2016,Been here a few times. They no longer have the drink with the grand Marnier shooter.  That's sad but okay. On this recent visit I got there around 8 pm. It's a very mall space but it's just right if you have a seat lol. They have happy hour til 8 pm on the weekend which is cool. I tired the the Hennessy  punch which  wasn't that great it tasted like there was no alcohol. My second round  I chose  the Hennessy and Ginger ale it hit the spot. I also got bar food chicken fingers and fries they were good. They had  good music playing not sure if I would say dj per se since I seen the person walk over to a tablet and change the music. Either way it worked for me.I've come here after 10 pm when they had a DJ and got a pitcher of their  mojito  and danced the night away with friends. I absolutely  love  this place and I will be back.,2,,

Each one of my guest are certified NYS teachers for the board of education and two NYU certified chefs. She treated us rudely as if we were beneath her (half of my guest being Latina, and the males being Black.) I've been to Dyckman Bar on numerous occasions when the bartender FiFi was there and the other bartender with silver hair. Had an amazing time; which is what led me to returning to celebrate again this pass Saturday.

My favorite drink is the Coconut Mojito, with two of these you'll get a really good buzz. They have a few Jenga sets that you can play with while you're having a few drinks. It's really laid back and I love it because it's so different from the other establishments in Uptown. Only thing I don't appreciate is the automatic gratuity included and $30 minimum when you're paying with a credit card. I saw they have a really good deal for mimosas during the weekend, $20 until 8:00pm or so, def. will be back for that soon!",2,,1

Updated review","while i still enjoy coming here occasionally (usually when a friend decides to do a bday here even though the space is TINY) last night was a NEW experience for me.Sat down ordered the Berry-Mosa, (which is a great drink and at $12 in a mason jar with both vodka and bubbly you can't go wrong), ordered the bday boy a drink, same price, ordered myself another drink, SAME price...requested check.  Bill comes it's $43.20.  i'm just in a rush to go home so i round up to $50 and keep my half of the receipt (luckily they also gave me a breakdown of it).  This morning I start thinking where did that extra $7.20 come from? Bill should have been $36 plus tax and tip.  Apparently every time i requested a drink they had to go to the back process my request through a type writer, then wait for it to be approved then file the request, search for the recipe in the labyrinth of files etc b/c it said the extra $7.20 was for an ADMINISTRATIVE FEE.  What exactly is an ""administrative fee??""At least call it what it is! A MANDATORY gratuity fee.  Never again.  They got an extra $14 from me for no reason.  Next time I'm paying cash and ordering at the bar unless they charge me a ""delivery fee"".they also place the 7.20 so far into the corner that the 7 is on top of the .20 (see pic), so after a few drinks you don't even notice.  SHADY!!!",16,5,1

I like rap but and the entire hour hay I spent there that was all they played I felt like I was in the rap world, not even one bachata or merengue or any other type of music.

39,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,1/15/2013,"Came here to watch the football game on 1/13/13.Ambiance: The music was popping like it was a Saturday night, normally I don't mind it, but it was so loud we had to scream just to hear each other.  Also, since the music was on, you couldn't hear the game which is fine, but perhaps putting the close captions would be a good idea.  Speaking of the game, we were sitting at one of the tables by front and the way in which the TVs are mounted made it hard for us to watch the game, like you literally catch a neck cramp.  If you are sitting at the bar, the view is fine.Food: I did not have any of the food but my friend Anthony had the wings and fries and he said they were fine.  My friend Marisol had the calamari and she said it did not taste good and I believe her because like me, she is a calamari snob.Drinks: There was a sign that said they had $6 well drinks, but I noticed when we got the bill, the drinks went up to $9.  Maybe the special were over by the time I ordered my second and third drink, but I think a good waitress will let you know that happy hour no longer applies. I mean come on, $9 for cheap vodka and cranberry?  this is the heights, not Soho.Service: With the exception of not telling us when the drink specials stopped, the waitress was friendly and even brought us some board games (connect 4 and jenga) which I thought was fun and interesting.I have been here many times on a Friday and Saturday night, and I wouldn't object to going back, but I might pregame at a cheaper place before I do.",3,,

From the moment I walked in , the DJ or whoever he said he was, was giving me compliments, making me feel uncomfortable and asking for my number. Really ? Give me a break.The manager was very unprofessional , chilling in his car, and if you think you'll be interviewed at the bar, don't worry - you'll have to walk to his car so he can do an ""interview"". The interest was gone and opportunity was lost, after I didn't provide my social media ( instagram / twitter ) because , simply , I don't have one and I won't share my personal life and pictures with some random manager. And who even asks for social media when hiring ?! Exactly, because my instagram won't bartend but myself and my skills will.WOW Dyckman bar , so ghetto!",11,11,3

There was a DJ spinning some tunes in the background & me and my boyfriend sat down to order some drinks. We had made it right in time for the happy hour special, which is 2 for 1 drinks. We indulged in some Cuervo Margaritas that were not only very tasty, but very strong as well. The music was great, the bartender was very friendly & outgoing, and there wasn't much of a crowd at the place, which is always a plus.Overall, I had a great time at this bar. Don't be fooled by the size or location... this is a bar not to miss when going out in the Inwood area. I will definitely be coming back here again!",3,,1

49,KB K.,"New York, NY",0,12,1,1.0,8/2/2013,"I rarely give any place a bad revue, honestly I didn't even make it in the door so I cant say much about the inside. The staff in the front was rude and nasty to me. It was the Dominican Day parade after party so I realize it was busy. We came back several times and they said we couldn't go in; mind you we were dressed very nice and we were really polite; 4 girls. We waited for it to clear out more inside and they STILL wouldn't let us in. We are ""tomboy"" girls but I am not going to use that card right now as far as why we didn't get in. We watched every other person get in. They were slipping money to the bouncers who happily took it, which is fine, I would have slipped him a 20 no big deal! The fact was they wouldn't let us in for no apparent reason. I guess because we weren't in scantily clad clothes or we weren't drug dealers. The man at the door, claimed to be a former cop, which I am sure he probably was, was super nasty. I asked if it was because we were tomboyish and he said ""OH WHATS NEXT ARE YOU GOING TO USE THE ""BROWN CARD"" , which could be offensive being that 2 of the girls were black 2 were Spanish. I love allllll of those bars on that strip! All we wanted to do was party and enjoy the festivities and support the venue. We weren't even allowed the chance. I know this year I WONT be partying here for any after parties following the parade.",5,1,
50,Jasmine F.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,1,4.0,6/24/2013,"I must start by saying I absolutely love Dyckman Bar! Yes, there are a couple things I dislike about the place, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. The DJs always play a great variety of music and the people are so much fun. If you want to dance, have a good time, drink and laugh this is the place to be. Their happy hour runs until 10pm, which gives you more than enough time to head home after work, change clothing and still catch their selection of $5 drinks. As others have said, the bar is small and narrow, but by the second martini the size of the pace is the last thing on your mind. If I go here during non happy hour times I usually buy a pitcher to share with my friends. The pitchers could be stronger, for $50 I expect to get a buzz after my second cup. I'd recommend DB to anyone considering going here. It's always a fun time!* O, and, if the bar is empty enough they have games like Jenga and connect 4 you can play with while you're drinking. A great way to start a conversation with a cute guy or gal.",6,1,2

57,Susana C.,"Manhattan, NY",60,19,0,5.0,2/4/2013,"Oh Dyckman Bar! (sigh!)  There are plenty of reasons to love this place.  I'll start by saying that it's probably one of three places Uptown with an amazing musical selection.  Sure you get your rowdy, rowdy hip hop nights,but the owners always make sure to feature an eclectic array of dj's and those are the nights I personally love!  This bite-sized bar has become the ""it"" place Uptown. I see a lot of people complaining about the size of this place but it IS a BAR people and NOT a club--that detial is clearly stated in the name fyi.  As a girl, the thing I appreciate MOST about it is that it's never a place where you feel threatened by a bunch of guys hounding you and thats incredibly important to me.I will say that Friday-Sunday nights get EXTREMELY packed and folks love to complain about the dress code.  I will say that I never mind a dress code at a trendy spot. After all, what girl wants to walk into a place where there are a bunch of dudes with hoodies on, on a Saturday night?  This is New York City right?Less I digress,  I'm here to reivew the other 4 nights that this fly bar is open.  People focus way too much on the weekends and forget that this great neighborhood spot is open early on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and how phenomenal the Happy Hour is!  You can actually sit and have a great cocktail and catch a game, listen to some great music and just chill out.  They always have rotatating specials, the bar is always impecably clean and its a great place to grab a beer or a martini with your girls.  My advise, try a Tuesday or Wednesday night and see what I'm talking about!",2,,

59,Anthony T.,"Jamaica, NY",244,288,591,3.0,1/14/2013,The place is very narrow for one so if its packed people could get upset or pissed off and try to push other people. the bouncers were cool they werent bad or demanding at the door.  went here for NFL playoff game with the patriots and Texans. food wise they do not have a large menu but calamari chicken wings Mini PIzza. if you are looking for a large food selection not this place. They had the DJ playing the music VERY loud like it was a saturday night club. the music was great but thought they would would have the game audio playing.  Beers are like 6 bucks which isnt bad like bars or clubs downtown in manhattan. other than it being the NFL playoff it would be nice to listen to old music and have a good time.,1,,

63,Ely M.,"Mahopac, NY",58,62,3,4.0,10/3/2011,"""DB""....As the chain the bartenders wear says, in gold bling'd out block letters, took over what used to be Patricks, a little dive bar with cheap drinks.  They made a good use of the space somehow it feels a bit bigger than patricks even though the layout is the same.  I love the cold hues, and use of mostly blue tones throughout.  What mostly stood out were the interesting light fixtures made of what seem to be empty patron bottles with blue pebbles hung from a rope and also the puzzle wall behind where the different DJ's usually stand.  I like that the bar isn't trying to be anything but a bar (at the moment), there are too many restaurants trying to be clubs etc on this strip.  They have a very small food menu offering wings, empanadas, and a cuban sandwhich for $10 each.  While I havent tried the food, I havent heard great things about it either.I like that they have a drink menu that changes with the season.  In the summer it was mostly mojitos, and bellinis, for the fall most of the drinks are less and a bit more creamy.  From the fall menu I really enjoyed the ""Hersheys Kiss"" (godiva, chocolate syrup, stoli vanilla, and a bit of frangelico) and the ""She-Devil"" (Nuvo, strawberry puree and Ciroc Red Berry)....  But there was nothing that really stood out from this menu, nothing that really called my attention and made me think ""I HAVE to have that.""  They also offer a happy hour special and foursquare special.The music varies and is different EVERYTIME I have been, which is good and bad...Variety but too unpredictable.  Overall, I'd return here as a pit-stop and have a drink but it would not be my ultimate destination.BTW someone here definitely tries to push Ciroc heavy because its allover the drink menu and has most of the space in the bar...hmmmmm...lol And shoutout to the bartender Chamy, she's AWESOME!",10,9,5

It took her 5 or so minutes to bother to acknowledge us.  By looking at is quickly and saying nothing. The host spoke to me told me the voucher could not be used because we had to have 4 people instead of 2.  We looked at the voucher again and the fine print. Nowhere did it specify this.  Fine. We would have gladly stayed and paid REGULAR PRICE but the attitude of the Host and Bartendar was as if they did not want our kind (non Latino and female) there. Maybe green money from non ""looking"" latinos are no good at this bar.   I hate to say it but it appeared that if you didnt look hispanic /latino they did not want to serve you. Or more specifically, if you are black or they think your African American or African or black latino. You shouldnt expect to be served here. No matter how much $$$ your ready to spend.
