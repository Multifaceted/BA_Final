0,Suresh D.,"Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, NY",101,973,1064,4.0,6/25/2018,"Manhattan Pride weekend. I was at brunch nearby for hours.  I wanted to relax with a drink nearby. The last time I had been here before was at least 2 years ago.It was not too crowded around 4:30 so there was still a seats at the bar. I ordered a house margarita. It was surprisingly good and inexpensive ($6). A few minutes after it was served the recently hired bartender asked how I liked it.Maybe an hour or so had passed and 2 more drinks, the bar manager challenged previously mentioned bartender to a push up contest.  He needed 2 people. One person to sit outside and watch the bar manager's car. The second volunteer was needed to count. There was a vote taken from the crowd as to who would win. Supposedly the winning voters got a free drink.Contest ended. Bar manager won. He announced a free round on him for everyone. That also meant the two volunteers got 2 drinks.Before I left after having my free drink (drink 4) I thanked the bartenders. Great friendly bartenders, good drinks. HAPPY PRIDE!",,1,1
1,Jim R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",27,22,1,4.0,11/19/2018,"Fun, cozy neighborhood bar in mid-town.  Good pour on the drinks at a reasonable price.  Bartenders are friendly and remembered my drink each time I came in during my week-long NYC stay.  Always appreciated. Early HH is a good time to drop in in order to get a seat at the bar (preferable).  Later at night it's a bit too crowded for my comfort level.  I like a bit of elbow room.  Friendly patrons, probably encouraged by having friendly bartenders.  Will always drop in when I'm in the city.",,,
2,Cy R.,"New York, NY",0,40,0,2.0,11/19/2018,"Ewww, barely tolerable bartender who was not pleasant and spoke broken English to the point he wasn't able to do his job well.   Somewhat decent arms don't constitute a great image for a bar.   My experience could have been so much better.   Won't be quick to return.",,,
3,Justin C.,"New York, NY",90,80,74,2.0,10/17/2018,"Last Saturday when I visited, the music was not so great (the dj kept on playing music from the 70s to the 80s). The drinks was very weak, and the crowd there was kind of random too. Overall, the environment and atmosphere of that bar is not ""posh"" at all. It actually felt kind of divey and retro (not in a good way). There are better bars out there.",,,
4,Devin B.,"Manhattan, NY",612,8,1,1.0,10/9/2018,"On October 8th, I came here with my friend at 3:30 AM. My friend's card, which had plenty of money in the account, was declined and the bartender immediately started yelling at him for wasting his time. I really just wanted to go home, so I politely offered my credit card to pay for the bill. My card, which has plenty of money in the account as well, was also declined. The bartender continued to yell at my friend and wave his hand in his face. I calmly walked up to him, apologized, and told him that we would not accept the drinks, take our cards and simply leave. I understand how many annoying, drunken customers they must get throughout the night, so I was as calm as possible to find a resolution. He then proceeded to scream at me, wave his hand in my face and refused to give our cards back. At this point, I cannot believe how I am being treated & bullied, especially within my own community, so I slapped the drinks over because of the horrid way he was speaking to me and threateningly waving his hand in our faces. The bartender then punched me in the breast. I pulled away to avoid a fight and saw he was walking around the bar to get closer to me. It took 3-5 staff members to hold him back. I am not sure what drugs he was on, but he was acting like a feral animal. I am in extreme pain and my implant is lopsided. I never in my entire life thought I would have to leave a negative review for a gay bar, especially being a trans woman who has worked in nightlife for years. It really sucks but people need to know what kind of place this is. I am sick of trans women being assaulted and nothing being done about it.",2,,
5,John S.,"Manhattan, NY",48,184,108,4.0,5/1/2018,"Here's a fun fact about Posh--it's not really that posh! But it is cheap and comfortable, and that's more important. Posh is a small, unfussy bar, with some beat up couches in back, and some tables outside in the front for the smokers. There are also TVs, though I wish there weren't. Happy hour prices are low, pours are heavy, and the staff is friendly and shirtless. Later at night, you'll sometimes find dancing or drag, though the space is not ideal for either. Posh is best when it's working as a down-home, semi-divey local favorite.",1,1,
6,AJ G.,"Houston, TX",91,129,76,4.0,12/1/2017,"Found this club while in town and was pleasantly surprised. Drinks are strong. Music was a mix of 90s through today - mostly dance remixes of pop songs. The club itself was small and dark with a lot of fog, lasers and strobes. Bartenders were friendly and fast. Didn't have to wait too long to order a drink!",2,,
7,Christopher L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,1.0,7/24/2018,"A customer for nearly 25 years and now been reduced to a straight white girl space with 10+ dancers working the crowd for tips. A Dj wirh a mic catering to the Latino crowd and straight Dj's with mix's announcing the pretty latinas in the room. Such a shame. What was the best neighborhood bar for ""our"" people has sold out. Shame. I'm sorry but, I just want a gin and tonic... not some straight muscly guy begging for tips. No thanks.",2,1,

9,BA L.,"Johnson City, NY",2,76,3,5.0,5/7/2018,Where have you been all my life? First time here this last weekend and I loved it. Very diverse crowd and not pretentious at all. Bartenders were nice and attentive. Drinks were a bit pricy but that's sort of par for the course in NYC. DJ played an amazing set of music of songs that I actually knew--everyone seemed to be having a great time. Would definitely come back again and bring more people along I am looking forward to my next trip.,1,,

11,Peter N.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",583,10,0,5.0,2/13/2018,"I ALWAYS have a fun time at Posh. It overcomes the pretentious and standoffish attitude other bars in the neighborhood can get. Generous pour on the drinks, reliably fun danceable music from classic hits to the new stuff. The sound design is good, quieter by the bar and louder in the back by the DJ/dance floor. The smoke machine and lasers get going at night too, unapologetically festive and fun. Go to Posh for a no-bull good time: drink, dance, flirt!",,,
12,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,5.0,3/21/2016,"What a great little, unpretentious gay bar! Try this place out for happy hour where they feature deals like deep discounted well drinks, $3 draft and bottled beer, etc. They even have complimentary bar food treats some nights! The inside bar is smallish but still comfortable and inviting. Plus, most nights, the bar tenders provide some might good eye candy ;) I especially like coming here once it warms up outside to enjoy the small front patio. As you might suspect, Posh also features some fierce drag queens, go-go boys, and other entertainment throughout the week. Check out their Web site to see what tickles your fancy.",9,3,6
13,William L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,20,0,2.0,6/7/2018,Won't go here again. I opened a tab and purchased six drinks for our group. The bill was $90. I wasn't asking for well drinks but I was overcharged. Be careful going here.,,,
14,Rashawn N.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,12/29/2017,The shady bartenders used my card to pay someone else's tab. I reached out to the manager via emails and phone calls 3 days ago. I've yet to receive a reply. As a gay man this is One of the main reasons why I hate gay bars and clubs . The level of professionalism and customer service SUCKS!!!!,4,,
15,Nicole A.,"Lodi, NJ",152,5,0,5.0,1/26/2018,My favorite bar ever. Service is amazing and the drinks are great too! Best time to go is on a weekend when it's crowded.

18,Joseph M.,"Manhattan, NY",20,289,13,3.0,5/25/2016,"Eh, I came here twice the in the past few weeks and it's the same old, same old. It's this little bar hidden away in Hell's Kitchen and often frequented by the local gays up here. It's mostly an older crowd, with younger guys who like older guys coming here. The drinks were pretty good, as is the DJ, but it's pretty dead here. The first time I came here, there were around 10-12 people, and the next time ,there was around 15, even though it was a Thursday night and Friday night. I'd probably come back here again for drinks, but don't expect anything spectacular. It's just a gay dive bar. I'd prefer the gay bars on Christopher St.",2,,1
19,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,3.0,4/2/2015,"My girlfriend set up a barcrawl for the gang and after trying out some of the East Village businesses and being utterly disappointed by the lack of communication between them and the event hosts as well as their blatant disregard for our patronage, we set course for some of the bars that were in the Midtown West area of our crawl map. Posh was the second spot we ventured to and were welcomed with open arms, despite their lack of knowledge about the barcrawl event in which they were participating. The bartenders here, as with the other locations in the village, were unaware of their involvement but they were pleasant, had limited drink specials and showed us a good time. The bar was packed and its kind of small. We befriended a couple of guys at the bar and they were helpful in suggesting which bar we should check out next. Even though our day started off crappy and Posh also did not have the drink specials promised to us, just their overall amicable behavior towards us and our plight was sufficient enough to make us enjoy ourselves, thoroughly.",2,2,2
20,Jonathan H.,"Minneapolis, MN",308,359,64,4.0,5/27/2015,"I have been here a few times for some good drinks and to have a good time.  Whenever I am in Manhattan, I make my effort to go to this bar.  I never fail to have a good time here.  I like that this is good for lounging; yet, it has a lot of cool lights for effect.The bartenders clearly know how to do their job.  Their drinks are great, and they are served in a timely manner.  My favorite drink from over there is their appletini.  I think the prices are reasonable, considering the quality.  Sometimes, it can be busy there, but the employees seem to carry themselves pretty well.The place is always well organized and well run.  Any time I go in there, I always feel comfortable and welcome.  The employees appear to be an top of things regarding keeping everything clean and tighty.  Any time I am in Manhattan and looking for a good time, I will continue checking out this place.  This place never fails to deliver.",1,,
21,Reggie M.,"Manhattan, NY",273,315,2690,3.0,3/29/2014,"I love the unpretentious ambience of this bar. It is located in Hell's Kitchen, and there's a neighborly feel here.There are cozy leather couches at the back for you and friends to lounge on.I can still have a great conversation here even while the DJ is playing music.$4 happy hour on well drinks and $3 for draft beers. It can get really crowded at happy hour on weekdays. I have never been here on weekends.Bartenders are gorgeous with 6 packs that it made me want to run to the gym and work out.Downside: there are only two bathrooms here and it can get busy at times.",6,5,4
22,Michael T.,"New York, NY",15,254,430,3.0,11/23/2015,I was at Posh for an early Friday night. I liked the crowd - very mixed in terms of 'type'. The music was decent with a lot of 70s/80s disco albeit 90s remixes. Probably would have given it another star if the DJ hadn't been such an unfriendly dick. Can't have everything.,1,1,

I remember being 20 years old and wishing I could go in on a trip to NYC and now I'm happy I did 5 years later. You think with the name POSH, this place would come off snooty, but in reality it's a really fun dance club with a cool crowd that is very welcoming and friendly. I assumed I'd stay like an hour or two. Ended up staying four hours and not getting home until 5:30 the next morning because it was that much fun.",3,2,3

26,Clyde Charles J.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,1.0,7/15/2017,Great location and great bar but the bartenders are no good.  They looked right at me several times for about 10-15 minutes and then I asked what someone had to do to get a second drink here. The tall bald one (Zack I believe) is a horseshit bartender. No smile no personality and very lacking in customer service skills.,,,

29,Louis L.,"New York, NY",48,77,0,2.0,8/1/2015,"It doesn't get trashier than this in Manhattan. I end up at this bar every so often because I know they have pretty good music for a gay bar, but each time I say never again.The drinks are the cheapest you'll find at a dive dance club bar, the service is poor and if you'd like to use the family restroom, the door is conveniently located in the center of the dance floor. At this little gem you'll find quite an ethnic crowd. Many lurking men attempting to dance with you which is quite uncomfortable. But as long as you're removed from the center dance area, it's bearable. It's not uncommon to see some raunchy tweeting. Trust me.It is pretty convenient to get to by subway, I take the A or C train from the financial district when I go to Hells Kitchen. Take the C to 50th street or the A to 42nd street port authority. Don't count on these trains to get you home quickly if you're out pay 3, service can be quite infrequent.",,3,1

The music was general and basic for a regular happy hour spot. 5 dollar well drinks which were bland and not as good as off the wagon or hangar. When I go to a bar, I expect good drinks and maybe a special during happy hour. Well an even better special I guess because I've exposed to other better places than this for drink specials.",3,1,1

It's a random Thursday, I asked for an older techno song from 2009, the third time I walked up to the booth. Calabria from Enur.  The DJ DIDNT KNOW IT.  the bar was already empty and I just wanted one song. We all have YouTube. But the DJ didn't know it and couldn't accommodate.

I've spent many drunken nights here with my besties. Depending on the bartender your drinks can be really strong or almost pure ice water. After about 11:30 or 12 they get you with free sliders!! Makes you want to drink more!The dance floor can get crowded but who doesn't enjoy a nice genital pressed against you lol. All in all great place good vibe my go to spot.,5,1,1

The location is great and close to other gay bars in the neighborhood. There is a big friendly bouncer at the entrance that eventually will remember who you are! (Maybe I have been here too much)I have always got to speak to other people, maybe cause it's so packed that I am always stepping on someone's feet! This is not a place for dates!! However..

Then later the bouncer tells that ""we can now come in"" after hearing us try and get the police to assist us with this discrimination.  I guess they don't know that it's a Federal Law to discriminate against a person or persons with guide dogs who use them for mobility.  They should have handled it much better and trained their staff to check 1st before denying us entry.  The bouncer or elusive Bar Owner was not at all accommodating, didn't even bother to make his face/presence known or even come out to apologize after the incident.  What kind of hospitality is that for a ""gay"" bar in NEW YORK?!? Geez! We are from Los Angeles and they don't do that there!!! Regardless of the fact that we gays already face other forms of discrimination within the rest of the heterosexual world... but in our own community is ridiculous!!!  To all the VISUALLY IMPAIRED or BLIND LGBTQ peeps out there... DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE or even CHECK IT OUT.  Even if they do let you in,  the other patrons will be looking you up and down making you truly feel as if you don't belong within your own community.Hope you guys a have great time!

40,Ashleigh A.,"New York, NY",10,10,8,3.0,1/16/2015,"I have had more than a few fun, boozy nights here thanks to the especially cheap happy hour.It's a Hell's Kitchen hole-in-the-wall, which I always enjoy, but it's really the sort of place that you start the night so you can drink as much as you like cheaply, not finish it.  In fact, finishing the night there is likely the result of being incredibly drunk (but who has a problem with that?).The shirtless bartenders are nice (they know that because of the limited bar space, waits can be REALLY long).  The drinks aren't great, but they'll get the job done if you're the sort that can over look the cheap, disgusting house liquor (like me), you'll be able to have a ton of fun dancing to awesome music with a lively after work crowd any day of the week.Happy hour is from 3-9 EVERYDAY. Need I really say more?  $4 house liquor and $3 draft beer.  The DJ is so much fun, and some nights they have activities like Drag Bingo on Tuesdays (I've won drinks, my tab was taken care of and meals at other hot spots like LIPS).     Pros: Great music, sweet AND good-looking bartenders, cheap-o drinks, sense of community: so many people are regulars so everyone knows everyone     Cons: Cheap liquor used, super crowded happy hours that cause long bar waits, strange odor throughout",,1,1
41,Jacob M.,"Philadelphia, PA",275,136,2,3.0,11/19/2013,"Before I begin my review, I think I should note that my one and only experience at this bar has been on a Monday night, so goodness knows what it's actually like on the weekend.The bar is a good size with bar tables and then leather sofas in the back. The decor isn't exactly brilliant: gay bars circa 2002 would be proud though. What the bartenders lack in personality, they make up for in being shirtless and ripped. (Or at least, I do believe that's the bar's mindset.) The drinks were strong though, thank God.It was bingo night when I went which I actually enjoyed. Drunk bingo was surprisingly fun, but the crowd was a tad strange. Boyfriend and I met a few nice people, but overall, there didn't seem to be a lot of mingling unless you were hugged to the bar. Surprisingly though, it was a very diverse crowd which I did appreciate.Overall it's a mixed bag. Some good and some meh. At the very least, my guess would be that it's a stop on your gay ol' bar crawl through Hell's Kitchen.",5,1,

I see a mess, and a mess, and a mess.MESS 1: Two boys who shove their way to the couch and make-out and dry-hump so intensely that they give new meaning to the term ""dry-hump."" No nudity was involved. Though I'm guessing that occurred AFTER they entered the private bathroom together.MESS 2: A LITERAL giant hitting on anyone who would talk to him. Overheard: ""I live right across the street..."" Although his huge stature raises many questions, I don't think you want to find out the answers.MESS 3: That old guy--everyone knows this old guy--who skulks around alone, giving everyone the eye, ""brushing"" up against you as he maneuvers from one dark, creepy corner to the other, and then sits on the couch and watches you dance, licking his lips the entire time.MESS 4: Another old guy passed out on the couch way past his bedtime. He's so wasted that he can't even keep his eyes open while his young lover grinds on him. MESS 5: A stranger from Minnesota who says to me, ""I couldn't imagine this lifestyle 24/7. I don't think New York is for me."" Meanwhile, he's putting his arm around my waist and leaning in for a kiss. Ironic mess.I. Love.Messes.After 1 am, the people who go to Posh can be divided into two very distinct categories: those who want to dance, and those who want to take someone home. I guess you win if you manage to do both.Here's the best tip I can give you: go when you're already drunk. This is key. It means that you won't have to wait in line at the bar for a drink and you won't realize what you're stepping into. Instead, you can head right for the dance floor, which becomes so incredibly crowded that you'll be happy you don't have a glass in hand, spilling beer all over your messy self.You'll get to dance to classics from Cyndi, Whitney, Madonna, and Tina. But you'll also hear your Stefani Germanotta, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, and B. Jean Spears. Go ahead and request songs. The DJs (at least the one I've experienced) is super accommodating. Tip two is to watch your goodies while you're waiting in line for the bathroom. This is not a free-for-all, people. Buy me a drink first. Or since I'm at Posh, make that at least three drinks. I'll need it.",18,34,11

I noticed several patrons being let in the bar, while I was denied entry. Upon inquiring why I was being denied entry the doorman began to yell and threaten me. The doorman stated that I was ""the black man"" that was in the bar earlier ""patting peoples pockets"" I denied the accusation and requested to see the manager. I was informed that the manager was not available. As I waited for the manager to return, the doorman continued to yell the accusations in front of other patrons of the bar, and threatened to call the cops.I waited approximately 45 minutes until the manager returned to the bar, and requested to speak with him. While waiting to speak with the manager I over heard the manager tell the doorman that I was not the black man in the bar earlier patting pockets.I was so upset by the the situation and shocked by the accusation that I left without discussing the incident with the manager. I did call the bar on the afternoon of July 5th to discuss the incident with the bar owner, Mr. Greico. I explained the incident to a staff member, and I was informed that Mr. Greico would call me back immediately, As of July13, 2013 I have not received a telephone call from Mr. Greico.I find it to be extremely troubling that I was  humiliated, embarrassed and accused of being a thief in front of several people and denied entry into Posh Bar, because of the color of my skin.

He get's lots of attention where ever we go- and so he should.

There's a dance floor, though it's small. The music is pretty decent...kind of your standard gay pop remix dance fare. It's very dark inside. Drinks are expensive to me as a Chicagoan, but about what you'd expect to pay in Manhattan I guess.  The door man was friendly.The problems? It's small and gets really crowded. There are only two bartenders. When the bar gets full (as it did both nights I was there) two bartenders aren't enough. It can take forever to get a drink. During one of my attempts at getting a drink I came the closest I've ever come to getting into a bar fight with this asshole standing next to me trying to push me out of the way. I eventually gave up and walked away, as ""New York City jail"" was not one of the things I had listed to experience on this trip.Anyway, my advice for getting a drink is to go to the bartender closer to the front. The one in back seems to cover a larger area of the bar PLUS gets drinks for the roving cocktail waiter so he's totally over-worked. It might be good that there's a wait for drinks as there can also be a wait for the bathrooms. I have it on good authority that there are in fact two bathrooms at Posh. One is in the basement.

I want to say that Scott B. introduced me to this place and got me to go more often 2 years ago when I was still an NYC baby and willing to explore the west side. I've grown up a lot since then, but I was just recently at Posh so here goes.Jen S. and I were having dinner around the corner at a place she wanted to go. She really wanted to get a drink after. I said she could pick the place because quote, ""I always end up taking you to a gay bar."" When we were done dinner, she looked up at me with those big, big eyes of here. Then she said, ""I want to dance"" ... and I didn't feel bad about constantly bringing her to homosexual drinking establishments when we hang out. I'll never feel bad about it AGAIN.We were at Posh pretty early (most of my previous experiences were at night). The place is pretty popular since it has no cover, but I'm pretty sure places not too far from it like The Ritz and 9th Avenue also don't have covers, so it really doesn't matter. Usually, people are having a blast here. The music was all over the place, but they played some Michael Jackson eventually. Some queens gave us a pretty fun show, so it was totally worth going.

91,Miller M.,"New York, NY",119,68,20,3.0,2/23/2008,"My friend Amy came into town from Detroit this week.  What to do...what to do!  Our first night I had no idea where to take her.  She isn't that acquainted with gay culture so I didn't want to take her to some go-go dancing queen zone.  I looked up a few different places on Yelp, and came across Posh.  I read many things about the laid-back atmosphere and friendly demeanor.  Why not?It was a Tuesday and we got there around ten.  There weren't that many people there when we got there, and the people that were there were older and (frankly) unattractive.  The bartender came over and asked us what we wanted.  I ordered two mojitos.  ""Six dollars"" he said.  We gave him fifteen.  Six for each drink and a tip.  He came back with nine dollars, ""no six for both.  Three dollar specials on mojitos tonight.""  Whoohoo for us!!!Took a sip and could tell why they only cost three dollars.  They tasted more like appletinis than mojitos but for only three dollars, I'll take it.  Later in the night things started spicing up.  Me and Amy played the game we like to play when we go out, in which we tell people we meet that we are siblings.  The weirder the person, the more unbelievable our story became.  Miguel from Ecuador asked for my number and I told him not to bother because Amy and I were ""going back to Kenya to finish our psychology and music degrees.""""How interesting, why Kenya?"" Miguel asked, in his thick Ecuadorian accent.  ""Well we have found that Kenyans are having erratic seizures whenever they hear Maroon 5,"" Amy explained.""We've been sent by medical researchers to figure out why,"" I added.Miguel, puzzled, went home to throw away Songs for Jane.  Some tranny started lip synching to some Celine Dion song.  She tripped on herself and her sad excuse for a wig practically fell off.  Some hotty took off his shirt and started dancing.  That was a treat.  Amy and I volunteered to bust a move and received free drink tickets.  People were somewhat appalled at our ""incestuous"" dancing behavior, but seemed to make sense of it when they found out we were from Detroit (don't know what that's about).  I did end up meeting a few cuties.  Got some numbers but still wondering whether or not to follow up or not.  People kept buying us drinks, and giving us attention.   People were very willing to talk and I have to agree, it is probably the least pretentious gay bar I've been to in the city.  I would probably go only during the week because there are better things to do on the weekend.When we left we had barely made a dent in our wallets and were feeling fine, and that's what it's all about isn't it?",7,13,7

112,Chris B.,"New York, NY",75,12,7,1.0,8/7/2010,"Bouncers literally throwing people out and calling them ""cock suckers!""So here's the story. I'm usually not one to pick a fight but I refuse to stand by and watch nonsense like what happened last night occur. I was standing on the porch area with a group of friends, having had 1 drink, one of our friends went in to get the second round. We noticed one of the bouncers being a bit pushy and kinda rude, but hey - that's NY. He probably deals with a lot of stupid people. He started throwing middle fingers in peoples faces and then telling them ""I will F*** you up!"" Which I still was like... ""ehh - people are drunk."" At one point this guy came up and the bouncer told him he had to leave and the guy said he wanted to speak to the manager and then the bouncer told the guy that he would ""f*** him up"" and then threw out ""cock sucker.""At this point I had to step in. I asked the bouncer to clarify what he said and he started screaming at me - the sober one. He was a complete barbarian. He refused to let me speak but had to get his speech in about how he didn't care what I or anyone thought. Mind you, I was completely sober and am usually very quite - I then had to speak to the ""head of security"" at which point my boyfriend joined me and we explained how inappropriate this was - our concerns fell upon deaf ears. Luckily my handy iPhone 4 jumped out of my pocket and decided to document the entire thing.I don't really care how much the drinks are, how drunk someone is or what type of night you're having as a bouncer, you do NOT call a patron a cock sucker, especially at a gay establishment in Hells Kitchen. Not to mention the rest of the night he was completely unprofessional. Posh and their employees need to realize that they can't discriminate against their only source of revenue - I mean, haven't they heard the old saying ""Don't bite the hand that feeds you?"" Avoid this place at all costs - in such a pivotal time as a community, we can't support someone that so blatantly doesn't support us.",3,2,2

137,Bryan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,36,0,3.0,12/11/2007,"nothing like Pink and Fergie at 4 in the morning.  It's true this is one of the less pretentious gay bars in Hell's Kitchen.  A good mix of different types of guys.  It gets really really crowded, but so does everywhere.",2,2,2
138,Barry M.,"New York, NY",12,59,0,5.0,6/21/2009,"If you are looking for a friendly neighborhood bar this is it. Unlike some of the other bars in the area, there is no attitude....just friendly people. The bartenders pour a great (strong) drink.",1,,1
139,K K.,"Queens, NY",18,135,31,4.0,8/8/2009,"Posh is pretty fun.  Although it is small, there seems to be only one bathroom, but most people don't know that there are two, it is dark throughout the whole place, its fun.Every time im  in midtown, I always go to POSH.The people who are not regulars are fun and inviting, although the regulars don't seem to talk to anyone but.  The drinks are reasonably priced for midtown.There are couches in the back to chill if you need a minute to recoup and the place has air conditioning and its not too hot (which I cant say about other clubs/bars in the area)Fun times",1,,
140,Tom B.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,69,0,4.0,10/28/2006,"I went here Friday night with some friends and we had a really good time! Like Sam says in his review, it is not as nice as Therapy but it really is more fun. The music was great and I enjoyed the small impromptu dance floor. The crowd was young, hip, and attractive. Most importantly, Posh was free of attitude! Guys were very friendly and approachable. Drinks were nice and strong and I happened to be handed a free drink card from one of the owners! Nice touch! Check it out!",2,1,2
141,Samantha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,378,44,4.0,2/20/2008,We ended up barely waiting to go inside this divey very unPosh bar. The music here (which is so regular at gay bars) was much better than the previous place we had hit up and I ended up dancing here and having a really great time. It was very dark and grimy but I liked that although as my friends began to take off their loafers and grind on the dance floor I inwardly cringed and debated running after them with my clean-wipes. Its a cute place that gets pretty crowded but its great fun.,2,1,2
142,Joseph R.,"Brookline, MA",256,24,0,1.0,3/1/2007,"Certainly one of the worst experiences at a gay bar in NYC.  I had a great time one time before I was drugged by someone at the bar - so clearly, either the clientale is sketchy, or the sketchy people just happen to find their way here.  I vote NO for going there ever again.",3,,
143,Christopher T.,"Manhattan, NY",96,610,9,2.0,5/8/2007,"I've been twice, the second time i only stuck around for 20minutes before my friends were convinced as i. It's small and the guys inside are ugly. The DJ doesnt have any good music in his collection, and the back sofa area is so scandi. I have nothing else to say, that's all.",2,,1
144,Buddy S.,"Boston, MA",43,85,14,3.0,10/17/2011,The drinks were good.  It's a really tiny place with a sort of dance floor.  The crowd tends to be on the younger crowd (21-28).  It was very packed and hard to find a place to just stand without getting pushed.  Watch your drinks because the guy shoving into you isn't.,,,
145,Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",483,103,364,4.0,2/2/2011,"so coming from san francisco,ca-capitol of gays!! i walked across posh the whole week i was there!! came in friday night and it so happened to have live kareoke!! never acutually did live kareoke with band behind me but it was quite the experince with a few vodka tonics under my belt...i had a blast there and the drinks were dirt cheap!!! my kinda spot for a girl on a drinking budget!! the place was small but well worth your money if you wanna get your drink on for the cheap and listen to some good music!! i will be going back this summer to start off the night maybe even come back after the straight bars for round three!!",1,1,1
146,Brian H.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,21,0,2.0,8/22/2007,"Everyone I know Loves this place.  Ehh.  I have been here several times and when I'm not getting drinks spilled on me (last Saturday) I am being leered at by the strangest people.  If I had a dime for everytime some stranger asked me why I don't have a boyfriend, (is this a compliment or an insult?) I could buy one and move to Palm Springs.",1,2,
147,Tyrone W.,"Washington, DC",194,115,0,2.0,5/5/2009,"Where does NYC party on Sunday night?! Apparently I'm not in the know was vdoing an extended weekend in the City with a friend from Chicago and while I had an okay time there was hardly anyone thereee. The dj was spinning decent tunes too but who wants to dance in a half empty joint. The drinks were reasobably priced that night though and we got free shots (I think it was the owner or maybe manager's bday?!) Def. seems like it could get on and poppin' but maybe on a Friday or Sat. night I'll try it again soon. Also wasn't terribly large! I'm really not liking this lounge trend that's all the rave in the ""gay scene"" now because we all want to get pretty, stand around, and look at one another. Shit I can do that at home!",,2,
148,Mathew S.,"San Francisco, CA",58,95,1,4.0,4/18/2008,"Went to Posh after meeting up with friends at Vynl (see review) for a drink.  At first I was a little hesitant about the place.  Maybe it's because I had only had one drink so far in the night.  It was pretty crowded and hard to move around, but I wound up really liking the mix of people here.  No one seemed to pretentious, just there to have a good time with friends.  Apparently people were dancing towards the back of the bar.  I don't know how, the place is pretty tight quarters.  Be prepared to be very intimate with your neighbors, as you're not going to get much personal space if you go on a crowded night.  All in all, good times.",1,,1

150,aaron d.,"San Diego, CA",10,12,0,3.0,3/28/2009,This was the conclusion to my first night in NY.  The vibe was slightly off and the crowd wasn't as good looking as Vlada.  I still had a great time as I was busy showing off my eye-candy Manhattan Man to that very same crowd.  I felt like if I would have gone in further I would've gotten stabbed or something.  I'll definitely be back.,,,
151,Thom B.,"Washington, DC",62,86,5,4.0,12/10/2008,"I've been to posh several times, and each time it has been a very positive experience.  After all, the happy hour is to DIE for!  Seriously, to die for!  The bartenders are typically very good, and they mix a mean drink, one that is not  too strong, but also one that deliciously intoxicating.  However, the bathrooms are odd, usually without paper towels or soap (ick).  It's an okay place for a small group, and it can become VERY loud after 7ish.  I say go go, and drink during happy hour.",,,
152,Kelly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,93,2,1.0,2/13/2010,overcrowded to the point you can't move.  strong drinks made with low quality alcohol that's cheap.  rude bartender. mix is hit or miss - good dance music mixed in with hanson boys.,,,
153,Jonathan W.,"New York, NY",72,186,5,4.0,2/11/2007,i had a great time there last night - it's usually the place i'd suggest going to after work (as work isn't too far away) - anyway - packed - asses to elbows on a saturday - great music by dj anthony velantis - the bathroom situation is a little wonky - either stagger downstairs to your death as you descend the most narrow staircase ever - or stand in line upstairs in a bathroom that seems to have been added as an afterthought - cushy couches - good drinks - pretty decent people (not so much the lookers during happy hour - but they get more attractive as the night goes on - or is that the beer goggling?) - anyway - it's cute - it's fun - check it out.,2,,2
