1,Amber K.,"New York, NY",17,51,0.0,2.0,10/5/2018,"I went to Otto's Shrunken Head with a large group of coworkers last night. We brought in some pizzas. As we were placing the pizzas on one of the tables this belligerent-looking guy came and stood aggressively close behind the young woman organizing them, obviously wanting to snag some pizza. One of our male coworkers came over and politely was like ""hey, these pizzas are for this group of people here."" Something like that. And the guy was like ""I'M THE BAR BACK HERE, FUCK OFF!"" And he kept on saying ""fuck off"" and grumbling, in this mix of super-agro and is-he-going-to-cry, until we handed him a paper plate. Personally I don't have an issue offering the bar back some pizza, but you're not famous, bro. We don't know you're the bar back. Also, after spending the whole evening there, it still wouldn't be obvious he's the bar back. As far as I can tell he's just the guy who hangs out sullen-style at the end of the bar *not* working.I acknowledge that when you step inside Otto's Shrunken Head, it's obviously punk-vibed. Maybe our group was automatically worthy of this guy's contempt because he considers himself ""hardcore"" and and we were all ""smiling"" and ""having fun"" and some of us weren't wearing all black, and we should have just gone with it. But everyone else who worked there was professional and lovely. And I'm fine with gruff. Bring on the gruff. Mr. Lowbloodsugar, however, needs to get his sh*t under control.",1,1,

You have to put down a $ deposit to get in the spirit of the place and have your tropical boozy drinks served in the cool tiki glasses and you can keep them, or return them to get your $ back (or you can be uncool and cheap and get your drink in plain boring glassware). We tried the:Stormy Skull - rum, coconut & ginger YUM Zombie - tasted like sex on the beach Flying fish - tasted like candy & RedullNo food here, just chips.Dress super casual, wear ur Hawaiian shirt. Arrive early to snag a booth. Note: If you're going to multiple bars, don't buy the glassware.

Updated review","Otto's Shrunken Head has gone downhill since I first started coming in 2013, which is pretty disappointing. For years, it was my favorite bar in the East Village, for its excellent drinks, relaxed yet, wild atmosphere, and  that fact that it was pretty lowkey.It's not as lowkey as it once was, it's been packed during all my recent visits. Getting a drink takes much longer than it used to, and I can barely get a seat at the bar. Worst of all, the drink prices have gone up ridiculously. Back in 2013, a drink was only $10, with a $5 deposit on the mug, and my usual Volcano Blast was $26. Now, a tiki drink sets you back $14 with a $6 deposit on the mug, and a Volcano Blast will run you $35. This is close to a 50% price increase in about 5 years, but I'm still getting the same drink. This makes things pretty rough, because they still don't accept credit cards. I generally drink between 3 and 5 drinks on a typical night out, not including any drinks I buy for my company. But I generally do not carry more than $50 in cash, meaning I'd only be able to get 3 drinks.The prices are a high now, but I still like coming here for the memories I have of the place.",2,,2

13,Laura J.,"Seaford, NY",30,125,91,4.0,2/2/2018,"It's hard to find good and strong tiki drinks in the city but Otto's delivers. Decked out in light up blow fish and shrunken heads hanging in the window, it's everything you want a tiki bar to be! They have a pretty extensive menu of all different kinds of tiki drinks. For our first round I had the Singapore Sling (gin and cherry mix) and my friend had the Stormy Skull (dark rum, ginger and coconut) and both were delicious. For our second round I had a traditional dark and stormy (made PERFECTLY!!!!) and my friend had a cosmo.  They have a small room in the back which had a comedian when we got there and later switched to a cover band.  We were here on a Wednesday and there was a decent crowd so I'd imagine on the weekends it gets pretty crowded. Otto's is definitely a cool place to come and have some me fun drinks. Their volcano blast is in my near future!",2,2,2

I love getting them in the tiki mugs with the umbrella and decorations. Even if you don't get a tiki mug they still decorate the drink with cute umbrellas and other decorations. The vibe is this place is gritty, but in a good way. They have a room in the bad for bands to play. It's fun to get some cool drinks and just chill listening to the music. My only complaint is that they don't take credit cards. There is an ATM, but it's frustrating because these days who carries around cash because like everywhere takes cards.

18,Jennifer N.,"Worcester, MA",43,35,23,5.0,9/5/2018,"We stopped by at Otto's on our last night in town. It was labor day weekend, so there weren't a lot of people there. That was fine by us since we were there for the music. Apparently every Sunday there is a wind-down event of live music all day. We arrived after 8 so we missed most of the music but as musicians, we were in for a real treat. Hopefully, he reads this- but Rick Eckerle and his band were AMAZING. They played the most amazing covers where they were different enough that you had to lean in to try and figure out what they were. His voice had shades of Nick Cave and Bowie (thankfully, he ended the night singing Heroes). I know this is supposed to be a review of the venue/bar and it is... the owner of the bar has certainly selected great acts to play the venue. Sean Morrison was doing a musical comedy set of very short songs that were equally hilarious and shocking. I apologize for heckling so strongly but it is rare that an act is funny enough for me to engage.The drinks were very very tasty and strong. They were a tad expensive, however it is Manhatten so what do you expect?",,,

21,Mitch T.,"Pomona, CA",94,1,0,5.0,8/22/2018,"I was feeling like having some rum & fruit juice and Otto's Shrunken Head certainly hit the spot. It's a bit more divey than most tiki bars that I've been to but that's mostly 'cuz they're really leaving into it with the red vinyl booths & zebra print barstools. Their tiki bar classics are delicious as are their signature drinks. They make you pay a little extra to get drinks served in one of their drink-specific mugs, but they refund a portion of that so long as you bring it back to the bar after you're done, so it's absolutely with it. I ended up getting the Pinky's Potion which is the bartender's choice & Jodi made a delicious ""Stormy Daniels aka the Achilles's Heel"", on top of providing some real excellent service throughout the night. If you love tiki bars or are a fan of rum & fruit juice, generally, you should definitely come here.",,,

I have a love for tiki bars, the fun glassware, the fruity, strong drinks and the tunes that normally follow. Otto's has been a NY staple for ages. There's a reason it has stuck around for so long. Last time I was here it was a xmas party- after party. Madness to say the least. There was a giant posse that waved in. And before I knew it, I spotted the bowls ""Volcano Blast"". I was going to avoid the bowls at this round since, work was still the next day. Luckily my co worker's band was starting at 10ish. The space in the back was intimate space and plenty of seating. And a little space to get your booty shaking!  There is also a PHOTOBOOTH!!! This place literally has it all. I also love that the ladies room is huge, brightly lit and with a full length mirror. This is necessary for last minute beauty fixes. This whole bar is a photo shoot waiting to happen with funky wall paper and trinkets galore. There's always fun dj nights and rockabilly, rock n roll and punk style bands. A must see when in NY, when entertaining friends or when you get you get a craving for the kitsch!  It does come at a price for drinks but hey, it's NY!Thanks to bartender Zofia the other night for handling all my drunken co workers with finesse!",4,1,5

Otto's Shrunken Head definitely has a different feel than many other bars in NYC, and it does it well. It's unique and intriguing to the extent of elevating it from ""Hey there's a cool bar that you should check out"" to ""Yo this place is dope! You gotta hit it up!"" Pricing is on the ritzier side for a dive bar, although happy hour can balance for that. The drinks were decent, varied, and didn't taste that strong. In fact, I think they only put a little bit of alco... and now I'm drunk.",,,
24,Kyle S.,"New Albany, IN",63,492,129,4.0,1/29/2018,"Nestled in the East Village, Otto's Shrunken Head was a bit of a trek from the nearest train station.  The streets were nearly empty as we made our way toward our destination.  We weren't sure what we were looking for, but it was obvious as a glance.  There, tucked into a building in the middle of the block were neon lights and a window jammed with as many Tiki statues, mugs, and flowers as would fit, blocking the world's ability to determine what evils lurk behind the snarling wooden grotesques; the kind of window that would scare an over protective mother, holding her children a little closer as they pass.   Given the packed-to-the-gills look of the window, I expected a flea market of Polynesian memorabilia lining every space that didn't need to host a customer.  To my surprise, the room was actually quite spacious and organized.  Bathed in blue light, a sizable bar occupied the prime real estate with a row of rounded booths with tufted red vinyl seats parked to the left.  Puffer fish, Christmas lights and even the occasional lamp dimly lit the room. All of the walls were covered bamboo-framed beach patterns to set the mood and create a mash up of tropical and rockabilly.  We were visiting on a Wednesday, and there were only a handful of patrons occupying the barstools.  Their easy banter with the bartender made us assume that they were regulars, locals.  Regardless, the bar tender was extremely friendly to a couple of Hoosiers who had made their way to where she hangs her shingle.  There is no food menu, just a great list of drinks with a healthy focus on Tiki.  You can order your drink in either the designated Tiki mug or you can be dumb and get it in a pint glass.  At $14 per drink plus $6 per glass (except the signature glass) if you want to hold onto it, the beverage menu is a pretty good deal.  Otto's has one signature mug that is made exclusively for them and, I've got to say, it is probably one of my favorites.  Like the bar itself, it is a great mix of cultures and will sit proudly in our bar.  The rest of the mugs are pretty commonplace, but a fun mix and there were a couple that we hadn't seen very often so we ended up with three souvenirs, all well wrapped and boxed.  But what about what's in the mugs?  Like I said before, this place has no food, so the drinks better be good.  And they were!  We ordered a Mai Tai to start things off because this classic is where the bar gets set.  Honestly, it wasn't the best that I've had, but it was certainly a solid effort with fine flavor and a mellow bite.  In fact, none of the drinks we ordered that night had a kick that made you think that the woman shaking the ice was anything short of masterful.  My favorite was the signature drink, Shrunken Head ($25 and you keep the glass or $14 in a pint glass, but come on, this is a bad ass glass).  I do wish that the drink descriptions would include more of what is in the recipe rather than the general polished wording on the concoction, but given that each was delightful, I'm not going to hold that opinion too strongly.Otto's is definitely worth a trip if you're in the mood for a taste of a different set of islands while you're in Manhattan.  An excellent blend of cultures in its own melting pot gets thumbs up from me.",1,,1
25,Ana Lee M.,"New Milford, NJ",639,128,161,5.0,5/28/2017,"Otto's Shrunken head is a hawaii themed dive bar. Once you're inside, they have tiki decorations from puffer fish lanterns to tiki themed drinks. The crowd is very different. Something i'm not used to. There were some people dressed up (I guess monster themed?), and others were dressed like they were in the 80's. It was very interesting.The music was a bunch of throwbacks as well, but they also had a live band. When you order drinks they provide tiki themed cups, but you have to put down a $5 deposit so you can either keep the cups, or get your deposit back. I have heard a lot about the volcano drinks which is $30 and can serve up to four people. I had expected to get buzzed because I always assume they water drinks like this down, but NOPE! I definitely felt good, so my friends and I ordered another volcano. They serve the drink in this big bowl, and in the middle it's on fire (like a volcano...get it? haha). You can share amongst others or if you're in the mood to get wasted then a bowl for a party of one should do the trick. It's an overall good time, and I would definitely come back to revisit this place when the time comes.",2,2,1

And this is what makes it so unique.A friend and I dropped by Friday after work, and started out with a Zombie and a Stormy Skull, respectively. We couldn't resist putting down $6 deposits to be able to enjoy them from their mugs, which we later collected and promptly spent on a round of beer.The Stormy Skull, complete with dark rum, coconut, and ginger, hit the spot, and the Zombie spoke for itself.

That's not a bad thing, it's got a specific aesthetic and style. Drinks can be hit or miss, and at the tail end of the night, they may send you over the top if you're not careful. The cash-only aspect can be a bit of a bummer, but at least there's an ATM close by. If you're used to the west coast tiki bars, you'll be very confused by this punk/dive bar, gone tiki... but settle in, talk to the person next to you and before you know it, you won't miss the high shelf liquor or custom-made mixes.

One came in a monkey mug and was *very* strong, my zombie was above average, but the other (pig mug) was really quite weak and my friends didn't want to stick around.

They have an amazing selection of ceramic tiki mugs, which you can enjoy any of your beverages from, and take home with you (for a deposit).Lori is an awesome bartender who made great drink recommendations. The Mai Tai here is my favorite drink on the menu. Less sweet than a typical Mai Tai, with a heavy pour of 80 proof dark rums and a bit of lime. I also tried the Shrunken Skirt, which was sweet and mango flavored, and the Stormy Skull, which tasted like a delicious coconut version of a dark and stormy.

32,Maud D.,"New York, NY",347,136,14,5.0,2/26/2016,"This place fills me with joy for a number of reasons, the first being that it's so purely East Village in a way that I remember from a combination of my childhood growing up in the city and probably from stories my mom used to tell me about the glory days of the city, in equal measure. Pop into this grungy tiki paradise and you'll be met with a bevy of old New York punk types, the ladies in granny boots and funny glasses, and the men with ponytails. It's not a young crowd -- these are locals for sure. But you'll also be met with solid drinks and a fun atmosphere. It's a home run in my book. If you're looking for foofy fancy tiki, though, go elsewhere. I love weird New York stuff and tiki, so for me, this place is perfect. You won't find the fancy pants tiki inventions you used to see at PKNY, but you also won't see the crazy prices you used to find there either. And for just $5, you can keep your mug! The last time I was there, my guy and I got a pair of great ones -- a shade-throwing parrot and a pirate, so it was a great investment. I recommend the Ruby Jewels, which is basically a dangerous Shirley Temple, which is basically what I would always drink if I was totally shameless and willing to own my true desires. My boo got the Scurvy Dog, which is a butterscotchy delight. You're basically drinking candy however you choose to go, but that's part of the fun of tiki, right?!",6,6,7

This tiki dive is amazing. I came here on halloween last year and had a great time. Besides normal drinks, they have a wide array of beachy tiki drinks you can get straight up or served in a fancy take-home mug. The bar itself its a narrow area but in back there is a small venue for local performers. When we were there a live band was playing, but we opted to stay in front. The only criticism I have is that, while I appreciate no wait or cover charge, the place is so crowded that random people actually had to corral the crowd in order for anyone to move anywhere. This probably isn't anything new in the Manhattan bar scene, but annoying nonetheless.",3,2,1

Did she think I was trying to slip away without leaving a tip? I'm always mistaken for East Asian and they're stereotyped for not tipping well. Was she stereotyping me?Really, why did she ask this? My head hurts from thinking about it (and also from the 4 cocktails I had at another bar).Why 2 stars and not one? 2 reasons...1. She recommend a drink (Otto's Octane), which was similar to something I had in mind, and it was great.2. She asked for my I.D., which made me feel younger.",4,6,

I understand this place is more of a live music scene at night, and since that is the case, why are they charging $15 for drinks during the day? Better yet, why did they need to scan my driver's license just to be served? I was 21 over 25 years ago. I went just to cross it off of my list of tiki places to visit.

53,William K.,"Brooklyn, NY",176,65,540,4.0,3/12/2016,"Otto's is a NYC staple!  Great Tiki drinks, cheap beers, DJ's in front, dope small band room in the back with an eclectic line up and one of the last remaining B&W ""Film"" photo booths.  The original B&W Photo booth will always be a draw for me.  We have lost most of them or they have been replaced with the digital versions.  No one really wants to service them anymore.  This one is owned by a local woman who comes in and refills the developing chemicals and services it to keep it running well.  It takes only tokens and they can be purchased for $5 at the bar.  It is totally worth it.The Tiki drinks are what you would expect and range from classic small drinks to full Scorpion Bowls to share with upwards of 5 to 6 people.  They carry 'Not Your Fathers Root beer', one of my favorite new bottled drinks.  They are also using the alcoholic soda in a Root Beer Ice Cream Float for 2 for only $30.  A fun treat if you like the sweet side.The DJ's are always great and it's nice to have a physical presence and not just pandora.  You can DJ and just play great mixes.  I feel like when you mention bars have DJ's, one tends to think your going to here Hip Hop or House or EDM.  But sometimes its just dope old school metal and death rock or classic 60's tracks played on 45's.The small band room in the back is another huge draw for me.  With the railroad style layout of the bar you can easily enjoy the dj music at front or a band in the back with no conflict.  It never seems to be too overly crowded and the patrons tend to rotate through rather quickly. The staff is always friendly and the crowd is as well... think Beauty Bar or unpretentious old Williamsburg dives.",5,1,3

We went in on a night it should have been decently busy and it was empty, which would have been fine, but only the old male regulars were there and I felt a bit exposed. Sure enough, at one point one of them came over to tell me how beautiful we were and to ask us a series of drunken nonsensical questions. Also, someone was smoking a cigar right next to the wide open door, so the whole place reeked and was stuffy. It's too bad. The tiki cocktails are silly and fun. And I would have loved this place when I was still in college, but now, it feels sad. (Maybe not when it's full.) I love a good tiki bar, but if Im gonna get a sweet drink it needs to  have higher quality ingredients and recipes, otherwise Ill get a crazy hangover. I guess I'm more into tiki inspired cocktail bars. The moment she grabbed a giant bottle of shitty flavored liquor I knew this wasn't for me. That being said, a lot of my friends love this place, so judge for yourself. Its worth going once, if only to gaze at all the tiki mugs they offer.",1,,

They play a lot of surfer rock and some punk, and the drinks were pretty strong. It was a great pre-game before a night on the town.

Also tried the Pina Colada and that wasn't a good last choice, way too processed tasting. I would stay away from frozen drinks and stick with their actual signature ones.Overall, I had a fun time.

63,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,484,1951,4.0,9/20/2015,"Had been meaning to make it in here at the recommendation of an acquaintance. This place is such a hodgepodge of contradictions that it is so right for me. A lot of dive, with some music, with a funny bouncer, with tiki mugs and a random crowd.This is the type of place where you meet a stranger, you become friends and become regulars.  But if your relationship dies down, then you'll have to pick who gets to keep this bar. Great for people watching in the booths. I didnt get to sit at the bar but I suspect it's second fiddle to the booths or the live music stage in the rear. Either way I think coming here alone would lead to a good time too.  I had great company and was beyond entertained.Didn't have time to take pics because I was enjoying myself and the dimly lit atmosphère did not need to be corrupted by flashing lights. Didnt use the bathroom, nor start a tab, so I cannot comment on that.However, this place truly honors the dive bar spirit: it is all about the drink. Those bowls may feel light at first but they do creep up on you. We imbibed on a volcano punchbowl that looked like it was filled with Pang's punch.   I'm not 100% certain what it was tbh but I thank the genteel lad that tried to flame the fire in our souls with the bowl and it's 151 shot!

65,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1851,4.0,6/26/2014,"I've been meaning to check out Otto's for years, and finally went there yesterday around 7pm when the front room was mostly empty and there was a free open mic comedy show going on in the small back room (where bands often play). Probably should have come sooner as the drinks are now up to $12 ea (I guess they were $10 for the longest time). If they were $9 I probably would have bumped them up to 5 stars, I'm just too frugal to be dropping $12 on a single drink (especially in a dive), do you know how many dumplings or bud lights you can get for that money? A lot if you know where to look. Anywho Otto's Shrunken Head for those unfamiliar is quite the well known tiki dive. It's the exact combination of a classic dive bar and a kitschy tropical tiki bar that you just don't see much of on this coast. I'm assuming the place gets rowdy as they run your ID through a machine, are cash only, and have a number of security cameras. Luckily the place was mostly empty and really laid back when I came. In addition to the back room the bar features a few nice booths, a pin ball machine, a photo booth, and buck hunter. Happy Hour runs until 8pm but only includes 2 for 1 Bud/Bud Lights ($5). The real reason to come here is their awesome selection of tropical drinks and glasses. There's 16 tropical drinks on the rocks, 15 of which in their own unique ceramic tiki glass. There's also a special tiki themed shot, and 7 types of frozen drinks. Most options are $12 ($17 if you want to keep the glass), the special shot is $8 (not sure if that includes the glass), as well as the large Volcano Blast bowl (good for a few people) which is $30 (bowl not available for sale). All drinks come with a piece of pineapple, maraschino cherry, plastic monkey, umbrella, and a frilly straw. It's just over the top enough to be fun and not ""girly"". They also have other merch like an amazing limited edition shrunken head glass for $40, t-shirts for $20, and a few other things. I had the Otto's Octane and the Pang's Punch and tried the Wicked Willie, my slight OCD certainly makes me want to go back to try them all. Here's my breakdown of those three:-Wicked Willie (monkey glass): ""Passion Fruit, pineapple and a suprising kick! Keeps you keepin' on"". This was delicious and tasted like a hawaiin punch juice box. It was sweet but not overly sugary.-Pangs Punch (reg glass with a glow stick in it): ""Our very own glow in the dark radioactive rum punch"". This blue punch was equally delicious and had a prodominantly coconut flavor to it. Again sweet, but not overly sugary. -Otto's Octane (classic tiki glass): ""Our pineapple rum, coffee liquer & banana concoction will help speed you to your destination"". This was the clear winner. Not only was it one of the coolest glasses but the Kahlua balanced the fruit flavors out and it just was amazingly delicious, I certainly wished I had a beach to enjoy this on.",5,1,1

A once punk bar, now kinda punk bar but mostly tiki bar, it is as confused and in denial as a teenager going through those important life things.Don't get me wrong - I love tiki bars more than a everything bagel on Sunday - but Otto's identity crisis leaves me wanting more. Also, the drinks, aside from the Mai Tai, are sweet garbage (in their defense, this could be said about any tiki bar).Despite it's two-faced profile, I still very much appreciate Otto's and its longstanding tenure in the East Village.",1,4,

The atmosphere doesn't feel kitschy or overly done. In fact, it almost feels like a neighborhood dive bar that happens to have a dedicated tiki theme. We came on a Saturday night when a nearby bar was packed to overcapacity, and we're glad to find an interesting bar without the jostling and poking elbows. Note: cash only, and if you want the tiki glasses they make you give a $5 deposit. I also got the sense when we remembered to ask for that deposit back that they are counting on the drinks being strong enough that you won't remember to request your $5 back. Don't be that guy. You deserve your deposit. Or the glass....(jk)",,,

77,Alice H.,"New York, NY",0,23,27,2.0,6/29/2016,"Always wanted to check out this place, and finally decided to come on a Wednesday night after coming back from Hawaii and still thinking about their tiki drinks. We got here around 8pm and the place was already full. We've waited so long for our drinks but we totally understand, given there was only 1 bartender serving the whole house. This place gets so loud and if you want to have a convo with your friends without yelling out of your lungs, you should go somewhere else. The whole dive bar is tacky and ugly. Personally I don't find their drinks appetizing. Totally don't get how everyone is raving about their ""great"" cocktails. With $14/tiki drink I can get a better shaken cocktail at a fancier cocktail bar with real fruit juices and better liquor. We ordered the Wicked Willie and Mai Tai, the cocktails tasted like they were made from cheap liquors and artificial fruit flavored syrups. Gross. You can pay $6 deposit for the tiki mugs, which comes up to $20/drink. We decided we didn't want the mugs and asked for the bartender for the deposit and that took such a long time as well. While we were drinking and chatting among ourselves, this guy who works at the bar but not the bartender came and started to collect the emptied mugs, he suddenly shouted and startled all of us. When we looked over at him, he didn't say anything and just pointed to the mugs beside our drinks hinting if that was ours I suppose? We said they aren't ours and he just took the mugs and walked away. He was rude and there's really no need to raise your voice when you are literally right beside us. That just killed it.

We sat at a booth but when no one came we figured we just had to get our drinks ourselves. There were two bartenders standing there with their backs turned away from the counter. One was cleaning bottles and the other was eating. I tried to get the attention of the one eating, she just ignored me trying to call her and then she moved from around the counter to go outside and talk to her friend. I then tried to get the attention of the second bartender but she just continued cleaning. Shortly after the buss boy went behind the bar and was standing just a few inches from the bartender. I told him that I would like to order a drink and his response was ""I'm not the bartender""- that's it! He never attempted to get the bartenders Attention for me even though he was standing within arms length from her.Eventually she turned around and I ordered the volcano drink. When it was ready she didn't bring it to me, I had to get back up and get it myself. It came up to $35 and to my surprise they only took cash. I couldn't find a sign any where that said ""cash only"" and on top of that you have to pay for each drink up front which is annoying when you're ordering multiple drinks. It would be nice to just pay for everything together.",2,1,

I was really looking forward to the fact that it was Tiki themed and it just looked like a really cool.

Tasted like straight up passion fruit juice and pineapple from the Wicked Willie drink. Overall, cute drink mugs, either u keep it to pay $20 or you just pay $14 for a regular glass. I didn't read the fine lines till after ordering my drink lol, but they do give back you're $6 per drink if you return the cool mug. Overall, drinks need more alcohol, less juice.",1,,

This treasure of a dive bar drips with Tiki-ness and cheap liquor... If your on the east side of Manhattan you better make sure you enter this domain and sip some Polynesian pleasure. One of the many qualities about OTTO's  is you'll still find many locals and a few drunks enjoying intoxicating punch and straight shots while enjoying the company's of new & old bar mates from parts unknown.. Live music is located in the back room, so entertainment is a plus. After all you can only drink so much prior to passing out and becoming the entertainment.Watch out for glowing green drinks served for $12, it's the reason I lost my mind in NYC. It's either I drank to many or aliens abducted me. Cause I have no recollection of my wear a outs for 12 hours. I also think this caused the 70's NYC Black Out.You have nothing to fear and everything to gain by entering the finest TIKI BAR on the island! So drink up!",5,3,6

If you want to fluff out your poodle skirt and ride up on your motorcycle- check out their two rockabilly nights- ""Thee Midnight Monster Hop"" and ""Rebel Night"". Go to their website and click events for more info about these two nights. It's definitely something to be a part of even if you don't dress up! The sights and sounds is worth it alone.I also held my birthday party here and they of course were awesome! I worked out a package where I got reserved tables and my party got discounted drinks for the whole night.On to the drinks- amazing! Getting the volcano drink is a must- but you cant go wrong with just about anything you choose. I love Pang's Punch and by the end of the night, I'm covered in the glowsticks they come with.

I hate that it's cash only. The music is too loud (which I can forgive b/c it's a dive bar afterall) The decor is really nice, cool space. I love the lit wallpaper and the booths to sit. The tiki mugs to purchase are also super cute & affordable. Not really a fan of the service/drinks.

Been here a couple times for shows and a drunkenly good time. I have yet to get a cool mug, I definitely want to take them up on the offer of just having them keep the extra $5 and walking out with the mug.They have cheap beers and usually strong tiki drinks. Though the last time the lychee drink seemed to not have any liquor in it. Still delicious nonetheless.

I was so excited, I got to keep the best cat mug and drink Daquiris in it all night.

108,Eric V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",59,242,18,4.0,8/16/2015,"Love this NYC tiki bar.I've been to some of the top tiki bars throughout the country (namely La Mariana in Honolulu, Tiki Ti in Los Angeles, Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago, Tonga Room and Smuggler's Cove in San Francisco . . . and I'd put Otto's up there with the best of them (Three Dots and a Dash being my favorite).  Otto's is a dive -- but that's a good thing. The place has a half-dozen booths and a bar seating maybe 15-20 people and that's about it.  There was live music in the back which appeared to accommodate more seating but I didn't venture back there so I'm not sure how much more room the place provides for seating.  Nevertheless, we got in quickly and instantly found two open seats at the bar on a crowded Saturday night around 11pm.  The place was VERY loud and it was difficult to communicate with the bartenders but the girls tending bar were very professional and more than adequate in a fast-paced environment.  Mixing tiki drinks is obviously a process and it seemed you never had to wait too long to order the next drink.For me, the drinks were way too potent.  Also, the combination of ingredients in the drinks wasn't balanced very well making them too strong and detracted from the taste.The highlight, for me, were the tiki glasses.  I collect them from all of my stops across the country and Otto's had some great glasses and you can take them home for a VERY affordable $5 apiece.  I bought six (with one of them being a very cool limited edition piece for $40).",2,,1

The specialty Tiki cocktails were great. For an extra 5 bucks you can take the specialty glasses home. Happy Hour also had 2 for 1 on Well Cocktails or Bud/Bud light. Decor was great, as well as the much needed air conditioning. Only drawbacks here is...there is no food. When you have craft cocktails this strong and good, just offering potato chips isn't a enough. Sadly we couldn't handle more than one specialty cocktail without food and had to go somewhere else. Will be back again...after we eat first.",1,1,1

There were suits, randoms, and weirdos sipping island drinks and PBRs side by side, so that was a nice throwback to what I assume bars in New York might have been like 30 years ago. Beer selection was OK. You probably want to try one of their colorful cocktails--it seemed to be the thing to do.I realize it was a free show, but the staff could have done a better job preparing the stage for the performers. The ZZ top guy who rolled in late to finally do it was kind of disruptive to the audience and made the band nervous.It's not quite my kind of bar, but it might be yours.",1,1,1

However, Otto's is one of the oldest ""dives"" in the east village and instead of closing, they seemed to be forced to raise their drink prices.  Their cheapest drinks are $4 PBR pints. Everything else is very steep from there. I went to this bar recently with some friends for the first time for a Johnny Cash Live Cover show with various bands. Well, the bands were terrible and hardly sang any Cash songs. However, towards the front of the bar, they were playing nothing but Johnny Cash songs.....some were very rare. It was enjoyable for a while. I also felt that the bartenders working on that Friday night were very robotic and unfriendly. After a couple beers, I didn't even feel like tipping them because they couldn't even smile when serving folks. I got the impression they didn't want to be working there. The patrons seemed to consist mostly of  older 40-50 year olds.....no young hipsters.  I may go back again if I hear of a good band performing there in the future, but definitely not a bar I'd go out of my way to visit.

Unfortunately, there was a crotchety, rude old man who worked there. Maybe it's Otto... There were no seats so I had to stand at the end of the bar. I'm ok with that. What I'm not okay with is that this old dude purposely nudged me forcefully each time he had to go behind the counter. And granted, I moved for his cranky ass to give him plenty of space and yet he still nudged me forcefully.I figure he doesn't get enough love or play in general.

116,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1573,657,1217,4.0,5/23/2013,"Otto's Shrunken Head is a casual (i.e. dive-y) Tiki bar on the edge of Alphabet City and the East Village with tasty tropical drinks and chill atmosphere.Of course the bar is decked out in the highly romanticized Western stereotypical view of Polynesian culture. I mean, it wouldn't be a decent Tiki bar without bamboo decor, angry Tiki man carvings and dangling heads from the ceiling? The space at Otto's is narrow with not much seating space so unless you grab a big booth early it can be a little claustrophobic at night. They also often have live music in the back so if you're into that sort of scene, check the calendar for their band schedule.While PKNY is more reminiscent of the mixology culture, Otto's crafts its drinks with more straightforward gusto serving them in adorably cheesy themed glasses for my personal amusement. I mean, who doesn't want to sip a tropical cocktail out of a parrot shaped container with a bunch of plastic monkeys hanging on the rim? Oh and you can buy or take home these glasses if you wish. Just make sure to return the cup if you want your deposit back (hello $5 towards the next drink!).Otto's is CASH ONLY and the Tiki drinks are $10 a pop which is decent considering the amount of alcohol often found in them. They DO have a Happy Hour specials which is nice but unfortunately not for the highly coveted Tiki beverages. Happy Hour specials are from 2-8 pm Monday through Friday and 4-8 pm on Sunday:-$3 PBR Pints-$6 Boilmaker (whatever the hell that is)-$1 Off Everything But Tiki Drinks (booooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)-2 for 1 Bud and Well Drinks-$5 Bloody Marys-$5 MargaritasOn a plus note, the infamous Volcano Blast (basically their version of a Scorpion Bowl) is only $26 all the time!!! That's the best deal ever. It's four drinks in one! I could have one to myself and save a ton of money... Yes my poor side is talking right now. And on another plus note, apparently on Saturday nights at 2:30 AM the bar makes a drink that is only served once a week for 30 minutes called a ""Slice of Heaven"" which involves ""deep fried bacon"" and a shot of your choice. I don't know why deep fried bacon is in quotation marks on their site but that is definitely going on my bucket NYC list. It better be real bacon.",12,6,8

Drinks come in a souvenir cup which requires a $5 deposit.  Return the glass get $5 back or keep it as a souvenir and don't get your deposit back.  We ordered a drink that corresponded with the glass we liked and wanted to keep, then used that glass for our next few drinks.  Or you could be lame and have your drink in a regular cup and skip the deposit.  If you can have more than 3 and still walk a straight line then you are a Tiki master.We skipped the back room, $10 cover to hang in a small 30x30 room to hear the band, which didn't sound that great anyways. .This was a cool spot, very happy we came by.",2,,
119,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1269,914,4.0,6/5/2013,"I accidentally walked by ""Otto's Shrunken Head"" twice looking for it thanks to its very unassuming looking store front.  Once you go inside however, it's one distinctive looking Tiki bar.  Fake palm trees in one corner, blowfish lamps over the bar and Tiki styled cups lining the back of the bar.  This place makes an extra effort to transport you into a different world than the East Side environment outside.I met a group of folks here for Leslie D's most recent UYE.  It was a really fun gathering of folks including the awesome Ruggy who graced us with his presence for a bit.  I started off with the ""Scurvy Dog"" (which gives you an idea of the place's sense of humor) which was roughly their take on a ""Dark & Stormy"" complete with ginger and butterscotch flavors.  The drink was good, but not overwhelming.  No...that came later with the insanity that was the Volcano Blast!  This $26 monstrosity of a drink has enough alcohol to make 6-8 people happy as you all dip your straws in and share.  In the center is a burning flame as you consume this sweet yet alcohol laden beverage!  While we enjoyed our drinks and conversation, a live band gathered and started to play in a back room as DJ music blared in the front.  While the place is no sophisticated lounge, it's very clean and well maintained.  It definitely edges on that dive bar ""feel"" but it never jumps over the line.On important note: this joint is CASH ONLY, there is an ATM inside but it's best if you come stocked with bills.I had fun at Otto's and wish to test out their ""bring your own food"" policy one day!",4,,1

121,Susan A.,"New York, NY",359,498,559,4.0,3/25/2016,"Otto's is a cool, dark and quirky bar in East Village/Alphabet City.I came here for a show by my friend's band. Otto's is a cave. It could be sunny outside, but walk into Otto's and it feels like midnight. Their tiki drinks are their signature drink. They start at $12 and you can get it in a cool cup for a $5 deposit. In the front, they have big booths that easily fit five friends (more if you're friendly!). On your way to the back, there is a $5 old school photo booth. And finally, in the back, there is a fairly small room for music. Seats line the wall and there are a handful of small circle tables. It's good for smaller gigs. I enjoyed my drink and time here. I met a bunch of interesting people and enjoyed good music. I would be happy to come back!",2,,1
122,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,4.0,6/4/2013,"I first went out of my way to come here on some too-hot autumn night in what must've been 2010. A great margarita place near Union Square had shut down and I figured a tiki dive would hit the spot. First of all, I was new to the city then and didn't have the wisdom to take the L train eastwards, and couldn't believe how far I had to walk from the 6 in order to get there. Found a papered up facade. The place was obviously closed, and looked so run down that I couldn't believe I'd just seen something about the bar in Time Out New York or something - looked like it had been closed since the seventies. Still, I kind of knocked, until a couple incredulous guys opened the door to reveal a gutted space inside. They explained that they were still rebuilding after a fire. What a bust!My interest in Otto's reignited when I realized that a new friend of mine was pretty much a regular there. Finally hit the place up last Thursday, and was not disappointed. This place is like the dark side of a planet of parrothead and Hawaiian kitsch, mixed in with rockabilly/diner sentiments and a biker friendly space that also can seamlessly host a live Big Mountainesque soft-rock reggae band in back.However, the bar is not so dark and so esoteric that you feel creeped out. This is one truly democratic place where you can mingle with a lot of unbelievably unironic folks with mohawks, full-body tats, pin-up style clothing, etc. and realize that we are all pretty mellow and human. Perhaps the blowfish lanterns and Christmas lights everywhere contribute to the unexpectedly soothing feel here.As for drinks, there's just no question that you should forgo all shitty beers and grimy deals and sugary cocktails for PANG'S PUNCH. Pang's Punch is that elusive mystery drink that places claim to have, but don't really HAVE. Pang's Punch glows from within, and will fuck you up for ten bucks while allowing you to remain cheerfully conscious. And if you're lucky, the dude sitting next to you will insist on taking the magic glow stick out of your just-finished drink and escort you outside as he breaks it open and releases the toxic, luminescent liquid in abstract streaks across the drab sidewalk for your viewing enjoyment. Then, you will both sneer at the 20 year olds rushing to the scene to Instagram the already-fading glow paint and duck back into lalaland.Interestingly, the generally older (but young-spirited) crowd here also contributes to a feeling of safety and gentility that anyone born after 1980 might miss from their daily lives. For example, a scary looking bouncer asked for my ID. When I groaned, ""I'm so OLD,"" he said in an incongruously grandfatherly voice, ""Doesn't matter how old you are."" And at the end of the night, a guy walked me out to get me a cab. I was bracing myself for when he'd try to get in to try to get laid by me, but he simply winked and said, ""Good night, beautiful; I hope I see you again!""Indeed, there are lots of people who go back again and again to dwell forevermore in the gritty-and-sweet oblivion of Otto's. But in this case, there's nothing sad about it.",1,3,1

They're busy enough that you won't be making small talk, and certainly efficient; you'll be spending more time drinking than thinking about small talk. And that's not a bad thing.A random crowd fills the bar, booths, and back room. There's something for everyone, from a pinball machine to a table arcade to a photo booth to a lady DJ spinning hip tunes. Did I mention how colorful the place is? It's like a clown threw up here.Yes, they're cash only, but relax: a margarita and a pint of PBR costs only $10.",22,17,18

It's a tiki themed dive bar, with aptly named drinks and atmosphere. I ordered the Wicked Willie and was delighted to see the bartender fill it 3/4 of the way up with the alcohol. It was a delicious drink, and it'll definitely be one that I go back for. A bunch of my friends ordered piña coladas and it tastes better than you'd get on a tropical island.Otto's puts little trinkets in your drink, an umbrella, an animal shaped stirrer (mine was a seahorse), a piece of fruit, a palm tree bendy straw, and mine had a monkey hanging off the rim. It was very cute and made my way into my purse before my drink was done haha.The live bands in the back were fantastic. And Ottos also had an Avatar pinball machine (it wasn't working when we went) and a deerhunter game. Oh and a photobooth! You have to buy tokens from the bar to use that.The bathroom could use some work. It was really stingy and didn't feel clean",,,
126,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,4.0,9/21/2013,"Love this bar. It's not really a bar you come to on your own, and mingling isn't really what people seem to be there for- it's best to come with your own friends. There's usually live music every night in the back, and the crowd can vary a lot depending on whose playing, so if you're not already close by you might want to check the events page on their site before making a night of it. Last night it was a lot of oldies/surfer-esque rock (apparently it was rockabilly night), and I remember hearing Johnny B. Goode. Volume was loud but not loud enough that you couldn't hold a conversation. Drinks are incredible. They're just so damn tasty and they really sneak up on you. It might not taste like there's booze in there, but when you stand up after 3 or 4 you'll know exactly how much you've been drinking! I'm partial to the shrunken skirt and the scurvy dog. I'm surprised to see some negative feedback about the bartenders. Whenever I've come the people behind the bar have worked as fast as they could. The tiki drinks (which most people want to order at a tiki bar) require more work than your average cocktail- it's gonna take time folks, have some patience, especially on a weekend. One Saturday night I waited 20 minutes for a drink because the bar was packed, which is rough, but worth it.",,,

129,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,8/6/2012,"Punk rockabilly surfer tiki bar. So much kitsch. So much fun. So many tattoos!I started off my epic bar crawl this past Thursday night at Otto's for happy hour. It's kind of fitting that they have $3 pints of PBR of which I downed a few along with a shot of Jameson while listing to the DJ play an eclectic mix of punk, surfer, goth, and rock tunes. Since it was early still I had a chance to chill out as the crowd was sparse save for a sexy tattooed bartender who dug my Star Wars dancing Stormtrooper shirt, and the two tattooed ladies in cool retro Bettie Page like outfits that asked me to turn around and model for them. The crowd that was in there ranged from cougars as I mentioned to younger hipsters to fun music types to punks, to rockers, and other types. Half the crowd looks like they want to kick your ass, including the bartender if you piss her off, and the other half looks like they would be fun to get drunk with as they are here for that one sole purpose. It's a fun diverse crowd in a fun diverse bar! Zebra striped barstools, colorful blowfish lights, tiki heads, photo booth, colorful walls, and a back room where bands play sometimes. It's a non-pretentious place where all are welcome. Yeah, it's a bit grimy, dark, and can use a power washing. Character and ambiance, baby. Of course they serve up mixed drinks in tiki glasses and have the eponymous flaming tiki punch bowls for group imbibing. A few decent beers on tap such as Yuengling and PBR. They even have comedy shows here. Cash only but not to fear as it's pretty cheap overall. Can't help myself as I love these kinds of bars. Kitschy love! Some people would say that it's divey and dirty, not their type of music, and with a crowd that might not be attractive enough for them. That's ok. Let those people hang out with the beautiful bridge & tunnel folks in the LES overcrowded and overhyped club scene. No velvet rope here. Divey, dirty, and cheap suits me just fine.

130,Jeremy K.,"Stoughton, MA",620,1004,1174,4.0,2/18/2013,"Nested in the heart of Alphabet City, Otto's Shrunken Head is a bar of the type which is quickly becoming extinct. It's a dive... but... a great gone. It's tiki-themed and was once featured on Bourdain's No Reservations a few years ago. That's when I first heard of it and it's been on my list of places to hit up when in town for a while. Well it looks like I can now cross it off my bucket list as my significant other and I hit up this joint on a very early afternoon, on a weekend after stuffing ourselves silly at one of the Momofoku's nearby. We braved the chilly winds of a sunny, winter day and easily found the place. We stared at the dusty window display and walked right in. It was just past 2PM and the woman behind the bar was still setting up. They had just opened and we were the first patrons there. We decided to forego the booths and instead opted to sit at the bar.The place is unique - and by unique I mean rundown. And by rundown I mean awesome. It's exactly what I was hoping it would be and honestly everyone should experience Otto's at least once in their lives. The drinks are pretty stiff but actually pretty tasty however they require deposits for each drink which was a pain in the ass. We were the only patrons there and yet they still made us pay those deposits. Seriously? We're sitting a foot away from you and making small talk. Their drinks feature 2 categories: Tiki drinks and frozen drinks. We skipped the latter and tiki'd our way into an early afternoon buzz. I started with a delicious Shrunken Head, their signature drink and later had a Patty's Poison. Each drink has tons of exotic juices and rum. Tons and tons of rum. It's all sugary and it's all delicious. It'll add some hair to your chest and it will let you contemplate your life in whole new ways. I myself was wondering what the hell I was doing there at 2PM. But then I realized that their drinks were good and used that as an excuse for my holiday alcoholism.The bartender was pretty friendly and made small talk with us and other patrons who eventually arrived. The place is cash only and they have events all the time (check their site or Facebook page). They also have happy hour fro 2PM to 8PM, Monday through Fridays but that doesn't apply to tiki drinks. Add $3 PBR pints and $6 boilermakers and you've got yourself a solid spot. A pretty dirty, rundown but glorious place. I look forward to hopefully returning one day for some more daytime drinkin' and some friendly banter with the bartenders working there. And and if you don't feel like being separated from their awesome tikiware that the drinks come served in, they sell them all either at the bar or line which is really rad!",1,1,1

My beer was warm, one tiki drink tasted like it was straight grenadine, and the other two were so sweet we couldn't even enjoy them. I do not blame the bartenders bc I'm sure these are drink recipes not created by them. There was a band that was pretty cool and the place was packed. I don't need to go back here again though.",,,

He was not kidding. This place attracts a variety of characters, but that doesn't mean you aren't welcome to join the shenanigans.I couldn't tell you what the drink specials are. I'm sure another Yelp review might help that, but let's face it, you shouldn't come to Otto's for drink specials. The place is a bona fide tiki bar, so take advantage of that. The drinks to order: the volcano and German Chocolate shake. German chocolate shake is reminiscent of a Bushwacker (according to my Tennessee friend), and tastes like liquid heaven. Surprisingly strong for how sweet a drink. The Volcano will MESS YOU UP. Just a warning. But don't be shy. If Anthony Bourdain can knock it down, so can you. Plus, I've shared two separate volcanos between three girls, so just drink it already.The decor is something straight out of a vintage hawaiian bar left to the tattooed generation. There is a photo booth, but I've yet to take advantage of it's awesomeness.

But if you're looking for a fun, unpretentious night out in cool atmosphere, this will be right up your alley. I went because a friend's band was playing in the back room. It was a Saturday night so there were a lot of people there, a DJ in the front room and live music in the back, very much a party atmosphere. I have a feeling during the week and during the day it has more of a mellow, neighborhood bar feel. Definitely a rocker/punk vibe.The tiki drinks are your typical sweet concoctions made with cheap booze. A little pricy at $12, but they're served in a pint glass, so hey! Still cheap booze though, and they're not really that strong. You can also get them in a fancy tiki mug you can take home for five bucks extra. They have regular drinks and beer, so there's something for everyone. The doorman and bartenders were great.

In order to order drinks, we had to go to the bar to order. The bartender took other people's orders first (even though we were there first).

You can return the mug back for the $5 back or keep it. I tried the Shrunken Skirt, which is a rum with pineapple juice, mango juice and lime. It is sweet and tropical.

Happy Hour seems like a pretty good deal here and I'm sure myself and other Yelpers utilized that to their full advantage. There is also a variety of tropical drinks on their cocktail menu that looked pretty interesting. Tonight, was strictly Jack Daniel's, so I did not dabble in such fruity drinks. There is also a small room in the back, where I'm presuming they hold events and probably even rent out the space (judging by what seemed like stand-up comedy during the time I was there).The bartender here was a little impolite though. It seemed she had a little trouble multitasking with a bar full of about twenty people but I guess she tried to the best of her ability. About twenty minutes before happy hour ended, she left the bar and didn't come back until after it ended. Being the only bartender there, knowing that it was a YELP event, why would you even think of leaving the bar?! During that time, I managed to get behind the bar and serve myself water.

I can appreciate that it is truly off the beaten track of trendy and mainstream but that's no excuse to put a truly awful band on stage, not clean your floors, and hang up tacky decorations.My friend surprised his wife for her bday here, which also happens to be where they got engaged a la the photo booth. I think the draw of no other people to this bar and the lack of interest in the photo booth were the prevailing qualifiers for the effort. I'll send her a singing telegram next year if they want to come back for another round.",1,,

Bartender was super nice and washed our glasses before we left so that we could take them home (optionally you can get your $5 back if you return the cup). Worth popping in for a drink.",,,
163,Nicole T.,"Manhattan, NY",83,271,11,4.0,9/9/2013,"I love this place.  We've been here a few times, and it's always been an absolute blast.  The drinks are so deliciously potent, if you're not careful, you'll be stumbling home after just 2 of the ""tiki drinks.""   The best part about the drinks here is that they have fun names like ""Patty's Poison"" and ""Suffering Bastard.""  Plus, they always add a cherry or pineapple slice, a mini umbrella, and a tiny plastic monkey.  You will feel like you're on vacation!  So, yes, the drinks are awesome.  But the real thing that makes this place great is the live music.  On the website they tout a wide range of musical talent including ""Lounge/Exotica, Rockabilly, Punk, Country, Rock, Garage, Metal, Surf and Acoustic/Singer/Songwriter.""  All three times we've been here, they've had mainly rockabilly/surf/rock type bands.  And they were SO fun!  Just the other night, we saw a rockabilly cover band that belted out some classics by Chuck Berry and the Ramones.  The music room is tiny, hot and LOUD, but there will most definitely be people dancing and having a good ol' time so make sure you wear cool, comfortable clothes. The only thing I don't like about Otto's Shrunken Head is that is is totally dirty and disgusting!  Maybe it's because this used to be a pharmacy (with the cool tiled floor still in place), but I feel like everything has a coat of dinge on it.  The bathrooms are heinous and the floor always looks filthy.  Just have another tiki drink and try not to think about how gross the place is.",2,,

165,Bryan B.,"New York, NY",57,182,0,3.0,7/21/2014,"Not to be scarred by our high school and college drinking days of abusing Malibu Rum, my boyfriend and I are pretty big Tiki drink fans. We are lucky to live in San Francisco, which has one of the best Tiki bars in the country (Smuggler's Cove), but we have also started to make it a point to visit other cities' Tiki/rum scenes. Well, as you would have it, Sandra Lee (""Aunt Sandy"" in our house) was having one of her (in)famous ""Cocktail Time!"" segments and went to Otto's. The Otto's bartender marveled and made a delicious Tiki cocktail. (Aunt Sandy bastardized her 'take', probably using flavored vodka in place of rum.) So, when we found ourselves in New York, we knew we had to visit. The facade is pretty unassuming, and to be honest, so is the interior decor. Otto's feels a bit more like a dive bar with Tiki decorations rather than a Tiki bar. Nothing wrong with it, but comparing it to a few other bars, it was a bit shocking. Random hipster DJ playing non-island music didn't add to the tropical ambiance.But surely, the drinks would make up? Unfortunately, it was only half-true for us. We tried a Mai Tai and another forgettable mixed drink and both were pretty meh. Undeterred, we moved on to their Frozen drinks and thankfully found what we were looking for. Creamy and sweet and refreshing! Their is an obvious kitsch level here, with each drink being served in fun mugs, adorned with palm tree straws and a plastic monkey perched from the rim. However, with a hit-or-miss record on their drinks, I'm not sure if the kitsch is worth another visit. Perhaps on a night with live music (the band was setting u, but we didn't stay long enough to enjoy!)",,,

They also have live music in the back at times.  Drinks are stiff and this spot offers great people watching! You can buy any of their tiki mugs, or purchase a drink that comes with them. I purchased the lucky cat drink (the drink made with this cup is bartenders choice)! So freakin cute! I was so wasted already when I stumbled into this after-party spot and this bar kept my party Rollin!  We showed up a little after 1:30am and this spot was bumpin! It was like I was walking into a crazy mushroom trip (for some, I can see how it would feel like a bad trip, it's not uncommon to see people dressed up like voodoo zombies... I thought it was cool!)

168,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,4.0,3/15/2009,"Otto's coined the category dive bar as it's beyond divey.  This bar desperately needs structural and cosmetic TLC, as it appears to be in a state of despair.  The interior dates back to the 1930s where it was originally a pharmacy.  Remnants of this former pharmacy are imbued by the foyer's entrance onto the ground where a green and white Rx tile is visible.There is a small room containing a stage and music equipment, which is perfect for events decorated with kitsch Tiki theme.  Live band performances or other acts of creative talent are showcased on this music venue stage, ergo no TV exist as all the focus is on the performers.  Note:  Music venue and bar lounge are extremely dark and dingy.  Upon emerging as a performance poet artist begining January 2009, Otto's Shrunken Head hosted my very first poetry recitations for an Open-Mic reading.  There is a photo booth which originated from the former Woolworth's.  No food exist but patrons are permitted BYOF of choice.N.B. Otto's opens at 4pm on Saturday and Sundays.  Most of the time the bar tender/owner usually arrives late to open shop on Saturdays.",4,1,3
169,Naima R.,"New York, NY",85,64,7,4.0,5/27/2014,Any bar with 2 for 1 happy hour deals that lets you bring food in from outside is at the top of my list. I came here with about 10 people for a coworker's going away party around 5:30pm and the place was empty. The bar has such a fun vibe but I couldn't really tell what it's like when it's crowded. There was nothing special about the music but the decor is unique and the drinks were great. I was boring and got the 2 for 1 bud light for $5 but my friends ordered the zombie (came with an awesome green glow-stick inside the drink) and the stormy skull and I only heard great things from them. I'll probably come back on a busier night but it seems like a great place to meet up.,,,

To the owner, please invest a little more into this place and have someone go through and give it a power cleaning. Being a dive bar doesn't mean license to let everything fall apart.My bar stool looked like a sad old lion out on the Serengeti. It also had a giant cigarette burn, which seeing as how smoking in bars was banned years ago, it's probably a good indication as to how long this place has been neglecting things. The men's bathroom was like walking into a port-a-potty, but the kind that might have been steeping in the hot sun for three years closed off and forgotten by the public, only then to be uncovered and opened again with an engulfing steam and perspiring stench that is beyond recognition.I also want to make it clear, I am all for a little dirt, I do not shy away from the putrid or grotesque, but were it not for alcohols ability to sanitize, I might not have been able to finish my drinkIt's like going to an old haunted house where everything is a bit sordid and disorientating, and the fear emanates not from whats haunting you, but that the whole building might collapse or catch fire, and then you're thinking how unfortunate it would be for your tombstone to read ""died in a shanty haunted house attraction.""But I loved the bar tender.",1,9,
186,Kathleen D.,"Philadelphia, PA",360,384,39,4.0,8/18/2012,"Deliciously strong, fruity times pour out of Otto's Shrunken Head... and of times I've always have a good ones at this East Village joint. It's fun, it's divey, it's comfortable. Back room bands play as you're surrounded by Polynesian themed tchotkes, vintage island albums on the walls, and tiki everything. It's some good throwback fun, though I have to admit that I've never made a whole night of it here. For me, Otto's is a usually a pit stop along the way here or there, for a drink or two. Yes, I am fully aware that typically when I suggest, ""a drink or two,"" the true sum of my boozing reveals itself to be significantly much more than a couplea ...but not at this tiki-bar- meets-punk dive. Your Mai Tai, or Sufferin' Bastard, or what have you, will be delicious, refreshin' and fruity and they will certainly not leave you buzzless. These kitschy yet mighty concoctions run about 10 or 15 buckaroos, depending on whether or not you wanna keep that tiki glass. In my pro-drinkin estimation, these drinks are worth the dough. They're not stingy with the sauce here, if I haven't made that everso abundantly clear enough. And tiki stuff!",3,3,3

Of course I immediately walked towards the music, and saw a ragtag group of very talented musicians playing a variety of a rowdy version of popular songs from the 60s and 70s. I was later to find out that this was a group of musicians led by the incomparable Frank Wood. They had a very captive audience of people who are obvious fans and friends.The drinks are also nice, and you can also pay a little extra to keep their tiki mugs.

I'm a huge lightweight but when I go here, I can easily drink twice as much as I do anywhere else. I feel like I've seen everything here. One time it was an adorable gay-boy dance party; another time a huge brawl broke out because a bunch of homophobes decided to flip out over the presence of some lesbians. You never really know what you're going to get. It is a fairly filthy place, you must prepare yourself for that. Last time I was here, somebody took a dump on the floor in the ladies' room. At, like, 8pm on a Sunday. (You could tell because you could hear the tormented screams of the next person to use the stall.) And it was STILL THERE when we left like four hours later. I have spent lots of quality time at some of the divey-est bars on the planet but that one was a first. And yet I frigging love this place and get excited every time I have an excuse to come back. The people are friendly, the space is awesome, the music is good, and as a non-native New Yorker I am sick and tired of seeing prissy and expensive spaces marketed as ""dive bars,"" so as much as I don't love having to deal with actual feces on the bathroom floor, I will forever appreciate that this joint Is What It Is, ya know?",,,
