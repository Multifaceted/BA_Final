0,Chris P.,"ELMHURST, NY",32,18,47,5.0,11/16/2018,"I came here back in June 2017 with a good friend of mine.  Food overall was very good.   My friend and I went pescatarian and vegetarian as our food order of small plates did not contain any meat.  The first dish we ordered was their Roasted Cauliflower (now $13)  The food is served with roasted corn, cheese, chili flakes and lime which was to die for.  Since this post is over a year too late, I don't see it as described on their menu.  I was not sure if it was a special they had that day.  But needless to say, this dish with these condiments has to be part of this menu.  We moved along with the green gnocchi (now $16) made with freshly made gnocchi covered with pesto, shrimp, Parmesan cheese and chili flakes. It was rich and it doesn't get any better with freshly made gnocchi.  We were still hungry and ordered a side of Parmesan truffle fries (now $16) which were addicting but the dish was too small for the price and it was $10 last year. We were still hungry and ordered the garlic shrimp ($14) which consisted of garlic, parsley, chili flakes and olive oil. They were really good. Overall service was good. Personally I would return to try their other dishes especially that their menu changed within the last year.",,,

2,Carly R.,"New York, NY",323,7,2,5.0,10/17/2018,"10/10. Love the ambiance, service and incredible menu at this cozy spot. Came in for a mixology class and had a wonderful, memorable evening - Ross was incredibly warm and welcoming and made our experience so much fun. Not to mention his bartending talents (he made us a new cocktail, the Big Apple, which was the perfect fall drink with just the right amount of spice and sweetness - try it!) which are on point. All 3 cocktails we made were excellent and the infused liquors were so unique.Also highly recommend the truffle mac, scallops, truffle Parmesan fries, and Brussels sprouts - all perfectly flavored and delicious accompaniments to the cocktails. Can't say enough good things. Looking forward to returning to Sanctuary T to try the rest of their menu!",,,
3,Andrew M.,"Harvard Square, Boston, MA",8,4,4,4.0,8/26/2018,"Stumbled upon this place while shopping with friends on a Saturday morning. Pretty busy, but we spotted one empty table in the back and were seated immediately.While we sat down quickly, there were a number of delays on the food/drink front. The kitchen was short on staff (and consequently, was *very* slow to roll out orders), and the bar had run out of sparkling wine and was waiting on more when we ordered. I can only imagine that the manager heard my stomach growling, as he walked up to our table and offered us a free round of drinks while we waited for the food! Didn't catch his name, but he and our waitress were both incredibly hospitable and friendly. Between the table we ordered 2 short-rib breakfast burgers, a classic omelette and one breakfast alambre (pictured below). Very filling, tasty and reasonably priced food. The breakfast cocktails are a bit pricey ($13 for a cava/prosecco mimosa), so while I wouldn't recommend Sanctuary for a super boozy brunch, one drink isn't too horrible. Will definitely be back again for their Breakfast Burger!",1,1,1
4,Nayana R.,"Mountain View, CA",247,34,90,5.0,8/15/2018,"I looked up the top few places for a mixology class in New York and landed on this restaurant based on its reviews. I really really had a great time during the mixology class with my team. I learnt to make a tea infused cocktail, Geri halliwell and earl soho. Julio, who was leading our session was extremely warm and welcoming and made sure we had a great time! These cocktails were worth every penny but what surprised me most was the food. The dishes seem simple but full of flavor ! So happy with my find amd would definitely recommend this place when in New York :)Food ordered: truffle Mac and cheese, truffle fries, brussel sprouts, shrimp tacos all great in flavor !",2,,

6,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1899,817,3.0,2/20/2018,"Fancy some afternoon tea? As a big tea lover, I was excited to discover Sanctuary T. The space is tiny, welcoming, and very naturey. Has some tea leaves and tea accessories on display at the bar and in the back for sale. The décor is picturesque and made me feel like I was on vacation. From the apparently 80+ options, I requested a more earthy, ricey flavor, and the waitress suggested a Japanese tea whose name I couldn't recall for the life of me. It was tangy and sweet with a slightly bitter kick to it, but I wouldn't say it was worth $9! Jesus, who decided these prices were acceptable?The menu is health-conscious and light. Easy to stay healthy while dining here. I recommend the chickpea starter. So the service was sweet and the place is charming, but the prices are just no bueno.",5,3,6

8,Bill H.,"Naples, FL",43,486,61,4.0,6/2/2018,We wanted a quick brunch bite before heading out for the rest of the day so when we saw the tea sign it was a must try.  We sat outside along the sidewalk on a gorgeous day.  service was friendly and efficient.  We had the carnival dish and truffle mac n cheese (a must try).  A great selection of hot and cold handmade teas.  Definitely drop in here for tea!,2,,1
9,Sabrina T.,"New York, NY",229,176,27,1.0,6/8/2018,"In truth, I'm not sure where to begin... I have passed Sanctuary T on many occasions and i've always witnessed a decent amount of people dining here on a regular basis. The restaurant is very open, airy and as one would think, nice to dine here when the weather is nice. Beware! There is no AC, therefore, if you sit further to the back of the restaurant prepare to endure your bottoms sticking to the chair. I made a reservation, my co-workers and I arrived about 10 mins early, we were not greeted by anyone and due to that, we proceeded to hang by the bar. There was a gentleman by the bar, who I assumed was the manager and/or owner, he wore thick black glasses and a v neck. He didn't acknowledge us, nor greeted us until I spoke up about our reservation.. he told us to pretty much sit anywhere. We sat and waited 15 mins for the owner (or manager) to take our order! When we had a hiccup in changing the order, he aggressively told us that if we were not ready he would rather do something else than wait for us to figure it out. After the drinks arrived, he never came back to check on us and we had to ask him and his team plenty of times for the check. As we were deciding to pay, we overheard him having a conversation with one of the workers, in which she asked him not to belittle her on the floor and he told her to leave.. seems as if this guy is a problem. I won't be back, based on the horrible service.",,,
10,Crystal O.,"Manhattan, NY",376,1,0,5.0,7/13/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here post-workout in desperate need of a healthy yet filling meal. Sanctuary T gave us just what we needed! The place is nicely set in the Soho area--the ambience was very welcoming, including a very friendly staff(Pierre was awesome!) I had the steak with with crispy potatoes and my boyfriend had the lemongrass chicken. They were both delicious and with great portions. Additionally, the brussel sprouts were honestly the best I've ever had. We live in the area and can't wait to frequent this place.",2,,
11,Rachel B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",416,63,47,4.0,4/13/2018,"Came here for happy hour the other day. The restaurant has a great vibe and is perfect for a low key happy hour where you can actually talk. We sat at the bar and had truffle fries and the cocktail made with earl grey tea. Truffle fries were great, the drink was ok - just not my type. Really looking forward to coming back for brunch or dinner. It's very open and airy and relaxing!",,,2
12,Faith C.,"Seattle, WA",25,5,0,5.0,7/22/2018,"What a quaint and refreshing place to get drinks and a bite to eat in between our shopping.The zucchini fritters and the Chorizo dumplings were pretty amazing. On top of the great location and good food, the service was amazing too! Our server, Pierre went over and beyond to make our experience with our limited schedule the very best. He was engaging and warm-but still gave us our space to enjoy our meal and conversation. Not many people can strike the happy balance and he did so effortlessly. Thank you!!",1,,
13,De C.,"Manhattan, NY",15,25,106,5.0,7/19/2018,"Cute cozy tea shop.  Very nice waitress, very helpful with explaining the menu. Truly enjoyed the food, everything was very fresh, and nice twist to traditional flavors. High recommend, for a nice cozy meal with an up beat atmosphere.",1,,

15,Kelsey S.,"Carrollton, TX",204,238,766,5.0,6/24/2017,"Sanctuary T's cute decor and welcoming, open-air set up attracted me and my friends while we were doing some touristy shopping in Soho. We just wanted to see what it was and ended up spending a good hour and half drinking during happy hour! We probably would've stayed longer if we didn't have places to be. No shame.Their happy hour menu has a couple of fancy options at decent prices, so we tried a few of them out as well as bartender specialties. Speaking of bartenders, Jaime, Ayash, and Keenan are all rockstars. Since the place was pretty empty, we were just all hanging out and having good 'ol conversation. I can't say anything about the food other than it looked and smelled good. But I can say that the Rosé is a nice pour and the matcha cocktail is the unique drink that they're known for, so give it a try! I'll be back by for some quick HH drinks when I'm back in NY.",2,1,2
16,Kristy D.,"Philadelphia, PA",287,50,49,3.0,2/25/2018,"It is a cute place. Relatively unimpressed by the food. Got the turkey wrap with a side salad. Turkey was cubed and over chewy. Side salad was sad, literally just lettuce leaves and no veggies. The had a lot of tea options -For tea, I got the hibiscus tea and the spiced life. They were pretty and tasted pretty good. This place is for sure over priced for the quality. If you are super into tea I would say give it a try but it's for food I wouldn't really recommend it.",,,
17,Rohit G.,"Maywood, NJ",70,204,587,4.0,8/11/2017,"This is probably my fav snack place. Ordered all six. My top three are Crispy chick peas 1, sweet and sour Brussels sprouts 2, and fire roasted eggplant 3. But they were all great. Food and service were very good. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions that were all great. They have interesting and yummy cocktail selections. This is also a good summer spot as they have tables outside in the large accordion windows.",,,

Other than that a very great experience here.",,,
19,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,5.0,11/19/2017,This review is based solely on the mixology class experience I had here a few weeks ago. I have been in the market for a fun couples cocktail making class for a while and finally stumbled upon this one at Sanctuary T. For the price it was pretty phenomenal. A lot of the other big cocktail bars are ~150 a head and this one we paid $75 which included appetizers and 3 (but ended up being 4) cocktails.The whole purpose of this class is to teach you how to make simple yet complex in flavor cocktails using ingredients that you most likely have at home. The key component is utilizing tea-infused simple syrups or tea-infused alcohol to simply add complex flavors to your drink composition. We made 3 cocktails and were given a 4th to share with the group. Two were created using tea-infused simple syrup and the 3rd was using tea-infused alcohol. The group drink was a special treat and was a flaming tiki drink which was pretty spectacular. This was a really inspiring class for us and we have continued experimenting with new types of cocktails using the basics taught in this class. Really the only problem I have is that the class is early on a Monday making it not as accessible but if you have the ability to do it I highly recommend you make it work.I loved our instructor - Ben. He tells it how it is and I appreciated all of the honesty.,1,,1
20,Catfish H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,229,107,2.0,8/31/2018,"The photos the business owners posted here look nothing like the food that is served.  This place is trying to sell dumplings and la Frieda burgers - hey, why not?  Food was pub grub quality and service was average.  Bathroom filthy early in the evening.  Prices pretty high.  Some of the other reviews read like press releases.",,1,
21,Christina J.,"Bethesda, MD",0,18,0,2.0,11/3/2018,"Ordered two lemonades. Watermelon and charcoal. The watermelon tasted like a crappy jolly rancher soaked in soda and the charcoal didn't have any lemon taste.  It did leave my daughter's tongue a nice black shade, however.  Nice atmosphere but big disappointment for 18 dollars of lame drinks.",,,
22,Marshall P.,"Winona Lake, IN",274,3,0,5.0,8/11/2018,"Great for anytime of day but their brunch is my favorite. Been coming to Sanctuary T for about a year now. I appreciate the service and wide selection of teas the most. So many varieties of tea it can be overwhelming, but the staff helps making great recommendations and clearly knowing their stuff. Ask Pierre for his favorite, he hasn't steered me wrong yet!",1,1,1
23,Kimberly M.,"Hoboken, NJ",144,290,9,4.0,5/31/2018,A surprise good meal with an above average bartender.  We lost interest in Gilligan's and wandered over here on a particularly warm Friday night when the doors were open.  I had the crab avocado salad plus a few margaritas.  Also a fan of the Ghostbuster cocktail.,,,
24,Kevin M.,"Carrollton, TX",17,11,0,5.0,7/21/2018,"It is not common for me to find someplace distinctive enough to write a review. Sanctuary T is a personally favorite and one of the few places in NYC (I live in Dallas) that I seek out on every trip. Service is consistently engaging, fun, and insightful. Small place with a very neighborhood place vibe. Pierre kept things moving and his suggestions were first rate. I will continue to seek it out and I have sent so many others here over the years...",2,,
25,Alixandra E.,"New Orleans, LA",356,201,1109,3.0,1/27/2017,"I love, love, love the concept of this place, but unfortunately Sanctuary T didn't fulfill the dreams I had of it. It's a very nice and intimate restaurant/bar that specializes in tea infused cocktails. There are about 10 tables of varying size and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Behind the bar they've got a wall full of jars of different loose leaf teas. They bag the tea bags straight from the jars and because of that the place smells great. They don't have a wide selection of happy hour specials. There were three different cocktail options that cost about $8, but the drink I was really interested in was their Figgy Sangria for $12. I gave in and got it even though it wasn't a special. The wine/tea combination was on point. I loved the flavor and the addition of fresh apple slices made it s delightful and creative concoction. I've never thought to put a tea bag in my wine, but this place inspired me. When I got my drink, the glass was so full of ice I couldn't even move the straw to stir it without it spilling. The proportion of ice to drink was pretty skewed. The bartender was kind enough to take the ice out when I asked, but I shouldn't have had to ask. The sangria was pretty good, but I couldn't taste taste any fig at all. It tasted like a slightly altered Chardonnay, but I don't know where the spices and fig ended up. What really griped me about this place was the service. The bartenders were friendly when my friend and I initially came in, but that was the height of it. It wasn't a busy time and even though there were three idle bartenders in front of us, they still ignored us. At another point I was still actively looking at the drink menu when it was snatched away from my peering eyes by one of the bartenders. Did they not want me to order a second drink? It certainly discouraged me from doing so. Instead we ordered the Flatbread to share. It took a while to come out, but it was worth the wait. The portion was bigger than I expected, but for $14 it should be big enough to share. It was quite delicious! I loved the combination of the crispy flatbread with the cauliflower, kale and gruyere. I didn't realize how hungry I had been until it was gone. My only complaint about it was that it was drenched in oil. Seriously, there was a puddle of oil left on the plate once the flatbread was gone. I really wanted to love Sanctuary T, but I just couldn't. I see so much great potential, but they need to step up their game a bit.",4,1,
26,Galen R.,"Manhattan, NY",413,147,167,4.0,1/24/2017,"Brunched here with friends after my first ever and rigorous Pilates session (ya boi woke af and not afraid to try new things) so I had quite the appetite worked up. Unfortunately they don't take reservations but we still managed to get seated immediately. The accommodations were intimate and smelled amazing (due to the tea leaves, obviously). For billing itself primarily as a tea spot, I was really impressed with the other food offerings on the menu. I ended up getting the Vermonster omelet with a salad, while others at my table had the Vegetarian, the TBLT, and fries. Not a single person was disappointed with what they got. I'm really looking forward to going back and exploring the rest of the menu since everything I saw servers bring out while there looked and smelled delicious. To be fair, the brunch drinks were on the pricier side, but the cuisine more than made up for it.Go here.",2,5,3
27,Natasha R.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",113,59,0,2.0,7/26/2018,"I'd give this place 4 or even 5 stars because its super cute, has outdoor seating, and the shrimp is the bomb, but the waitstaff on duty are mentally defective. I made eye contact with the missing link of a waiter twice. Neither time did he let me know he'd be right with me. We had to get up and approach him before he came to the table. I ordered tequila neat. This involves nothing but pouring tequila in a glass. We watched as the missing link went behind the bar and did nothing. He just stood there. My guess is, he wasnt having deep thoughts. By the way, the place is maybe 1/5 full. Multiple times we had to get up from our table to ask for service. Hopefully the Sanctuary manager is reading this and will fire this dolt.",,1,

They have some fun blends that mix together different teas, floral notes, and herbs into a ""relaxation"" or other themed drinks. I ended up trying the charcoal lemonade.

For whatever reason, the waiter with the dreads, took it upon herself to touch my iPhone and turn off the sound of a video playing on my Instagram. How much nerve and audacity can one have, to touch someone else's phone? I was completely appalled by this and won't return here! On the contrary, the Green Tea Margarita is quite delectable, the bartender was hospitable, and this is a very intimate restaurant.

I had a bespoke cocktail (very cool btw) and another bourbon based drink.Food was so so. Skirt steak was about 2-3 slivers of steak (maybe 2 oz) on top of arugula. The potatoes were blah. Def not worth the $28 cost (maybe $12 at best)I had the chicken for $24. Was quite surprised to receive dark meat for the price (and server didn't mention upgrade to white meat). Bird was seasoned good. Veggies were very OILY. I couldn't eat all my food. Was a total waste. Nice concept w tea based drinks but I wouldn't come back for the food.,,,

44,Michelle Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",349,104,20,3.0,5/2/2017,"Depending on the day you go, Sanctuary T can be a hit or miss. I've been to this restaurant about 3 or 4 times because their groupon deal is great. For $39, a group of two can each get a craft cocktail and an entree. My friend and I normally get the hanger steak or the crab pasta. The food here is excellent. The vegetables that come with the steak and tender and sweet while the steak is always cooked perfectly. The pasta is also delicious and comes with a lot of jumbo crab. I have no qualms about the food but the drinks here are too strong for my taste. After my first experience at Sanctuary T, I asked my waitress to put less alcohol in my cocktail on my second visit. What i got back, however, tasted like straight up liquor. i couldn't even take a sip without gagging and it was even stronger than the first time.I have also noticed that the service tends to be much better on the weekends. This is when they are better staffed and things run much more smoothly. The one time I went on a weekday, the bartender doubled as the waiter and he forgot to put in our order so we didn't receive our food until an hour and a half later. he was apologetic and offered us free cocktails but seeing how strong they are, i was not interested. Overall, the food is great for the price and the drinks are probably great for someone who loves alcohol but I would only visit on the weekends.",,,

The bartender was attentive and concerned equally about the customer's experience as well as the quality of the cocktails. I had a couple of Take the Blacks and they were phenomenal ! The drink is essentially black barrel mount gay rum, Mr. Black coffee liqueur, Campari, simple syrup, and coffe beans. It is going to be my favorite new drink of 2018. Anyway, I highly recommend stopping in and giving these guys a try.",,,
46,Ash N.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,7,0,5.0,6/12/2018,"Where do I begin? The exceptional cocktails? The incredible selection of tea? Or how about the ridiculously good looking bartenders? If none of this is incentive to walk into this pretty little soho spot, I don't know what is. One bartender in particular - Jamie, I believe his name is (I was too flustered to ask), is a sight to behold. A 6 foot-four, chiseled blonde Adonis of Olympian splendor provided me with exceptional service one evening. And then he opened his mouth - I could have died and ascended to heaven then and there. A sultry British accent poured forth that I must admit, made me hear color and see sound. Perhaps it was the cocktails, perhaps I was simply charmed. Sanctuary T is the place for both.",,,
47,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",399,484,1233,4.0,1/20/2017,"Sanctuary T became my sanctuary today for a late lunch after a morning of back to back meetings. I remember passing by it in the past, but never had the opportunity to eat here until today.I must admit, the fact that it stated Tea Bar on the awning was a huge draw for me to enter as I love tea.Once inside, I was impressed with the all things relating to tea décor--loose tea in jars, canisters, gift sets and more. I had a wonderful chat with the general manager, Ben who was extremely knowledgeable on the different kinds of teas.  There was nothing he didn't know about it! He was also very helpful with recommendations of selections from the menu. I chose the breakfast egg tacos. For me, the portion was adequate--3 mini corn tacos stuffed with scrambled eggs, onions, peppers, tomatoes and cilantro. A dash of Tabasco gave it a nice kick. To compliment my lunch, I selected the green tea with rosebuds and chrysanthemum. This was delicious and classic. Most tea is also available for purchase.

Would definitely recommend.",2,1,2
48,Nicole B.,"New York, NY",111,32,44,4.0,5/29/2017,"Intimate, rather trendy SoHo place. Came here with three friends on a busy Sunday night before Memorial Day and had a Groupon for four for $71. We got the seafood pasta (which my friend said wasn't too great), two orders of the burger (you can choose gruyere or cheddar cheese), and the duck carnitas tacos. We liked the burgers and the tacos ($26 each; pasta was $28). We also got four cocktails; size overall was on the small side for $13 each. The Strawberry Fields Sangria tasted a bit watered down and only had one slice of strawberry but was alright. The Radlersnake is pretty spicy, the St. Valentina was alright, but the Hulk was pretty good. With the Groupon, we paid $100 including tip. 20% tip was automatically added. Original tab would've been almost $200, so I wouldn't go here without some kind of discount. Server was nice, though be aware there isn't a ton of seating for groups of four or more. Reservation for dinner is probably best.",,,
49,Ryan H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,2.0,6/1/2018,"I never write reviews but considering the quality of service that Im used to at this establishment, I was expecting a lot more that what I got. To say that I was disappointed with this experience is an understatement. Im used to really great service here from the likes of Jamie, the British gentleman, or Shihui, the young Asian woman with the brightly colored hair. I am especially fond of Kourtney, the manager with the dread locks. However, on my most recent visit I discovered she was no longer the manager, by non other than the worst possible replacement. The current manager, a rude Asian man with obnoxiously large goggles and a terrible attitude ""greeted"" me. I dont actually know his name because he never introduced himself. Upon walking in, he pretty much looked me up and down with a clear disdain. I thought he was just a rude customer so I paid him no mind. When he made a gesture to seat me, I was shocked he actually worked there. As I was already feeling a bit uncomfortable I asked if Kourtney was available. In a rather curt tone he stated she was no longer there and that he was the manager. I took my seat, and read through the menu but had already made up my mind I was not going to eat there. Soon after, I made an excuse that I had colleagues waiting for me elsewhere. Thats how uncomfortable I was! I hope that if I return I dont run into that sort of negative energy. In a place known for its exceptional service and recognizable faces this new manager is not the way to bring about the same feelings. As I work in the service industry myself I feel this is not the best person to welcome peoples time or money. I hate to leave something that could affect the staffs well being but the manager energy and attitude will dictate that going forward.",,,

Ordered two happy hour drinks and continued with our conversations. Meanwhile, host and bartender ignore us and our order completely. The bartender is literally staring at us with contempt while he makes drinks for every other person. After 20 minutes waiting for a glass of rose, we walked out.This is my first review on yelp because my experiences have always been at least decent. I have never experienced this kind of service. If you didn't want us to sit at a table, you should have said something instead of acting like petulant children.

My first experience was years ago, but I was happy to make it back in for a birthday celebration.  We came in with a group of 6 on a Friday night. This place is small, so definitely make a reservation if you have a larger group. The menu has changed quite a bit since we went, so I can't comment on the new items. But I can say that each dish is very tasty and usually has some type of tea spice incorporated. The drinks here a must as well. There are always specialty cocktails incorporating teas or just take a look at their gigantic menu of non-alcoholic teas. The ambience is excellent. The feel is rustic and trendy with a dimly lit ambience. The service is great too. Our waiter was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, I really love this place. It's best fit for a smaller group of friends or a date, but don't be shy to bring in a crew as well. I'll be back again.",1,,1

However, recently the mgmt has been very off. You can tell the front of house does not have good communication with superiors. I love coming here because it's a cool spot with a friendly staff.

I came here a few months ago, live in the neighborhood, and I was disappointed despite what I read online and I was excited to try this place. Always looking for a new good local spot. It wasn't a total disappointment but not what I was expecting. The food was acceptable but the ambiance and service was sub-par. Anyway I decided to give it another try recently and was extremely pleased with both the service and quality of food. The manager (Pierre) as well as our server were very attentive and polite and made sure everything was to our liking. Drinks were fantastic as well as the food. After my second try I would definitely come back again and can see it becoming a favorite!!!

I was attracted to this restaurant because they had the windows/doors open so outdoor seating was an option today. The waiter was very polite and nice but the service in the kitchen was too good. It took 50 minutes to bring out FRIES. My meal, two fish tacos came out on time. The tacos were OK but bland and needed more flavor/seasoning. I should've ordered from their ALL DAY BREAKFAST menu :( but I will next time!!!They have a large selection of wine, alcoholic beverages and teas(doesn't look like a tea house but it is). They have sooooooo many teas which all looked so good and the prices are GREAT $5-7!!! You also have the option of getting it hot or cold so I ordered a cold Spring Harvest($5) which was quality size. I'd return again to try the breakfast menu.",3,1,3

We sat at the bar when it was less half full and no one came to get our order or ask if we had questions for over twenty minutes. When the server finally came to take our menus, we had to say that we hadn't even ordered yet. Then she couldn't remember our order but spoke to me as if I was the idiot.More than fifteen minutes went by before they brought my coffee (which tasted cheap and stale) and my boyfriend's tea, which he liked. Another fifteen minutes and they brought his French toast and my eggs benedict. The French toast was good and most of the other plates that went by looked also very good. But the poached eggs were overcooked like hard boiled eggs, they forgot the hollandaise sauce, the bread was burnt on one side and soggy on the other, and the 'season vegetables' consisted only of bland chunky potatoes. For the expensive cost, terrible coffee, very very bad service, and my bad food, I will not return. You can get good French toast elsewhere. Also the bathroom was dirty. No thanks.",,,

67,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",850,1051,1785,2.0,8/2/2016,"Sanctuary T will go down as one of my biggest lunch fails. And I don't think there's any way to resuscitate that.With my old job being proximate to SoHo (where you can find trust fund babes with healthy diets), I had been wanting to try Sanctuary T but was reluctant to spend at least $14 for just a wrap--and that's only one of the cheapest options. But one day--for whatever reason--I gave in and decided to finally order from here. I got the Chicken Wrap and it was a mess. It came with a side salad in a box and my wrap was soaked in oil and dressing, I had to wipe my hands every time I put my food down with the one napkin they gave me. Needless to say, it didn't go very well. For a $14 wrap, you think they would separate the salad in a separate container, rather than trying to fit both in a box--or at least have the dressing on the side. I think I was really expecting the wrap to be amazing or something but it was nothing to write home about--I think they're more known for their tea selection, but I doubt it's anything spectacular. If anything, it looks like unpackaged Teavana (or whatever shit quality commercial tea leaves they're overpricing these days) or a yuppie version of Alice's Tea Cup.Perhaps coming back for happy hour or tea may be an option, but I definitely will not be ordering the food again.",1,1,1

The drink was enjoyable since you could taste the red tea and it was not overpowered by the whiskey.  I ordered the duck which was tender and juicy.  Portion size was just right to make you feel satisfied, but not anywhere near stuffed.  Servers were friendly, but food did seem to take a bit longer than usual to come out, so just don't go here when you're in a rush.",,,

Not to mention the atmosphere is super cute and cozy. Come here now!",,,
74,Meredith C.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,26,39,3.0,7/6/2016,"Let's get this out of the way first: the kitchen and waitstaff at Sanctuary T are consistently slow. This isn't a one-time issue. I've been visiting for years and have never gotten back out in under an hour. Once I had to ask the waiter if they could box my food before before it hit the table because I no longer had time to sit and eat. Lesson learned. Now I only stop in on lazy afternoons.When you do have an hour and a half to spare, this is a nice lunch spot. The menu changes frequently, but is usually well-tuned to the season. Hot and cold soups are consistently delicious and inventive, and a meal on their own if you're not too hungry. Someone in the kitchen really knows how to layer up flavors over time. And if you see meatballs on offer, definitely jump on that. They're meaty, hearty and well-seasoned. Again, the sauce has great depth.If you're looking for something sandwich-like, my regular dining companion recommends the Chicken Wrap.  It's a bit simple, more or less a club sandwich, but the ingredients are good. I was less impressed with the open-faced Tea Smoked Salmon I ordered on my last visit, mostly because I couldn't taste any tea or smoke. (Though the the use of greek yogurt as a spread was a surprise home run... creamy and slightly tart, but not as thin as I was expecting.)The tea is not the best in Soho, but there are a lot of fun and experimental drinks to choose from. I was in love with the hot buttered bourbon maple tea and would definitely order it again, even though I did have to keep stirring to stop the butter from turning into a film on top. Here's hoping this special comes back in the winter. Right now they have a series of spritzers. They're nice, refreshing summer drinks, good for those days when you're really craving a cold soda but know it wouldn't hydrate you at all.Prices run high, but you are in part paying for the location. The front of the restaurant is open to the street in good weather and it's the best spot in the house. Grab a drink, get comfortable, and watch the world go by... it'll be a while before your food comes anyway.",1,,
75,Brittany S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",214,3,0,2.0,5/30/2018,"I have always enjoyed the environment offered at Sanctuary T but due to the new management, I felt a change in the atmosphere.  I arrived to brunch around 3pm, and after sitting down with a friend, the new owner or manager (a French Male) was highly rude.1. Tossed the menu down on the table, instead of gentle placing it in our hands. (Who does this and why? I clearly had my hand out. Please note, he tossed it, because there was a noise and we both looked at one another, questioning the situation.  Maybe that was a sign to leave, right then and there, but we love this place!)2. When the food came, the French Male's fingers were a little too close to the meal. (I'm a germaphobe, so this made me a little uncomfortable.) 3. After we ordered and finished our meal, I felt as if this guy was watching over our table like a hawk, in dyer need of food; waiting for and wanting us to leave. (I can't stand when people hover over a table while you are clearly a purchasing customer.  Let us eat peacefully by keeping a distance and checking on us at reasonable times.)4. The prices increased as well!!!! - why are fries so expensive????! This makes no sense! 5. Last but not least, but most importantly, I didn't like the way the French Man was speaking to our waitress, the ""Lady with Dreads."" His tone and his demeanor was not professional at all.  He should have a better understanding of what should be said on the floor verses private conversation.   I will say this, I am only giving this restaurant 2 stars because of the ""LADY WITH DREADS'S SERVICE!"" She was the highlight and energetic energy of the day.  She was helpful, sweet and even joined our conversation.  She was such a joy! I really think she was the reason we finished our meal... that French man was a bit much to handle on a Sunday afternoon.  I don't think I'll return until it's turned over to someone else. I'll be waiting and hoping to see this ""Lady with Dreads"" again! To whoever this lady is, thank you for the dining experience! It was much appreciated!",,,
76,Anne K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,9/3/2018,"Other reviews have pointed out the poor service at this restaurant and unfortunately have to agree 100%. My friends and I had made plans to eat here before going to Brooklyn for an event, giving us about an hour and a half to eat. We didn't have to wait for a table when we arrived at 1:10pm as half the restaurant was empty. After sitting down, it took about 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order which is a bit long but also not the worst. Ten minutes after we placed our orders, the waiter comes back saying they're out of pancakes. My friend looks at the menu again. 10 minutes later he comes back to take her order they're out of what she wanted to order again so at that point she just ordered a side. Our drinks come fairly quickly but then for the food this is where the waiting game begins. As we're waiting, we see that 3 tables who arrived after us have received their meals, so we're growing a little frustrated. The table behind us was also asking the waitress to check in on their food. I overheard them complaining that they'd been waiting over 40 minutes and when I told them we'd been there for over an hour they were shocked. We tried asking the waitress to check in on the kitchen, explaining that we're in a rush and she never came back to tell us the status of our meal. 2:20pm rolls around and we see food come out of the kitchen. We get excited but then see yet again that this food is for a table that arrived after us! Our food is still nowhere to be seen so we ask one of the servers and then the waitress if we can just pay for our drinks and leave since we're on a time crunch but both of them just told us to ""hold on."" Their constant excuse was that they were ""busy"" which was obviously untrue just seeing all the empty tables. A few minutes later we see our food come out but at that point we had no time or even the appetite for eating there anymore so we just paid for our drinks and left. The worst part about this ordeal was even as we were leaving, we overheard the waitress saying complaining about other tables being unhappy regarding how long were waiting. Can't comment on the food but it looked good if you have a lot of time on your hands.",,,

We came on a Sunday afternoon for a quick bite. The store was pretty empty (and now I know why). My chicken wrap literally felt like a kid made it as part of science experiment (did that sound too harsh.. I'm not sorry). Too many parts of the chicken were charred, salad drenched in dressing, and the tortilla wrap is barely holding the whole thing together as it is made so loosely that it sadly falls off. I also have to complain about the lack of protection for the entrance in the winter time. We sat in the seat next to the door and every time someone left and came in, boy did we feel it. My legs were numb from the freezing air by the time food got served. So no, I won't be going back.",3,2,1

I am a 49 year old woman that just finished a workout at Barry's bootcamp in Tribeca. I was with my son (home from college) , my daughter and cousin (visiting from London), a group of four that entered the establishment looking for a meal. The black woman (I am black too) said that they only have tables-for-two available. Me: ""Oh, can we just put those two tables together"" (pointing to two tables in the corner). Her response is ""no because the people next to you wouldn't be able get up and get to the bathroom"". I'm thinking to myself, ""The tables are literally against the wall, there is no possibility of that happening... unless they are walking thru the wall to get to the loo"". She continues, ""well we just don't move tables!"" And shoots me and ear-to-ear, psychotic smile. Then she tells her colleague loudly for us to hear and he comes over and says "" u can have the two tables but u have to sit separately"".

I would say an easy-going, super delicious, cozy must if you're in the neighborhood and hungry!",2,1,1

94,Andrew L.,"New York, NY",1,73,160,3.0,2/24/2017,"Had dinner at Sanctuary T on a Sunday evening a few weeks ago:Pros: - Used a Groupon with no issues - Food was reasonably good. Enjoyed the BrusselSprouts and the Mac and Cheese. The Duck Breast was just a bit overcooked.- Servers were friendly.  Cons:- Though the servers were friendly, they were sometimes overwhelmed. The bartender also acted as the waiter. - Towards the end of our dinner a group of non-customers who appeared to have had a little too much to drink barged into the restaurant to use the restroom. The waiter/bartender initially tried to stop them but gave in and let them use it. That caused us to have to leave immediately as my wife needed a restroom but did not want to wait to see what happened after the group had each used it.Not likely to return.",,,
95,Ankan J.,"Manhattan, NY",145,181,401,4.0,7/16/2014,"In the heart of Soho - we walked by this place a number of times thinking of just a CAFE and tea place.  But with open window seating available, decided to give it a shot for dinner - perfect for a nice summer day.Since this was after the world cup games earlier in the day, the place was out of a number of things on the menu - hopefully that only happens once every four years.  Drinks:Carrot Cilantro mojito is unlike anything you've ever had.  Not too overpowering, we really enjoyed it!  It might sound weird at first but definitely a must try.  The sangrias and infused cocktails all looked yummy judging from the tables around us who were enjoying them, and most are available by the pitcher as well.Food (vegetarian):- Cauliflower steak was the best, LOVED the lightly breaded seasoning!- Truffle mac and cheese was also awesome.  This can be made vegetarian.- Burrata crostini is fairly standard, though extremely fresh and tasty. I would list this the least favorite.- Ravioli was regular.  Not super impressed with this- Seasonal flatbread is supposedly amazing but they had run out.  Have to go back to try this out- Apple and arugula salad was good, though a bit pricy for what you get.",1,1,

Updated review","Well, I've loved the salad before but was very disappointed today when I got it to go. I paid $17.42 including tax for this salad (plus tip). When I got back to the office it was less than appealing. Not very fresh. Check out this browning red cabbage. When you spend $20 (with tip), I would hope to get a fresh salad at the very least. The bartender who I ordered from had a beautiful smile and the service was quick. I'm just really disappointed by the salad.",1,,
99,Jessica B.,"Royal Oak, MI",138,181,436,5.0,8/7/2016,"Came here last year and loved it, saw there was a Groupon so we decided to go back. This time it was their summer menu and everything sounded delicious. One of the reasons we loved this place so much was their unique cocktails. To start I ordered the sangria and my boyfriend got the doctors order. This was the most delicious sangria I have ever had. I have never had a sangria made with rose let alone rose buds and I highly recommend this drink. My boyfriend loved his drink, he said it was strong but delicious and unique. For dinner I got the turkey burger with a side salad and he got the umami burger with the truffle fries. I'm usually hesitant about getting turkey burgers but this was delicious! The avocado and aioli go so well with the turkey and made for an amazing dinner. The umami burger looked amazing and the truffle fries were to die for. Our waitress was extremely nice and since it took a little longer for us to get our food, she gave us complimentary chocolate mousse. Holy cow! The mousse was a perfect ending to an already delicious meal. Great food, great service, great night!",1,,

103,Devon M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,1,5.0,1/9/2018,"Alright ya'll, so I love to go out and I have very high standards, so when I say this hidden gem is one of the best restaurants in the city, I am NOT joking, baby! It has a cool, hip, sexy vibe, without feeling pretentious (great date-night spot), and the food will make you wanna scream ""YAASSS"" as loud as you possibly can. It's seasonal, fresh, farm to table American comfort food mixed with all things eastern, and for Soho, the prices are really good. It's the only place I'll eat vegetables because they use witchcraft or something and make Brussels sprouts and kale taste good, don't ask me how. If you like cocktails as much as me, get your ass over there. Now. They literally set like cinnamon on fire and put sage and dill in things, and have elevated their drinks to a new dimension. Oh, and they can pretty much make you any drink ... ANY DRINK. But the best part of this place is definitely the staff - they are all incredibly talented, extremely charming, gorgeous (am I allowed to say that?) and just like, people you wanna watch on a reality tv show about NYC restaurants. I love them all, but Jamie, Julio, Christian and Courtney are legends. Anyway, I'm new to Yelp, and this is the first place I wanted to review, so check it out If you're down-town. Not open super late, so plan accordingly.",,,
104,W. L.,"NY, NY",2,51,0,1.0,7/7/2017,"The vegan cocktail infused with rosemary is probably the worst drink I've ever tasted. It tasted of bitter, burned, over-the-top rosemary.

When calmly explaining to her that our truffle fries didn't taste of truffle oil she immediately started raising her voice at us even yelled ""if you can't taste something that's on you."" Look. If you don't know how to treat customers then at least don't disrespect them. No one wants that.Few basic things that I expect from a good restaurant - decent food, drinks and service. If you can't meet those then don't bother customers at least and ruin their experience.",1,,

107,Amy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",481,357,3613,4.0,5/20/2014,"The tea bar tenders are knowledgeable about the teas they serve here, everything I asked about they were able to tell me where its from, when it was picked, and how its good for you. The place is small, but cozy and intimate at the same time, usually it gets packed so come early or make a  reservation. I sat down by the bar with a friend, look into the menu and boy did I feel lost, didn't know what I should try since I'm no tea expert. They have a huge selection of tea, but then, I see this pie chart. It's called a mood chart, different moods labeled in different colors. How it works? So you pick your mood, look for your color and you would see a list of teas to choose from in that category. I remember I wanted something for relaxation and went for a ginger coconut green tea. They serve your tea with the right amount of leaves in a steeper, and hands you a timer so you would have to time your own tea, which I thought was cool. Oh yea and they serve rock sugars with their teas.We did also get a chance to try their sandwiches during afternoon tea. I thought they were a bit pricey and didn't really excite me. The macaroons were tasty and not overly sweet which paired well with my tea. I must say, the egg sandwiches was definitely my cup of tea! Egg salad is light and creamy.Overall, this place is great for a friend or two for some relaxing small talk. Next time I'm gonna boost it up and try their tea infused cocktails!",,,
108,Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",124,547,7478,3.0,4/3/2016,"Service was defiantly a 5 out of 5. Decided to try this place with a Groupon and really enjoyed the ambiance and vide.  Even though service was excellent I always hate places that tack on an automatic 20% gratuity. It just somehow feels like holding a gun to someone's head, nothing was written anywhere on the menu or voucher. Leaves a bad taste in you mouth (no pun intended).I love the concept of 80 different types of tea.The Burrata Toast ($13) was delicious. The crab and avocado salad was okay but definitely not worth the $26, I've had a more unique and delicious salad at local salad eateries for $10. They do get points for using real crab and not imitation crab meat, which has become the norm.My husband really enjoyed his burger, the meat tastes really fresh. The fries were way too salty.I didn't care for my drink ($14) 'any port in a storm,' as the taste of the rye was overpowering.A cute restaurant but expect to spend $100+ on 2 people (and that with only 1 cocktail each), the food did not blow me away for this price.",2,2,1

Tiny but comfortable, and very Asian-influenced interior. We were very comfortable at the bar. The bartender was a new girl that was training, but she was sweet as could be. They were having a special on their Green Tea Margaritas, so I tried one of those to start. I was pretty bummed when I saw they weren't blended fresh, but just sit in a blender pitcher in the fridge and the mix looked like a watered down slushie. However, actually, when I tried it - it was delicious and super refreshing. I still think they would be even better if you guys made them fresh to order.We tried a few other cocktails - the West Broadway which was my favorite. Fruity St. Germain, chamomile tea and lavender mix with gin and get a kick of really fresh, clean flavor when mint and cucumber are added. We also tried the Jasmine Caprioska - also good. Drinks are pricey however and are not very heavy on the alcohol, it's more about enjoying the tea and the flavors, which may happen very quickly because the drinks arrive in tall glasses, but you soon realize it's all mostly ice.We shared the Greek Platter for 2 as an appetizer. It was okay. The hummus was very average and really lacking in flavor. Everything else was good but you don't really mess up olives or feta. Pita was good (although heavily salted), but you definitely need to order more with the toppings-to-pita ratio and they know that, which is why they charge $2 for extra pita.I would go back again for tea, cocktails or a light lunch, but I can very quickly tell that it's overpriced and mediocre food for dinner, so maybe skip that and come before or after for tea-infused drinks.",1,,

If you are solo, or on a date, or looking to have a leisurely catch-up with a friend, I highly recommend it! My gentleman simply loses his mind over the miso salmon every time, and I like the simple but lovely crab-avocado salad. I try a different cocktail every time; most recently the ""Kind of a Big Dill"" -- vegetal, light, not sweet -- and ""Momma's Breakfast"" -- with a smokey flavor provided by real smoke! I also enjoy the personalities of the servers and managers I've met; they are confident and proud of their work but chill about offering an unhurried experience. They don't even blink if you have a Groupon, which I think is a solid metric of a consistently pleasant customer-service attitude.

You have to make a reservation because they have a specific set up for this offer. (The offer includes unlimited tea with a selection of pastries and sandwiches. The food is neatly arranged upon your arrival). The pastries and sandwiches were satisfactory, but not to die for. The tea however was worth finding this place. I am not a coffee nor tea addict...Yet, I found this to be an enriching experience. The staff was friendly when helping us make a tea selection. If you don't want to listen to their suggestions then there is a tea chart that you can use as your guide!  I also loved that they have a variety of tea flavors placed in displayed. The options are endless!!The display encouraged me to try different tea flavors and find my favorite one. In order for me to accomplish this mission I have to continue coming to this place, and trust me I will!",2,,
146,Erum R.,"New York, NY",236,320,223,2.0,8/3/2015,"Well I basically feel like I drank a cup of olive oil...We wanted to be spontaneous so dropped in. Also the prices were decent. Put in our order and waited a good 30 minutes for it to come out. The restaurant was scorching hot, they didn't have the AC on, only two fans which didn't seem to do anything. I ordered the shrimp with white wine in a garlic sauce. It came out in a bowl, and was literally plain shrimp sitting in a bowl of olive oil with some garlic on the bottom and one parsley leaf barely chopped up. I couldn't taste the white wine acidity and this is where the overdose of olive oil comes in. I also ordered the zucchini fries which were horrendous. They basically took a zucchini, cut it into fourths length wise, and dropped it in a deep fryer. It was more like deep fried zucchini chunks with no flavor and too much oil. I couldn't eat it and sent it back. Luckily they comped us for this and the waitress was sympathetic about how the dish is misleading. My husband had the lemongrass chicken which was virtually flavorless and overlooked. Nothing is worse than dry chicken. The decor was pretty and drinks seemed interesting but I will not, absolutely not, ever come back. And please do yourself a favor and walk a few streets up to Spring where there is much better food. Keeping it to two stars because the waitress was nice and bartender friendly.",1,,

That right there tells you how much a restaurant values customer service. I'm not sure why some fellow Yelpers said the brunch wasn't great but I came with 5 others and we thought the food for the most part was good, some unique. I loved my dish- le croque provincial. It was a twist on the French classic madam croque which usually consists or a half open bread topped with cheese ham and egg. This one was full of flavor and perfectly crispy. It could do with a little less cheese though. My favorite part was indeed the tea from the specialties selection. I got the flaming tea which was delicious in medium flavor. It's name derives from when the different teas touch at one point, the jasmine pearls at the bottom open up like flames. All I know is that it tasted perfectly- no sweetness or bitterness. Others got the matcha latte (a bit milky), regular coffee and a hibiscus tea.  Ill be back!",2,1,
148,Karry L.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,475,273,3.0,7/2/2014,"I want to give it 4 star but the slow service during brunch time and pricey menu cut 0.5 star, so it's solid 3.5 star. Its decor was lovely and tranquil, w a small bar specialized in tea drinks/cocktails, it fits its name, also a good place for people watching on the busy street of soho by the main entraince on a nice summer day. Seats and table are very comfortable, I wouldn't have paid so much attention to details if i didn't have to wait pretty long time for my food; and i also noticed that manage had to wait when the table filled up.  I love the fact that they have varieties of loose leaves, it's a tea place afterall. its tea drinks are served w a rock sugar stick which stirs and mixes your drink.  the presentation is very pleasing, but the taste of tea is slightly weaker than I expected, esp the two drinks we ordered (chai and jasmine green tea). Friend had breakfast burrito that he really liked, I had salmon scrambled eggs, it was ok, very little salmon, eggs were slightly overcooked, I also love that they served couple pieces of fresh fruits on each plate!  I was lucky for getting the restaurant.com promo to cut down my bills abit, otherwise it's pretty expensive brunch.  I wouldn't mind to just come back to try their tea cocktails after shopping in the area and unwind!",,,

There were several employees walking around, serving people, making drinks, etc. After several minutes of waiting, we began looking around, wondering if anyone was going to even acknowledge that we had come in. A pair of women then came in and a server offered them a table, and a few minutes later took their order. We sat at the counter for over 10 minutes, having multiple employees make drinks right in front of us, without a single person even recognizing our presence. We finally left after feeling like we were invisible. It was an incredibly disappointing experience. We won't be back.",,,

It has sleek decor- makes it less noticeable how small the space is. The space is used very efficiently, there are nice cushioned seated tables near the wall, and spots to sit at the bar. They usually play pretty upbeat music too. In the summer they open the big windows. So, if you are by the windows it's almost like you are sitting outside!Their selection of tea is really great- there are event charts to explain the flavors and intensity of each tea. What I love is how they bring out rock candy on a stick for you to use as your stirrer. The menu has a good selection- the portions are a little on the smaller size... but for me it's just right! I like how everything is very natural and not too oily- more ""healthy"" if you will. The staff here is very friendly and very knowledgeable about their drinks and dishes. I definitely will be back soon! Love it here and I'm sure you will too if you enjoy quaint little restaurant/ bars in the city that aren't too loud.",,,

Updated review","Honestly had the worst experience ever here. If they'd allow 0 stars if go for it in a heartbeat. To begin with, we came here after knowing a friend of ours came as well. So I got my hopes high. We came in and were greeted by the workers but weren't seated just yet. We wanted to sit by the door seat but the table was dirty so we just waited for the waiter to clean it. After a few moments, we told him that we'd sit there but yet he still didn't wipe the mess the previous customers made. After waiting for SOOO long, we finally got the menu. After waiting for another 10 minutes or so the waiter finally came to get our order. Mind you, our table wasn't fully cleaned yet. He took another tables' order before us even though they came before... Despite all this inconvenience, on the bright side we were about 10 minutes away from being able to order from the lunch menu, yet the waiter was nice enough to let us order the truffle Mac and cheese. We also ordered a blt from the breakfast menu. Another 20 minutes went by and our food finally came. It looked pretty appetizing but the result was inferior. The Mac and cheese was too watery and it didn't have enough taste to it. In addition to that, they literally gave us 5 tiny bits of bacon???? $12 for this is such a rip off. While reading other reviews, mine is pretty controversial. But, I'm just stating facts.Regardless of the terrible experience, don't get me wrong the waiters are pretty nice and this is a cute little place.",,,
156,Fatima S.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,20,9,2.0,10/5/2016,This is not for the food.  The food is great which is why I have come here for years.  This is for the service.  I hate to say it but...it's bad.  They took my plate and 20+ min later no one has come to give me my check..offer a dessert...order another drink or even water.  I don't know what is considered worse as a customer having to go up to the counter to ask for service or just waiting around.  Either way...I'm turned off.  Paying 30 bucks for a crostini and a cup of tea never bothered me but today I felt like it was money wasted.,,,
157,Atl F.,"Atlanta, GA",26,56,16,5.0,7/12/2015,"Awesome place, walked by here after doing some shopping in the area and wanted a meal that was healthy. I got the roasted Branzino with a a side Brussels sprouts and an iced tea (tea selection here is crazy). I didn't feel like drinking alcohol so I went with the tea and I was happy with it. Branzino had so much flavor and was juicy with lemon olive oil as the base. The Brussels sprouts were awesome and had a awesome touch of balsamic that pushed them over to perfection, also they are cooked perfectly and had a light crisp on the outer leaves . Service was good and next time I go I will try some of the alcoholic beverages as I saw the bartender was wizard making so many concoctions for the other patrons that looked delicious.",,1,

I had the striped bass and while it wasn't bad, it definitely wasn't worth the price. I got my drink for free (with Hooch) and it was alright, but not something I'd ever be comfortable paying $8-12 for.

161,Eric L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,175,0,4.0,1/3/2016,"A fun place for a drink, and a spot of tea guvnah, hip hip, cheerio.  The bartender was cool, I got a cocktail where he took some duck fat, used a blowtorch to make it start smoking, and then put my drink glass over the smoke.  He let it sit there for a few minutes, took it off and poured a bourbon drink into the smokey glass.  Every sip not only delicious, but smelled delicious too, what a cool drink.  I tried my date's tea, and that was tasty as well, they leave the tea strainer for you to use as you wish.  Overall, a nice atmosphere, got a little loud at the tables behind us (we were at the bar), but it was ok since you could still hear each other talk easily.  Nice and dark, it was a good time.",,,
162,Evelina I.,"Franklin Square, NY",127,1,0,1.0,6/9/2017,"Just stopped by for happy hour drinks and had the worst experience. There was no room at the bar, so we asked the host if we could sit at a table instead, and he obliged (we had told him we were only having drinks). Ordered our drinks, and after 20 minutes of waiting with nothing in hand, we left. As opposed to serving us, the host and bartender kept staring at us while giving other patrons their drinks/food who were sitting at the surrounding tables. Instead of waiting another 20 minutes, we walked out. I never post on yelp because I usually have a good experience, but this restaurant by far has the most atrocious service ever. If we were not welcome to sit at a table, the host could have told us politely as opposed to ignoring us while we sat waiting for our drinks.",,,

My friend and I were so thirsty so we were looking for anywhere to get some drink and we just walked in. I always thought this place was one of restaurants on W Broadway which I am not really fan of... but yes, they do have food menu there but surprisingly they have great refreshment  menu. Place Was packed so we sat at the bar and we both got fresh fruity drink. You can literally ask anything you want, the waiter ( didn't get his name) was  so knowledgable with drink and he kindly accommodated any special order we asked. I asked for ginger, lime and mint ice tea.  I wanted to be sweet but not sugary so I had it with honey. Yum and super fresh. My friend got strawberry lemonade and there were good amount of fresh strawberries in her drink. She absolutely loved it. Waiter even gave to us free rose wine on the house. Awesome! .

I feel like I only get 4-5 ravioli and 4 ricotta fritters per order, especially when I order out. That's nearly $3 a fritter/ravioli!! I'm willing to pay it because the food is so good, but I'd be a muchhhhh more frequent customer if I thought I was going to get more food every time (think about it... by giving me more food per order, you'd be making more money in the long run!)I hope you find it in your hearts to give more food per order, because I'm finding it harder and harder to justify spending as much money as I do at your restaurant.Love,Loyal customer who lives across the street",1,1,

172,Wing C.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",213,1403,9445,4.0,2/27/2013,"My maid of honor and her friend were visiting the city. I thought afternoon tea would be perfect for us girls to meet, sit down and catch up. I actually have never done afternoon tea in the city so I was really excited. I love love love the presentation of tiers of goodies/finger food -  savory, sweets, and sandwiches all brought out to you at once. I made reservation for 3 ppl  @ 3PM. We arrived promptly and there was only one additional party in the restaurant. Every table had the tea menu ready and we noticed the rock candy with the tea spices displayed nicely on the table for us. The tea menu was extensive. We started off with Eight Treasures, White Lillies, and Soho Chai. The tea came out within 5 mins and our tiers of goodies followed shortly after. I sampled everything within the first 2 mins (literally taking a bite of everything). I thought the unlimited tea also included unlimited food .. so I went all out XD.  Nevertheless, I wasn't disappointed. My friends were stuffed way before they had a chance to try everything. Our favorites ended up being the scone (with yummy fresh cream and jam) and the salmon sandwiches. Before we were 1/4 into our food, we ordered our second round of tea. This time we tried vanilla crescent, pear cobbler and green geisha? Vanilla crescent was sooooooooo yummy and my favorite of the day! My friend wasn't too crazy about her pear cobbler (too sour for her taste). For our third round, we ordered watermelon, energy, and toasted almond. My friend who didn't like the pear cobbler ended up loving her toasted almond. Watermelon was tasty but not as good as the vanilla crescent. Around 4:40, I decided to make my money worth by ordering 2 more tea - tiramisu and chunky monkey. Chunk monkey had a sour/burnt tire smell.. but it was actually really yummy. Tiramisu was exactly how I imagined it... just like Tiramisu. We stayed for the full 2 hrs and had no problem whatsoever in ordering (re-ordering) our tea. They didn't have a problem with us not finishing our previous tea and wanting to try something new too. By the time we were ready to go, the place was packed!11 diff tea + tiers of sweets + savory goodies for $24 per person + tax + tip (they included the 18% gratuity charge). Honestly I don't think it's worth the price... good thing we came with groupon. The final total (after presenting our groupon) was $43.35. Still pretty pricey for tea for 3. 43.35+24 = Almost 70 dollars! Nevertheless, a really fun experience.",1,1,1

I loved the decoration inside and it was one of those relaxing and enjoyable environment for drinks and dinner. The restaurant lighting was romantic and each table has candle light. it's a great place for couple and friends to hang out. The cocktails were very unique and you couldn't find them everywhere. I ordered an Any Port in A Storm which contains egg white (thought protein is very healthy), this drink was not bad but not great. I would order something else next time. However, my friend got a white wine and it was absolutely delicious so he couldn't resist of getting another glass. The Duck confit was very good. we sat at the bar and we were able to see the bartender making drinks professionally. The staff there were very friendly so the overall experience was great. I saw this deal on Groupon so I decided to visit again. Same old. Even though I told the waitress that I have a Groupon deal. she didn't treat me differently. She was very polite and friendly and introduced me their menu. The drinks and food took awhile to come but it was worth of wait. The food was delicious and my bf was surprised.

The other problem was the noise level.  Seated in the back area, I found myself somewhat yelling in order to be heard.  The music was loud and it was only 4:30pm on a Sunday...I mean I just want to have a conversation without feeling like I'm in a club.Maybe I was having an off day but I was under-whelmed by Sanctuary T.",,,

I didn't eat much during the day just in case, but I actually anticipated the food being very minimal, and actually planned on going out to dinner after just in case.I was completely wrong. They brought out an adorable platter with an assortment of pastries and sandwiches, and by the time I was finished I was stuffed. It was more than enough food for two people - three probably could have eaten off of it. The wait staff was delightful. They were very attentive, and checked up on us periodically to ask if we wanted more tea or if the food was to our satisfaction. When I asked one of the ladies which tea I should choose she actually gave it some thought and picked me something delicious.My only complaint was the size of the tea glasses - I'd prefer a smaller portion per tea because having a giant tumbler of hot tea is a little much for me. I normally drink my tea out of much smaller cups. Plus it didn't insulate well, so it was hot to hold.I would definitely recommend Sanctuary T for a fun afternoon out, and I plan on trying to stop back by there for lunch, dinner, or brunch sometime.",1,,

186,A T.,"New York, NY",0,21,0,2.0,5/23/2016,"We went for dinner using Groupon.  Four of us sat down and ordered our drinks, 20 minutes passed by without getting anything.  Our waiter was drinking his tea inside of counter, paying zero attention to the floor.  I finally walked over to the bartendar and asked what happened to our drinks.  After 5 more minutes wait he brought wrong orders.  Food - especially my miso salmon - was delicious and that was the best part.  Their chef knows what he is doing, but they need to clean up the diningroom performance.  When we were told 20% service charge is added to all the Groupon bills, I had to politely tell them that we did not receive 20% tip worth of service.  They agreed to take it out from our bill and we left  with 15% tip instead.  None of us will ever want to go back there.",,,
187,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,1.0,8/14/2012,"Met with some girl friends for brunch a while back.Food was pretty good. Your typical brunch fare. The place was busy and crowded. All in all, it would have been a decent experience, except for one crucial thing.THE SERVER CHARGED SOMEONE ELSE'S BILL TO MY CREDIT CARD. Are you serious??!??A bill, mind you, that was MUCH more than the cost of our own meal. The server was apologetic, but the damage was done. I was pissed to learn I'd have to leave the place with a DOUBLE charge on my card (one for our meal, one for whoever else's the server had charged) with only the weak promise that this would get resolved in the next week or so (hopefully not by the same person who screwed this up). And I would have to babysit my account for the next few days and PRAY I wouldn't have to call the restaurant and argue off a wrongful charge.I'd like to say hey, the food is good, try it out, but then I'd be subjecting others to the risk of paying double for that meal.It's just not worth the hassle for a restaurant  that is only ""pretty good.""",1,4,1
188,Bonnie E.,"Manhattan, NY",450,81,0,1.0,8/14/2014,"The worst overpriced cocktail I have ever had.  We stopped in for a drink knowing nothing about the place.  We ordered vodka martinis.  My friend had ordered a dirty martini which was served with no olives.  When she asked for olives, the bartender took out a cheap jar of salad olives and dumped a couple in her glass.  The martinis were served in  small glasses.  I had asked for a twist of lemon in mine and was given a thick slice of lemon peel.  The charge for each drink was $17!  If you are going to charge that much, serve it in a bigger glass, with a big green olive, a proper twist along with some mixed nuts and in a nicer looking place. Oh right, a nicer looking place would be somewhere else in that neighborhood.  I can't speak to the food or the tea but I will never find out because I will never go back.",2,2,
189,Chantel B.,"University Heights, Bronx, NY",4,32,23,4.0,11/29/2014,The food and atmosphere was very nice!  Had brunch with my family and everyone was very pleased with their choices.,1,,
190,Chris H.,"New York, NY",9,352,0,4.0,4/24/2016,"Only tried the drinks, but they were good. The ambience is great, especially on a day when it's warm out. More mellow than some of the surrounding bars. The happy hour specials seem good. The bartender was helpful and made good drink suggestions. It's a hybrid tea room/bar/restaurant, so a lot of their specialty cocktails used tea infused vodka, like earl grey bourbon, for example.",,,
191,Minto S.,"Richmond Hill, NY",149,274,10,3.0,2/23/2015,"Came here for a late lunch the other day.  The place is very cozy and the service is great.  I ordered the fish tacos and Kale salad, I could've passed on the tacos but the Kale salad was pretty yummy although it had a bit too much cheese on it.The best part of this place is the drinks.....they are awesome.  I tried their white wine Sangria and it was perfect.  The place is also pretty pricey.",,,
192,Brittany H.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,101,0,3.0,11/15/2014,"I made a reservation here quite randomly. I had no idea that it was a ""tea"" place. I guess my brain did not put two and two together. Nonetheless, I came here for dinner with a friend and to my surprise, it was quite good! I was starving and I ordered the burger which was cooked pretty well. I will add that there was only one other party in the restaurant for dinner so to say we got a lot of special attention is a bit of an understatement. I loved it though. We also had a few glasses of wine, which were up to par. Overall, it's a very quaint place... I almost walked right past it, but with pretty good food and nice intimate setting. I can't comment on the ""T"" part though.",1,,
193,Ian E.,"Manhattan, NY",110,32,7,3.0,4/17/2016,"Service was very poor and they sat us at a dirty table with food all over it.  Waitress was inattentive and did not know the menu at all.  She could not suggest a tea for me to order when I told her I just wanted a plain unsweetened ice tea.  Food was very good though, the fish tacos and crostini's were both very tasty.",,,
194,James S.,"Brooklyn, NY",91,3,0,4.0,8/7/2016,Cocktails were delicious! That was the main reason for going there. So we ordered the crab salad and duck confit. Luckily we had a Groupon and paid half price otherwise I definitely wouldn't have paid $26 for the salad and the duck was tiny! Had clearly been marinated and salted for too long as it was extremely dry. Luckily the server was LOVELY and I ended up getting a free steak! Ended up leaving extremely satisfied.,,,
195,Kimberly L.,"CORONA, NY",254,135,221,5.0,9/10/2014,"I didn't dine here. As I waited for the Bolt bus to arrive, I walked around and found this little spot and decided to have a pre-trip cocktail. This spot earned 5 stars because I had one of the best sangrias EVER. If you're in the area or are dining there, try the Rose Basil Sangria. Refreshing, fruity, champagne-y. Awesome.",1,,

197,Tracey M.,"Chicago, IL",77,402,40,5.0,1/12/2016,I was at Sanctuary T for a private party.  The space worked out great for the number of people in attendance.  The cucumber sandwiches were perfect finger food.  The Sake To Me was quite delicious and has to be the most unique cocktail I've ever tried.  This is definitely a place I'd like to eat at sometime during regular business hours.,,,
198,Ida Iselin E.,"Oslo, Norway",222,211,126,3.0,9/11/2014,"I came here a while back with my old roommate. We were walking around Soho and just wanted a place to sit down, enjoy a bottle of wine and catch up, and that is how we ended up at Sanctuary T. The place is cozy, intimate and has open window seating so it is almost like sitting outside (not completely outdoor seating but close enough).To be honest it was nothing about this place that stood out. Our wine was not all that good (recommended by a waiter who clearly had no idea what he was talking about), the food was mediocre, and the service was ok. The only plus is the open window seating where you can sit and watch people as they walk by.It might just be my melancholic mood that day that ruined my experience, but given all the options around Soho I would chose something else.",1,,
199,Aleksey K.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,84,2,1.0,8/2/2014,"I'm pretty sure I reviewed this place a while back and gave them a good review.Came back here few weeks ago and I can no longer recommend it. Scratch that, I would recommend that you avoid this place.The drinks are $18 and are extremely basic and dull. Cucumber something? Strawberry something? $18? Before we would have an option of getting a nice big glass of sangria with tons of fruits in it.The food sucked. Got their Mac & Cheese ($10?), it was pretty good before but this time it felt like cheese was replaced with water. Disgusting.Our waiter was also new, which is cool. But you don't have to be an expert in customer service to realize that it's not OK to get the drink order and then sit right next to our table and eat a cherry pie while we are waiting to order food.Oh, they are also including gratitude by default now. That should tell you everything you need to know.",1,1,
