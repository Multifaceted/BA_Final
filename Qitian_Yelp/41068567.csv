0,Lexcita G.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,4.0,11/5/2018,"This was my first time going to this establishment and i must admit i had a very good time. My cousin and I went for a birthday celebration. Upon arrival i assumed it was just a restaurant and bar, but downstairs it's a whole club. Atmosphere is very nice and upscale. The crowd was diverse. Music was great. It was very crowded but that is to be expected in NYC on Saturday night. I did order a vodka cranberry, it was okay. Not too watered down. I don't have anything negative to say about this place. If you're out in NYC and want a nice club to go to, this is definitely an option.",,,
1,matthew h.,"New York, NY",227,210,3,2.0,11/9/2018,"Ok, I'm confused. This place looks like a Moroccan dwelling. The cocktail names  all are puns on North African themes. The bar snacks are Moroccan. The waitresses all loo like they're trying out for I dream of Jeannie. So why frack is it named after an island nation off the coast of southern India?With that lack of understanding of marketing, it's no surprise how lackluster the service is. The cocktails were ok, but not like you couldn't get as good elsewhere, with friendly service.",,,
2,CB M.,"New York, NY",122,146,41,1.0,8/4/2018,"It's a beautiful room that loses its luster within a couple of minutes. Staff are rude/uptight, unhelpful, and not concerned about service. Automatic 20% tip included so why be nice to the customers?Oh and THEY DO NOT BRING WATER. Apparently ""it's a rule"" and they have all been instructed to provide bottled water only, at $8/each. We asked for waters with our martinis. No dice. So we left and spent a lot more money down the street.",4,1,
3,Siddharth P.,"Manhattan, NY",3,14,2,1.0,6/29/2018,"Worst place when it comes to service !Don't serve water , only bottled water! Cost - 10 bucks. Our server had a face which made us feel very unwelcome.We asked her to take a group pic . Reply was I am very busy.And then we realised it was the same throughout the entire place.Never going back !",4,1,
4,Lana L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",549,420,3296,4.0,9/16/2018,"I thought Cèlon was a really nice venue. It was super dark, but not uncomfortably dark. Ambience was a little different than your typical New York City bar. Although the lounge was small to medium in size, there was still plenty of seating and tables while not taking up too much space either. A small crowd was dancing, so there was space for that too. They made a decent whiskey sour and did not skimp on the alcohol.",4,2,2
5,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1260,4.0,4/24/2018,"I came here for drinks since I had dinner reservations nearby. I fell in love with this place the minute I walked in.Love the whole Moroccan décor and all the waitress were dress accordingly. This place has a very sexy intimate atmosphere. We took a seat and looked at the menu, we only ordered drinks since we were heading to dinner. I go the charcoal martini with gold leave. I have to say it was good and very strong.I would definitely come back and spend more time here since I really liked the vibe.",6,2,4
6,Nick G.,"Miller Place, NY",262,2,0,3.0,11/12/2018,"Nice atmosphere, upscale vibe, good dj. $17 Moscow mule is painful but to be expected in a midtown club, on a positive note it was much larger than expected and was very well made. I would give the place 5 stars but they had that guy in the bathroom who's sole purpose is to provide you paper towels and stare you down for tips which is far more annoying than convenient, and the bartender tried charging me $6 for a bottle of Voss water after I watched them give a girl a free glass of water, which is just plain obnoxious. From what I'm reading in these other reviews, they've also tried charging people $8 and $10 for water, and that kind of greed is enough to prevent me from going back",,,
7,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",92,155,93,3.0,11/23/2017,"More like 3.5 Stars. Okay, this place was pretty crowded when I went so I'm not sure why this only has 1 review so far. Met a friend here on a weeknight for drinks and found that it was a pretty casual/loungey venue with tables, couches etc. It's in the lower level of a hotel but when entering (after coat checks, which are mandatory), the space is very dim and cavernous with moderate noise levels. Seemed like there were at least two main areas with a bar in the lower level. Service was decent, but the waiters disappeared at times and so hailing one for the bill was tough! Long story short: Decent place with an interesting cocktail menu (drinks are $17!, beer is $6) Would I come back here? No thank you. Proceed if you're looking for some dim, confusing, and pricey middle eastern (ish) den experience.",4,2,1
8,Wendy W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",24,14,0,1.0,8/4/2018,"The couches and ceiling lamps create a Morracanesque ambiance, but the music, staff, and policies are unappealing. Five martinis ordered - all warm (ick!) asked for ice water, no tap only bottles for $8 (wtf?) no return visit for me.",2,1,
9,Scarlet B.,"Bronx, NY",295,4,15,5.0,6/5/2018,"I came here alone after work, the vibe is IT HUNTY!!!!! The service is top notch, I wish I remembered my servers name but he was amazing. I had the Marakech & the Lavender Oasis (AKA MY FAVE). I also had the Pizza Bites they were okay, enough to make me not feel buzzed. the drinks were superb and the decor even better. Will def be returning!!",1,,
10,Lilly T.,"Manhattan, NY",10,19,4,2.0,3/25/2018,"Had been meaning to check out the place since I had seen pictures. Met my friend there for drinks. She had been there when it was the Cellar Bar and we both loved the renovations and new decor. Drinks: Pricey but most hotel lounges have pricey drinks. Specially if they have a cool theme. Food: Tiny. The pizza we ordered was like a grandma slice they cut into 8 pieces and charge you $10. The rest is what they call a la carte. If you order hummus the bread does not come with it. Who eats hummus without something to dip in it?! We ordered babaganush with bread, my friend liked it but I could not get over the a la carte situation. Not a fan. Water: ONLY bottled. Don't think they will hand you a glass of New York's finest tap. You will have to pay $4 for a bottle of water. I've heard of this at a club but at a bar?! Apparently they used to serve tap water and the manager decided against it. Wow. Go for the decor, get a $17 drink, take your photos for Instagram and move on to another bar to enjoy yourself.",2,1,
11,Bek P.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",12,9,0,1.0,8/6/2018,"O stars is actually more accurate. Came here for a special occasion with my girlfriends. The space is beautiful but our excitement was quickly dampened by rude staff and policies that are driven by profit at the expense of experience, customer service, and the environment. Our group all ordered cocktails (which came out warm) and water but were refused tap water because Celon Lounge and the entire Bryant Park Hotel do not serve tap water. Instead, we were offered bottle water for $8 and were shamed by our server for asking for something as basic as tap water. Apparently, New York's water which is universally considered very high quality is not good enough for the Bryant Park Hotel. The automatic 20% tip was the icing on this rotten cake. Shame on you, Celon Lounge!",1,1,
12,Kevin G.,"Edison, NJ",314,4,0,1.0,6/24/2018,"I would give this place 0 stars if I could and that would be generous. I asked for water after being in the VIP table, purchasing bottle service, and they would not provide tap water in any circumstances and the next option was to purchase a $7 VOSS glass water bottle. Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience, the bartender proceeded to say ""1 oak and Up & Down don't provide free water either"" which to me is really funny because 1 oak and Up & Down are celebrity locations, I'm sorry Cèlon you are far from that. Know your place in NYC bars, clubs, lounges and don't compare yourself to a real club lounge.",2,1,
13,Mick S.,"Palisades, NY",16,44,8,5.0,11/3/2017,"4 Coworkers and I went to Célon after work this week. This is a new lounge in the space formerly occupied by the Cellar Bar in The Bryant Park Hotel. We made reservations for a table on that ""restaurant reservation site"" which worked out well.  We had a nice table overlooking the lower bar area. We were very happy. The new decor is very cool and the seats are super comfortable. It's got a Mediterranean vibe but it's not overdone. Theres a nice sound system and the light level was low, which I prefer. The drinks weren't too expensive and the staff were really friendly. I just drank bourbon but a few people had the charcoal martini and thought it was unusual and good. We also ordered some bread, vegetables and Mediterranean dips. They were good too. No complaints. We'll be back.",4,,1
14,Michael J.,"Henderson, NV",568,47,7,1.0,5/25/2018,"Gyp as fuck. No alcohol I'm my 3 drinks for my friend. $104. I wrote ""are you f*cking kidding me"" on the tip line because they treated me like shit and asked my friend who wrote that. I did and i reviewed this Rip off joint. Don't go here. Music sucks, bar sucks. Whole place SUCKS!!!!",2,4,
15,Kevin R.,"Plainville, CT",438,12,1,1.0,3/10/2018,Me and a group of my friends were gay bashed by the bar tender. The manager was wonderful and took care of our drinks but we will most definitely not be back and suggest any homosexuals refrain from showing business to this homophobic establishment.,2,1,
16,Trisha P.,"High Bridge, NJ",338,1,0,1.0,6/23/2018,Asked for water at the bar because my friend wasn't feeling well and they said they have no water. They only have sparkling water or bottled water for purchase. Bottled water is $7 which is obnoxious. This is very unaccommodating for a place that is charging cover to get in and has pricey drinks.,1,1,
17,NyGirl C.,"New York, NY",1,33,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY supporting this bar and it's ridiculous policies. I was with a group of 7 people. Upon arrival, we ordered 1 of every appetizer on the menu and were deciding on cocktails. We asked for water while deciding and they would not provide tap water. The owner does not allow tap water to be served and instead will only sell bottles of Voss (12 oz), which turned out to be $8/each (which obviously they did not tell us upon ordering). What makes it even worse was that it was a 90 degree, incredibly humid day - not the kind of day you deny people water. The food was mediocre and the cocktails fine, but expensive. So despite spending several hundred dollars buying every item on the menu + ordering 7 cocktails (at about $15-$20/each) neither the waitress nor manager would make an exception to bring us water. While he made $32 dollars on water, the owner and his ridiculous rule will actually cost more in 7 lost customers (all influential NYC publicists) and bad reviews. Terrible policy, terrible experience, terrible customer service.",1,1,
18,Thomas G.,"North Palm Beach, FL",4,5,0,2.0,12/20/2017,Drinks are expensive and small just doing drinks and apps at bar ordered humus and it came with a spoon!?? No bread or crackers. Ugh! Bar is neat but not worth my time too many other cool places to go,3,2,
