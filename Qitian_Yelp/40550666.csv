Updated review","Oh. My. Glob.... Talk about going waaaay over expectations. So I'm one of those people that's trying to be healthier and eat more wholesome foods. I've been doing a good job of staying away from my usual orders (like burgers, fries, steak, chicken fingers, pasta, sandwiches, onion rings *cue Homer Simpson drool sound* ...wait what were we talking about....oh yeah, right). Anyways... I got out of work late and just wanted to grab a quick bite to eat, but because I'm trying to be ""healthy"", my late dinner had to be something along the lines of a salad or at least protein with veggies. After a quick search on Yelp I found this hole in the wall. When you walk in there is the counter, a tiny narrow space and the wall. It was also dimly lit and looked like they could use renovations, but that's not important. I ordered the lite delight salad and honestly I was just expecting lettuce and frozen chicken. Boy, do I feel like an idiot for judging a book by it's cover. I mean the photo I took speaks for itself. I ended up getting this monster of a salad with fresh ingredients (including hot, fresh off the grill cooked chicken that was somehow not oily but not dry).They have seating in the back if you're too hungry to take your food to go (which is exactly what I did). Not a lot of space but the food is phenomenal. I will definitely be returning to see how good their other salads are!",,,
1,Caroline Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",92,66,17,4.0,8/29/2018,"Love this place - the perfect little deli shop to grab a good sammie during your lunch break if you work in the area. They are very quick to make your food and have a ton of different options. Everything is very fresh and also vegetarian friendly!! My personal favorites are the spicy veggie on pita and the veggie burger, and I can also never pass up one of those big chocolate chip cookies",,,
2,Lisa G.,"Port Chester, NY",37,3,5,5.0,8/11/2018,"The problem with Yelp is people like the ones on here that give LD one stars. That's actually ridiculous. Let's start with those that don't like the ""ambience"" or think it's a ""dump"" - this is a deli on Houston that charges fair prices and probably has exorbitant rent. So if they don't have the money to renovate it, who cares?! It's a DELI for grab and go sandwiches, salads, smoothies, etc. Does the decor even matter? No it doesnt. More importantly, the food is awesome. We eat here at least once a week, it's by far our favorite place to get a sandwich in NYC. If you don't like the food, you're ordering the wrong things. Get the Thai sweet chicken wrap or chicken deluxe wrap (add jalapeños) and trust me, you'll keep going back. Note: I must feel strongly about this since i don't write Yelp reviews ever but was astonished to see some of the other reviews.",2,,
3,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,170,469,4.0,12/3/2017,"Narrow place on Houston, came here for a quick bite. Pleasant enough service, there's even a few tables in the back. I ordered the bulgolgi rice bowl for $8. Cooked on the spot so it was quick. The bowl itself was pretty big, bulgolgi mixed with onions and mushrooms over brown rice. Also served with some lettuce, carrots, tomato, and optional jalapeño for a side salad. The bulgolgi was actually quite tasty, slightly dry but very good for the price and portion. The other bowls including the chicken bowls look good, so I'll likely be stopping by here again next time I want a quick, cheap, healthy meal.",,,
4,Evan H.,"Manhattan, NY",122,2,0,5.0,8/11/2018,"I rarely write Yelp reviews, but I go to this place maybe once a week, and it's the best deli in NYC. Their sandwiches are amazingly creative and delicious. I have seen delis in the area come and go due to increasing rents, but this place has stood the test of time for good reason. It's busy during the lunch hour, but it's great any time of day. I can't say enough about this place. My go-to sandwiches are the Thai Sweet Chicken and Chicken Deluxe. Get either one and prepare to have your mind blown.",,,
5,Chris C.,"New York, NY",148,185,24,3.0,11/29/2017,"small sandwich joint, they do have other types of food here. It's cheap, quick and what you see is what you get.

6,Cameron L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,68,3,1.0,3/23/2018,"Please spend your money elsewhere. The older Asian man who is the owner is SO RUDE and either laughs in your face or rolls his eyes at you.

8,Y P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,7/12/2018,"The produce quality is not the best.  Also, I recently came in for a quick scrambled egg bagel while running to work.  The man behind the counter asked what kind of bagel I wanted, and I replied ""whatever you have"" because I was in a hurry and assumed they'd grab a plain bagel, onion, salt/pepper, or something like that.  Instead, I was horrified to find out that they put the scrambled eggs onto a cinnamon raison bagel.  I know I was in a hurry and should have specified exactly what I wanted, but COME ON!  That's just plain rude especially when I saw they had more than one bagel option available.  Assholes, poor quality fruits, and the place is a dump.  See the below reviews regarding how much of a jerk this guy is.",1,1,
9,Paddy D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,2,5.0,7/10/2017,Love this place.DeliciousGreat value for moneyFriendly serviceTastes fresh and healthy options Much better than any seamless order considering the price. I recommend picking up (if you live nearby) - it's very quick.,,,
10,Corisa K.,"Queens, NY",327,108,242,2.0,3/20/2017,"If the thai chicken platter wasn't so delicious, I would have given this place one star!(But it's honestly a simple meal that can be made at home)The service varies from horrible to mediocre, I've never had an amazing or favorable interaction with the staff.I used to always order my food to go when I worked in the area, but decided to dine in one day.... HUGE MISTAKE!!The seats are located by the restroom, which has a disturbing pungent order and I saw two enormous cockroaches on the wall and on the vacant table next to me! I immediately left and have not been back since!",1,,

14,Alison C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,9,23,5.0,2/4/2016,I absolutely love this place! Quick service and healthy food. I work a few blocks away and this is definitely my go to spot for lunch.

15,Eric C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,4,3,5.0,6/15/2016,"Love this place that I have it for lunch most of the time.  I wish they can deliver to my workplace.  Small tiny narrow place, tables inside to the back, gets packed super easily and I always get the Thai Chicken Platter with black beans.Pros: Takes credit card minimum of 8 dollars, lots of smoothies choices, lots of drinks, great portion of food.Cons: One to two people cooking your food so it can take a chunk of your lunch break.",1,,
16,Nora K.,"Somerville, MA",348,32,19,4.0,4/20/2016,"For a hole in the wall place, I was impressed. The food was pretty good, and the price for the amount of food you get is fantastic! I ordered the chicken platter and it came out to be $7 (including tax).Before you go in I would recommend looking at the menu outside and deciding what you want. Inside the space is cramped, and it makes it easier on the servers to have an easy flow of customers. I didn't try any of their juices this time around, but they looked delicious and are freshly made. The person ahead of me ordered a carrot juice, and in went orange carrots into the juicer.",1,,
17,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1076,1948,46,5.0,9/8/2015,"When you're in this part of town, it is hard to find an economical place that is also healthy. I passed by this place on several occasions, but always after I had eaten, but finally, I was walking by and had a thirst that needed to be quenched. This place is small and narrow, but realize you will be getting something really healthy and nutritious for a good price. I ordered up an apple, celery and ginger juice (small for $4.50). It really hit the spot! Can't go wrong with all natural fruits and herbs and for a really decent price. I am definitely coming back when I am in the area to fuel up on healthy goodness!",14,5,9

19,Erin D.,"New York, NY",134,117,118,4.0,9/4/2015,"A small deli slash eat in place on Houston. It gets super crowded and busy during lunch hours, and I wish they would develop come kind of order tracking system or hire one more person at the front. The lady that takes orders and makes juices at the same time is always frantic to the point that it makes me uncomfortable asking her for my food order. Anyhow, overlooking the sanitation (it is kind of dingy) and the line in the deli that has no order at all, the food itself is always on point. I'd recommend the strawberry fields smoothie and the California turkey bacon sandwich. For the price and taste, it can't get better than this.One tip is to call with your order beforehand and come by to just pick it up. Should save you about fifteen minutes.",,1,
20,Diana L.,"Mendham, NJ",3,66,68,3.0,3/25/2016,good place for juice but its cramped. The guy was a bit judgmental...Ordered the juice ($4 regular size)Ordered the bulgogi wrap with jalapeños  (good but the wrap got soggy)Would i come back?Maybe but there are better lunch places...,1,1,

22,Josh E.,"Chicago, IL",1,12,4,2.0,2/24/2017,"I typically frequent this place 2 to 3 times a week because it's so close to my job and has fresh delicious food. However my experience today will probably shift the frequency in which I'd come here. I was informed that they don't do anything ""on the side"" which means I can order a sandwich with chicken on it but not have the chicken  put on the side... what a ridiculous rule!",,,
23,Julia V.,"New York, NY",2,29,20,5.0,1/2/2017,"Once that rude lady left my experience here has been so much better. The food never changed but having to deal with the rude sassy pants on the phone to call in an order (Thai chicken salad with extra cheese) I said by accident - I also call this in 1-2 times a week. I get there she didn't make it because I said ""salad"" instead of platter. THAI CHICKEN PLATTER. anywho. Get the Thai chicken platter. It's dope hot fire. Also the staff is nice now. The cook dude who now is up at the register is always super nice. Oh one thing tho. The brown rice is just white rice with black bean sauce on it - I find it more comical than anything but yeah maybe switch to real brown rice.  I mean I'll buy a Costco size and drop it off if y'all use it just for mine. Lemme know.",,,
24,Angela J.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,110,352,5.0,8/1/2015,"It may look like a run down deli from the outside, but don't be fooled this place got  great food here. The Tai chicken is soooooo GOOD! It has lettuce, tomato, avocado, a choice of brown or white rice, pepper Jack cheese that melts on top of the rice,  and all that is topped with their grilled chicken with the sweet and sour sauce. The portion is good enough for two people or two meal, all that for less than $10! their cookies are so on point,but always sells out fast. They have a sitting area in the back ,and a bathroom. Call ahead and order before you go, it takes a while for the food to get ready.",1,1,1
25,Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",663,841,861,4.0,11/28/2011,"Searching for a light and inexpensive dinner while holiday shopping, I settled on this place, as opposed to a $8 burrito from one of my nearby bookmarks.This place filled the billed nicely, and scores high marks for food quality, portion size, and pricing.  For $5 measly dollars I oped for the Califormnia style mission burrito, which was packed with zucchini, black beans, spicy salsa, rice and grilled roasted peppers.   Since this was a Sunday evening, there was no crowd, and it was ready in 5 minutes.   The size on this thing was almost as large as one from Chipotle, and was toasty warm and delicious.  I couldn't finish it all.I saved so much money, I almost opted for their very large, and varied cookies at only $1.50 each!   Ginger spice?  Lemon?   Love that from the standard chocolate chip or dark chocolate cookies.    This place has a plethora of bananas and other fruits stacked up in the window, for smoothies made to order, and it looks like they must do a good volume business.   This was the place I should have had bookmarked!",3,,2
26,Allie P.,"South Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1075,668,1856,3.0,6/12/2014,Maybe I should have ordered one of their sandwiches to go after glancing at the side bar of previous reviews... I happened to walk into this place randomly.  I was in dire need of something refreshing to drink.  Read a sign outside that said juice!!  YUM!  I ordered one of their regular sized juices off their short menu.  It was hard to decide because all of them sounded nice.  I believe I also paid under $5 for it... what a steal!  There were business looking people inside waiting for their food so this place must have good food too.  It also didn't take long to order or wait for my juice to be ready which was a quite nice.,1,,
27,Zoe J.,"Manhattan, NY",227,18,2,5.0,1/7/2014,"I love this place! They have such yummy sandwiches and great fresh juice for such an affordable price. I want to explore outside of the sandwich menu to try a burrito or some of the other options they have. And the service is fast. This is my go to spot.UPDATE* I tried the chicken burrito. I was surprised by how spicy it was, but thank goodness I like spicy. Oh, and did I mention it was HUGE??? (for 7 bucks... What the...) I only ate half and was stuffed. As always, I also got my ""warm up"" juice with it. Perfect.",1,1,2

The first sip of the peanut butter shake had me smiling because it was so damn good. It's a fitting name for a place like this because my stomach felt very light after the shake and the sandwich. I'll be coming back for so much more tasty and yummy sandwiches after I do my weekly Hollister and Express shopping, and maybe Zara when there's a sale cause I'm broke.  :c*Also for those complaining about the atmosphere, this isn't a full fledged restaurant or anything, its a sandwich and juice joint meaning sit in, eat it, get out.",,,

I let her know that it was my first time at Lite Delights and asked if she could make an exception for my $6 purchase. While she was trying to answer my question (I think she was trying to inform me where the nearest ATM was), the manager/owner came from the back and abruptly shouted ""BYEEE"" at me.

The pluses are that you get a ton of food for a great price. I would return to grab a quick bite, but perhaps get a sandwich, as per all the reviews.

I've also had the spirulina based smoothie and it's weird the first time...if you've never had spirulina which I hadn't, but then it became a freaky addiction...? Maybe that's just me. Juices: I have tried most of them but I avoid the ones with orange in them because once I tried to get it and I saw the orange juice was pre-made in a pitcher. I asked if it's pre-juiced from real oranges, which is still kind of 'meh' but better than a pasteurized bottle, or if it's from a bottle and she said it's not pre-juiced...so I'm like ehh..I'll just stick with my apple/ginger/celery or whatever else I see that is freshly juiced in person. That's just me. I haven't checked again since that time to see if they're juicing whole oranges in person yet. I probably will.

My absolute favorite item is the beef bulgogi sandwich subbed out with a wrap. Its well marinated and the servings are generous.

The same can be said of their offerings. Pressed-to-order juices (build your own either carrot or apple-based, or green juice or choose from their suggestions), smoothies, and healthy sandwiches, as well as some random selection of power bars, ""healthy"" muffins and scones, and a yummy hearty energy cookie. (Not sure how lite those last few are). Guess how much for a juice? Right around $5. And if you go in the morning, a regular size of juices and smoothies are on breakfast special for $3.50. Thats an economical way to get your veggies right there.So maybe there's more carrot and less of a presence of the beet/ginger/spinach than I usually want. But at a third of the price, I'll take it.

Yes $4. The staff is super nice and accomodating and I love their sandwiches too. If you are a veg, try the Hummus Veggie and the Chiptole Tofu--yum!",1,1,
54,Vi N.,"Manhattan, NY",374,237,1002,5.0,5/5/2011,"I LOVE Smoothies, and smoothies dont usually come cheap, until I discovered Lite Delights. How did this place exist around the corner from me and yet I never noticed before?? The place is tiny, but it has all flavors of smoothies you can possibly want.  The smoothie was fresh, and the lady that made them was super sweet. Smoothies range from $3-4, for decent size AND if you come in the morning between 7-10am you get a dollar off. What a deal!!Sorry Jamba Juice!!Closes at 10pm on week nights.",3,,
55,Jerrica J.,"New York, NY",963,1360,221,4.0,4/1/2011,"I would like to thank Lite Delights for slowly emptying my wallet on a daily basis. Just kidding, but yeah, I come here after the gym to get my protein fix. They got the ""Designer"" Whey stuff. It's pretty awesome. I don't think they know me by name yet, but they will. Soon I will be walking in and my smoothie will be ready before I even arrive. My favorite so far is a smoothie with Banana, Strawberry and Pineapple Juice mixed with Designer Whey Protein and a little ice. For $3.75 I feel as though its much healthier than going to some chain place like Jamba Juice or Planet Smoothie.It's usually finished before I walk home.",1,1,1
56,Jessica M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",240,180,17,5.0,3/10/2011,"Cheap, delicious, AND healthy?! How have I not been to this place before? I'm so glad I found it while scouring nearby places to grab lunch on my Yelp app.The people behind the counter were all very patient with me while I debated what to order. I ended up choosing the burrito that came with black beans, brown rice, avocado, and salsa. I asked if they could put it in a whole wheat tortilla and they said no problem. I walked about 10 minutes to get home before eating it and it was still hot and TASTY! They grill the tortilla first and it was the best whole wheat tortilla I've ever had. It was also GINORMOUS for the price ($4.25!), definitely ordering this again. Think it was only like a dollar more to add chicken, but I decided to be ""healthy"" and go veggie today.I also wanted a juice, but couldn't decide which one and pored over the options for at least 5 full minutes. I ended up going with the ""Refresh"" which is (if I recall correctly) carrots, beets, and celery. I didn't specify a size but it's a fairly good sized portion-either 12 or 16 oz. And the grand total of the juice and the burrito was $8.13!!! I know Liquiteria uses the Norwalk machine that keeps nutrients in and yadda yadda yadda...but I got a huge burrito AND a healthy juice for under the price of one juice from Liquiteria. Just sayin'...",1,,
57,Katelyn C.,"Bronx, NY",93,8,2,5.0,7/22/2015,"I absolutely adore this place!! As an intern in nyc finding cheap, healthy food in the area is always a struggle.  They have a ton of vegetarian and vegan options and their food is never coated in oil.  Their smoothies and juices are made right in front of you and are CHEAP. I'm a total sucker for their burritos which are huge and a total bargain (normally around $5).  Honestly I used to walk by this place everyday (the outside is a little sketchy looking) but definitely give it a chance, you won't be sorry!",,,
58,Staz T.,"New Port Richey, FL",23,13,2,4.0,11/6/2013,"Unexpectedly good. I had a fantastic pita sandwich there that was prepared quickly and it was of the yum variety. The place is dive-ish to the eye, but great for the semi health conscious eater. Flavorful eating, not cardboard.",,,
59,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",237,206,145,4.0,3/18/2010,"I was first introduced to Lite Delight a few weeks ago at work while trying to conquer my Korean BBQ cravings. While resembling more of a health food deli than a Korean food venue, they did offer a Bulgogi Sandwich that definitely hit the spot. After work today I found myself walking the few blocks back down towards Lite Delight again.This time I ordered the Turkey Burger $3.95, a premade Hard Boiled Egg $.40, and an Eczema Juice (price unknown). My total for everything came out to $8.20. Which is actually quite reasonable for health food. Who says healthy is always expensive? Someone should pass that memo on down to Whole Foods.My Turkey Burger came out moist and delicious. Although I have to contest to the obviously burnt to ash edges and other parts of the surface. The egg well, it's a Hard Boiled Egg you can't really say much about it. My juice, that's another story. I ordered the Eczema Juice with carrots, celery, parsley and some other ingredient I forget at the moment. What I got instead was the Asthma Juice with carrots, celery and ginger. Ahh ginger, my mortal enemy. I do understand the mix up though I guess. If you try to say both in a really Asian accent, they do sound alike.What I really liked was the outdoor seating area in the back. It's basically a tiny hole between the buildings that someone decided to fence off and throw a few tables into. It always amazes me to find things like this in the middle of the city. And just blocks from SOHO too. Check out Pizza Box, which is walking distance from here, for a cooler looking and bigger backyard seating area. In short, the food here is actually pretty good. I wouldn't go as far as saying really cheap but it's definitely reasonable. Seriously, someone send a memo to Whole Foods.",4,3,3
60,Philip D.,"Toronto, Canada",23,97,0,4.0,3/28/2011,"This place is solid! Really good smoothies, juices, sandwhiches, cookies... I was looking for a place like this! Also the prices are definitely reasonable, about 3.50 for a smoothie, whereas other places easily charge 5 bucks. The staff are very friendly and efficient. I had the california chicken with turkey bacon, it was great! This is more of a stop by pick up place, but they do have some seating area in the back although it's a little dingy. They're also very open to what you want in your smoothie, I saw a guy listing off like 6 different fruits and they happily made it for him, that's service!So what not 5 stars? The sandwiches are good but a little bit sloppy, i.e. hard to eat, though still doable. This is definitely a whole in the wall, and totally girls jamba juice, there I SAID IT!ATM inside, shit I forgot to inspect the washrooms! will update soonps Christine if you're reading this, you smell",,,
61,Andrea G.,"New York, NY",21,13,0,4.0,4/27/2013,"I come here about once a week, since I work in the neighborhood.  Anyone who works in Soho knows there is a lack of affordable (lunch and drink under $10) places to pop in and get a healthy lunch.  When you can easily spend $15-20 on lunch at Dean & Deluca, it's nice to know that Lite Delights is a few blocks away.I like their prepared sandwiches $4.75 (the turkey/avocado w/spicy mayo is delish) and love that I can get a 12 oz carrot/ginger juice for $3!  I like that they offer both meat and vegetarian options, and that it's not one of those raw food places where there's no meat protein.  Yes the place is very narrow and sometimes you have to wait since the owner is often on the phone taking delivery orders, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes to be served.  I've never gotten delivery here either, so I can't comment on how good or  bad their delivery service is.",,,
62,Kat H.,"Brooklyn, NY",126,165,23,4.0,8/23/2009,"Whenever I get the idea into my head that healthy = happy, I make dumb decisions. Thinking Carrot Juice (Small: $1.95) wouldn't taste like straight-up carrots is just one of them. I don't like carrots, never have. 3 long, orange phallus-like vegetables crushed into a fine paste in a blender didn't change my mind, but I still think it's a good value. IF you like carrots. I don't know if I already mentioned this, but I don't. I highly recommend any of the Smoothies ($3.00-$4.75), though, if you're looking to pack in some vitamins, fiber, etc. into your diet.As far as meals go, the Santa Fe Burrito ($4.25 for Black Beans, Brown Rice, Avocado, Salsa, and Scallions) fulfills my constant craving for foods that are their own container/utensils without clogging my colon with meatstuffs or cheese. Don't hate. It is dee-licious and can we talk about those low, low prices? Unfortunately, last time I visited, I was unable to quench my burrito hunger because ""the guy"" wasn't there. The stonefaced cashier pointed to their selection of sandwiches as an alternative and I was mildly insulted. A sammich is a beautiful thing but it is not a burrito! Your answer does not compute! The California Roll ($4.25) ended up being the lucky chosen dish, and I was a happy camper.All in all, this is really the only cheap place in which to grab a healthy, satisfying meal or a snack when you're in NoLita. Better than all those $9 lunch specials that leave you feeling sleepy and bloated, yes? Yes (but if you want to pig out, try their Banana Chocolate Bread because I was scoping it out the other day and WOAH, MAMA I think I'm in love).",4,3,3

67,David H.,"Bayside, NY",1,35,0,5.0,8/7/2014,"The food isn't so overly amazing. But it is however good, and a great ""bang for your buck"" type place.

The chicken deluxe is also a really solid choice. Pretty sure all the sandwiches are $7, which is not a bad price to pay for them considering how good they taste. This place is also a juice bar where you can get fresh squeezed juice blends. Can't comment on the juices as I have never tried them. The one thing I am not wild about is how narrow the space is near the counter. I know there isn't much they can do about it, but it can get pretty cramped when multiple customers are waiting for an order.",,,

Sometimes when you wished that you packed your lunch because the thought of spending more money on a lunch that has about 100 million calories gets old, you call up lite delights. They don't mess around, they don't have a gimmick, they just have this adorable guy standing next to a REAL grill that will make you sandwiches and salads and burritos n' stuff. I always get the santa fe burrito with no wrap and extra avacado. For some reason this is not like a regular burrito, it's a feel good after you eat it burrito. It has brown rice and black beans and some delicious salsa, scallions, avacado...and when you're done, you think...that ruled, I feel great.They also have tasty sammies and wraps, all of which rarely ever cost more that 4 dollars a piece.

For example, I had the Poulet Special today. For $7.50, I got a huge amount of grilled chicken breast, grilled red and green peppers, zucchini and summer squash, broccoli, and carrots. It was served over brown rice topped with black beans, pesto  on the side (oil-free, I think, and not too garlicky), and a salad. This is way too much food for a single meal. I am going to eat the  other half tomorrow. Yesterday I had a salad with romaine, avocado, grilled tofu, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, and carrot-ginger dressing (again, oil-free, I think). I was amazing. And it cost $4.50.The food is cooked with as little oil as possible, and they are careful with the salt.
