1,William M.,"San Francisco, CA",177,11,67,5.0,11/19/2018,"We came here to celebrate a birthday while on a trip in NYC. We had tons of fun. The staff was incredible, very accommodating and helpful with questions prior to arrival. We even had to change the headcount last minute and they were able to help us out no problem. We got bottle service at our table and our waitress was very attentive. The food was absolutely amazing. The lobster mac and cheese was the table favorite!Thanks for the great service and hospitality!",,,
2,Christine Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,66,97,3.0,11/18/2018,"Stumbled into this bar since it says it plays 90s hip hop. Came here after dinner so it was pretty early, around 9ish. They were playing mostly drake.I ordered when of their specials - yummy bear. When I ordered it the guy seems confused and was asking me what it is. I told them it's on the wall... so he made it while looking at the wall. When he gave it to me I asked for the gummy bears since it was supposed to be in there. Later on he grab some gummy bears with his hands and threw it in... ummm ewww? I didnt say anything and was hoping the alcohol would kill the germs. Fingers crossed. The drink was way too sweet and it cost $14! My friend got a jameson and ginger ale & wolf pup beer. The beer was alright.Later on in the night my friend wanted a mojito and got me one too. That was the worst mojito I ever had. It was way too sweet. Ugh.. They started playing better music but it became so crowded so we left. However a lot of people were celebrating birthdays and there were tons of birthday sundaes! Might come back to try that!",,,
3,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,4.0,10/28/2018,"This review is for celebrating my birthday here.  I wanted a place that had a lively, fun, good atmosphere with good music, decent to good food and a great place for a birthday.  This met all of those requirements.RESERVATIONS: I made reservations about 1 1/2 months in advance.  I made them online through Open Table or Resy or one of those websites but then it was followed up via email so I could reserve the Kitchen Sink ahead of time.  They were very accommodating and quick to answer even when I had to expand my reservation to 12 people.They say that they only hold the table for 15 minutes and they don't seat incomplete parties.  It seemed like they did hold onto that rule although no one else was in there so I'm sure they would have sat us and let the others come later if we were 90% there.ATMOSPHERE: My birthday is in late October so today it fell on the weekend before halloween.  Hence, the place was decked out for halloween, which I don't care for much.  Cob webs, weird blood stains etc. all over and the staff were also dressed up. I think because they were having a halloween party at 9pm, no one else was there.  Apparently, some of my group came early and they said they weren't even open yet.  At around 6:50pm they let us come into the bar first to wait for everyone else to arrive.We were literally the only group in the restaurant for the entire night until around 8:30 pm when one other group came and then by 9 pm, more people were coming.  It was a little weird but also nice since we could be loud and walk around taking pictures without worrying about anyone.The inside has a darkish, pub/bar vibe with books on shelves, wooden tables and chairs and other decor.  It was cozy and a nice place for a birthday.  It's not super fancy but you can get dressed up.The music is partly why I chose this.  They play really good hip hop and rap.  Mostly things that people in their mid to late 20s and 30s would enjoy.  Apparently it was a random playlist but with DJ mixing in between songs so it sounds like a DJ is mixing, but it's not.  I liked that it was lively, we could dance in our seats and have fun while enjoying dinner.For those interested in coming to dance or party, there is a ""pit"" area where there are tables and a DJ.  It's very small and I think there was a bouncer so if you didn't have a table there you couldn't go down there.  There's also a large bar area to order drinks, restrooms, a video Photo Booth and then more tables towards the back (where we sat).  Dancing is a bit odd because waiters are coming in and out with food but eventually it was fun.  The music was pretty good, a mix of hip hop/rap that is from the mid to late 2000s.  It got more crowded around 10:30 but not to the point where I couldn't move or find a space to dance comfortably.FOOD: The food itself was OK.  Most of my group ordered the fried chicken sandwich and then a few burgers etc.  They had open bar for their special halloween night so we got to take advantage of that even though we didn't buy tickets for the event.  We stayed until after 9pm and then just had to give up our table but could hang out in the bar and dance.FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH - it claims that it comes on a brioche bun but I am skeptical.  It's a basic soft sesame bun/roll type of bun.  The fried chicken is white meat so it tends to be a bit dry and hard to eat.  It's a big chunk of meat and it is crispy on the outside but too dry! There could have been more sauce too.  The truffle fries were good though, very crispy and a hint of truffle though not super overwhelming.TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE - we got these for the table and it was a hit.  The Mac was al dente, the cheese tasty and the top of it was super crispy and good.  The only thing was that I barely tasted the truffle.  I think they could have used a bit more.KITCHEN SINK - definitely another draw for why I chose this place.  You can pay $55 for a basic huge martini glass with 6-7 scoops of cookies and cream and chocolate ice cream, cones, whipped cream, and oreos and cookies.  It comes out kind of like when you get bottle service and the girls bring out the drinks with fire and music.  They put 2 sparklers on the ice cream and then hand the birthday person the other sparkler.  It lasts about 10-15 seconds and then burn out.  It makes for great fun and impresses everyone and also I got a few good photos out of it!  I would recommend as an alternative to a traditional birthday cake.  They recommend reserving it early (kind of strange since you're the one booking the reservation and it's your birthday) but it works.  There is a more expensive option that involves a sign for your birthday and champagne.Overall, I enjoyed my birthday here because of the fun atmosphere and good music.  Although the food was just OK, the atmosphere made up for it and I liked that we didn't have to pay ""cover"" or get a ticket to the halloween after party event and still got to enjoy it.",6,2,3
4,Trish S.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",29,42,1,1.0,11/4/2018,"Never one to review bars but after my miserable experience I must. I have NEVER seen staff push around people at the bar and I literally was pushed around by various male and female servers throughout the entirety of the night. Im 5'2"" and hardly take up any space...no reason for me to be pushed around the bar.I will not be returning and I highly recommend not coming here for a night out. There are so many other bars in LES where the staff doesn't push you around and act super entitled. Disgusting.",1,,1
5,Lisbeth M.,"Hialeah, FL",87,39,82,3.0,11/14/2018,"The restaurant itself was very dim and had a nice ambiance to It. They were attentive and the food came in good time. I honestly went to this restaurant because I read reviews that made it seem like a good place for nightlife. I'm not sure if it's because It was Labor Day weekend but Sons of Essex was pretty empty and a little dull with the music. However, that didn't take away from the food. It was delicious and the drinks were strong and perfect. I was a tad disappointed but I wouldn't mind coming back next time I visit New York and give it a second try.",,,
6,Erin W.,"Valley Stream, NY",2,9,13,3.0,11/13/2018,"Came here for brunch. We made reservations even though we were a party of 2 (I make reservations whenever possible). We were seated immediately. Ambience: Dim lights, quaint décor, loud music (DJ), lively and fun. There were several people celebrating their birthdays and the crowd just seemed to blend together and enjoy each other. They definitely make noise for the birthday celebrations with a large customized banner and a special dessert. They also have a large area near the DJ booth for larger groups. Food: I had the ""Grandma's country quich"" and my partner had the steak and eggs. The food was okay. I ended up ordering the truffle tater tots to supplement my meal, but overall it was just okay.  Service: while the service started off good, it quickly declined. We waited over 30 minutes for the waiter to bring the check and still waited a while for someone to collect it. After a while we noticed that out waiter was setting up for every birthday celebration in addition to taking care of his tables. This is a lively and fun brunch. Despite the service, there was a nice ambience and good music. It started to get busy as we were leaving. I would return for a special occasion or for drinks.",,,
7,Yong K.,"Manhattan, NY",576,481,124,3.0,11/2/2018,"Came with some friends for a birthday dinner.Food: tasty, not mindblowing. I got the burger which was pretty good. Most of my friends got the chicken sandwich (it was THICC). The Truffle Mac n Cheese was also really goodFor dessert we got the KITCHEN SINK, a huge bowl of lots of ice cream and cones... amazing. Ambience: it was a nice dimly lit interior and lots of space for dancing and had really good music playing. When we asked where the dj was, I said it's spotify as a joke.. but then it actually was haha. But i don't mind, it was still fun. Great place to hang out for some food and drinks and dancing. Price: food was a bit overpriced for what you getOverall, I would recommend going here for drinks, music, dance, and the kitchen sink",,,
8,Stina L.,"Jamaica, NY",128,22,75,5.0,10/28/2018,"Hands Down the Best Birthday Brunch! The DJ was off the hook, the 90's hip hop & reggae had us singing & dancing all afternoon!! We were a party of 9, came in on a Sat afternoon, and had no issues with table seating. Make sure your whole party arrives on time, they will only seat you once everyone's present. There were several delicious brunch options... few of our favs: avocado toast with lobster, truffle tater tots, veggie burgers, chicken & waffles, steak & huevos! Food was fresh, delish & served warm. Get the Bellinis spiked with coconut or pineapple Ciroc (we had several pitchers of each) Our glasses were always full! To add... My party surprised me with a birthday parade!! Loud, sparkly, a personalized bday board, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot & a humongous shareable dessert (kitchen sink)! WOW!! What a way to make a girl feel super special!! The team at Essex are AMAZING, accommodating, & service was attentive & super friendly! What a great time!! My whole party had a blast! Thank you Sons!!!!",1,,1
9,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,8/8/2018,"Came here on a Thursday night around 8pm for drinks and a light snack. It wasn't busy at all. The ambiance was spacious, dark and sexy. I loved the R&B music! We had the lobster roll, frosé and Please Don't Bramble cocktail. The lobster roll was tasty with plenty of meat and not too much mayo which is what I prefer. The frosé was delicious and strong. The Please Don't Bramble cocktail however was too sweet for me. Prices are higher than average. I had a nice experience and I would like to check it out some time on a weekend.",3,2,4

Updated review","The first time I came, we ordered a round of drinks and some fried calamari. It was average, nothing too exciting.The restaurant is dimly lit with wooden tables and a very old American feel. However it was playing recent pop/rap music. Thafelt very disconnected. We went at 7pm on a weekday and the restaurant was mostly empty. Definitely won't need a reservation if you decide to go at the same time. I did appreciate the fact that they sat us in one of the booths/couch area. Very intimate feel. The second time I came I spoke to Ross one of the managers. He was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We had the lobster rolls and truffle fries to share and ordered steak and shrimp for our mains. For dessert, we had the chocolate soufflé which was TO DIE FOR. The chocolate ice cream came with nuts and there were blueberries and strawberries with cream. I'm usually not a sweet person, especially after eating so much, but I wanted more! I suggest this location for after work drinks, intimate dates and maybe a relaxed evening with friends. The happy hour drinks end at 8pm and given how good the soufflé was, I'm looking forward to trying the other desserts on the menu!",4,1,2

Updated review",I'm back for moreeee. I loved this place so much I came here for my birthday. Ross hooked it up & made sure everyone was well fed & drank. It is more on the expensive side but you get SO MUCH food & our server was really sweet & super helpful & looked out for me (the birthday girl). The music was great as per usual & I had so much fun with all my friend,,,
12,Shantel A.,"Bronx, New York, NY",9,23,63,3.0,10/16/2018,"If you're looking for a good turn up brunch with a group of friends come here !On a Sunday my friend and I decided to have a late brunch- we literally made it right before brunch was over which is at 4pm. We walked in and the DJ was playing great music and could tell there was a birthday being celebrated at one of the tables, so it was definitely loud lol. We were seated immediately thankfully so we had time to give our order. For our drinks we ordered a pitcher of the mango Bellini. It was so delicious and just enough for both of us to have a good three drinks from it. For our meal we each decided to get the chicken and waffles and a order of truffle tater tots to share. That meal was so satisfying and came to our table really quick. The wait time was maybe 15 minutes.",,1,1
13,Su J.,"New York, NY",1,55,32,3.0,9/23/2018,"Not sure what happened to this place. I came previously to their Saturday brunch ""Ain't 2 Proud 2 Brunch"" and the atmosphere was fantastic. Great crowd, good music, really party/club like feel during the day. My brunch was good too. I came yesterday with two friends and this place looks like it's turned into a retirement home. I noticed on IG that A2P2B hasn't posted in awhile so maybe they switched up the format, and if that's the case, it sucks now. The place was barely filling half its tables, the crowd was just a bunch of sad souls, nobody was having fun or dancing and the food was terrible. I had the chicken sandwich. The chicken was so damn dry and tough that I even struggled to cut it with a knife. I used to speak highly of Sons of Essex's A2P2B parties on Saturdays but that won't be happening anymore.",2,,
14,Chanell C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,2,1.0,11/19/2018,"Ok let me start by saying this establishment has inspired me to write a thorough review for the first time. I never thought I would say this but I was glad we arrived late to this establishment. Our reservation was made  for 3:00pm and I am glad we arrived thirty minutes later because I was extremely disappointed. My good good girlfriend and I we're looking for a good vibe and good food. Sadly, this establishment did not make the cut. If you are looking for a good brunch spot this is not the place. For starters , they attempted to sit us by the restroom. This actually made me consider leaving and I wanted to just throw the whole establishment away, however they redeem themselves by seating us by the next best thing two tables down from the restroom.  When we were finally seated, I glance at the menu and could not help but think where are the wings . We mention this to our waiter , who we could barely heard due to the loud music. I must say they need a new DJ who can actually do more than replay a a playlist that consist of  R Kelly 112, Biggie, Ariana Grande , and Cardi B. The whole time I was think people CANT GET JIGGY WITH THIS SHIT * Michael blackson voice. I was highly disturbed by how the party of 20 who were bump and grinding to R Kelly 12 play had to quickly adjust to Ariana Grande thank you next.  I could not  help but also noticed that two men were having a white chicks moment and jamming out to thank you, next.  As I watched my waiter approach us again , he too was jamming out to thank you , next. Thirty minutes later, we still could not figure out what to order due the menu which did not looking appeasing to  me. The waiter recommended we order Strawberry Bellini. For all my drinkers out there, please do not I repeat do not order this watered down strawberry crystal light. I recommend that you bring your own crystal light lol. As far as food ,  I saw some people sharing food because of the large portions served . I honestly felt like their  food selection was much like an IHOP brunch edition. When the waiter return to check on us, he asked if we wanted more drinks. I kindly decline a round two of crystal light. According to the waiter ( the one comment I could hear ), when your white girl wasted you get pushed to the front. At first I thought he was joking , however towards 6pm... I noticed all the drunk in love individuals who were slay to the god and dressed in their Sunday best appeared to get the to the left to left boot. After we ate, quickly  our dishes, empty dressing cups , ketchup, salt and pepper were removed. I felt like  they wanted us to leave. Despite this establishment killing my whole mood, I was highly entertained by the fact that they blew out the candles as a indicator "" time to go ""... So if you plan on coming to this establishment . . Please keep in mind the following 1. Good picture require extra lighting from the flashlight on your phone . 2. Drink before you get there! Unless you intend to get  crystal light wasted.3. Just buy the giant sundae split they offer for birthdays because there was a party of ten who seemed to enjoy the sundae more than the food they order. 4. Those who are planning to come here and you are between the ages of 21- 25 the close thing to trap music your going to hear is one cardi b song , which is backing it up.5. Beware that your candle will be blown out before 6pm comes and they transition into dinner time. Overall , I give this establishment one star only because there is no option for a .5 star . I would like to attend this establishment after 6 pm to compare brunch and dinner. I will surely provide an update.",,,
15,Josephina V.,"New York, NY",7,7,2,5.0,8/14/2018,"So I'm reviewing based on a weekday visit. During the weekend the crowd is fun, loud, but young and a little bridge and tunnel. I happen to be from NJ and have friends from NJ so it's a good time for me. They have a good ""pit"" lounge area for birthdays, and they play awesome music. I came most recently on a Tuesday and they had ""hip hop and happy hour"" for the full night. So $5 house cocktails, house shots, and all beers. Overall it's a great time on weekdays and a fun time on weekends especially compared to some of the other LES bars nearby that are filled with fratstars and interns.",,,
16,Kyrah I.,"Philadelphia, PA",78,22,38,5.0,7/22/2018,"Maaaannnn!!!! Where do I start! The second we walked inside we were greeting by three beautiful women who sat us right away...seating was a little tight but that doesn't really matter, the water was great we ordered two carafes of the mimosa spiked with mango and peach vodka and it was delightful. The music was amazing, and the food!!! Baabbyyyy! This truffle Mac n Chz with shrimps was to die for! The perfect amount of cheese garlic and truffles and the shrimp were perfectly seasoned. The lemon pancakes were also very very good, perfect amount of flavor and heaviness. In my personal opinion syrup isn't necessary. My girlfriends and I had a blast and will be back on a regular bas",,,1
17,Laura K.,"New York, NY",148,85,16,3.0,9/29/2018,"I came to Sons of Essex for a birthday party. Drinks started at $15. The bartender was great and generous with his pours. My issue was my friend had her party in the back and the bouncers were pretty rude at times for no reason. That alone would make me hesitate before coming back. Of note, the DJ was 4/5 stars but the area to dance was very small.",,2,
18,Elizabeth S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,1.0,11/4/2018,"Security at this establishment is terrible. Before the place closed, my group of 10 were asked to leave. Even after spending money, they told us we could not stay... on a saturday night!!",1,,
19,Mabelle L.,"Queens, NY",283,284,1513,4.0,1/11/2018,"Been to this place a few times. The first time I came was an amazing experience and that's why I've been coming back since.We threw a farewell party for one of my friends that was moving to the west coast. She reserved the left side that is a little separated from the rest of the restaurant. We had snacks and was super easy to mingle with each other given the large size of our group. Later that night, it got amped up. A DJ came, set up his stuff, and our area turned into the dance floor. It was so awesome!The second time I came was late night and unfortunately they were charging mandatory coat check. I didn't have cash with me so we ended up going to another stop. Plus, it looked super packed so didn't seem like it'd be fun to squeeze between everyone.Came again the other day with some friends around 9pm for some drinks. Was able to get a table right by the bar. Moscow mules are delicious and totally recommended! This place is so great just to hang out with friends and catch up with some ""party type"" vibes.",3,,
20,Soltier G.,"Queens, NY",0,3,6,5.0,10/16/2018,I attended one of my close friends birthday dinner last week. The ambiance in this restaurant is very warm and welcoming. We were a group of 6 so we decided to do drinks and appetizers. The menu is a bit pricey but very worth it. The lobster Mac and cheese is to die for!! & the mushroom pizza was everything. We had to order several of these appetizers because it was that good! We also tasted the whiskey wings and the lobster rolls. It was my first time eating a lobster roll and this definitely set the tone!,,,
21,Katherine D.,"New York, NY",510,228,120,4.0,9/16/2018,"This is a really fun spot. I went for the first time recently and it was karaoke night. I like that there are places besides clubs where you can get bottle services. I went with a promoter and food was part of the package which was also different from a lot of similar places. There was so much truffle oil! I was very happy. They had cheeseburger sliders, truffle oil on mushroom pizza, and truffle fries. These were great pairings and they were delicious. This was a really fun night and I definitely recommend it.",1,,
22,Henry M.,"Englewood, NJ",1,10,3,2.0,11/10/2018,This is a nice place with really great music but the turn off are the bartenders with their stone face and not so approachable demeanor which makes you think twice about ordering a drink. Unless your looking for a last minute or totally last alternative place to go with friends I'd recommend try anything else then this place. These guys behind the bar a total jerks. I regrets spending my after work gathering in this place with so bad service.,,,
23,Marlen A.,"New York, NY",1,6,14,5.0,10/5/2018,"I hosted a nonprofit social with my Associate Board and it went great. Planning - The manager was super responsive via email, professional, welcoming. I really enjoyed working with him because I knew he'd respond immediately and because he was so pleasant. Royce was our onsite contact and he also was wonderful, super accommodating, actively helping us solve any issues we faced. He even helped us out by buying a cord we needed for a new Mac. Day of the event, we ordered truffle Mac and cheese balls, burger sliders, chicken sliders, and lobster rolls and we had an open beer and wine bar. All of them appetizers were delicious, they were constantly brought out. The staff was courteous. Would love to host an event here again. I'll definitely come back for regular nights out.",,,
24,Trent T.,"Nutley, NJ",42,156,389,4.0,11/29/2017,"Scheduled a brunch here for around 15 guys a few weeks back. The last couple weeks we had been doubtful we would be admitted in, as we had been turned away from another popular brunch spot before (see other reviews). Fortunately, we did not have the slightest issue at Sons of Essex. We were accommodated as soon as we came through the door, they were even lenient given 2 of my reservation couldn't make it! We opted for the bottomless mimosas, and boy were they bottomless. The carafes were kept filled for the entirety of the time we were at the table. They started us off with some corn bread and tater tots, which after a few drinks tasted heavenly. There were ample dishes to share and everyone loved them. From there our entrees came out, all of them correct and all of them hot. I was pleased with the quesadillas, however I will live with the regret I did not choose the chicken and waffles. The waffles were soft and sweet, the chicken salty and crunchy .. it was great. Our waitress was checking in on us every so often and we never went more then a couple minutes without something we needed. I was concerned they might try to upcharge us as everything went so well there needed to be some downfall. That was not the case, in their email it was advertised as 85 a person with tip included and that is exactly what the bill reflected. Sons of Essex, I'll be back.",3,,1
25,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,11/10/2017,"I'd had Sons of Essex on my to do list for a while, and finally was able to make a visit for dinner earlier this week. It's definitely one of the more unique spots in NYC; the entrance is deceptive as it looks like a small storefront and cafe. The back door gives way to the full dining room, however, which has a full bar and plenty of seating options for pairs or larger groups.Everything on the menu is tempting, and my friend and I had such a difficult time narrowing down our options. From the appetizers, I would definitely recommend the Whiskey Wings; the chicken wings are tender and juicy, and generously coated in a whiskey honey glaze. The side of sriracha mayo adds a spicy, creamy contrast as well. We loved the take on Lobster Rolls as well, except the one here are served on toast and the lobster is only light mixed with an old bay aioli, which allows the protein to shine through. We couldn't skip the Mac and Cheese either. You can pick from a variety of proteins, but the crowd pleaser is the Lobster, and it pairs well with the creaminess of the sauce and the al dente of the macaroni.As for the entrees: definitely do not skip out on the Scallops. They're perfectly seared and are cooked to the ideal texture, and are perfectly paired with sweet corn and zucchini noodles. We also shared the Essex Street Burger, which you can top with various ingredients (we opted for the bacon and fried egg), which was cooked to our requested medium rare and was well seasoned and delightfully juicy.Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal and made sure to check up on us several times throughout the evening.Definitely looking forward to returning later for brunch, which has an another tempting menu for the weekend afternoons!",16,6,13

Think Tupac and biggy, with a dj and a super friendly waitress.Make reservation is advance.There is no bottomless options , but they have some deals. Expect to pay around 45$ with tip if you're drinking to get drunk/ tipsy.  I would say the meals are a little more on the pricey side for typical brunch but worth it.I hear there is bottomless brunch if you have a party of 10 or more, which would be kinda of fun. A little strange though.",,,
28,Daniella L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",242,19,7,3.0,4/16/2018,"The previous reviews are pretty accurate - This place is a guaranteed an amazing time! However, if money is an object and you weren't mentally ready to ball out for brunch, then this is not the place for you. As mentioned by other reviewers... Sons of Essex has the most misleading menu!!! The menu shows $30 for brunch, and you would automatically think... ""What a steal for downtown!"". Next to this there is a plus sign (""+"") of $5 for unlimited mimosas. On any normal planet, this means $35 for brunch with unlimited. Well ladies and gentlemen, that is not the case here. Nope Nope. Somehow +5 translates to $35 more for unlimited. So your easily spending $65 without tip/taxes/extra drinks for brunch! Whereas, you could take your money elsewhere for equally if not better food and a better experience. Not sure what the issue here is with management, because it is clear there have been multiple complaints about this... but fix the menu or fix your price. Stop playing your customers before you lose them. Anyhow, back to the good. Brunch this past Sunday was a Hip Hop brunch, so the energy was great and the DJ was pretty amazing. Best mixes I've heard in a while. The food was pretty great as well - I had the chicken and waffles and cannot complain there. It was delicious! Some of my group had the Eggs Benedict and thought it was pretty average so can't speak on that front. The cornbread on the side though, that is definitely in my top 5. Very well done - would go back just for the cornbread. Overall, I had a good time till the bill came around. I stress that management needs to fix this before people decide to walk out on them. no one likes to be mislead. And there's not enough liquor in the world to make me not realize what I'm paying for. I'll have to think about it really hard before I return for brunch here again.",9,1,
29,Stephen D.,"New York, NY",792,51,263,4.0,4/6/2018,"This place is a must if you want a good meal in L.E.S. My second time there and it was worth it! Went to try Sweet Chick's for the first time with chicken and waffles on my mind, but they weren't serving from the original menu due to an issue with no gas. Lot of commotion with the FDNY in the area. Don't know if that was a related issue or not. Needless to say I was livid that my dreams of chicken and waffles were shattered, but I brushed it off and my buddy and I remembered our experience at Essex and decided to go back.The blue point oysters were really good. The shrimp cerviche incredible. I totally recommend this appetizer. So light and tasty i couldn't even take a pic. The presentation was so nice, i took a bite right away and that's all she wrote! Scarfed down!The Pat La Freida burger was the capper! Fantastic burger. I added egg, bacon, and caramilized onions. Forget about it. Heaven. Had the Michigan game on and my Saturday night went in the right direction from that point on. Great service. Place is small, so reservations may be a good idea",10,3,7

The food... not so much.The ""lobster roll"" was more like lobster on a cracker but the lobster mac and cheese was bomb. There was a flatbread pizza I would try if I went back but that's abt all I can say. The music was banging. Every table was jamming... and the crowd was super diverse so that's saying a lot. The decor was my favorite part though, it accounts for 3 for the 4 stars, for real.",,,

Recently, I came here for dinner on a Wednesday, and I couldn't recommend this place MORE for a sit-down meal during a weeknight. My eyes were finally opened to the level of detail put into this restaurant. As you stroll off the streets of the Lower East Side, you are immediately enamored by the transition of a speak-easy style store front to an electrifying restaurant. Despite presenting itself as a prohibition-style dining establishment, I certainly appreciated hearing artists like Biggie Smalls and 50 Cent blasting throughout the restaurant. The cocktail menu was impressive and very creative. I recommend ordering the 'Yummy Bear' cocktail, especially if you're #doingitforthegram. The dinner menu provided a great list of entrees and appetizers. The mini lobster rolls were adorable and a great starter. The truffle mac n' cheese was outstanding, especially with the added bacon! The salmon burger was fresh and delicious.The crowd ranged from smaller groups of tastefully dressed LES friends - to bumble dates becoming less uncomfortable after each master crafted drink. After such a great dining experience, I will certainly be returning (maybe next Wednesday!).",6,,2

I've frequented this place over the past 6 years and I'm honestly never disappointed.I decided to write a review this time because of their amazing hostesss (Dark skin with bald head dancer just in case management sees this ha!). We literally showed up without a reservation and she was super cool and took care of us. She seated us in the pit (you wanna get seated here esp during brunch) within less than 5 minutes of us waiting.I would say make reservations for around 1:15 because that's when the DJ starts spinning. At any given point, it will turn into a part. The vibes here are absolutely insane and a perfect place to celebrate. The food is really good but it's kinda pricey. Our mimosa cost about 32$ and it said that it was a pitcher. It was literally a carafe that wasn't filled to brim. Hence why I'm giving it 4 stars because I feel like the prices are a bit outrageous. With that being said, if you're looking for a place to celebrate definitely come here",1,,

It's a big enough place that you can sit/stand around and they have a small lounge section to dance. We came around 3-5pm on Cinco de Mayo and it was bumping.The drinks sucked. I had 2 and they both were wack. The gummy bear which is crazy sweet (& good) but had no alcohol, I swear. For my 2nd, I lightened up with a cran & vodka... same thing. The bartender was friendly and attentive but I cant recommend her serving style.I'd come back for a good place to bar hop in LES, but I don't think I'd stay here bc you wouldnt even be buzzed after paying $14 for a single cocktail.",,1,

39,Mady A.,"Manhattan, NY",223,186,776,5.0,2/6/2018,"The first time I came to Sons of Essex, I was a guest at a friend's birthday brunch. I had such a fantastic time that I decided to throw my b/f's birthday there this past Saturday. Booking a party of 12 was very simple. A few emails back and forth and we were ready. They day of, I made sure all my guests knew to be on time (I even told them our reservation was 15 minutes earlier than it was). They will not seat your party until everyone is there so be prepared for that. From the minute you walk, the ambiance puts you in a good mood. The music is pumping to all the good oldies hip hop and current songs. Everyone is in a good mood. Our party was seated in the middle at a long table and pre-fixed menus were set at each place setting. We all had to choose one entree and we shared tater tots and cornbread. The cornbread is fantastic and the tots were so good we ordered another round. We chose to have mimosa and bellini pitchers to share that were spiked with circoc. All of our food came out in a timely manner and everyone raved about their food. I love the avocado toast and the chicken and waffles were another big hit. Our waitress Alexa was super fun and always checked on us. She even made sure our one gluten-free guest had something she could eat and was very careful about what was put on her plate. Kudos to Alexa for going the extra mile. Our group was older than the average crowd here but that didn't stop us at all from joining in on the fun. We danced, laughed, screamed, snapped pics and truly enjoyed every minute. They do have a strict 2 hour per table seat time but we still hung out there after. All of our friends raved about the wonderful time they had and I know we will all definitely come back. Prices are SUPER reasonable compared to some of the other popular brunch places in the city. If you're looking for a great, fun place to chill or celebrate, this is the place!",6,2,4

Updated review","Came here for a birthday brunch this past weekend and it was good but not as great as before. We were a party of about 14 people so they sat us across a booth and a few other tables. They brought out a few orders of cornbread and tater tots as starters, I believe they were complimentary. The menu is very different now but looked promising given the variety. I believe all the entrees cost $30. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles and I did not regret it. It came with two small waffles, 3 large pieces of delicious fried chicken, maple syrup and a spicy sauce. It was great and a very filling portion. Some people ordered french toast, avocado toast, eggs, etc and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. It costs $35 extra to add 2 hours of bottomless mimosa/bellinis, which puts the brunch at over $60. Since we had another stop after brunch we decided to go with the pitchers of mimosas and bellinis instead. They were $27 each and I believe are enough for about 6-8 champagne flutes. My bf and I ordered a bellini pitcher and we did not like it. It did not taste like a bellini but more like diluted prosecco with a very weird after-taste. They had a dj playing and although the song selections were good, the volume needed to be a little louder. There were several other large parties around so they made it fun. Overall, the visit really deserves 3 stars but I'm adding 1 more solely because the food was very tasty and our waitress was really sweet.",2,,
42,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,120,201,4.0,10/21/2017,"This place is a tad bit pricey but provides a great atmosphere. The whiskey wings were amazing. They are very pricey at $15 for only 7 wings. The drinks at the cheapest were $13 and even the house tequila shots were $13. You are indeed in LES but the prices are a little steep if you ask me.But other than the price I enjoyed this place. The music was on point,it is a good crowd, and has a nice ambience.I will definitely come back but make sure you pre-game before you arrive lol",,,

For gentrifying the shit outta LES? I get it but nah, I'm good. The DJ is ok, playing the commercial music as per usual. I had high expectations for this local but it has let me down. Oh and I went to use my check in coupon but a waiter yelled as he was walking by ""don't use that! I asked why and he said that it's only good from Monday through Wednesday *another eye roll* be nicer about it, please. He's lucky he was cute .

47,Cindy N.,"Long Beach, CA",264,489,3118,1.0,6/2/2017,"What an establishment, and not a good one either. Came here to eat as well as have drinks. Upon walking in the security made us check our umbrella despite wanting to take it with us to our table. When we first entered there wasn't that many people to begin with and we could only go to the bar or sit in the pit area because all tables were blocked off since they were getting ready for the dinner rush. The atmosphere is trendy yet casual and the establishment is dark with antique like decor including lots of wood, bookshelves, and pictures on the walls. Music was some modern with mostly 90s music which is a plus.Food was just ok in my opinion. AVOCADO TOAST-$15.00Smashed avocado, olive oil, lemon juice, toasted crostini topped with house sriracha.---- ehhh probably one of the worse avocado toasts I've ever had. Very bland not to mention you don't get much for the amount you pay for. Pass on this item for sure. 1 star*****TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE $17 not too bad, decent amount of cheese and decent amount of truffle flavoring. Amount was on the small side for the price 3 1/2 stars****WHISKEY WINGS $15whiskey honey glaze with sriracha mayo. Tangy and sweet good flavoring but the wings were kind of soft and not crispy. 3 1/2 stars.*****----Service---Now the service is the reason why they got one star. If I could give this place no stars I would for the service. We ended up trying to get our umbrella back and it wasn't there so we got the number to the establishment and called an hour later to check because we were told by Nani? That she would look and call us back which never happened. I called again the next day and was again told they would take my number down and would be called back, nothing. I messaged through Yelp which I got a response right away from management telling me to email them personally which I did but never got a response. I messaged them through Yelp one more time to which management again answered and asked for my number so they could contact me which they never did. Doesn't surprise me with how horrible workers customer service is since management is just as bad and probably doesn't hold their employees accountable. I don't appreciate not being acknowledged and given the run around. Especially when my belongings was lost by them. If they gave me a simple we can't find it sorry that would've been fine, but to keep me hanging and given the run around is not excusable. I definitely will not be back to this place, nor will I be recommending this to anyone I know for parties, events, or even a simple dinner.",19,12,15

Style over substance--this is the ""Avengers 2"" of restaurants.At no point were we insulted or slighted in any way, but the wait times took long enough to make us feel of inadequate importance. If this weren't enough, we were presented a menu with prices that would make a food vendor in Yankee Stadium balk.$15 for a cocktail? $20 for a burger? Better yet, upon request of an extra shot in the cocktail, I was told that it would be another $16. Yes, you read that right: an extra shot would be more than another cocktail.If you are looking for an a mildly average night to only slightly alleviate your chronic depression, Sons of Essex might do, but don't expect a cure anytime soon.",1,,

I've been here twice -- once in the summer and once in the dead of winter and both were great experiences. For one thing, the establishment itself is large enough to hold a good number of people meaning there's less of  a chance people will be turned away at the door. Both time, I've come to Sons of Essex when other bars in the area have been too crowded/too difficult to get in. The drinks are strong and reasonably priced. The best part though? The music! Their DJs seem to always hit the nail right on the head with their song selections. The most recent time I came (which was a few days ago on a Friday night) they did a pretty good mix of top 40s and throwback songs that gave just about everyone in the crowd something to dance to. There weren't too many people on the dance floor that particular day, but the people who were there definitely had a great time. It was fun to join in! A tip for the winter though: coat check at the door is $3 per person.",,,

Our party of 8 enjoyed good service and great music. We went on a rainy Saturday around 12:30 and we didn't have much trouble with lines after reserving ahead of time. I believe the DJ was in a late 90s, early 2000s Hip-hop mood and we were much appreciative. It definitely set the mood for our mostly 80s babies-90s kids nostalgia.

60,Wendy G.,"Jersey City, NJ",132,213,354,2.0,10/25/2017,"What a place! My great friend was having her birthday boozy brunch here, so we made our way there on a busy Sunday. We were a large group of 20, so while the majority of the group was there (15 of us were), they were still giving us a hard time to get seated, which I understood is there policy, but they giving us issues cause there were too many of us at the bar and blocking the entrance, which was quite comical cause they wouldn't seat us to get us out of the way! So finally we were seated, they knew in advance that we were such a large group, however the seating was an issue. We were all separated, which isn't an issue but they tried to cramp us into the smallest booths and tables. We were forced to fit like 8 people into a booth, there was barely any room to move. Next, we ordered our food, I opted for the chicken & waffles. The shareables were truffle tater tots & cornbread. Both items were actually amazing, it was so amazing that I thought my food was going to be that great and it wasn't. The waffle and chicken were equally as dry, I drowned both items in syrup and hot sauce. I didn't even finish my dish cause it wasn't even good. The other issue we had was that we were not allowed to order drinks from the bar. We were trying to do that so the check in the end wouldn't get crazy  cause everyone had exactly the amount for the brunch in cash, however the waitress actually stopped people in our party and told us we were not allowed to order from the bar, and sent us back to our seats! They even told the bartender not to serve our party, which I thought was actually crazy!Needless to say, our experience was a crappy one, I'll honestly probably not come back. The food was mediocre, and the drinks were weak, and everything was overpriced for their quality. I can get all that stuff in Jersey minus the crazy traffic.",2,,

When we came back an hour later to try again, once again the trash bouncer tried to get $200 bucks from us. I can't believe I didn't sue their asses right there because I would've had a great case. Oh, I'm not done. How about when a friend of mine went last week and the waiter tries to pocket the cash we gave them for the bill, meanwhile the top is included . Then he tells us, ""sorry I didn't see the cash,"" which btw we put right into his hand when he took the bill.

Don't get me wrong I had fun b/c we were a group and celebrating, however I just felt I could really enjoy my food, and talk with my friends b/c we were kinda of crowded in and the food was just ok and the mimosas were mediocre at best. But that's how most places do for brunch is give you water down drinks so you're drinking mostly juice.

Can never have enough truffle! The service is good and attentive as well.  The music is rocking here.  Jams from the 90s and it gets a club vibe after 1230 pm. This place is popular and gets packed.  There was a line as we were leaving. Def make a reservation.",2,,

The music was my absolute favorite part of brunch, it felt like I was at a party at 1pm... just the way I like my brunches!!! The Mac n' cheese was also amazing and so were the mimosas. I definitely recommend this place!",,,
71,Shayla B.,"Hartford, CT",8,55,28,5.0,10/27/2017,"I heard this was a great option for a boozy brunch with music. We decided to celebrate my BF bday here with brunch. Making a reservation was very simple, unfortunately we had to change the reservation a bit, but they were very accommodating and made it easy. We arrived right on the dot for the reservation and were seated within minutes. I wish I remembered our servers name because she was very sweet, answered all of our questions, and was attentive. We ordered the peach belleni pitchers for the table which were great. The tater tots were yummy.  I ordered the steak and eggs, the steak was tough and I ordered the eggs over hard but they still came over Easy. I did not send my food back or complain but our server noticed I did not eat much and when I let her know it was though she removed it from the bill. The rest of our party enjoyed their food, especially the lobster omelette. The DJ was great, I loved the music and that he played both old and new hip hop and RnB. Drink prices are what you expect in NYC. They earned five stars from me because the service was so good. We needed an Advil and the door man (I think his name was Rutger, forgive me) found some for us so we didn't have to walk to the store. That's customer service. I would definitely recommend visiting and will be back! Wish I took picsThe only thing I did not like was the super low lighting. I would have liked to be able to see my food a little better LOL!",,,1
72,Molly P.,"New York, NY",4,40,9,3.0,4/28/2018,"Not the best place to come for brunch or drinks. The 3 stars are for the food quality & music. I came here for a friend's birthday brunch a couple of weeks ago. The venue itself is cool, and the DJ was playing good music. So I was expecting a good meal/drinks. Unfortunately, the brunch is pre-fix, meaning it was $30 for one of the 5 options on the menu, and then if you wanted to add a bottomless drink option, it's another $35. Now I know my way around a brunch and $65 for food and drinks is a bit much. On top of that, if the entire table doesn't want to do bottomless, no one can. So 3 of us ended up sharing a $40 (!!) pitcher of Ciroc-spiked mimosa. The drink itself was okay, but for a $40 pitcher I expect a decent amount of Ciroc. It ended up being a really overpriced and underwhelming meal. It kind of feels like they're trying to rip you off as much as possible.. because for the prices they're charging, they shouldn't have trouble providing good quality food/drink as well.",,,1

James, Ross and their entire team were SO incredibly delightful to work with. They were patient, gave great recommendations, and we proactive in every imaginable way the night of our event, making hosting and planning this event super seamless. The venue has a great vibe-rustic with a hip-hop vibe-making it both unique and inviting. The appetizers were all delicious as well and the bar staff now how to serve up some mean cocktails. I would highly recommend this location to anyone wanting to host a party/event. Thanks again to the Sons of Essex team! You guys were great!",,,
80,Cam N.,"Boston, MA",55,17,9,2.0,12/8/2017,Wanna go for brunch? Check out their website First. I ordered an avocado toast with poach eggs add-on from the brunch prix-fixe menu.  It's looked delicious. The guac was okay. The toast was ridiculously hard. I didn't know how to eat it. Just not my cup of java. I dislike how it is mandatory for parties of 10 or more to pick from the little prix-fixe menu.,,,

83,Charlie T.,"Nutley, NJ",7,13,16,4.0,11/26/2017,"Went for brunch on Saturday afternoon with a group of 12 friends. We had a great time, and I would definitely recommend checking it out if you are looking for a cool spot for a weekend city brunch. My brother made reservations about a month ago. They confirmed and everyone was on board. I was a bit weary due to the fact that the last place we set up brunch reservations with ended up screwing us over the day of (Il bastardo). We got there and were seated in a matter of minutes. Our  server (Alexa or Alexis) was great and had us sipping on drinks and eating in no time. Food was not bad, i had the chicken and waffles and enjoyed it. Cool decor and setup. Didn't expect them to play hip hop music, but it was a welcome surprise.  All and all good experience and I will definitely be back as well as recommend Sons of Essex go friends.",,,
84,Kia A.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",1,203,1044,5.0,3/30/2018,"I went here for my birthday in December 2016. I made a reservation and told friends to get here earlier than the reservation because I did not want the table to be given away. There was a mini snow storm so people were late but they were kind enough to let us sit with an incomplete party.  The atmosphere is really cool and the place is medium sized. There is a pit area (best way to describe it) where people typically dance, but the day I was there someone reserved that area so I was forced to dance in my seat! I chose this place because it was brunch with a DJ. The DJ was good and I enjoyed the selections played.  The food was so good!I got french toast that had a cornflake/fruity pebble crust with a sweet whipped cream on it. I had eggs and bacon on the side. One of my friends had shrimp and grits. The other had eggs benedict and another friend had a salad. We had bellinis which were so good! A lot of people around us ordered the breakfast pizza which looked really good as well. My friends got me the birthday sundae and bottle of champagne which was great!! You don't get to keep the chalkboard with your name on it!  I would highly recommend this place for a birthday or just brunch in general.",,,

Hands down a cool dope spot in LES. Please make reservations in advance so that you can guarantee a table. The crowd, music and ambiance exudes FUN!I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was fried to perfection, well seasoned and moist on the inside. The waffle was warm and soft. my entire meal was amazing and my friends enjoyed their meal also. Please keep in mind that that this is not your typical boozy brunch. 2 hour unlimited drinks are not included! (unless you have a party of 10 or more)  We decided to order two pitchers of margaritas and mimosas. But it was worth it and did not hike up our bill like crazy.

88,Christina G.,"New York, NY",0,18,19,4.0,2/25/2018,"Celebrated my 30th birthday last night at Sons. It was excellent. They gladly accommodated my party of 7 with a last minute reservation. We had great table/location and they set up the balloons I had with me nicely as well. Our waitress (Alexis) was so attentive and on point. We were taken care of all night. 2 small issues (which is why I did not rate them a 5):1.) I had inquired in an email about bringing a small cake/cupcakes and was told it was not an issue. After purchasing and transporting the cupcakes from NJ to NYC, I was told that there was an ""outside dessert fee of $3 per dessert"". That was NEVER mentioned to me otherwise I would have never spent the money on them in the first place. Sadly, they were shoved under the front desk & when we left at 3AM all of the cupcakes were either upside down or ruined. Total waste.2.) None of my other guests were able to get in to party afterwards which was a little disappointing considering we gave this place a decent amount of business as patrons from our cocktails/liquor tab and food. II will certainly be back and really appreciate the accommodations. Thanks!",1,,

90,Liz R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/16/2018,Very bad experience. We live up the street and wants to give this place a try with two friends on a Friday night. Bar service was great but after we were sat it took over 15 minutes for our server to even come by our table. After they took our drink and food order we watched other tables around us order and be served. After 20+ minutes of waiting we flagged bus staff and managers and eventually got server to come over. The server had not put in any of our orders and unapologetically asked to retake our drink order. We walked after that. Would have maybe understood if it was busy but other people were being served all around us with no problems. Heard good things about the food. Too bad we never got the chance to try any.,,,

94,Megan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,81,30,5.0,6/8/2017,"Came here for a ""Sibling Date"" and had an amazing time. My brother and I were going to share some apps, however, our server (Alexa, maybe?), informed us of the $10 burger and beer combo, and we quickly opted for that option. We started with two blue moons and burgers, med-well, and medium. I would say my burger was perfect, other than it being a little too salty, but definitely edible. My brother said his burger was a little salty too. We also split an order of fries, which again, were a little salty. They are also made with truffle oil which I wasn't aware of. Not the biggest truffle oil fan but they were still crispy and tastey. We next ordered some cocktails off the menu, and they were yummy! Wish I could remember which ones, however, they all looked great. I don't think you will go wrong on a cocktail. The decor of this place is amazing!! I loved the feel. It was so cool to enter through a coffee shop and end up in a super chic speakeasy. My only complain would have been the DJ. For something with this atmosphere, I would have expected some low key chill music. Not 50 cent throwbacks. All in all, I would absolutely be back!!!! Loved this place!!!",3,,1

I sampled the fried chicken as well (also a bit pricey), but it was pretty good with the dip they gave you.Pizza was great!!!! Please get that. Mac and cheese was a hit or miss and this was a hit.

101,Carri J.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,0,1.0,4/14/2018,"Sons of Essex has a very misleading menu that they do not clarify until you receive the bill. The menu shows  $30 for brunch. There is an additional line where they put a plus sign ""+"" instead of explicitly stating its an ADDITIONAL  $35  to include unlimited mimosas. The plus sign is very misleading giving the impression that the cost is only $35 including bottomless mimosas. While I understand as consumers we need verify before we accept a purchase, if a merchants motive is to mislead its patrons into an unexpected cost they are successful in doing so as a business strategy but it is at the misfortune of their consumers. This type of business is likely also illegal.  I plan to file this company to better business bureau.",,,

With a few of her friends, me and a guy friend of mine. Drinks were a bit expensive, but that's NYC for you. Music was hovering between decent and good, not much of a ""dance"" type of music, some hip-hop, pop, rap and so forth. Nothing really to get the hips moving, but I managed to get off the arms for a little milly rock here and there. My patented brand of milly will always make an appearance if the music lets it. The drinks weren't watered down. Tons of different people there just trying to have a good time. We ended up getting ""in"" this little ""VIP"" area which is basically just a tiny dance floor leading from a few steps guarded by a bouncer who just allows whoever they deem worthy of the area??

Well i soon as I get to the entrance I am greeted with a hello and great to see you guys back (myself and my betsie) . That tells me that they are paying attention who comes into there place and checking familar faces.  That's a plus for me.  The first time we went we were wanting some sanagria since it was the summer time and we are not heavy drinkers.  The bar maid Emme made her own sanagria version and we loved it.  The truffle fries are great. Every Wednesday they have sales on the chicken wings. It's just a nice place to chill have your drinks and eat some food. If u like hip hop music it's the place to be.  Will definitely be going back to Sons Of Essex especially are those cold days where there no place to go and it's near the home.,,,

114,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",962,976,2710,4.0,3/15/2017,"Truth be told, I actually never heard of this place. My friend and I checked it out since she has had this place bookmarked for a while, I have to admit that I thought the place was a lot of fun. The atmosphere was very chill, I really loved the decor and the vibe, the decor was really unique since it kinda had a gentleman hangout/Cracker Barrel feel. And of course, the food was solid, there was a very wide range of things to order but overall I was happy with what we got.The food: Truffle Mushroom Pizza- Three cheese blend, seasonal mushrooms, arugula. The pizza was definitely good but not as exciting from reading the description. I enjoyed the flavor but it really didn't have any kind of wow factor and I wish there was more texture to the dough. Pan Seared Scallops- Corn puree, green & yellow zucchini. I found this dish to be the fav of the night. I really thought the scallops were super fresh, they were cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed what it was paired with. As much as I enjoyed this dish, the dish did come off a bit salty for me but my friend reallllllllly loved this since she really likes salty food. lol Truffle Fries. The fries were cooked really well, they were super crunchy and not oily at all, then the hint of truffle oil was a nice addition.Braised Short Ribs- Seasonal vegetables, red wine reduction. I enjoyed the flavor especially the way the root veggies came out but I felt the short rib wasn't as sexy as I was hoping. I felt it was both dry and not as tender as it should have been.",13,9,11

119,Cristin B.,"Rochester, NY",17,1,0,5.0,9/25/2017,"Those of us who frequent the LES on a weekly basis know the area to be a lively pit of dining, partying, brunching, chaos. That being said, over the past few years of touring around the hotspots, Sons of Essex has truly been a diamond in the rough. Each time I have been to Sons I have found the door hostesses lovely, and the bar staff gracious -  I feel like a guest in the establishment, always comfortable, and at home. They play a mix of the best old school hip hop hits, while throwing in the latest and greatest, making it a welcome experience for a wide variety of friends.I have to mention my favorite cocktail which has been and will forever be the red Yummy Bear cocktail... A big thank you to Sons for even sparing a few extra gummy bears for me!Whether you come for a boozy brunch, a night-cap, birthday party, or your traditional bar hoping Saturday, Sons of Essex is your LES destination. Here's to many more Uber rides home from 133 Essex St!",2,2,1

The happy hour makes it even better, $6-7 specialty cocktails, quick bites and more. For dinner I always order the rib tacos. They come in 3s, packed with flavor, a little small but they tend to fill me up. On the weekends they have a nice DJ at night which only makes it better. Eat and party! Brunch is also WILD here! They have mimosa carafes for $25 a pop (not including your entree) and a pricier option for groups of 10 ($30 fixed menu, +$35 extra for bottomless carafes). The group deal isn't my favorite as the menu doesn't offer all of the food options. You've got to try the regular brunch menu, it's a must. I'd def recommend this place to everyone!",3,2,1

125,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,3.0,5/23/2016,"I got the Sunday brunch Groupon for two, which comes with two entrees and two cocktails (you can also substitute for coffee, which I saw the people around us do). Online it says that you have to make reservations prior to arriving, but when I got there and found out that OpenTable had *mysteriously* cancelled my reservation, the hostess waved it off, told me not to trust OpenTable, and said ""I GOTCHU!"". We were seated as soon as my friend arrived. Sweet!At 11:30AM on a Sunday morning, they were still relatively empty, so the wait wasn't an issue at all. The dining area is also much bigger than it looks from the outside. Decor is on point! But it is more of a lounge-y atmosphere (read: really dark) than what I'd expect from a typical brunch place. We showed our server the groupon on my phone and we were told that we could order ANYTHING off of their brunch menu for our entrees ( even if the price comes out to more than $38, which is the max value that the groupon says that they allow), which was great! You just have to pay for extras (sides, add-ons, etc.).  I went with a mimosa and the eggs benedictowitz and my friend ordered the lobster benedict so that we could swap and try both types. Instead of Canadian bacon and a biscuit, the benedictowiz has poached eggs that are served with smoked salmon on a hashbrown. YUM! I thoroughly enjoyed both of the benedicts..and the poached eggs were perfectly runny. :) Portions err on the smaller side though, so I'd say that you should plan to grab a snack afterwards. Our bill without the groupon and including tip and tax would have been an astounding $85, for TWO. With the Groupon, everything together was about $65. Still, that's on the higher end of brunch places in the city. OOf. Really wanted to love this place, but without a Groupon, I don't think I could/would return.",6,1,1

There arent many options under $14 except for beer (probably wine). Service is good, they are well staffed and it keeps thing moving fast. If you want a loud raucous Saturday brunch this is the place. They bring in DJ's that spin mostly hip-hop and r&b with some house and dance mixed in.

We got there a bit early but had to wait till our reservation time which was no biggie. This place is poppin'! We sat at a two person table near the ""dance floor"" section and must say it was fun. DJ was playing all the hits from oldies to new songs - you can tell everyone was loving it. We had paid for a groupon deal which was pretty sweet. 2 drinks and 2 entrees for $39. We ended up adding the $25 Bellini carafe because why not! I order the avocado toast with a side of bacon which was pretty awesome! BF ordered the breakfast pizza which he raved about. Both of us really enjoyed just about everything here. Our biggest and only complain is that the service isn't the greatest. Our waitress was barely to be found and really never checked in with us.

We had a flatbread with scrambled eggs and other toppings. So different and so good! We also shared pancakes. I'm a huge pancake and waffles fan and tend to be pretty picky. These absolutely were some of the best pancakes I've ever had! Fluffy, thick, with a little bit of crisp on the edges without being burnt, topped with fresh berries and powdered sugar. To die for!

138,Kristina P.,"New York, NY",230,150,39,3.0,2/8/2017,"I came here for dinner + drinks last night (Tuesday) and everything was fine but I wasn't particularly impressed.We arrived around 6:45 and aside from a few other people at the bar, the place was empty. We had a round of drinks at the bar before moving to a table (there were 8 of us). Someone from my party had called the restaurant several times over the weekend to try to make a reservation and nobody answered the phone. She left a voicemail and no one returned her call. We went as far as to make another reservation at a nearby restaurant just in case we couldn't get a table at Sons of Essex. So it was pretty frustrating when we saw that literally every single table in the restaurant was empty -- the staff clearly didn't care to bring in business by returning our calls/voicemails for a reservation.The food was extremely subpar. The shaved brussels salad and truffled mac and cheese were the star of the meal which is probably a larger representation of the food quality. The calamari appetizer was very rubbery. I ordered the fried chicken for my entree because nothing else really stuck out to me. The chicken itself was good, but the ""cornbread"" it came with left a lot to be desired. It did not have the texture or taste of regular cornbread. It had the texture of cake, and quite honestly it tasted like Betty Crocker vanilla cake mix, too. It was very sweet, but artificially so. I took a few bites and left the rest.The bartender and our waitress were both very friendly and attentive, always making sure we had everything we needed and that our drinks were full. They were the saving grace for this review... if it weren't for them, I probably would have given 2 stars.",2,,

Drinks I ended up switching & trying the Kentucky mule this was good interesting taste with a nice amount of alcohol, Mojito was good as well. To start we tried the Avocado toast very good nice creamy avocado great taste. The Truffle Tater tots were good as well could use more truffle oil taste.Main dish I had the Mac & Cheese omelette  interesting combo here very good comes w roasted potatoes good as well. Also tried the Fried chicken...yum nice tasting good with the spicy sauce, the Truffle Mac & cheese w Lobster was delicious nice truffle taste.

My boyfriend's crunch French toast was also good! If you are drinking def go for a craf! My advice is to add that extra ciroc shot to spike it but be careful- two of us on one craf we're feeling reallllllllyyy good after one! Totally worth it if it's that kinda brunch your into lmao.

We ordered the truffle/mushroom pizza, sliders and fries and rock shrimp. That pizza is 100% one of my favorites, the rock shrimp was teeny and had a wonderful kick to it and the sliders were delicious and just enough. Also how can you not love shoestring fries????The brunch is also fantastic. I got a MACAND CHEESE OMELETTE! I'll say that's again... a MAC... and CHEESE.... OMELETTE!!!! Really for the experience, I was more in it for that than the egg part but still cool. Could've been cheesier but anywhooooo. They have truffle tots that is travel the world to get and I had some of the blueberry pancakes that... though I don't like blueberry when baked, those were the fluffiest pancakes I've ever encountered.

Updated review","A group of 30 of us (all African American attorneys) attempted to attend Sons of Essex for brunch a few months ago and, at the time, were not accommodated by the staff in booking the reservation.  This caused us to write an unfavorable Yelp review about our experience.  We contemplated sending the review to the management of Sons of Essex but before we could even do so, we were contacted by the management who, upon reading our review, proactively went above and beyond to ensure that our group would give Sons of Essex a second chance to host us.  So we took them up on their offer and we're glad that we did.  The unanimous consensus among our group is that the food was great, the service was great, and a good time was had by all.  Sons of Essex not only remedied our previous experience, but it proved to be a place that our group will return for future brunches.  I'd also like to highlight that Royce, Isabella, and Alejandro did an excellent job making sure that our group was taken care of. Even though the tip was already included in the final price, we took the opportunity to add an additional 20% on top of the final bill to reflect the service we received.",,,

In order to reserve a table here for brunch you'll need to send them a copy of your ID and Credit card. As soon as we walked through the door our table was waiting and we were greeted by our waitress. $25 pitchers of mimosas we're great! I ordered the steak and huevos which lacked seasoning but was still tasty! - my friends ordered a bunch of different things but I really enjoyed the tater tots! Lobster mac and cheese, ehhhh not so much! Way too expensive for what you receive. Over all its nice here, the vibe is great, music is great, drinks are great. Food is OK.

Updated review","Had another great brunch experience with my girlfriend this past Sunday. We made reservations and were unfortunately very late for our table (parking was hell), lost it but opted to eat at the bar instead of waiting the 45 minutes for another table. The bartender for the day, Ray, laughed when we ordered a carafe of their Kentucky Mule cocktail. He had us a little worried (all in good fun, of course) but served us the bourbon-laden drink and it was very  good; spicey with the zing of ginger. I loved it. We were bummed to find out the the bites menu they used to offer was gone, otherwise I would have ordered some deviled eggs and those damned good biscuits w/sweet butter but, alas, they weren't selling and so, they went the way of wind. We didn't grieve for long since deciding to order some Truffle Tots and Truffle Mac & Cheese before our entrées,both of which were good. The Tots were crispy on the outside and flavorful and the mac and cheese was OK, not as thick as I would like but decent. My gf chose the Steak & Huevos which was very good. It was served with some spicey salsa on top and while it looked messy AF, the flavor was wonderful. I went with my usual, Shrimp & Grits w/o the ham. I'm never disappointed with that choice at SoE. The staff is very accommodating and sometimes I forget about how much better a dining experience can be when you opt to sit at the bar. There's always a possibility of good conversation with the bartender and other staff members. Definitely want to give a shout out to Ray, the bartender, and Kountri, the bouncer, for their pleasantries and good convo. We had a nice Sunday and I know I'll be back.",7,2,6

When you approach the door though, it hits you, damn this place is fresh. Walk through the store front, past the bouncer, through the door, past the crowd at the bar and tell them you're here.Go sit in the pit while you wait. It's a lower area with banquets, tables and dancing hipster the girls next to the amazing Dj. Your tables ready. It's amidst old photos, books antiques and other shit you can find at grandmas house. Order appetizers. White truffle pizza, oysters, Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, empanadas. Go nuts, they're all pretty good. Not amazing, but you're here for the scene. Entrees come- scallops, chicken, burger. You're too distracted by the model dancing on the banquet on your right to notice how bland it is. Get the check. Go home happy.

159,Rachel M.,"Chicago, IL",83,18,4,4.0,3/25/2018,"One of the most unique bar/restaurants I've been been to. First off, is 90s hip hop becoming a thing amongst the hipster crowd? This place has avocado toast on the menu and sleeved out dandy punks behind the bar making craft cocktails whilst Biggie and 2 Pac tunes try to knock all the vintage art and murals of 19th century Bowery imagery off the 100 year old plaster. I was very confused, yet amused (word to your mother). I also couldn't generalize the crowd (human nature fail!) which was quite lively and ample for a late Sunday morning. Millennial suburban kids wishing to reminisce about when we would ""say he's just a friend...oh baby youuuuu...got what I neeeeed...""  Amidst my confusion, the food and service was amazing. Sit at the bar and chat with one of the cool bartenders who will try to explain the phenomenon to you. Very good food.  I had the Essex Burger rare with no bun and fried egg (very good). The bathrooms are likely my favorite restaurant bathrooms ever. The vintage art and photography are almost as awesome as the antique 5 panel oak bathroom stall doors and the pre-electricity medicine cabinet vanity mirrors with candle holders (swoon!)...but then the 90s hip hop murals...",,,
160,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1045,25564,3.0,12/1/2015,"Came here tonight for a start-up/tech Meetup that was sponsored by an app doing a soft launch of their new app.This event had a special cocktail made for the event - I think it was called a ""Pink Gummy"" and it was made with Ciroc Berry, Pama (a pomegranate liquor), lemon juice (which tasted more like sour mix...which I hate) and maybe a splash of like soda. It wasn't awful, but more sour and sweet than I prefer. The taller bartender out of the 2 behind the bar tonight was rude when I asked him nicely for a beer list. He was bent on telling it to me verbally, but skipped 4 beers that were on their menu and it was one of those that I ended up getting (Empire White Aphro...it was the best one on their menu given the weak beer selection). He said he was ""trying to not be rude"" because it was ""dark"" and I might not be able to see the menu...yeahhhh....no. The lighting at Sons of Essex is dim, but I have 20/15 vision - that's BETTER than 20/20. If I'm asking to see a menu, then that means I'm confident that I can read it. Thankfully the blonde bartender (who must have overhead the request I made two times) passed a menu over and all was good.The overall vibe here is really sexy, warm and old-fashioned/vintagey/speakeasy-like. Sons of Essex would make a faaaaaantastic date night place. Their food menu also looks interesting and I'd be up for coming back to try their truffle Mac N' Cheese, crab cakes, in-house created Twinkie dessert and their brunch...especially their Mac N' Cheese omelette...mmmmmm. Although brunch here is unfortunately on the pricier side ($40+), so it would have to be for a special occasion and not for just casual brunch hangs.3 stars. Yep.",2,2,3

These fried chicken wings are tossed in a whiskey honey glaze and come with a sriracha mayo sauce on the side. There's also a really good deal on whiskey drinks on Wednesdays.

163,Lizzy K.,"New York, NY",274,234,168,5.0,11/22/2015,"I came here for a friend's endless birthday brunch on a Saturday afternoon a few months ago and I am sorry I never get around for giving this place the proper review it deserves! I would prefer to give this place a 4.5 if I could! At first, I was reluctant to come here because of the price (approx 70$ per person between food and endless drink charge for the table  for the amount of time we were allowed) but I could not be any happier that I made the decision to come here.I ordered the mac and cheese omelet which was unique and very good. The tator tots were also delicious and well seasoned. We had endless pitchers of mimosas, bellinis and mimosas etc on the table. Service was great! They were friendly and accommodating. Also, I accidentally got hit in the head with a cardboard box by staff walking by and they gave me and my friend free shots! That is how it should be! The atmosphere is also great. People getting up and dancing early on a Saturday afternoon, all happy and getting along even with strangers.",3,1,

165,A. B.,"Jamaica, NY",65,35,3,2.0,8/21/2017,"This place is a typical dark, all wood bar/restaurant in the East Village.  I arrived early and sat at the bar for a drink.  We each had a vodka/seltzer and the tab was 30 bucks, which I felt was on the high end simple cocktails during Sunday brunch.  The rap/R&B music was fine at the bar but when we headed to our table in the back it became deafening. We were a large group of 20 plus pp but were only given 1 waiter.  They seated us in several small groups so it felt disjointed and with the blaring music, conversation across the table was near impossible. The booth seating had tape on torn seams and many tables were wobbly.  The service was very slow and one of our groups was served 20 minutes before the other group within our party.  Then they said we could only have one bill but folks got upset when they wanted to leave but had to wait for others to finish eating.  Overall, this place is probably good for pricey albeit good cocktails and loud music.  We found the food to be mediocre.  The brunch menu offered to our group was a price fix of 30 per/person so I paid 30 bucks for a breakfast quesadilla with some potatoes on the side. Not at all worth it!  My hubby ordered the breakfast pizza and he said is was meh. The price fix menu  didn't include chicken and waffles, burgers or anything else that looked appetizing from the main menu.  Just the usual French toast with no meat, eggs Benedict and the aforementioned.  We couldn't wait to get out of there as many of us felt this to be a torturous experience.",,,

The event management staff was excellent in providing clear options on both food and beverages. The process with booking was seamless. The event itself went off without a hitch. The food and beverages were both excellent. The staff was both attentive, friendly, and easy to work with. I would recommend this spot to anybody looking to either host an event or just go for a drink. The cocktails were definitely delicious! Thanks,Brandon",,,

He played the right amount of a song before switching. Not too much and not too little. People were loving it.Drinks are standard and crowd was mid 20's. Its a cool place to let loose a little.,2,,

Ross and the team of waitresses that assisted the night of were super attentive and made sure everything went smoothly. They made sure every detail was perfect and made the night feel extra special. When the cake came out they brought out this awesome, customized sign, sparklers, the works! The food was delicious (the truffle mac and cheese and truffle mushroom pizza were out of this world.)

The team at Sons were so hands on and executed our small event perfectly. I see why they do so many events. Upon arrival I was greeted and brought to the Pit Lounge where we ordered light bites, a few bottles of champagne and tequila - Overall, my Fiancé had the best celebration, everyone loved the music !I recommend Sons of Essex for celebrations of any kind!",,,
173,Sarah K.,"Granger, IN",272,50,14,4.0,1/15/2018,"Went for drinks and good music to vibe to for my friend's birthday. The crowd had a little older crowd, played top rap/hip hop hits, and was pretty lively. There was a mandatory $3 coat check, which is probably for the best because the space isn't that big so it gets hot and crowded quick. Drinks were more on the expensive side, and they don't make any specialty drinks. More of a laid back spot where you can vibe at a table with good drinks, good music, and good company.",,,

My large party  (8) was suddenly cut to 4 and they still accommodated us without hesitation. Definitely a great ambience (the setting matched my theme) and the live DJ played a lot of classic 90s songs that I love. The food was alright and the idea of not having unlimited mimosas did throw me off. Enjoyed the singing and dancing of the staff while holding a chalkboard with the saying ""Happy Birthday...."" during my dessert presentation.",4,,

I was in NY for the weekend was trying to explore. Really cool atmosphere, dark, mysterious, vintage, romantic kind of vibe.    I drank 2 and a half rum punches and that was enough lol.The music was pretty good. Hip hop, some old and new. Everybody was dancing  and having a great time once they took away the chairs. I really don't have much to say about this place because I was a bit inebriated and preoccupied, lol. I was being a bad girl that night, dont judge me.  But I definitely would like to try their brunch or dinner next time I'm in NY.",4,2,

Will never step back and never recommend to anyone.,1,,
183,Shaienne K.,"Hightstown, NJ",0,6,2,2.0,2/25/2018,"There's a lot you can say about his place. It's exciting, but there's a lot to be fixed. The $30 brunch menu includes a big meal. I got the chicken and waffles and while the waffles were ok the chicken was hearty and tasty. My issue is with the service. Our busboy made us feel Unwelcome and rushed. He asked people if they were done while they were still chewing with a plate full of food. I understand it was busy but he was clearing the table too quickly. We may have spent more ( a party of 15 of us) had he not rushed us out the door. The music could be turned down a bit also. We were SCREAMING and I know it's a cool place so loud music is customary but it was blasting... at noon. The birthday desert was cool! I appreciated it.My biggest complaint was a $50- something charge for the sink?  Ultimately I probably won't come back.",,,

Lobster rolls were a favorite and overall the horderves were plenty (they weren't kidding about ""heavily passed""). Great beer selection, fun prohibition-style vibe made for a fun atmosphere. The DJ was killing it on 1's and 2's, which made for a high-energy and a classy event. We had a picky crowd and no one walked away disappointed. Two thumbs up!",,,
186,Sdot T.,"New York, NY",365,4,0,2.0,1/28/2018,"Food is cool (esp the truffle Mac n cheese), but super overpriced and pitchers of drinks are expensive and watered down. It's also INSANELY loud. So, go if you're trying to turn up but food ain't allllllll that. Group of 8 of us had a bill of about $320. Also, dude that's at the front door asked us to ""clear a path"" after he saw us standing up front for a few minutes (after paying said $320 bill). So yea, underwhelmed.

The hostesses are EXTREMELY rude people who cant do their jobs right. Also the music SUCKS. Its so loud that you cant have a decent conversation with your friends. Trying to arrange another place now. Hate it here. Will NEVER come back. I do not recommend at all!!!Edit: we came to this cute place called la contenta --5 min from sons of essex. Super cute. They could arrange us a table in 5 minutes. Amazing food and amazing service. DO NOT waste your time at awful sons of essex. Either come to la contenta or hotel chantelle,3,1,

The music (hip hop, current and throwbacks) was great the entire time. The bouncers, however, gave me a lot of trouble about letting in my friends past midnight. They actually said that to manage the crowd, my female friends could come in but that mixed groups or guys had to purchase a bottle to enter. I thought that was shady, especially since I asked about cover policies prior to making my reservation over the phone. This happened to at least 3 groups of friends at different times during the night. I would maybe come back here for the DJ for brunch or early in the night but wouldn't throw a party here again.",1,,

After my umbrella got stolen he seriously slashed my bar bill (had a couple of Bailey's with coffee), which was very sweet and unnecessary. The truffle mac n' cheese is delicious, and the kraft of mimosas is a good deal ($25 for 5-6). Beautiful restaurant with great music, I'd recommend it if you like R&B/Hip-Hop music and southern food.",,1,
197,Jesse S.,"Jersey City, NJ",211,109,96,5.0,10/26/2015,Fantastic brunch spot! Came by with a groupon and had a great time. The decor is on point and they added a festive Halloween vibe to continue the charm. The music was hold school R&B and hip hop so be prepared to sing along. The menu has something for everybody. I went with the Eggs Benedictowitz which is a creative play on a classic - potato pancakes and lox instead of ham. Absolutely delicious. The Bloody Mary was decent. A bit pricy for the quality. At $11 each I would expect a bit more but still tasty. The service was phenomenal. Recognized our every need before it came up. Spent one second looking at the bent prong of my fork and he swooped in with a new one. Poured the last of the water and a new bottle appeared. Truly a wonderful experience. Will be back to the another one of the fantastic options that tempted me so much.,,,

Theres not many places I have found that play a good mix of older hip hop and r&b. If you want that kind of vibe definitely stop by here.The drinks were pretty well priced and quite large compared to most places I've been to in the area. They were well made and tasted great. I had the Kentucky Mule and my wife the Frose which we both througholy enjoyed.I will definitely be coming back again for happy hour.",,,
199,Jocelyn B.,"NY, NY",211,6,0,1.0,4/15/2018,"I had a pleasant time the first time I came here. Recommended the bar to many people who visited NYC and even suggested a friend have her birthday celebration at their facility. We emailed to ask about new bar regulations or any new cover charges we were not aware about and they emailed back stating that they only had a $3 dollar mandatory coat check (which we were all fine with) and no cover charges at all to get it. Upon arriving, I was in line with the birthday girl and 11 other friends waiting to get in. When we got to the bouncer he said he wouldn't let us in because there was a cover charge of $100 considering we had too many people in our party. We started arguing about how we had an email stating that there was no cover charge but he still insisted on having us pay to come inside. We noticed he didn't charge anyone else a cover charge who went in before or after us, he was clearly trying to take advantage of us and rip us off. He eventually let us in without us having to pay the fee after several friends of ours, waiting for us inside, had to come out and state that hey didn't pay and so forth. We waiting outside for 45 minutes while half of our friends were inside waiting for the birthday girl. Since I've been here, it's become a really crowded facility full of pretentious obnoxious bouncers trying to charge people he thinks wouldn't be aware of the no cover charge fee. Very unprofessional place... never going back and never recommending this place again.",1,,
