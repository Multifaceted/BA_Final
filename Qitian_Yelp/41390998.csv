0,Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",70,499,547,3.0,6/6/2018,"Not far from where I was staying, Cafe Olympia was a reasonable option for quick buys. I was  actually here three times in three days simply because it was convenient. There is an assortment of items from ice cream, to coffee, to beverages, to fresh fruit, snacks, and their buffet offerings and made to order counter. I was mostly interested in getting a yogurt or kobucha or a banana for quick bites since breakfast wasn't an option at my hostel.  While prices are admitedly high, $5+ for a kombucha which costs $3 back home, it is the reality of being in NYC. I do question the ""I'll charge you $6 instead of 5.99 and no tax""... Do they even charge tax on kombucha in NYC? If it had been a food item, is there tax on that? I'm not losing sleep over pennies, I'm just curious if there is some shadiness going on...Overall, for my needs I cant really complain. Would stop in again for the convenience.",,,
1,Pau L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",19,2,0,1.0,11/11/2018,"Used to come here for a quick snack but service is getting worse and worse. Last time there were a few gentlemen who could barely speak English and were very rude. They did not want to prepare any of the menu items. I complained to the kid at the cashier and he barely helped. I'm not coming here ever again, except to complain with the owner who usually stays at night.",,,
2,Jill B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/15/2018,This place is around the corner from where I work so I have tried it on occasion. On every occasion I have been there the staff is always very rude. This morning I went in to get a very small oatmeal with milk on the side. I put it on the scale and the rude cashier said I need to pay full price for my small oatmeal because I put it in a large cup. I explained there wasn't any small or medium containers left. She said it didn't matter. I showed her the inside and she could see I only had about 2 inches of oats. She also said she will charge me for my side of milk (1 inch of milk). And then she followed it up with that she is figuring in the price of the containers themselves into the hefty price. She was extremely rude and completely ridiculous. It's clear they are out to rip off their costumers and they don't care about keeping locals coming back.In addition to this after leaving I looked them up and found out that they have had some very serious health violations in the recent past including rodents and cockroaches! Please don't waste your time and your money going to this place!,,,
3,Nicolette F.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,35,76,3.0,9/24/2018,"Boy, do they have everything here. That's cool. Butttt,  just another typical Manhattan Super Deli. Busy, so you know things move.Decently Clean, so I would choose this over some others. Pretty Good Açaí bowls! If you are in the area and you want something good and fast, this is an ok option.",,,
4,Amal A.,"Hoboken, NJ",16,56,223,1.0,7/31/2018,I've had the Hawaiian acai bowl and replaced the banana with blueberries. It's the worst acai I've ever had! The oats were just regular oats they didn't even toast it and they should've put granola instead of oats. The blackberries were sour. The acai was gooey not even chilled!,2,,1
5,Abrianna R.,"Reno, NV",632,66,118,5.0,3/20/2018,"I went here for lunch a few weeks ago off a recommendation from a coworker because it's so convenient to our office. After getting a salad there (yum) I looked up Cafe Olympia on Yelp and was shocked by the low rating. This place is great! They have so many options for whatever you may be in the mood for, from salad and sandwiches, to a hot bar, Japanese and Korean food and much much more.The place itself is pretty standard, really big open space with lots of kiosks with the different types of food. There are tables to sit down at, as well as free wifi (which is sometimes wonky at first but it will work). I personally usually get the salad (I got there at least twice a week now) and if you don't get a meat then you're actually allowed 6 options to have with the salad instead of 4! I also just had the veggie ramen today which was pretty good as well, they make it fresh right in front of you.Yes the cashiers are pretty short with you, but such is the standard for a busy lunch spot in Manhattan. If they were going slowly and taking their time to talk to you I'm sure dozens of people would be pretty upset.  There is a $7 card minimum, but most of the lunch dishes cost just around that after tax anyway so hasn't been an issue for me. This place is so much more affordable than many of the other lunch spots around, and I go here often and haven't been given a reason not to come back! The salads are also really good and if you haven't tried the lime chipotle dressing you definitely should!",2,3,2

I ended up getting 5 or 6 items, and I found the food to be decent . Would I go out of my way again, probably not, but it's good to know there's a place open 24hrs with a decent spread .",1,,
7,Cathy M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/20/2018,"They charge more than what their menu states. It's probably better to order exactly what you want, even if it's not on the menu, and ask how much it will be. I also found the food to be very greasy and heavy. I couldn't eat it.",2,,
8,Benedetto S.,"Queens, NY",11,58,1,1.0,7/10/2018,The cashiers in Cafe Olympia are scamming people every day. My total for my egg sandwich was $8.00 @ 8.875 taxes that's $8.71. The cashier charged me $9.71. When I confronted him he said it's only a dollar. I told him if I were short a dollar you wouldn't give me the sandwich! This also happened to my coworkers. I could just imagine how much money they take in at the end of the week! You've been warned....,2,,
9,Connie K.,"East Arlington, Arlington, TX",19,12,10,5.0,7/23/2018,We visited the United Nations during our trip to New York and the family friend who works for the UN recommended this place to us. We were starving after hours of walking inside the UN and were glad to be able to quickly pick out what we like among so many options for hot dishes and salads. The food tasted pretty delicious to us.,,1,
10,Annie M.,"New York, NY",349,79,343,3.0,4/26/2017,"So far, this is my go-to for lunch break. It is clean, modern, and offers a variety of literally everything you can think of. You can get burgers and quesadillas on one side, Korean food and sushi on the other, then in the middle is a yummy hot foods bar. There's even a cafe with pastries and cake to the left of the entrance.Notes: While I do wish the hot food could be hotter, it's maintained and replenished often. I love the jap chae!The sushi rolls are huge. And fresh.The health drink selection is awesome. I got a detox aloe water that's flavored with lychee & white grape.I've had nothing but fast and friendly service here :)",6,3,3
11,Oyasimi N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,1.0,10/9/2017,"It's very disgusting and shady that the place is selling expired food. I bought the gum this morning. When I was chewing it, I felt something weird of the gum. I always buy the same brand, so I can know it. Then I check the package, and I noticed that somebody deliberately destroyed the label so that customer would recognize that it was expired. This behavior is really awful and irresponsible.",4,1,
12,Helen O.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",86,1,8,5.0,6/27/2018,"This deli is perfect for people on the go as well as those who want to sit down for a hot meal. You can also go grocery shopping here as they have a wide variety of selection to take home with you including wine. Everything is fresh made and there's a ton of healthy eating options here for those health food nuts. I particularly love their noodle bar, gotta have me my ramen on those rainy days!",,1,

14,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,3.0,12/5/2017,"There are a lot of options here. Anything ranging from shrimp fried rice to yams can is part of the hot bar. There are also salad bars, a place for acai bowls and sandwiches. Be careful, however. Food from the hot bar is weighed, and it can get pretty pricey, pretty quickly. It gets crowded around lunchtime, and there are not enough seats to dine in when busy. The food is o.k. It depends on the day, to be honest, but if you're indecisive, it may be an ideal spot to go to get a little of everything.",1,,
15,Jianna L.,"Manhattan, NY",96,23,189,2.0,4/3/2018,"I tend to order lunch from this place because it's close to my office.  However, they almost always get the order wrong. The Smoked Turkey Sandwich that I got, which is described as having ""smoked turkey, roasted red peppers, bacon, lettuce, tomato and ranch dressing on an orilan focaccia"" only had the peppers, turkey, and cheese. There was no bacon, lettuce, or tomato; they put Russian dressing instead of Ranch, and it was in a hero instead of Focaccia.  Any of the steak quesadillas are actually just cheese steak quesadillas. (And I've found papers mixed into the steak before.) And spinach salad with dressing on the side is somehow turned into Arugula salad with dressing mixed in.",2,,
16,Danika P.,"Houston, TX",0,3,2,3.0,6/6/2018,It was okay. They have everythingggg from affordable sushi so sandwiches and good candy. But they guy who made my sandwich was really rude and made me feel so pressured when making my sandwich. He wouldn't tell me what any of the toppings options were and got mad when I didn't know what they did and didn't have! Well I finally got my sandwich and it was soo average. But whatever got a p big sandwich and chips for $10. Probs wouldn't go back,,,

20,Jessica M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,9,56,4.0,6/29/2017,"Cafe Olympia near UN headquarters offers a diverse range of foods. From pad Thai to salad bars to burritos. Yum! My favorite so far is the acaí bowls! (California girl in the city what do you expect! ) Prices for acaí bowls range from $7.50 to $10, not bad for both acaí bowls and the city! I tried the ""Go Green"" acaí bowl, which is full of kale, acaí, spinach, fruits, and granola! Quite filling and delicious! Looking forward to trying the other options!

24,Marissa K.,"Manhattan, NY",107,192,54,1.0,3/15/2016,"I have been there twice now--both before work picking up breakfast and I have to say: disappointed.My roommates and I all work in the area-ish and we were talking about cheapest chopped salad options and one of my roommates mentioned Cafe Olympia.  I had never heard of it.  As life goes, the next day I passed it on my way to work while utterly famished and craving a smoothie.  That day, I got a large smoothie, which was smaller than any small smoothie I have ever gotten, and a yogurt and it cost $9.  I shamed myself for buying smoothies--its such a waste of money, but so delicious (and this one really was delicious, the one good thing about this place).I went back again this morning and ordered a spinach, feta, and onion omelette.  They did not put the feta in (fine) but then charged me $4.95--for just the omelette.  No bread, no potatoes.  I also got a diet dr. pepper and at the hot food bar I got two hashbrowns--which tasted like shit, btw.  The total charge was $9.50 AGAIN.  Okay, so 4.95 for the hashbrowns, let's say 2.50 for the diet dr pepper, which would be expensive but not unheard of, brings us to $7.50, which means my two pay by the weight hashbrowns cost $2???? It was early and I wasn't thinking when I paid, but I will definitely never return.  They clearly just like to take money and make crappy food, albeit delicious smoothies.",4,,
25,Gloria C.,"Bensonhurst, NY",142,208,122,3.0,1/23/2016,"Huge place with a large selection of food. I love the endless array of choices: do I want a quesadilla today? Hot sandwich? Hot buffet bar?

26,Alexandra L.,"Manhattan, NY",1021,678,2376,4.0,4/22/2015,"The Quick: For an in and out lunch, or a quick lunch eaten at the long wooden tables, this is an obvious good choice. The food is reasonably priced, local discount, and lots of options. It also seems very clean.The Details: For strictly the salad bar, this place had plenty of options. One protein plus 4 toppings (any toppings including avocado, egg whites, etc) for one price. There was also ample dressing choices... The options are limitless. I found the salad very fresh and the ingredients very flavorful. I also enjoyed the communal long wooden tables that overlooked Lexington Avenue, perfect for people watching. Obviously you would never go here on a date, or for a big night out. It's perfect for what it is, a quick lunch and a break from the office with healthy options The Damage: after my company discounts my salad came to ~$6.50. So much more reasonable than other options in the area.",1,1,
27,Sammy G.,"Manhattan, NY",26,132,64,1.0,9/25/2016,"I live extremely close by to this cafe and as convenient as it is for those late night supper runs, I loathe coming in here. I've had about 3 bad experiences with the staff members here. Once was asking the guy behind the counter to give me literally 2 ice cubes so I can make my extremely hot coffee more drinkable---he tried to charge me 25 cents for 2 ice cubes. Another time was this girl at the cashier who literally GLARED at me when I tried to swipe my credit card for a $5 bill. And the 3rd time was quite recent- John's Coffee Shop was extremely crowded for brunch so I decided to come here to get a quick to go brunch. I think it was around 11:10am and the mexican ""cooks"" refussssssed to make me an egg sandwich because their breakfast hour was only till 11:00am. He went as far as saying: we don't have any eggs. Which later turned out to be a complete lie- I hate saying this because it makes me sound racist but I've only had bad experiences with the hispanic/latino workers in here. The asian workers are nothing but nice to me... idk man...i really hope they would fix this situation.",6,4,1
28,Kinjal P.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,10,0,1.0,7/3/2017,"The owner is super rude and their prices are absurd. It's very hard to get me angry and this place accomplished that. They once charged me $5 for about 10 ice cubes. It was a very hot day and we ran out of ice. Out of desperation, I walked in and saw cups of ice in the freezer. I took 3 cups and it came out to $15. So I paid $15 for frozen tap water. Another time, the owner furiously yelled at one of the patrons for taking an extra packet of crackers for her soup.

I've only tried the hot food bar/salad bar so my review is only for that, but they also have a udon area, a sandwich bar and made-to-order food bar.There is a wide selection of food in the hot food bar. In the morning they have breakfast items such as sausage, 3 different types of omelettes, hash browns, etc. By lunch/dinner, these options are removed for other more lunch/dinner-like foods like beef and broccoli, noodles, fried rice, etc. Their salad bar also has a pretty good selection of salads, from shrimp asparagus salads to avocado tomato salads to grilled chicken salads. Lots of variety if you get there early or during off peak times! By 9PM, your choices are a lot more limited. There's a credit card min of $7.

Bottom line they are shady here and taking advantage of their location by the UN.  We live in the neighborhood and sometimes its necessary to grab a last minute food item and for that I give them two stars as the carrot cake was good and so was the quesadilla made to order.  Their staples that they sell are crazy priced and I'm pretty sure they are charging eat in tax rates on the food that we order to go.  Id love consumer affairs to stop in here and check out the way they are doing busy.  I'm pretty sure some fines are in order.",,,

When I asked for a glass of water, she was like go get it at the back, when I went to the back, another nasty looking chinese lady was like, there is no water in the tap when I could see a lot of empty glasses and water right next to her. Most delis offer water, its a free service, clearly here they are rude and they lie. When I tried the food, it was just borderline acceptable, I had to pour water into it to make it less oily and spicey (it was crazy spicey, the cook had told me it wasn't spicey at all).

Updated review","I get food here almost every weekday, working nearby.But no more.The food is still good, and most of the food preparaing staff (salad guys, Korean food guys) are pleasant. However I am so tired of the blatantly rude ladies at checkout.There is always a difference in the price listed on their boards and the price they charge you. I'm normally in a rush to get back to work and overlook it but 75c-$1 every day does add up.  If you try to question it, you get the rudest response from the Hispanic checkout ladies. Or be prepared for a death glare if you dare to request an extra napkin or salt packet!!After daring to ask why my ordered off the board Breakfast Sandwich was a dollar more than what's quoted on the board, the lady yelled at me, told me to move to the side, and basically was just unpleasant. I was in a rush and it's Christmas eve but I was tempted to ask to speak to the manager.I'll be finding somewhere else to get my lunch every day.Adios Olympia.",7,,1

Okay, I have been working kind of near this place for almost 8 years, but this place is not very close, and pricig and food was just okay, so I rarely used there. However, they closed for renovation for a while and reopend early this year, so I decided to give this place another try. I didn't feel like eating sandwich or something cold, so I went to Asian section and ordered Bibimbap. Bibimbap is popular Korean food even in Japan, so I know what good bibimpap is like. It is usually hot and some delicious ingredients comes over hot rice. However!!!! Their bibimbap was served over FROZEN salad. Yes. Icey cold frozen salad. Even hot rice was served over it, the salad was not thawed and the rice got colder and colder. It was not only the worst bibimbap in my life, but the worst food I had ever had in New York.

Updated review","Does anyone know why this place charges a different price each time, for the same thing?  You can come here every day, buy the same lunch item, and depending on the cashier, you will be charged a different price.  For example, a small salad at the salad station costs $6.45, so with tax it comes out to $7.  But you won't get charged $7 each time.  That is quite sketchy.  (And no, I do not add additional items to the salad that would up its price).  New Yorkers are so corrupt.Here's another update (2/13):  Got a small cup of soup, and a very small salad from the self-serve buffet.  Miraculously, the price was an even $8.  Another example of the sketchy pricing here.  Wanna bet the cashier simply rounds up?",7,,

Everyone who complained of horrible service, prices and especially the cashiers- is absolutely telling the truth!This place is an overpriced, inconsistent, unsanitary, noisy DUMP with questionable food quality, constantly varying prices, rigged scales and ILLITERATE, RUDE and most likely ILLEGAL staff working there.The worst are the nasty, snotty, plain rude cashiers (one fat Latina in specific) who will act nasty and put upon just for having to do their job and serve the customers. God forbid you ask any questions, question a price or ask for any condiments! You will get the nastiest skanky attitude EVER! They obviously don't realize they're not living in some third world country that they ran away from by running illegally across the border any more.  This one Latina in specific will dare to go as far as to talk back in a nasty manner and REFUSE to give you the condiments that you request (in this instance- ONE small packet of soy sauce). Are we rationing food now in the U.S. A. ???? If a customer pays $12 dollars, does it really cost you ANYTHING to give away one more packet of salt, catchup, soy sauce...- upon request? Obviously, they think it's a better business practice to lose a customer over 5 cents (for condiments) than to retain one who will pay $12 for the food again and return.  Also, the cashiers (and this one fat Latina in specific) when confronted and asked to call a manager- she will lie and tell you that the manager is not in the store at the moment.  Please save yourselves from any aggravation and potential food poisoning and go elsewhere. There are MANY better priced options in the area. A soup and a tiny salad bar container were $12 dollars!!! The scales are most likely rigged, and most of your containers will leak on the way out as they are cheap and flimsy.The way the food is handled and displayed in this place is EXTREMELY UNSANITARY!

Highly unpleasant and unnecessary experience over a small plate of food.  It looks to be consistent with other Yelp reviews - unfortunate that the owners are not taking feedback into consideration to improve his/her business.,6,,
97,Emily B.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,0,1.0,5/27/2014,"I should have heeded the other reviews...i was hoping that the new management and renovation meant that this place would be better.I got the stir fry with ""asian barbeque sauce"" by which they mean regular barbeque sauce, it's absolutely disgusting.",2,,
98,Shelley Y.,"Manhattan, NY",596,29,0,4.0,7/28/2011,"My go-to place for lunch with very very very varied offerings.  They have a quesadilla, panini, sandwich, bagel, and burger section in the front, a korean food, pasta, and salad station when you walk in, japanese  food including udon and sushi on the side, and by the pound buffet in the back.  I wasn't not kidding about the varied offerings.  The sandwiches are delicious.  Get the hot sandwiches, they're the bomb.  Its because the workers usually drench the grilled chicken in sauce on a hot grill, load it up with cheese and other yummy delights, and put it on a toasty sub.  The sandwiches are usually priced below $7 and come with a fountain drink.  The spicy udon is good for a cold day but go to Onya or Udon West (a few blocks away) for better udon at about the same price.  The hot buffet food is generally pretty tasty.  They have a lot of seafood (mainly shrimp, fried fish, and octopus/squid).  The food has a bit of an Asian flair to it but there are staples such as lasagna and mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes are very buttery actually.  The crowning glory of Cafe Olympia is that they have the most amazing avocado salad I've ever tasted.  It is so good.  Huge chunk of marinaded quartered avocados sit in this tasty sauce with cherry tomatoes and onions.  The avocados are silky and melt in your mouth soft.  It gets crowded during the lunch rush but the cashiers are really quick.  There is usually ample seating there but not recommended unless you like to smell like deli for the rest of the day.  Overall, it is a nice lunch place in the desert of Midtown East dining.",6,2,2

You can either go for the hot & cold buffet or you can choose different menus from the different stations available.Although the food is mostly the same everyday, they tend to have something new every week. But don't let my previous sentence mislead you: they offer a wide range of food! You can go there every weekday and eat something different.The reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because it smells a little of food when you enter the place, it would be great if they could eliminate this odor. And it can be a noise around 1-1.30pm. But the good thing is also that you can buy your food and eat it somewhere else.",,1,
104,Shelley S.,"Westchester County, NY",272,79,12,3.0,1/31/2014,"During our Polar Voertx, I had one of those days where some of  your plans in the city fall through and you have to waste an hour and a half and wander a few miles. So I did. And on the way I saw Cafe Olympia. on a normal day I would probably give it 4 stars, but it was not designed for a New York Winter. I go some of the (delicious) coffee, picked up a snack, and sat at an empty table to settle in and play on my phone for a while. They have their seating at the front of the cafe, facing out the window. But that also means close to the door. Metal chairs, metal tables, and doors that are mechanically set to close very slowly each time someone opens them (and they were opened quite a lot in that hour) do not add up to a comfortable experience.I had to stay wrapped up in my coat and scarf to stay warm and even then I shivered at particularly slow moments when the door was taking forever to close. This is coming from the girl who always complains about how hot I am, so don't think I'm sensitive to the cold! It was bad.",,1,

113,Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",317,875,428,3.0,1/21/2011,"I heard good things about their sandwiches, but I didn't try it. The buffet looked good too but I didn't try it. I was gravitating to the sushi section, not for the sushi but for their selection of Korean dishes. Yes, you can sit down at the counter area, where they offer Japanese udon soups as well as some basic Korean dishes like bibimbap, bibimnengmyun, and their newest addition, jjampong. I tried the bibimbap here. It is 8.99+tax. I mean 1st off, you have to be open minded about this place. Yes this deli looks like it is korean-owned, but c'mon, this is not k-town. You can't expect the best bibimbap out there. However, for midtown east, and for a deli, it is a respectable dish. It comes in a big bowl and it is filled with white rice, some veggies, a sunny side up egg, and some gochujang. However, they have extra bottles of gochujang so you can add more to your liking. Obviously, they mellowed it down for the local patrons. However, as a Korean, i needed that extra kick so i def used the extra gochujang. The veggies weren't very korean, and you don't expect to see them in a typical bibimbap. It was more of an Americanized version of bibimbap. It had some chopped up lettuce, some sliced red peppers, spinach, sliced sauteed mushrooms, etc... Yeah it sounds weird since it's not a typical bibimbap toppings, but it still works for a Korean guy who was fiending some Korean flavor in the midtown east area. The bowl also comes with a small miso soup. This was whatever. It tasted like it contained a lot of MSG. It had small cubes of tofu, chopped up seaweed and some dehydrated fish cake thats rehydrated in the broth.One of the chefs behind the counter gave me complimentary kimchi. Again, this is not the best kimchi out there, but I have had worse. I don't think it is homemade; I think they bought it from somewhere else. All in all, for a hungry Korean guy in a need of Korean food, this place isn't bad. It's cheap and I dont have to trek north to the 50s to Korea Palace or south to the 30s to Ktown. Not bad....not bad. I may not become a regular customer here eating the food everyday, but I""ll def come back here again to try the Jjampong and to satiate my bibimbap craving. Normally I would give this place 2 stars because i have had better bibimbap; however i took into consideration location since it is located in the E 40s, and it is geared toward non-Koreans. Therefore,  i bumped it up to 3 stars.",1,,

But lets be honest it is open 24 hours and when you're stumbling home at 3 am in the morning there aren't a lot of  options. The real problem with this place is the Guy who work's there (Is he the owner? If you frequent this place you know who im talking about). He is the older Korean gentelman. There are no prices on items in this store whatso-ever (except signs for the sandwiches and other take out food). So the older Korean man makes up prices on the spot. I am not even kidding, on the spot. I think he bases it on your race, as a white male I feel like I do pretty poorly, not sure how anyone else is priced....",6,1,

121,Jun M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/2/2014,"The food is okay there, but service not so.  I ordered a breakfast omelet with no additions (home fries & toast), and they charged me the platter price of $4.95.  I asked for the manager, whom they didn't want to call and employees that told me that even if you order one thing and you don't want potatoes, the price is the same.   How can that be?  Why should someone have to pay the same price if they don't want potatoes or toast?  The employee changed the price, reflecting the price of an omelet on a wrap or something $3.95, which led me to question again because I am not getting a wrap so they lowered it to $3.45.  It felt hopeless as they continually tried to just charge me for something I don't really have.  I am willing to pay for something if it is the correct price, but if they just make up stuff as they go or have unjust way of pricing that does not make sense, we all should speak up. I also know that they want to speedy up the line for check out and it's much appreciated, but they call the next person too quickly.  Before the previous person even has time to count their change, the cashiers extend their arms for your food container expecting the following person to ram over the person leaving.  Fast service is great, but being a little more considerate of the person before is better.",1,,

As a result, most people never really pay attention to what they are being charged.  I normally don't either - except for today. I had a burger for $7.75 and a soda which the cashier told me cost $2.  That makes $9.75, right? But I was charged $11.25.  So I came back and asked for an explanation.  I asked 2 different cashiers what percent the tax was - neither could answer me.  My cashier said the burger ($7.75) with tax was $8.66.  If you do the math, that tax comes out to 11.7%.  My soda ($2) with the tax was $2.25; that tax comes out to 12.5%.  And so the total with the exorbitant tax was supposed to be $10.91 - still less than the $11.25 that I was charged.  Without me asking, my cashier gave me back 35 cents.  So what did I learn about Cafe Olympia?  That the cash machines probably do not have a consistent tax markup built into the system; that the cashiers are taught to add some amount roughly equivalent to 12% of each sale, and then perhaps the cashiers take a cut of their own by adding a few cents more.  All at my expense!!!  Will I go back?  Take a guess.  I don't like being fooled.  There are many other more honest places to get food.",2,,
