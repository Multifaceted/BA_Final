Updated review","I had an issue with Chase a few months ago that dragged-on for a long time. It was finally resolved; once they were forced into their corner by one of my lawyers. Following that awful experience from last summer, I was dreading having to update my bank information that the monthly mortgage for the place in NY was to be deducted from. I switched banks and immediately updated the account information online. Shockingly, four days after I updated my checking account and home loan info online, I received a call from a Chase rep regarding a change to my account. The lady wanted me to verify that my home loan for the NY property was to be deducted from a ""new"" bank account. At first, I was hesitant because she called me, then wanted me to verify my account information. I told her that she was the one who contacted me, not the other way around, and with the way identity theft works, there's no way I was going to give her any of my info. She then had the nerve to tell me to call their department at a specific phone number to verify the information and that I am the one on the account. I again told her no and reminded her that she was the one calling me to ask for this info. I did my part and changed my bank info online. I didn't need the phone call. Once she realized I was not going to give-in, she decided to cooperate and verify the info pertaining to my account. Although I do not agree with the way they want to verify info, I'm somewhat shocked (in a good way) that they would take the time to verify that the change to my account was my doing and not a potential fraud.",4,2,2

I went to your bank to get funds, was denied since I didn't have an account there you would not convert into cashiers checks.Would give them minus stars if I could!DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE HORRIBLE BANKERS!!Michael",,,
2,Erica J.,"Sparks, NV",0,13,0,1.0,11/19/2018,"I applied for a job at the JP Morgan Chase in Jersey City.  I received a call from a recruiter from their NY offices who scheduled a phone interview with me.  He told me that he was very interested and wanted to get me in for a face-to-face interview.  I followed up with an email and then a phone call and then another email and he never responded to me.  I was very disappointed that he totally ignored my calls and emails after telling me that I would have an interview.  His name was Nick Semon and he was very unprofessional.  I completely lost interest in that company as I was very serious about finding work and not interested in playing games.  If you are serious about finding a good job, do not go to JP Morgan Chase because they will give you the runaround.",,,
3,Jack G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,0,1.0,8/2/2018,"Just spent over an HOUR trying to get this Credit Journey information.  Still do NOT have it!1. It is not clearly stated in any of their emails that you do not need to set up a separate account for this if you already have access to your accounts on line. Wasted time trying to get a separate account!2. When I got into my on-line account, there was NOTHING about Credit Journey!3. Talked to 2 Customer Service people.  The 1st did not know anything about Credit Journey.  He transferred me to the Credit Card Dept.  The Supervisor there did not know even what the 1st web page of on-line banking information looked like!  Then, she said the link should be on that page, and had no idea why it was not on my page.   More wasted time! She gave me a TransUnion phone number.  4. The person there said it was because I had two Chase accounts, and they had to be ""merged"" by Chase.  Have no idea what this means or who to talk to who might know something about this.  More wasted time!Totally frustrated and angry that I wasted an hour of my time to get NOTHING!  Why is Chase offering a product without your employees having any idea how to get it or how to deal with a problem in getting it???  NOT ACCEPTABLE!",,,

7,RUNWAYMODEL M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,15,1.0,9/28/2016,"I pulled out a loan out from my 401k to pay medical bills and for an upcoming surgery. The loan deductions were scheduled to be deducted every week from my paycheck. Upon me being out of work for 2-3 months. My weekly payment deductions were not deducted due to my checks being paid through my health insurance (Leave of Absence) and not my employer. This was my 1st major surgery. Therefore, I was unaware of the circumstances. I received no types of notification via phone, email, text, or mail from JP Morgan that payments were behind, therefore I was unaware. It was until late July processing through early August, my employer switched to a different 401k provider. Accounts were forwarded to this 401k company. The end of August, I received a letter in the mail from the new 401k comapny that my account had been delinquent and payments were behind. This was unbeknown to me and was hard to believe as I hadn't received any notifications and  had been seeing weekly payments come out of my check every week for over year. So I found this impossible to believe. I called the new 401k company and they explained that JP Morgan  forwarded everything over to them. When they received my account, It stated that I am 8 payments behind and owe nearly $800. It needs to be paid IMMEDIATELY with the next month or so or it will effect my credit, it will effect me to pull out future loans, and I will have to pay taxes and penalties. I was lost and confused on how this was possible unless I personally stopped payments with JP Morgan.  Which I can't because it automatically is set up to deduct funds from my paychecks weekly until it's fully paid off. My mind began to ponder there was fraudulent activity occurring with my account through JP Morgan employees. Maybe they were tampering with my account backstage during the company switch over.It was until a co-worker questioned me about my absence when I was out from surgery. I found this was the issue. I had been on medical leave several weeks and this would explain why my payments  were 8 payments behind. I am highly upset. Why wasn't I notified by JP Morgan? I could've been seriously injured, critical condition, in a coma or dead. Why no notification? Yet. They send balance/progress inquiries and information on my account and they send me forms to file my taxes. But sent nothing whatsoever concerning my account being overdue  (my money anyway). This is horrible service. I had no funds to pay this off as I have several bills and medical bills due monthly. Thankfully, God came through to help me pay the balance. However, Something needs to be done about this matter! This is unexceptable!If a class action suit starts, let me.know!",2,1,
8,C C.,"New York, NY",1,7,0,1.0,2/13/2016,"Worst bank ever... I've had multiple issues with this bank, the only reason why I kept my account for years was because the bank is a few steps away from my my house. Today, I tried to use my debit card at the ATM to make a deposit and realized that my card was deactivated and I was never informed. I called the bank and they made me sent documents over e-mail to prove my identity- the client service representative that I spoke with was very rude, they have no respect for people's time. They usually ask you to provide your information over and over. I followed their instructions and they made me wait for a long time inconveniently to be able to speak to someone that could review the information/document I sent. Do not open an account here, the smaller banks are better and more personalized.",1,,
9,Ira S.,"Yucaipa, CA",1,43,1,1.0,5/26/2016,"I have had a credit card with this bank for years. I recently requested a credit limit increase and, despite my excellent financial situation including a paid pff home and non-existant debts, they checked my credit and refused, even though my FICO is in the high 600s. I've also never been late in paying them. Given their poor handling of me as a customer together with their form letters, I will never sue their credit card again. I have many others, and these have all greatly increased my credit limit. Chase basically sent me a form letter and said...we could care less.",1,,
10,Marie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,5,0,1.0,6/21/2016,"If I could give NEGATIVE stars I would.On June 11 I received 5 texts from Chase giving me codes I did not ask for.I immediately called the number on my card and was told it was ""phishing"" and to keep an eye on my account but send the texts to abuse@chase.com. I also got an email and sent that along as well.Well, on June 13 I get an email from Chase telling me my account was overdrawn - this AFTER I alerted them that I did not do any of the transactions. This was an international wire.It is now June 21 and I still do not have the money back in my account - they are still ""investigating"" the claim. How long can this take? They know where they sent the money - to Viet Nam. Mind you, this is all their fault since I TOLD THEM about suspicious activity and they DECIDED to wire my money without my authorization.And so thank you Chase but I have been victimized TWICE once by a thief and then by you and your incompetent employees.",1,,
11,Robert J.,"Carrollton, TX",0,8,0,1.0,1/28/2016,Have a business account with Chase. They deactivated my debit without notice because I haven't received the new cars with a chip yet. I called 3 weeks ago to request the card and I received nothing from Chase. I had to go to a Chase location and wait for 30 minutes while 10 other people who had their cards deactivated wait. I received a new card with new card number. I now have call all my vendors and set up a new card number. Thank you for not communicating with me and wasting my day. - An Extremely Unhappy Soon To Be Former Customer,1,,
12,Qian W.,"Queens, NY",327,350,61,2.0,4/30/2014,"Okay JPM is great. Chase is great. I hope you're not on Yelp for career advice because if that's the case, you probably won't get an offer from anywhere. This isn't about the company.Did you know there's a cafeteria downstairs? Its located in the basement of the building and requires employee card access (or any other firms in the building). Yeah... now I don't even know why I am writing this review. It'll probably useless. Anyways, you'd think that because its tucked away in a special privileged area it'd be somewhat good, like Google's kitchen. But no. And no, its not free.Its a cafeteria designed specifically to look like your college's dining hall. Its where one would get nostalgic about the shit patties flipped by college kids (oh wait, that was me), stale hot entree, and bags of potato chips and fruits around to add some decor. They make sure to charge premium prices for those so you don't take down their decor. When here, I find myself digging deep to the bottom and picking pieces of the beef briskets soaked in water, pretending its actually juicy. Then, I'll fill it with globs of carbs, which makes me feel like the orphan being served dirt in Oliver the musical. I'll then bring my tray over to an old white lady sitting on a stool and getting charged $12. Amex not accepted.But one day, with my diminishing dignity, I know I would eventually become a regular, especially on the rainy and cold winter days.Until then, I hate you 1 CMP cafeteria.edit: fffffffffffffffffffffffffffff I accidentally used my 300th review on this shit place ffffffffffffffffffffff",6,6,4

You make your payments, and it never gets credited your account. Many letters, and calls are always handled by a bunch of morons, who do nothing to correct their own errors. They also have several major lawsuits/class action litigation against them...also were fined by the US Government for fraud. Amazing, they are still in business. The good news, I sold my house and got rid of them forever! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS BANK!",1,,

Updated review","Update 31st July 2014Just got to know, Walter Johnson has been given 8 weeks notice. He needs to get a new job soon, or GTFO. At 60 yr old without any skills (except for f*cking internationals visa status over) wonder what this assw*pe can land. He's been riding the JPMC d1ck for 28 years. Came a year too late, or else I could've been saved. But thankful for my co workers who had to work under this career killer.So, here goes what happened with me at JPMC:1) Aug 11th 2011 - Joined JPMC under previous manager. Joined on the condition of Green Card process being done in time. I had 2 years 2 months left, and wanted to make sure it gets done.2) Was told it'll get started after 1 year (that's JPMC standard gc process requirement). Now keyword here being ""started"". Means the law firm (Fragomen - a failure when it comes to immigration paper processing) in charge of collecting docs will start collecting, they won't actually start your process till they're good n ready. So make sure you clarify their expectations match with yours.3) Getting back to my situation, June 2012, my previous manager said he's leaving. Made sure my GC process was approved ( I was told it goes all the way up to MD for approval ).4) Under new manager - Walter Johnson. (QA/BA manager)5) As my previous manager left, I put in the request to become lead. Denied. Lead QA position moved offshore.6) My work became double, as Walter Johnson didn't know sh*t from spinach and I had to do both my previous managers work & mine.7) Worked my ass off, nights/weekends. 8) Nov 2012 - gave all my docs to the law firm for their processing.9) Dec 2012 - said they have initiated the first phase of Green Card.10) Under the GC sign treaty, the law firm forbirds (get it. FORBIDS) you to ask them for updates. And there's no fuckin website where you can see where the internal docs have reached, so you are left with your thumb up your ass as their process gets done. And keep requesitng them for updates.11) The 1st process requires your company to run an ad in 2 newspapers for 60-90 days advertising the position, then to interview potential candidates. Once finalized, they'll check the results and proceed. 12) This process usually takes 2-3 months. JPMC quoted 5 months. Okay - Dec 2012 + 5 months = April 2013. 13) May 2013, I emailed them requesting an update. they said it's still in process. Now I'm worred, as I only have 5 more months left in the country before I become illegal.14) I keep sending emails detailing my cause of concern, but they fucking firm (Fragomen) completely stops replying. I reach out to my internal HR Team, they do not respond either.15) I suggest this to my dumbass manager - Walter Johson. The fucking idiot dones't do anything. Until I email him, and cc my higher superiors. Then he emails HR immediately. 16) Little did I know, my manager Walter Johnson, and the other manager Rajasekhar Madugula have been planning to fuck me up here.17) As during this time, our team was in transition. The 2nd ED within the span of a year, also left. So there was no accountability. WJ & RM could do as they pleased, and no one had our back.18) They took 9 months to interview all candidates, at which point our NEW managing director told me not only did these 2 fucking idiots take too long (in a time-sensitive situation), but the fucking ad the law firm put in the newspaper was wrong. It eliminated the possibility of anyone but me to get the position. So they'll have to put a more generic ad and redo the process again. Who was responsible for the putting the ad? Walter Johson.19) Out of time, with my H1b visa almost done, I had no option but to leave the country I called home for 12 years. 16) In this time, I was not only repeatedly requesting the JPMC associated law firm for updates, but running around all over to salvage the situation by meeting with lawyers, spending my own hard earned time and money, HR and confiding in my own manager - Walter JOhnson.20) And all the while, he smiled and said yes he's worried for me too, as him and Rajasekhar egotistical corpse-fucker Madugula fucked my case over by taking too long interviewing ppl.21) If only these sons of bitches had told me earlier, I could've transferred over to another company and tried to salvage my situation. 22) I thank Alex Zawadisky who took up my cause and requested for an extension, for 55 days. Basically the time I spent outside USA, was recaptured. That's it. I had to leave the country after that.23) I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for JPMC. Their Immigration department is shit, their law firms they use are useless (non-communicative, and give legal wrong info).The only reason I've put the above is, if even 1 H1b candidate reads this and is saved the shit I had to go through, I will feel I did the right thing by laying the above out in the open.Reach out to me if you have any questions. Thank you.",24,5,4
