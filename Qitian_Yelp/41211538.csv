1,Courtney O.,"San Diego, CA",733,921,1083,4.0,8/5/2018,All of the bars in the area had a huge line so we came to STK because it wasn't crowded at all. We went straight up to the rooftop to grab a drink. The crowd was mixed. Someone was celebrating their 21st and a group of girls walked in that were definitely using fakes. There were also a lot of older people. The bartender was the slowest person in the world. He spent so much time trying to flirt with each person who ordered and definitely couldn't multi task. All of the girls were chatting about how they'd really rather he just focused on the drinks. No tip. Too distracted. We grabbed a seat on the patio and enjoyed the rooftop breeze. It was fun to grab a drink here. Very low key but the cucumber drink was really tasty and enjoyable.,,,1
2,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,2.0,8/5/2018,"I ended up here recently for some drinks, and despite my expectations of 'rooftop' when it comes to NYC (i.e. you're on top of one of the many tall buildings that are in Manhattan), this one is instead on the 4th floor of an old converted building in Meatpacking. As such, it feels nestled into the concrete jungle and provides a bit more of an intimate atmosphere. There's an elevator that takes you up all 4 floors, alongside a staircase that allows you to make it up or down quickly. Once upstairs, there's a decent amount of tables for sitting down, as well as a few seats at the bar, along with a corner that can be roped off for private events. Service is no great shakes here; ordering a beer almost always took 5-10 minutes to make it out, even though popping a bottle cap off is not that time-consuming. I had a cocktail later in the evening that was either not made properly or was just naturally weak, but it was a waste of the nearly $20 it cost. The spread we had was also not that impressive; the best bite was easily the sliders, which were juicy and flavorful. The pigs in a blanket were very generic (possibly just pulled out of a frozen box and heated up), while the mystery-meat fish tacos were a bit funky and had a crispy taco shell that already were softening due to absorbing a ton of moisture from somewhere. The 'steak sandwich' bites were okay - basically akin to a below-average bite of a cheesesteak.The ambiance and venue itself are alright, but the space is really the only highlight. The mediocre food, combined with servers who were inattentive at best, probably makes it a spot that I won't frequent too much.",1,1,1
3,Jennifer N.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,74,266,5.0,11/5/2018,"Friends and I went to STK meatpacking for dinner. The food was next level amazing. We started with a few appetizers and salads to share. Caesar salad, the shrimp cocktail, and the most amazing tuna tar tar ever. For dinner we all had the same, filet mignon and lobster tail.  The food was superb. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. And the lobster was buttery and tender. Perfectly cooked. For desert we all shared a white chocolate salted caramel moose.  My only words are, ""died and went to heaven."" The staff had a tremendous amount of food knowledge, which I commend. My only suggestion that needs improvement is the service. I felt like we had to wave down staff when we needed something. For a price point of roughly 85 dollars a person, the service needs to match the food quality. I love to promote places with amazing cuisine so I still give them 5 stars. Hopefully management reads my review and makes some adjustments. It was also a rainy Monday and the traffic was light. For that reason alone, service should have been equally as  amazing compared to the food.",,,
4,Emily Y.,"New York, NY",284,217,815,3.0,6/7/2018,"Came with a group of friends here for a get together  brunch! We got some drinks to share and also order some food separately. When we first arrived the place at 1pm and it was little empty and just people having brunch We really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and small live booth Dj. However as time passed the music became loader and it was difficult to chat. The food was not bad and pretty tasty. However it feels like it's about 5 dollars too expensive. Some friends ordered truffle fries ($14) and salmon carpaccio. I shared a tuna tar tar with tarp chips.The Tuna tar tar tasted great however the portion they give you more for 16-19 dollars compared to the whopping 22 dollars. If you are into photo opportunities and selfies this place has a bunch of great places for that :)!Honestly this place has a lot of potential but the cost is just not worth it for me (all I bought was one appetizer) Maybe you are paying for the ambiance? I don't know, but I rather go eat somewhere else and come here to hangout.",3,2,3
5,Chastity M.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,54,344,3.0,6/24/2018,"The venue is beautiful for multiple events or occasions. They have from dinning on the first floor , private rooms for special events and a rooftop for social mingling.  The rooftop has cute sections, decor, w/ a nice scenery of the city for selfies and group photos. It's more appropriate at the roof top to vibe out cause the have a live dj-playing music and a area to dance and get lit while downstairs is the total opposite. The dinning scenery is very settle vibes with installed fire places in sections and dim lights for more intimacy. Both areas have the same menu options however the downstairs has some options you can't get at the rooftop. The price point is heavy considering that every dish is separated. I suggested getting one entree per person and sharing appetizers because the appetizers have a good position to share with two or more.  They're do have happy hour on the weekdays as well rooftop I did expect way better service considering the reputation of the restaurant of being luxurious and ""classy"". We had a waiter I believe name of David, hardly checked in with the table and made multiple mistakes on the bill. I could understand if the velocity was high , but mistaking charges that was added to our check than handing us the incorrect check was unprofessional it could've led to mishaps /or no tip do to misunderstandings. I'm classy and bougie but i do not play when my money is involve to a business.",,1,1
6,Colin K.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",131,299,28,1.0,5/12/2018,"Wow...avoid at all costs.  Seriously.  Walking down the street in Chelsea, we saw a sandwich board for a rooftop lounge so we decided to check it out on a beautiful Saturday in May.  In order to get to the rooftop, you have to walk into the restaurant on the first floor, which was deserted (should have been a forewarning).  We got into the dingy, deathtrappy elevator and rode up to the roof and were greeted by a great view of the High Line.Sitting down, we opened up the drink menu and ordered one of their $9 beers.  The menus sad that it was happy hour, but the waitress said it didn't start for another 10 minutes, so we'd either have to wait the 10 minutes or pull the cover off the menu and look at the regular prices.If you look closely at their menu, where it says ""Happy Hour,"" there is an asterisk that quietly obfuscates the fact that the only drinks that are covered are drinks $17 and under (there are drinks over $17?  Really??).  If you take a look at the cocktail menu that directly faces the Happy Hour flyer, you'll realize that there isn't a single cocktail under $17...every single one of their cocktails were priced at $17.50.  Very sneaky.  Not sure how many of these $17 cocktails you have to sell to stay in business, but hopefully its too many so you can stop wasting space in the city and allow a more friendly business into this prime rooftop spot.  I wouldn't come back if I was on fire and they were giving water away for free.",5,,1
7,Katie B.,"Chicago, IL",277,2,0,1.0,7/4/2018,"Worst service ever. They gave my card to another customer, they took it and started spending money at various bars around the city. Bartenders said that sucks and management did nothing saying the have to talk to the owner. Very disappointed in the service here and the service provided by this company. Management was rude and unappreciative if our business. They also refuse to play specific music... because it doesn't fit their crowd... AKA they're racist and won't play music written by African Americans",5,,
8,Marie F.,"Long Island, NY",57,10,5,4.0,10/11/2018,Went for our 3 year wedding anniversary on a Saturday night---loved the food and loved the atmosphere even more. Will definitely be going back! It was pretty loud so I took away one star for that-- but it was sat night after all.,,,
9,Freddie Y.,"Port Washington, NY",1,6,1,2.0,6/17/2018,"The food quality is not great and over priced. The menu needs improvement especially the appetizer. Only go here to drink and hangout on the rooftop, maybe a lil snack but don't do dinner.

10,Aqua Z.,"Utica, NY",107,1,2,1.0,1/1/2018,Great way to start the new year....UNORGANIZED!!!!... Out of all the clubs in nyc. Ive ever been too this was by far the worst experiance.  Although it was a fun time!!! All my friends there.... The staff must have just been hired.  None of them where helpful. Dj sucked.  DRINKS WARTERED DOWN.TWO BARTENDERS. With a capacity of 500 (etstamated )  ppl. When we went to coat check to leave   there was no lined formed   security was pushing ppl. And everyone got the wrong jackets.  There where ppl crying leving with no coat on a night of 10 °degrees   ....unreal. it was a anarchy.   I will never go back.,2,,
11,Flora D.,"Boca Raton, FL",125,27,142,5.0,8/4/2018,"Pleasantly surprised! The food was amazing. We had the mac and cheese, truffle fries and the wagyu beef. It was very pricey but what do you expect from a steakhouse in Manhattan. The wagyu was $36 per ounce. Since we were just there for appetizers and drinks we ordered 3 Oz. Just to taste it. Unbelievably delicious and well worth the price. The cocktails were great and our server was also very attentive. Great atmosphere with a live DJ and nice rooftop casual vibe.",,,
12,Dominic S.,"Larchmont, NY",10,36,19,1.0,6/5/2018,"I rarely if ever post bad reviews, but feel compelled to here. We first came to STK rooftop for drinks a week ago. I wasn't buying so didn't think about the first or second drink. It was quite pleasant to stand next to the bar as the weather was nice. Came back a week later. Got a negroni (it is negroni week, btw), and didn't really pay attention to the fact that it wasn't a full pour. I closed out the tab - that weak negroni and two glasses of white wine - $60. OUCH! Anyway, I then joined my wife and her lovely friend for dinner. The waiter tried to seat us right next to a group of people sitting on a couch. That should have been a warning for us to make our way to the door. We asked and were re-seated in the regular dining area. Then, we opened the menu. My goodness. Nothing, I mean nothing, under $38 and every entree comes a la carte. My wife and I ordered a strip steak to split, the chopped salad, tuna tartar, and sides of their ""award winning"" creamed corn and fries. The waiter told us about their special - $50 off their malbec bottle of wine if you order a steak. My wife was wise enough to ask how much that bottle normally costs. $140!!!!. So, the $50 off special means you are still paying $90 for a bottle of wine. We asked if they could move a centerpiece since the table was so small. That never happened, so we ended up bussing our own tables half the time. There was nothing that stood out before we ate that seemed to indicate it was going to be a bad dinner. But it was. - Our steak, which was a $72 strip was gummy and had thick slabs of fat. The taste had to be masked by a combination of sauces (each of which costs $2). It was hard to cut through. My wife had to get a sharper knife. - the creamed corn was runny and not hot / no flavor- the steak fries were not hot and had no flavor- the chopped salad was lifeless and pretty paltry. The waiter was nice and the service wasn't bad, but he was not really experienced. The prices were WAY out of line. The food was really disappointing.",2,,
13,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1480,4346,3.0,5/28/2017,"Decent good but the service was terrible, and at these prices that shouldn't be the case. After cocktails (I had the green intensity, which was very good), 2 people and I shared:+ little gem caesar salad+ grilled spanish octopus+ bigeye tuna tartare+ market fish + filet medallion with lobster (x 2)+ sweet corn pudding+ asparagus+ jalapeño cheddar grits+ mac & cheese+ sweet potato donuts  Salad and octopus were great, and I enjoyed my fish entree. The best sides were the pudding and grits. Donuts were tasty. Like I said, our waiter was really bad, so I probably wouldn't come back. I've had a better experience in the restaurant downstairs. 3.5 stars.",4,,
14,Tina M.,"Manhattan, NY",43,38,20,5.0,9/15/2018,"I adore this place. The food is really tasty. The ambience is swanky,laid back and chill. The rooftop is nice as well. Can get a bit crowded and of course loud. But I enjoyed it nonetheless.",,,
15,Errol B.,"New York, NY",92,43,5,2.0,9/19/2017,"I've usually had a good time and decent service at STK Midtown, Chicago & DC. This past Sunday's brunch was abysmal to lightly put it. Do not get me wrong, the staff was very nice, from the front security, to the host, bussers, waiter & GM. The rooftop was not busy at all, so my company and I were relieved. Nice table, with great sun and the music was great. I order the STK & Eggs (scrambled with goat cheese), my brother orders the Bacon & Eggs (scrambled, no cheese, no corn chowder, no salad). Seriously, Bacon & Eggs. Easy. So the food comes out in decent timing. The server knows immediately my brothers food was wrong. He immediately takes it back to fix the plate. I didn't get my goat cheese, but I can do without it.They bring his plate out again, the bacon SERIOUSLY WAS AS SLAB OF FAT. Eggs were wrong. Waiter comes over realizes it's wrong. Tries again, not much different, offers us another menu, but that this point, my brother is just going to drink. Waiter places the plate there and says he'll take it off the bill but if we want to ""pick at it, that's fine!"". Huh? It's just a reminder that non-food snobs have a incorrect order in front of us. Brother orders another drink. GM comes over, 25 minutes a bit late, but was so gracious and apologetic. Perhaps this was a bad day, because we've had decent times at STK overall. Check the bonus.**BONUS- We get our bill for $46.64, the suggested 20% tip PRINTED on the bill was $23.98, over FIFTY PERCENT. This wasn't a split bill. I've attached the picture with the 18, 20 & 22% accurate suggestions. Could be computer error, but this level of service for this caliber of restaurant is unacceptable.",8,1,
16,Nitasia D.,"Austin, TX",1,7,0,1.0,4/9/2018,I came here to celebrate my birthday in NYC for the first time.I loved the STK in Miami/LA and assumed the one in NY would be even better. Boy was I wrong... the waiter was VERY rude and did not want to serve us. It was only a party of 5 but he clearly did not want to be at work. My steak was very dry and we barely could get a water refill!! I will never ever come here again and I am so mad I wasted my money & bday night here. STK NYC is the worst location and gives the brand a very bad name.,2,,
17,Phil N.,"Anaheim, CA",21,151,139,4.0,4/20/2018,"The Rooftop was closed, but I did like the small bar/lounge area in the STK restaurant. Live DJ was spinning some Hip Hop. It was noisy. Locals were dressed up and having a good time. The drinks were good. The vibe was good. The prices were... expensive. But, if I'm in the area again I would visit the bar again. Was told not to sit down to eat 'cause it's overpriced. But the bar was cool and would definitely go again.",,,
18,S C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",26,16,0,1.0,8/26/2018,"The rooftop bar is beautiful, the problem is if your going for dinner expect a group of hostess and managers that have no idea how to run a restaurant. We were a party of nine people and were treated so poorly. My recommendation is have drinks on the rooftop bar and enjoy your dinner somewhere else.",,,
19,Ang R.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",0,6,2,2.0,3/25/2018,"Been to various locations so I thought I knew what to expect. Make sure you have reservations especially for Sat evening in the main floor, otherwise; they will not take your name for a table. Not even for a party of two. We where told either bar or upstairs/rooftop. After drinks & appetizer at the bar we headed upstairs for dinner.... shrimp cocktail took 1/2 hr to arrive....steaks came in cold & undercooked. Sirloin was sent back, it was then brought out warmer but still red not medium/well as ordered. Boyfriend just had a few bites and at this point we just wanted our check. Manager & waiter apologize and they discount the shrimp cocktail. We don't mind the cost as long as the food/service is up to par. Ps. Keep your jackets on it was pretty cold.",,,

First impressions were "" it's super nice"" we were seated next to the fire place walls which was nice. Anyways FOOD was okay honestly OVERRATED! I can cook better filet and Brussels sprouts (sprouts were cold btw) and I left my birthday gift there - called stk 4 times they said someone would get back to me and nothing! I went out of my way to go downtown to get it and they said it wasn't there ... HOW ? Either someone is lieing or one of their employees have sticky fingers! Unprofessional for never getting back to me when I called also! Never going there again!",1,,
22,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,1.0,11/16/2017,"Not a single clue how this place is still open.  We made a reservation for dinner with a decent sized crew and we looked forward to sitting on the roof.  We were told we couldnt sit until everyone was there.  Fine, fair enough.  Lets just saddle up to the bar and spend a couple hundred extra dollars while we wait to sit and spend another grand...make sense to them.  Annoying to us.  Top that little diddy with the fact that this place smelled like 50 frat dudes had just thrown up in the lobby.  Also, it was empty and we were made to wait.  The waiter, God bless him, he was the only good part of our experience.  The food was not good.  The bill was outrageous and when we finally sat, we were ready to leave.",2,1,1
23,Jason S.,"New York, NY",298,28,12,1.0,9/16/2017,"First off let me start off by saying we had a reservation for two at 6:30pm on a Saturday night for the downstairs restaurant.And that's where story begins.....As we walked into the main restaurant, the smell of disgusting molded cheese hits us right in the face...That should of been my first sign to walk out... We arrived at 6:15pm and as we walked up to the host stand to check in the two male hosts that we're there didn't have their shit together and the smell grew worse.Finally one of the hosts asked us, can I help you and we checked in. I asked what is that horrible smell of molded cheese is there a way we can eat upstairs.  And he says to us, its two different restaurants and if you go upstairs you have to cancel down here first. And there is no guarantee there is availability upstairs. So my girlfriend said, well its 6:18pm its not 6:30pm so we still have time to come back down.He didn't look happy..So we head upstairs and see the host and I said what is that Horrible Smell downstairs and he says I have no idea, I'm used to horrible smells...Second sign we should of walked out...He sits us and we wait for the waitress to come to our table.The waitress comes to our table and she tells us the specials and we asked if there is anyway possible if we can get one of the items that are downstairs (I.E. Broccoli) she says unfortunately, No, because its not an item we stock up here... BTW, who doesn't stock broccoli at a steak place.... WTF???Third sign we should of walked out...  But because I was hungry,  I let it go...So we placed our order:1. ) Grilled watermelon salad  (APP)2. ) One 16 oz steak (Medium Rare) that we we're going to split.3.) Asparagus4.) Mushrooms (Ordered this since there was no BroccoliThe Watermelon App comes out and its just Ok...Now when your at a decent restaurant especially steak houses they ALWAYS offer you some type of bread of some sort...No bread ever came out...  But a couple two tables down from us had gotten bread...So I call the waitress back over and said Hi, can we get some bread and she says, yeah we don't have any bread up here. I said well that couple got bread... She says, yeah I don't know how they got that, sorry...Fourth sign we should of walked out...So after 25 minutes the steak and veggies finally arrives.. And the steak is OVER COOKED!!!!FML!!!!We call the waitress back over and said this is completely over cooked and she says yes it is, let me fix that for you. And I say how long will that be? Because our sides are going to get cold.She says let me find out...She comes back to the table and says, its gonna be ANOTHER 10 minutes for the steak to be cooked. Fifth sign and NOW IM FURIOUS.....I said that's it, I had enough where is the manager...The female manager comes over and says what can I help you with? I said well we waited a long time for our food and now our steak came out over cooked and now we're stuck eating cold veggies. She says, well its gonna take another 10 minutes for the steak to be cooked. I said that is unacceptable... She says well there is nothing I can do... What can I do to make this a better experience?I said at this point nothing, because we are both starving and we don't really want to wait any longer...She says Im sorry, there is nothing I can do we are really busy...  Now you would think she would of said I will make sure they cook your ASAP. She didn't...So I just said you know what just bring the check for what is here...SHE CHARGED US FOR SPARKLING WATER, WATERMELON SALAD, COLD ASPARAGUS' AND COLD MUSHROOMS...So much for doing the right thing... Total BS!!!!P.S. If anyone from STK's media relations department reads this, here is a tip...Know who your hiring... Because if you read all the other BAD REVIEWS on Yelp about your restaurant that should be your FIRST CLUE....",7,,
24,Dan-Ah K.,"Manhattan, NY",524,98,663,4.0,6/13/2016,"Went spontaneously for a friend's 22nd birthday and immediately noticed the older crowd - mostly early 30s to 40s. Though we felt out of place we just decided to stay there. We put our name down for a table and were seated after about an hour, when she said our table would be ready in 25-30 min. (It almost felt as if she forgot to seat us). In the meantime, we enjoyed cocktails ($17)  and glasses of wine ($13-14) which were good, but pricey for college students. When we were seated, we ordered the seared tuna, truffle fries, and a half dozen oysters. I'm not a big fan of oysters, so I didn't enjoy those, but the tuna and fries were excellent! The fries were so good that we ordered another along with a steak. The steak was also very juicy and good except it was so windy that day that it got cold quickly. Overall, we made it work because it was my friend's birthday, but the rooftop is meant for older, working professionals. Maybe next time we will try the actual restaurant downstairs.",6,1,1
25,Jennifer C.,"Garfield, NJ",1,7,2,1.0,4/23/2018,Came here yesterday with a group of friends for drinks and appetizers. Drinks are way overpriced and they tasted terrible. We had to send back a drink because it was poorly made. Almost 20 for a drink I expect the best. The appetizers were good but everything took forever to arrive including the drinks. There was only one waitress for the whole rooftop area. How can you only have one person and one bus boy. For the prices charged you should be treating people like royalty. Never again! Checked this off my list.,1,,

30,Tom M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",8,50,2,2.0,7/17/2017,"This was the worst steakhouse experience we've ever had. The restaurant came as a suggestion by American Express and our friends in the city said it's a great rooftop restaurant. We arrive promptly for our dinner reservation, and the 3 young girls at the hostess counter were standing around and giving us no indication when we'd be seated after I gave them the last name. After 10 minutes of standing there not knowing what's going on, I have to ask if we're going to be seated and they then asked for our name again so they could pull up the reservation. They then scramble around and finally seat us. Not the best way to start dinner. The view was amazing and we could definitely tell why this place is popular. However, we couldn't hear one another speak at our table due to a speaker that was 10 feet behind us and blasting dance music for the entire restaurant. They have a very nice audio set up with speakers placed around the restaurant, but were not using them for some reason. Instead it was a small speaker set on the ground that looked to be hooked up to an iPod and was billowing loud dance music. Don't get me wrong, it'd be fun and the music was good if it were a day party and everyone was standing around. Not when it's the dinner hour and you are wanting to catch up with old friends over dinner. After asking our server if the speaker can be turned in another direction or turned down, she said she'd ask Management. 15 minutes go by and nothing has changed so I go to the hostess where I was again ignored until I asked to be helped. She had an absolutely disgusted look on her face when I asked for help and went over to the speaker and turned it away from us. She threw her hands up with frustration, rolled her eyes at us and went back over to the hostess table. We then got our food, which I would say was just okay. Our steaks were luke warm at best, but at least our sides were nice and hot. $750 later, we paid our bill and were leaving. As we walked by the girl at the hostess counter again (I think she may have actually been the manager) we stand there waiting for the elevator and she never once looked up at us or said ""hey, thanks for coming in."" Nothing. This place is managed by young, entitled twits, and the only reason for not getting 1 star is the wine and good sides.",3,,
31,Rene A.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",31,14,21,4.0,8/8/2017,"Came by for my birthday because I had great experiences before & I knew I'd be happy with the menu choices. Sadly, the mac n cheese was my downfall. It was too wet. Therefore making me sick. There was also a light fixture that missed falling on my head by 5 inches. Not one staff member check to see if we were ok. My only other complaint that was my date was a rather big guy ( size of a pro footballer ) and the seat we were given I couldn't even get out of without disrupting the other diners. This is important. Very important. Please note we were sitting on the roof. Otherwise everything was fine. Still go back just making sure I let them know where I would like to sit & a well done mac n cheese.",1,,
32,Diana R.,"Clifton, NJ",31,147,173,3.0,8/28/2017,Came with a group of 8 ladies it was just ok I was expecting more... the octopus was a bit rubbery but it took awhile to even get a servers  attention I just ate it since we were starving...we ordered the seafood starter for 4-5 the oysters needed to be cleaned out better those were the ones no one wanted but the rest was good. The steaks were great according to the 2 girls that had them but the seafood was disappointing for the price. Service with the host...jeez I wish these people knew how to smile or at least welcome people... overall it was just ok would I come back probably only for a drink. Ambiance is nice but there was a table of fully grown late 40 somethings that were a mess they kept putting their feet on top of the table to show us his redbottoms like it was supposed to impress us then he got even more drunk and tried to fake hump my friend....NO ONE DID ANYTHING.

33,Susie W.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",222,109,90,2.0,6/28/2017,"came here for a friends birthday celebration. we did not know that they were upstairs on the rooftop bar. we asked the hostesss about possible seatings and reservation for a party of 6, basically got ignored for over 5 minutes until I had to re-address the issue. by then we had already received a text from our friends and found ourselves on the rooftop. i mean i get it, its a steak house in the middle of the meatpackings district, but cmon, you are blowing money on mediocre steaks and shitty service? no thank you. will not return. will spread the word to friends. this is a horrible experience. the only good part was that we were with friends. but other than that, oh man, do not come!we ordered tomahawk steak to share... idk. it just had a funny smell to it compare to the t-bone for two people. the sides were okay. fries were def not worth the money. the only thing that i enjoyed was the corn pudding. but cmon. its corn. and its pudding. you cant make it wrong. i wish i had a better experience. this place really needs some new management. and... wayyy too loud. literally deaf by the end of dinner.",1,1,1

35,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,3.0,9/26/2016,"Things that were great about STK Rooftop:- Really great playlist on a Saturday night - a nice mix of dancey top 40 songs that moved into slower jams later in the night- Great view of the sunset over the Hudson river- The rooftop has a very young vibe where people come to see and be seen, so if that's your thing, this is greatThings that were not as great about STK Rooftop:- The rooftop could have really used some heat lamps on a chilly summer-into-fall night- The round tables were pretty small for five people- The food was just ok, I got an expensive 6 oz steak which could have used a thicker crust, and the seared tuna was bland",4,,2
36,Elio V.,"Red Bank, NJ",994,70,121,1.0,3/24/2017,"I've been coming to STK downtown since they had first opened their doors in the Meatpacking District in New York City ! I've been to all STK locations around the United States and still STK downtown has been one of my favorite location of the One Group! My second favorite location is STK Miami.This evening my entire opinion of STK has completely changed. I had ignored all the telling signs throughout the years because I was a big fan of their food . Regardless , they were never known for their service. They were known for their trendy atmosphere and fantastic food . That trendy atmosphere that once graced STK downtown has become stale. Their food can't carry for their waitstaff short comings ! Every year on the day I was born , which is typically called your birthday. For the past 5 years, I would celebrate my birthday at STK . I would have a wonderful dinner with my party followed by real conversation that will end with a candle & dessert! No singing !!! That is just too embarrassing ! Every year, my party would make a reservations at STK. They will always instruct the reservationist that they would like a candle with desserts because they are celebrating a birthday and to keep it quietly since it's a surprise .Every year, STK would provide a candle in my dessert! That candle had symbolized the day I was born, my birthday!  Candle marked the day for me ! Last year , my mother had pass away . Thus , I mourned for the entire year which I did not celebrate my birthday nor any holiday . It's already hard enough missing the one person you would like to be there , but can't be their physically only in spirit.My party and I waited for the desserts to be brought out!  We waited about 22 minutes for STK waiter to bring out my dessert. Once they did , we realized something was missing !!! There was  no candle on the desert to mark my birthday!!' I was terribly upset and very disappointed that I personally brought it to the managers attention! It was just another ordinary dinner!!!  How  is this different than any other dinner ? This is my birthday dinner!  It need to be different,  we need to mark the occasion !! We were than told by the manager , he will be right back ! A woman then approached the table & stated to us that unfortunately they do not take reservations in house so they do not know who we spoke to at STK reservations off site. Than  they took off my $12 dessert! Her attitude was very nonchalant , like oh well . Listen I'm not looking for a free meal people ! I'm the CEO for a major global beauty brand. Every year I share my birthday with my family, friends at STK . STK & The One Group robbed me of my birthday celebrations this year 2017 ! They couldn't even acknowledge their responsibility for screwing things up. Than they had the audacity to push it back on us.. How stupid you think my party is ? We do this every single year! My party knows how important my birthday is especially not being able to celebrate it last year! Listen I understand things happen in life!  I get it, but I'm a paying customer requesting a service , and yet I did not receive said services! I feel robbed! Instead of enjoying my birthday evening I am forced to write reviews on a business that did not acknowledge or take any accountability on their mistake . A simply I'm sorry would of been suffice , but instead they tried to pass fault to a third party that is employed by STK and the One Group.  Also , what happen to coat check in this establishment ? Where do you expect me to put my Dsquared fur coat ? It weights a ton , its white plus an inconvenience for me",7,12,
37,Leney P.,"New York, NY",1,151,0,3.0,1/3/2018,"Three stars for the host who redeemed the experience - he was able to get us a table during a BUSY rush during Golden Hour and really worked to accommodate us. Kudos to him. Our waited would disappear for long periods of time, and ignore us. The couple dining next to us ordered two bottles of champagne, so I suppose they ""deserved"" more attention. The truffle fries are bleh. They're big thick rectangles that are not crispy enough and the truffle flavor was negligible. The lobster mac n cheese was actually incredibly and surprisingly good and a pretty big portion. The kale salad here is amazing and I would come back for it. Yes, that's how good it was. I know how insane that sounds. All in all, too snotty and pricey for me. Great for people watching and the kale salad. Also - the stairs and elevator up to here smell like pee. Absolutely disgusting.",,,
38,Phil S.,"Bergen County, NJ",15,121,35,4.0,8/10/2016,"Overall **** I came in without the highest expectations as I had been to the Midtown location which I don't recall being memorable. This spot far exceeded with its great space and food, would defiantly return.Setting ***** As others have mentioned, the views are stunning especially around sundown. There was a very busy bar scene, tables filled with families and bridge and tunnel people. The crowd fit my demo well, 40+.Service *** Our party of four was greeted warmly and sat promptly by the hostess. Something was off with our waiter, very nice but he seemed overwhelmed and disappeared for long stretches. We had to catch a train (aforementioned bridge and tunnel people) and it took myself, the hostess and a manager to find our waiter on the opposite side of the restaurant.Food ***** As with most steakhouses the menu is limited and I believe there was only one fish item on it but hey we are here for steak. We started with very good appetizers of Crispy Rock Shrimp and Tuna Tartare over Avocado with Root Chips. Our wives both ordered the Halibut special and was described as very good. I ordered the Strip and a table mate ordered the Bone In Filet, both ordered Medium. These steaks while slightly under seasoned for my taste were everything I could hope for, perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. Excellent sides of Mac & Cheese and Truffle Fries complimented the steaks well.Value *** Our drinks hovered around $14, appetizers $19, fish special $40, bone in filet $59, the strip $47 and the sides were $13. All in $415 before tip, gulp, but it is a NYC Steakhouse and unfortunately that is the norm. I have to drop a note about the wine list though, it is like a big ""FU"" as it is truly outrageously priced! We did not order anything from it.",3,,

40,Sherry F.,"Manhattan, NY",9,115,49,2.0,2/23/2017,"Had a double date here last fall. The rooftop is spectacular, can't beat the views! The decor & ambience is beautiful. Perfect during sunset, very romantic setting. We had truffle fries, lobster roll, lobster mac n cheese, a few sushi rolls & lots of wine & cocktails. Overall the food is just ok, not the best. But we came here for the ambience & the views. The music was playing louder & louder as it got darker after sunset. Too loud for dinner in my opinion.Also, the waiter had our entire table move because the table behind us was complaining about the sunset glare. So the waiter told us to get up so he can move the umbrella to cover the glare for them. WTF! I was pissed. We were in the middle of dinner. Very rude! Terrible service!The hostess were very friendly but the waiters are a bit snobby. This place is ok, a bit pretentious for my taste. Feels more like an LA scene than NY. Come here during warm weather for a drink or two & enjoy the sunset and the rooftop views. Skip dinner. Food is ok & terrible service!",2,,1
41,Shane L.,"Austin, TX",629,67,120,3.0,9/14/2016,"This was definitely a great swanky place in the up and coming, trendy, meatpacking district. The ambiance was great, rooftop, nice music all night (mix of top 40 and some oldies), and a great crowd. Young, professional, attractive crowd. We had a drink while we waited to be seated and the venue was great. Appetizers: Tuna Tartare & Grilled Octopus - Both appetizers were very average. I wasn't wow'd by any of the dishes to be honest. I have had some great grilled octopus with amazing flavors (Casa Apicii - NYC) so STK didn't really bring the wow factor. Entree: As this is a steak house I ordered the Filet 10 oz and it was cooked to perfection. Taste was amazing. I had some chimichurri on the side, but it definitely wasn't needed for the steak (sign of a great steak). Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese - this was a special for the night and it was AMAZING. I will always order Lobster Mac & Cheese when available! Parmesan Truffle Fries - Though the smell of these fries and description seemed amazing, I think they definitely fell short. They were good but not GREAT by any means. Grilled Asparagus - cooked well and was delicious. You definitely pay for the ambiance, location, and rooftop. I would go again if I was invited, but wouldn't initiate the invite.",,,
42,Evan B.,"Manhattan, NY",161,5,0,1.0,6/26/2017,"This review solely reflects the attitude of the staff and how they treated my family in our most recent trip. With yesterday being the Pride Parade, members of my family were late to the restaurant as was everyone else who had reservations. The hostess would not seat us at our table until our whole party was present. At that time we waited 30 mins before I asked again. I would also like to point out that the restaurant can seat 100+ and that there was literally 4 other people there at the time. After asking for the manager and telling him that we  would like to sit at our table and order drinks and an appetizer he said that""we can't do that because our chefs like everything to be ordered at once"" to which I replied there is literally  o one here that is bullshit. He obviously caved and seated us, but seated is right by the kitchen doors in the back of the restaurant (again keep in mind there is still no one there). The food was fine and the waiter was nice despite making an honest mistake. However, another family at the table next to ours was treated the same way as we were. They would not be seated until there whole party was there while the restaurant was still pretty empty. The female bathrooms were also extremely disgusting with trash all over floors and no toilet paper in any of the stalls. The floors were extremely sticky in both the hallways and the main floor and even in the ""lounge area"". It seems as though the staff didn't clean up from the night before and it was easily visible.After all of this I spoke to the manager again and explained all of our issues with him and said that everything could easily have been avoided and fixed. And still the place was less than half full. I only gave this review 1 star simply because the waiter was nice despite his mistake.I will never go back to this location and would tell everyone else to do the same as well. If that is how a restuant treat customers than you're better off taking your money somewhere else.",4,,1
43,Renee B.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",144,13,3,1.0,7/17/2017,"It was definitely not worth the money. $98 for a porterhouse for two and it was even worth it. The size and the quality of meat was very disappointing. I would never spend another dime especially after finding out my boyfriend told them it was my birthday and they nothing special for him, I was unaware of it at the time but I guess he told them three times. The staff treated us like we were an inconvenience; treated as stereotypes. Guess me and my boyfriend didn't look like the people to tip properly so maybe that's why the service was below average. Waste of time and money. So many other great steaks house that are worth it in the city and I will def let my friends and family know to avoid this place.",2,,

Had one cocktail and wine...both were good. There are a range of price options for wine. We went with an $80 bottle that I thought was very good. Service was great. Music is a tad loud (I wouldn't have mentioned it but I see it concerns some people) and it's a bit over priced but overall we had a great experience.",,,2

I had the burger and it was average. My friends got the porter house and the portion was pretty small. The meat is not very juicy and lacks flavor. You can get much better steak for the same price elsewhere (Rocco's). This is coming from someone that's has tried a lot of steak houses.

I was so disgusted, i could'nt even eat anymore.  We were so afraid we thought the mouse was going to run across our feet.  We told the manager who gave us free shots on the house but id rather a free bill because that was just nasty.  I've lived in New York my entire life, 43 years and i've never seen a mouse in a restaurant while out eating.  Horrible experience....",,,

I thought our tickets were for the rooftop and was then informed that they were for the basement, which had a long line that was few doors down from where we were. So we get to that line only to realize that these frauds oversold tickets and were no longer letting people in due to high capacity. Obviously there was no refund so we were just screwed.

We ordered the blue iceberg salad, Parmesan truffle fries, and a medium sirloin steak. The salad came as the actual iceberg lettuce cut in half. It was really good! The Parmesan truffle fries were hot and crispy and also really good! The disappoint was the steak--which is why we came to a steakhouse. We asked for medium rare and got a medium to medium well steak. It was super salty also. Glad we got the STK sauce with the steak because it helped with the chewiness and the fries (which are thick cuts of potatoes) helped balance the saltiness. Our waiter had so much knowledge about wine which was really nice. He helped us choose which wines would pair nicely with different cuts of steak while keeping in mine our preferences. I don't think it's the BEST steakhouse but worth going with a visitor in town or for a date for the ambiance/aesthetic.",,,1

We asked our waiter, (who was sweet) Ryan, twice about our food, and he said that they are still working on it.

The table we were sitting at seemed like a VIP table (which was cool) However ALL the tables seemed pretty close to each other so there seemed like alot of foot traffic but we didnt mind as much... Staff were super friendly & courteous. Our waiter was far enough to not stand over us but close enough that we can get her attention at any time we needed her.Its definitely an overpriced restaurant (which we knew before making a reservation) but you definitely do not get your money's worth !!!!!Our waiter had suggested a special appetizer which we agreed to & it was literally a thin slab of what seemed like pepperoni with some yellow & red peppers. I had ordered what was on special for the day which was a fish, that came with some mussels, rice & steamed spinach. I had ordered an extra side of steamed spinach cause everything seemed so small. My extra side order seemed very soggy. After a few bites, i could not fathom to finish it. The drinks are wayyyyy too overpriced for the size of the glass so we ended up ordering some corona beers.To be clear, money is not the issue! I would just prefer to pay for what i get, or at least half of it & that did not seem like the case at all. Probably wont be back at all, but i guess it was a good experience.",,,

62,Jonathan Z.,"New York, NY",19,20,1,2.0,2/17/2017,"We arrived earlier than our reservation, so we sat at the bar on the main level and had some amazing cocktails and had a great conversation with our bartender. She was exceptionally knowledgeable about drinks, edit them slightly to our taste, and was just all-around fun. We go upstairs to the rooftop for dinner and that's where things start to go wrong. I order The Château Briand which is steak and lobster and I'm told that it also comes with bone marrow and caviar. The busser  was very nice but did not pay close attention, he refilled my half full glass of sparkling water with flat, and while clearing our plates whipped a plate around quickly causing a fork to go flying and hit me. After an hour after ordering, I noticed other tables that were seated/ordered after us are already getting their food. There are several open tables, so it's not like they were exceptionally busy, but I'm getting more annoyed after an hour we still don't have our food. I eventually resigned that they had forgotten about us and get up to leave when the server comes rushing over. I tell her it's been over an hour since we ordered, she says to give her one minute and rushes to the back. A minute later she comes out with our food,  however it is stone cold; she had simply forgotten about us. I'm annoyed, however the food does look good so we continue to eat when I noticed that I don't have caviar. I asked the server where the caviar is and she says oh it's put on top of the lobster. This peaks my interest as that's not what she's told me when I was ordering and caviar is raw fish eggs so it should not have been cooked. I go to the front  desk and ask them to confirm what the special is and they say no there's no caviar, but crushed/mashed fish foam(?) of some type on top of the lobster. Now this would be fine if that's what they told me the meal included, however I was paying over $160 for my meal alone and I was expecting caviar. By the end, I'm just thoroughly disappointed and as were leaving the super sweet women at the front ask us how everything went; they can tell from my face how things went. They immediately ask what's wrong and I tell them and they try and make it right by offering us free drinks, however by this point I just wanted to leave. It was interesting to me that they even commented that they thought we were ""a sure thing"" for a good night because we came in in such high spirits; we really were having such a great night and it's sad that this really let me down. The failure here  really did begin and end with the service.",4,2,

We had to flag him down.  He seemed out of it and was completely loud and crazy. Actually, I'm going to go with drunk, based on the fact him and the ""manager"" were passing out horrible free shots and taking shots with customers. We constantly had to keep asking for water refill. When our food was delivered, one of the Steaks was not cooked correctly. After finally flagging down help, we were able to send it back to the kitchen. It was getting cold, at that point. They obviously just threw it on the grill again and burnt the crap out of it, than redelivered it. Ridiculous and not edible. They got really annoyed at us asking for the correction. The food was definitely not up to par, and service was horrible. The staff seemed to enjoy partying on the job more than pleasing their guests. I was so disappointed with this dinner, which is a bummer, we had friends visiting from out of town. Grow up staff, you have one job to do.",,,
67,Nick M.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,1,0,3.0,6/25/2017,"The food was very delicious! The seafood platter was full of a great combination of shell fish. The mac and cheese was very well baked.The asparagus is highly recommended. However, I was disappointed with the service. The hostess and waiter were very friendly but, we made reservations at 9, showed up around 8:50, and still were not seated until 9:30. After being seated we waited at least 10 minutes for sparkling water. They ran out of the Rose Sangria which was understandable but disappointing. The waiter was not always present. When we were ready to leave grabbing his attention was nearly impossible. We asked another waiter wandering around to close our bill.Food was delicious but the service definitely has room for improvement. Overall good restaurant at most.",,,
68,Pris M.,"Arden, NC",0,3,1,3.0,6/24/2017,"After reading the reviews we decided to try this place because my friends wanted meat, the food was excellent, specially the corn pudding (my favorite!!), the place is stunning, the decor, the fireplace, i looved the flower arrangements.... BUT our server was kinf od rude, i dont know if it was because he was tired, we were there kind of late, but i did not care for his attitude, thats why im giving this place only three stars, id say give the place a try, maybe you'll get a different server",,,
69,Theresa O.,"Central West End, Saint Louis, MO",0,6,0,1.0,6/5/2016,"I would give it 0 stars if possible. This restaurant does not honor its reservations and has rude staff (Kelly was awful!). Additionally, it had an over 40's crowd and mainly bridge and tunnel people. Not what you want for a night out in Meatpacking. We had a reservation for dinner for a bachelorette party and despite confirming the reservation the day before, the restaurant did not have room for us and instead seated us at two separate tables with no umbrella to cover us from the rain. The assistant manager did try to help but the hostess Kelly was beyond rude. Not only did she roll her eyes constantly and give me her back after refusing to talk to me but she then proceeded to go around to the adjoining tables and talk badly about our party. I have never been disrespected like that before in a restaurant, especially an ""upscale"" steakhouse in Manhattan. Food was ok but not worth the stress with the staff.",1,1,1
70,Nicole G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,5/11/2018,"I used to love this place and go to it all the time. Tonight I had the worst experience ever. I was with my brother and sister, which I hadn't seen in over a year and a guy came over to bother my sister and things went south. My brother tried to sit back on his spot and the guy wouldn't let him until he stood up and hit my brother on the chest. At that moment I got in the way and the guy pushed me and the sad thing is that the restaurant didn't do anything. They just separated him from us and told him to go back to his group and didn't kick him out. Afterwards, we let it go and kept being together and enjoying our little time we had together because none of use live in the same city. When we were closing the tab the guy was leaving and he picked up a beer bottle and threw it at my brother and sister. I went after him and the bouncers and GM stopped me as I was the one that did something wrong. As always, men get away with these things. When I tried to talk to the guy after it happened the restaurant protected him as if he had not done anything. Unfortunately, it seemed that the restaurant preferred to keep a disrespectful customer to a customer that was harassed by someone.",,,
71,My B.,"New York, NY",2,2,0,3.0,10/14/2017,"The rooftop is very nice with a great DJ but the African American server Asha with the long weave is HORRIBLE, DISRESPECTFUL and UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  We were directed to her to order drinks and she kept claiming that she was too busy to assist us and directed me to the bar. After ordering at the bar, I asked the bartender to pass the drinks (5 Patron shots and 5 Strawberry Cobbler Martinis) through the window to the area we were sitting in so I didn't have to walk through the crowd with 10 drinks.  I informed Asha that I ordered at the bar and the drinks were coming through the window. Again, she claimed she was too busy to help me. I let her know all she needed to do was pass my drinks to me from the window. I mean seriously...are you that freaking busy that you can't even pass along drinks for 1 minute that had already been paid for.  And while I was at the bar, my friends noticed that Asha was wasn't too busy to help patrons who sat down after us but never came to the table to ask if they would like anything. I eventually had to ask for a manager because she also gave our shots away and we had to get them replaced.  The manager was very accommodating (paid for our next round) and gave us our own personal server, the Fabulous Gabriella, and we ended up having a wonderful time despite the blatantly disrespectful Asha who was discriminatory towards the African American patrons.  So I would have given them 4 stars but Asha's BS unprofessionalism demoted the Service 1 Star.",,,
72,Michael M.,"New York, NY",588,20,16,1.0,10/5/2016,All I have to say is wow. We asked for a manager multiple times and they never arrived... the waiter has maybe worked at KFC at best bc he didn't understand that we asked to course our meal. Everything arrived on top of other courses and when it's $400 for 2 people this should not be the case. Don't come here for anything other than drinks. It's cattle call and they hire anyone off the street. They were AWFUL do not dine here. Food was great but soured by service. This is a NO DINE ZONE! Do not walk RUN!,,,

74,Stella R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,162,21,5.0,5/12/2016,"Went last night a little trepidatiously as I avoid Meatpacking sceney places- but was pleasantly surprised.The gorgeous Spring evening weather helped, but the rooftop is stunning. The music, the ambience, the Hudson with the sun setting. Really nice.We had reservations but were directed to the bar, where we couldn't get anyone's attention.  I asked the Hostess to seat us as soon possible as I had a ankle injury and thankfully she was really sweet about it and got us a table right away.  Our waiter was similarly really nice and just the right amount of attentive. The cocktails are delicious (the Green Ecstacy... yum) and the food was ok- the tuna tartare and sliders were good, the rest ok. But we still walked out really happy.NB: there is an elevator to the Rooftop through the restaurant entrance.",,,1
75,Holden C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,13,1,5.0,10/3/2017,"The place:it was really beautiful and the lighting and the views were really good, the designs and the bar too. It was romantic, chill, good music and semi-professional (by semi-professional I mean that if I go with my friends I would feel good if we want to hangout, if I go to a professional meeting it would also be a good choice, good place, mood and music overall).The only thing to improve would be that the windows were dirty, they should clean them because in our pictures our friends wanted to know about the place and it looks bad for u guys.The food:Was perfect, it tasted really well and they had a nice drinks list, wines also and very diverse sides and appetizers. The smashed potatoes was excellent. Again, everything about the food and the drinks were perfect. The dessert was really good too.The service: was really good, the security at the front, the host and the bartender. Kimberly was the name of the waitress, she recommended some really good dishes and the dessert that she recommended was exactly what we were looking for, she was really patient since it was our first time and the water was always filled up. The only thing that I would complain is that they took kinda long to bring the dessert, but it's fine.The only negative thing would be the price, I feel like it was kinda overpriced but it was totally worth it, it's the regular Manhattan price.Definitely we would come again. Thanks for the service guys.",,,
76,Dennis G.,"Mount Kisco, NY",21,6,0,5.0,8/9/2016,"This was one of the best evenings I have had in NYC. The weather was perfect! (75 or so) We went around 8pm, so got to see the sunset over New Jersey. Started with the Lil' Burgers, which were delicious. We did Striped Bass and Porter House for dinner, with the delicious corn casserole. All of it was cooked to perfection, and the house steak sauce was very tasty. Had a few drinks as the relaxing vibe was amply supported by a talented DJ. Having eating both downstairs, and upstairs, I will surely return.",,,
77,Cindy U.,"Manhattan, NY",37,57,211,1.0,1/3/2017,What a crappy New Years Eve. My actual bday. Paid for the Rooftop tickets. What crap. Food was barely passed around. The so called DJ was HORRIBLE. The music in the coat check room was much better than the crap she was playing in the Rooftop. Even after telling her it was my bday and requested a song. Nothing changed. Zero stars. What crap,,,1
78,Valentina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",141,33,1,3.0,9/29/2017,"Food and drinks were good. Waiter was meh, bussers were so much nicer. There was a mouse running around through most of our dinner, under my table and under the tables next to us. Employees acted as if this was the norm. Best part is I first noticed it run out when I was taking a picture of my friend and it appeared in the frame. I've eaten in the indoor area downstairs and the service is way better compared to the rooftop. The rooftop is mediocre, there are plenty of other spots to go to in this area and I'm sure most of these won't have a mouse running around with employees who think it's ok and don't bat an eye!",,,
79,Emily S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",53,5,3,1.0,2/5/2017,"Went here and after during happy hour and met a few younger people there? Weren't even 21! With drinks in their hands? Said someone got them in cause he knew the bouncer at the door.... doesn't seem legit to me. Wasn't comfortable - Especially if most bars have ""under covers"" walking around the place. Sorry Mad River, you've lost a customer!",,,
80,Nathalie G.,"Valley Stream, NY",61,1,0,3.0,5/20/2017,"My friend and I made reservations for last night. As it was my first time there, I was very excited to try their food and check the atmosphere. I walked in and was greeted warmly by the hostess who already knew where I was to be seated. My waiter, Gabriel, came within minutes of me seated and took our order. He offered his drink recommendation as I'm always undecided. The Strawberry Cobbler was delicious-not too strong, it was smooth and fruity. We started off with the crab cake. Also, delicious. One of my favorite appetizers I'm always eager to try, theirs definitely took the top spot. My friend had the 6 oz filet mignon medium well and I had the market fish (unfortunately I can not recall the fish- all I remember is filet) with beans and a side of lobster mac&cheese. Everything was amazing. We ate everything with sadly no room for dessert. However, later in the night, my stomach began to feel a little uneasy. I hadn't eaten anything before so I can surely say that my sudden sickness came from the food. The majority of my meal contents soon ended more in the toilet bowl. Which entree however, I can't say for sure. After a can of ginger ale and bottle of water I retired to bed. The rooftop had a good atmosphere and the waiter and drinks were amazing. I just wished that my sickness didn't spoil the night.",1,,
81,Lolita L.,"Brooklyn, NY",371,212,97,4.0,12/14/2016,I came here with my boyfriend for cinco de mayo. The weather was nice and the view from the rooftop was beautiful. I liked how they set up tables and chairs on the rooftop as well as comfy white coaches to give it a beach vibe. They even had a dj with a dance floor by the bar and people were dancing and having lots of fun. The food was really good and sangria was perfect. I had a really fun day and I ended up going back there again. Great atmosphere.,,,
82,Steven W.,"San Francisco, CA",86,20,0,1.0,10/15/2016,Takes forever to get a drink.  Place is stuffy for no reason. Find another place to spend your money. They don't want it. They will be out of business in a year. Good thing about NYC is it weeds out bad operators.,1,,
83,Awesome S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,0,1.0,9/18/2016,"I tried to make a reservation for the rooftop tables but none were available so I came early to see if there were any openings- there weren't. So we went down to the main dining room to have our meal and then came back up to the rooftop. It had been about an hour and all the tables were still empty. Ridiculous!! How could they say everything is booked and not give us a table when the whole place was empty? Also this place appears swanky but it is full of trashy people. The lounge area was full of people from the ""jersey shore"" and there was vomit on the hallway to the bathroom and my friend slipped and fell. Definitely would not recommend.",1,1,1
84,Maria B.,"Garfield, NJ",0,1,2,1.0,5/28/2016,I'm currently at stk and I must say I'm beyond disappointed. I arrived 15min early to my reservation but had an additional guest. I asked the host if it was going to be an issue and I was told that I would just have to wait a bit longer. 10:55 I was walked to my table that was for 4 people and it was in the middle of all the other 20 people waiting for tables. I asked the GM if that was the best he could do and he told me that this was my table and if I didn't like it he would give it to someone else. Really? Forward to to our apps... Oh wait there wasn't enough room for all of us 6 to have a plate so I didn't get to have any... Did I mention that we waited 20min for drinks...? Honestly I'm beyond disappointed and upset that my little sister bday was spent with me having to write this-,3,2,1

I've been to STK many times but never to the rooftop version of it let's jus say I wasn't impressed.... The views where beautiful drinks and food was just ok.... I've had lobster Mac at many different steak houses and for the 36.00 dollars stk charged for theres I was expecting something fantastic not jus ok.... the drinks again where just ok.... my waiter was pretty cool but the young man name Emilio (I believe that was his name) service and attitude was disgusting.. As me and my date were heading up to the rooftop he stops us looks as his watch and says did somebody send you guys up there :/ as if where going to head upstairs w/o someone telling us to.... that rubbed me the wrong way... again it's just an ok stk I've have better service at other stk's...,,,
89,Diane D.,"Boston, MA",0,10,0,2.0,3/12/2017,I'll start by saying the food was absolutely delicious. We had reservations at 8:30 waited over an hour to be seated. The atmosphere was fun but our server insisted on more than a 20% tip and became very rude then the hostess came over and asked us to leave our table. Will not be returning. Hope other locations are not so arrogant. Very disappointed in how we were treated.,,,

91,Cheryl F.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,18,1,1.0,9/17/2017,"So it was my 1 year wedding anniversary n I decided to go to one of my favorite places STK rooftop because of the food and atmosphere. I always order the same appetizer and dish. Tonight the Alaskan crab app was sooo fishy I couldn't eat it. I didn't bother to say anything to the waiter and just looked forward to my steak. My steak came n it was overcooked but again I didn't bother saying anything because at this point, I'm hungry n just want to eat.2 min after taking my last bite I see my husbands eyes move quickly. At first I just thought he was trying to scare me like he saw something so I ignored him. Within 10 seconds the mouse ran by my feet!!! 1 inch from running over my feet!!! I jumped up and ran. The waiter and 2 female managers on duty thought it was more important just to give me the check and get me the hell out of there with absolutely no regard that there are mice running around people's feet. The waiter didn't even want to actually give us our check, he just asked for a credit card. Yes this is NYC n mice and rats are everywhere but they should never be running around your feet when your eating. Safe to say I will never be going back there.",,,
92,Ron M.,"Bronx, NY",0,18,0,4.0,6/18/2016,If you are looking for a nice night out this is a great place. They have great music atmosphere the roof top is amazing also. The food for the price is not worth it. I ordered a steak with mash which was just okay and also chicken which wasn't nothing crazy. The kale salad was what was best. But the overall look and ambience of the restaurant is really cool. It is worth visiting for sure,,,

94,Eve O.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/5/2016,"Literally been treated better in a diner.  The worst restaurant I have ever been to. We came with a large party of ten people. Our reservation was booked in advance. Upon arrival they seated us at two separate tables and refused to give us an umbrella while it was raining because apparently another party needed two. The hostess Kelly was the most unprofessional woman I have ever met. Not only did she disrespect us but continued to tell every guest entering the restaurant about how terrible we were and made rounds to every table doing the same. She spoke badly about our party to other customers directly in front of us. Mind you our table consisted of nurses, a doctor, a lawyer and Fdny employees. No one from my party will ever return to this restaurant while this woman is employed there. I wouldn't even return if the meal were free.",4,2,2
95,N C.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,10,1,2.0,6/28/2017,"We went there last night for dinner and when we arrived we were greeted by one hostess who then told us we had to wait for the other hostess to get off the phone so that she can find our reservation. After about five minutes of waiting she got off the phone and told us we would have to wait to be seated.  We went over to the bar and while we were waiting a different hostess came to seat us.  After following her to the other side of the rooftop she informed us the table wasn't ready and that we would have to wait.  So we went back to the bar and waited another 5 minutes or so, she seated us and before we were even able to order our dinner we were asked to move to another table because a bigger party was coming.  We moved and then were asked to move yet again! Three tables later we were able to order our food, our appetizer came out and they bought it over to the wrong table! We then waited about 45 minutes before we got our waiters attention to ask where our food was since we had waited so long.  He informed us our food would be coming out soon but they needed to plate the table on the lower part of the rooftop first.  When we got our food it was a little cool since it was a chilly night and we had to wait for the other tables to get plated first.  I wish this was the last of bad things I had to say- but then the bill came and they charged us for things we didn't order!  I couldn't believe how terrible the service was, I was expecting better service especially being that it was a pricey dinner.  The only reason they are getting two stars instead of one is because the food was actually really good, it's a shame the service wasn't.",,,

98,Avinash R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,45,4,1.0,10/11/2016,"This place is like the AOL of steakhouses. Go to a real steakhouse for the same price. It is a second-rate restaurant trying really hard to make you feel as if you're in a first-rate restaurant, and you will pay the first rate prices, believe that. They have attitudes and weird little things that I'm sure impress people that don't know top service but it looks ridiculous if you have been to a place or two with real fantastic food and service. Here's a few examples: me and my partner arrived early and there was literally 90% of the tables open, they had us waiting for about 5 minutes to sit us down and they were letting people pile in the lobby upstairs in the Rooftop, the same way you have to wait in exclusive places for a table when it's packed. Once we sit down the waitress proceeds to explain the menu which really much amounted to her reading out loud what was printed on the menu. It was actually cringy to see. Then the waitress said that they were the only place in New York that serves kobe beef lol. Cocktails were OK not great, they have a really really limited selection of drinks. The DJ was playing really bad music but hey there's a DJ so it must be cool.",,,

Secondly, our party of 6 was waiting for one more who was on his way and they would not seat us. We were standing for 15 minutes and the only thing that the staff would say to us was can you move out of the doorway. This is NOT the way to treat customers that are about to dine at your overpriced chi chi restaurant. The food was fine. The ""truffle fries"" were raw. The mac & cheese was good. Nothing else was amazing. It is overpriced and service was so slow. They forgot my cousin's dish and it was her birthday. They brought it out almost 10 minutes after we had all gotten our food without even apologizing or offering anything to her. Not one server or hostess had a smile on their face and the crowd was a bunch of people trying way too hard. View was great, definitely the only good part about this restaurant. Chelsea has so many great restaurants. This isn't one of them. This place SCKs (sucks).",1,1,1
