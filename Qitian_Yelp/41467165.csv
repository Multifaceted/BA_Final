Cheese was nice and gooey and the chili had a whole lot of beans. Fries were kind of mushy but it worked. Not the greatest in the world but it hit the spot. Papaya juice was a bit too sweet and was the mango juice that Babe got but hey, c'est la guerre. These kinds of things don't bother me. Babe got the chicken tenders are some cheese fries. She tapped me on the shoulder. ""Look,"" she said ""these chicken tenders look like fish and chips from the outside."" Sure enough, they did, with the sleek and shiny batter. Never seen that on a tender before but there it was. Didn't try them myself but Babe seemed to like them and Babe has good taste so I trust it.",,,

I demanded he treat the cook with respect and dignity in front of a packed house of foreigners who said nothing.

Felt totally Bourdain-like standing alone in front of the window gobbling a messy hot dog w ketchup, mustard and sour kraut, and washing it down with a small cup of papaya juice. I guess it's exactly what I expected, so i got no complaints. But of course in true NYC fashion, things are a bit pricey (thus the 4, not 5, stars)",,,

I'm not even sure they were fried, more like left out to defrost. The lemonade is REALLY good, though but I can get delicious lemonade anywhere. The order was VERY fast, they got here within 20-25 min from when I placed the order but it clearly said CASH and the delivery guy didn't have change. (He did give me change from his own pocket but if the order says cash, shouldn't they send them out with the correct change?)I ate everything because I haven't eaten all day and this was the cheapest place by my job but I will definitely spend a little more from now for QUALITY.

If you like burnt hot dogs that they face down in your bread so you don't see it till you take a bite & watered down papaya drinks this is the place for you. Oh and don't forget the crusty dirty condiment containers that they don't clean on the window counter check the photo i posted & the flys flying around behind the register. The board of health should really check this place out. I guess there more worried about security than peoples health with the four cameras facing the register.,,,

It's just a hot dog place with tropical drinks (they do also have several other things on the menu but you'll most likely be here for the hot dogs and a pina colada or something). I like that they're open 24/hrs but I can't round up to 4 stars on these places because for $1.50 (which is the same as about any of the street vendors) you'll get a hot dog that's half the size (in terms of thickness). There's really nothing special about the food at these places. Yes the combination with tropical drinks is a uniquely New York thing and that's why these places are A-OK but that's about it.",,,

This Papaya is top ranked among it's cousin companies around town, always offering the freshest version of their menu options. I know that this statement is bold, but the cheesesteak at this particular Papaya is my FAVORITE thus far in the city of New York..............I KNOW! I KNOW! It's just a crappy food stand, posing to be the corner-most part of a building that offers hot, greasy grub. But I just can't stress how great this sandwich really is.Late Nite Philly Cheesesteak Instructions: get the mustard or BBQ version(s), eat half at 3am, the other half when you wake up, nap to Sunday golf on TV at a low volume on your couch, and I dare you to tell me you don't feel incredible and refreshed in the afternoon. Hang-over averted. My second favorite option are the chicken tenders. Big, fresh, crispy, white breast-meat, served up lava-hot at an extremely friendly price. The hotdogs are pretty much just hotdogs. But at least they make them right in front of you so that you can guarantee that they are going to be fresh. And their sauce is what makes these puppies special. Whether it's lunch on the run, or after a late night of fun, Chelsea Papaya's a perfect choice. Done, and done.",,1,2

I jumped and skipped on the way because I love a Great Frank.This was not a great frank.Ordered a sausage with onions, imagining a lovely browned, robust juicy-spicy stunner.**  Instead, out comes a boiled-lookin' spiced mini-dog with not one grill mark to recommend it, swimming in an onion-y tomato sauce. I added a Papaya drink to wash it down (as is the custom in these parts). Although it wasn't shouting with flavor, I enjoyed the combo and get why the spicy-sweet coupling has won such a following. Was still hungry after that wee dog, so went back for fries.

But having eaten at the other two many a time, Chelsea Papaya was a welcome surprise.The 100% beef hot dog had a just-right snap to the skin with juicy all beef meat inside, just salty enough to tantalize your taste buds without being so salty you're gagging for liquids. We asked for all the toppings and that is indeed the best way to eat it in my opinion. It had sauerkraut, onions, mustard, ketchup (not sure about the last two condiments but it had some sort of sauce on it). The bun was not as toasted as I would've liked but it was warm and soft. I fell in love in one bite. I would definitely go back whether or not I'm in the neighborhood. They're open late and their dogs are to die for!",,,1

The staff here are really friendly, and will sometimes allow you to taste a certain menu item before you order if you're unsure about the item. Last time I went, they allowed us to test their fried shrimp. Good thing they did, because my group ordered a lot of them because they were so good.

They handed your goods to me and I went to the counter, letting the smell waft into my nostrils, and I lifted you to my mouth and - it was love at first bite. I didn't think it was possible, but it was; I felt just like my dad must've felt so many years before me, and I knew in my heart of hearts that you were far from the best hot dog in the world or in this fine city, but damn you were good and you hit the spot. From that point on, I knew about the other Papayas, but you were so close, so warm and friendly, so remarkably easy for me to procure, 24 hours a day. You gave me what I needed, you never let me down. You were infallible.You were filled with drunkards who didn't appreciate you as much as I did, but you served them with grace as you do the homeless people who can actually afford to grab a decent bite & coffee because your prices aren't ridiculous. You expanded your menu to include all sorts of delicacies like cheesesteaks and burgers and knishes, but you stayed true to your hot dog roots and never forgot where you came from.Everytime I pass you, I'm tempted to stop in, even when I know I mustn't, that I'm due elsewhere. But the thought of 2 hotdogs with ketchup (maybe some sauerkraut if I'm feeling saucy), chili cheese fries, and a drink lingers with me as I pass your grimy doors.You give me heartburn (literally and metaphorically).

The prices are all pretty cheap and reasonable. I loved the  potato knishes (especially with spicy mustard inside), the fries are awesome there too. The dogs are small,  but tasty as well.The best part about visiting Chelsea Papaya and loading up on all sorts of comforting street foods are their all-natural juice drinks. They have papaya, mango, pina colada, and I believe strawberry-kiwi. I only got to try mango while I was there, but I was HOOKED!

114,diana m.,"Brooklyn, NY",134,807,0,3.0,9/10/2008,My first experience here was back when I was in college.  I might be a little crazy but I think the size of the dogs have shrunk since then.  And the prices certainly have gone up since then.  But it's still a pretty decent place to get a cheap meal.  I think from the outside it looks the sketchiest of all the papaya  places but the dogs still taste pretty much the same.,,,1

Was my health worth the fries? NAWWW!",,,
116,John T.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,66,0,3.0,9/25/2008,"There's not much to talk about. It's no Grey's Papaya and the papaya drink is nowhere near other papaya places. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in the area and hungry. But, then again, theres always that gyro cart on the corner.",,,
117,Mark Y.,"San Anselmo, CA",0,1,0,1.0,2/4/2011,Nasty Papaya drink. Tasted nothing like Gray's or Papaya King on 86th and 3rd. Yuk!,,,
118,Ryan H.,"Milwaukee, WI",901,205,57,3.0,10/28/2009,"this place is great for a quick snack or lunch, in fact when i was working in chelsea i'd eat here at least 2 or 3 times a week. you never have to wait for a dog, they are constantly grilling and selling, true ny speed and service here. one of the great things about this location compared to the other papaya places is that they also do burgers and fries... i suggest some cheese fries if you make it in there, great side dish to a dog with some spicy mustard... i personally dont love their juices, but they've got some great brain freeze inducing slushies, and the prices are unbeatable, you could feed a whole family for like 15 dollars.",,,
119,Diana A.,"New York, NY",6,30,2,3.0,5/1/2009,"the corn dogs are damn good!the hot dogs are alright aint no greys papaya.their pina colada drink is so refreshingand always an unhealthy start to your day you can always get 2 eggs with cheese and sausage for less than $3. fast, cheap,...and cheap",,,1
120,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/28/2011,"always fast and friendly! try the veggie burger.. it's not like your typical veggie burger and i'm not entirely sure what's in it.. potatoes, some peppers, mustard, onions...but it's delicious and only $3.50! can't beat that",,,
