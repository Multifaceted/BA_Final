He said it was smaller than he imagined and I agree.I want the sweet potato fries next time! It was half price off lunch special.There's some beer thing you can do to get BOGO! Price was an average American burger joint. Service: server was really nice, they made sure we were served and not left alone. I'd probably come back for the fries",2,,
1,Kristie P.,"Inwood, NY",162,101,306,4.0,7/9/2018,Came to have lunch & also watch the World Cup match. I've been here many times before and not much has changed. You can get half off apps and bogo drinks when you sign up for their brew club. I tried their IPA (was not a fan).  We also ordered the backyarder and the hot mess burgers with a side of disco fries to share. Both were delicious and cooked perfectly. The fries were also really good - the gravy and the cheese mix worked perfectly. Service was not the best but it could have been because of how packed the bar was for the game. Still a solid option in the neighborhood. Should mention that the fried Oreos are out of this world!,,,
2,Foodie X.,"New York, NY",4,62,9,1.0,7/6/2018,"My waitress Dallas was always smiling, which I loved, and the service was decent, but that bland, unseasoned, inferior cheddar burger with unripe, slightly yellow tomatoes looked more appetizing on their Yelp page than it tasted. IT was NOT worth it. I think Shake Shack has burgers on lock because of the quality of the beef, their recipe, and their ultra-fresh ingredients. I loved the McKenzie's Cider Rotation; an amazing Gluten-Free cider-it was delicious. It wasn't busy, so the ketchup condiments should be replenished-I ran out. It is almost blasphemous to mess up hand-cut fries; sacrilegious, sinful, shameful, disrespectful to potatoes...",1,,
3,Eddie M.,"New York, NY",9,33,2,4.0,11/6/2018,"Mel's burgers and food as a whole is solid, if not uninspiring. Good burgers, good apps, good fries and good specials. That said, it hits the spot and the selection really does lend itself to a lot of different preferences. What really makes Mel's awesome is the space (so cool) and their drink menu. Such an array of beer and drink selections! If you sign up for Brew Crew, there is also plenty of wonderful benefits. If you're up in Morningside, definitely worth a stop.",,,1
4,Nychoopaholic B.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",48,99,4,2.0,11/18/2018,Their burgers are pretty good but very small for the price. Felt like they were a little bit bigger than sliders. Their happy hour menu is solid. They have some good deals there. Too pricey for the size of the burgers.,,,
5,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,618,565,4.0,6/10/2018,"Beer, beer, ...and liquor I'm somewhat new to the Columbia U social scene, but I had a blast at Mel's. I feel like this place may become my post-work watering hole. Mel's has a great selection of various beers, and even subtypes of beer. For example, I had quite a selection of IPA's at my disposal; however, there was a limited selection of sour ales. :(. But, that's something that I can work around. The bartenders (Victoria, Blair, Dallas) were very nice and friendly, especially Blair. She always made sure that my glass was full. The regulars at the bar seem down to earth and willing to start a conversation with a new person. Even though the restaurant has the word, ""burger,"" in it name, I did not get an opportunity to try one, but the food smelled delicious. If I did not have other dinner plans, I probably would have tried one. But, you have to leave something for the next visit.",2,,
6,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,120,201,5.0,4/26/2018,"I really enjoyed my visit to this bar.I came here to just grab a quick bite,a few beers,and watch some sports.They have an very extensive list of beers to choose from so whatever your taste is you're sure to find it. Whatever type of beer you are looking for,they more than likely will have it.In additions to the various beers I also had a burger. They have a wide selection of burgers to choose from on their menu with various topping combinations.If it the area and looking for a bar to grab a quick bite and a good beer then you should definitely Stop by here.",,,1
7,Diamond G.,"New York, NY",336,143,2054,4.0,1/25/2018,"This was definitely my go to spot about 5 plus years ago. I was surprised Mel's Burger Bar was still opened as so many places in this neighborhood have closed or changed in the past year. We came to Mel's at around 11:30PM on a Wednesday and there were a decent amount of people still eating. We were seated and given menus quickly, we ordered our meals along with a shake. Our waiter asked us both a few questions in terms of toppings and how we wanted our burger cooked. The food didn't take long to come but it did come completely wrong, I   for some reason got a burger with jalapeños and raw onions instead of a well done cheese burger with bacon lettuce and tomatoes, my friend got mac and cheese sliders that were a bit raw. The fries were the only thing we ate, my burger wasn't extremely bad but I  definitely do not eat jalapenos so I could barely eat the burger. The waiter brought us some bacon on the side that was not cooked. I   was way to tired to complain or even wait for them to make me another burger so we ate what we both could and paid our bill. The service was great and so was the atmosphere. The food wasn't bad I   just wish I'd gotten what I  ordered.",12,2,7
8,Brian S.,"Union, NJ",651,53,69,4.0,2/26/2018,"I've only been here once after attending an event at Columbia University and I was pleasantly surprised at the price and quality of the food. It was definitely worth the visit and would consider going to again if I am ever in the area. The Bacon Mushroom Melt was delicious and the selection of beers was plentiful. The Nasty Shot was probably the most memorable (I wish it wasn't) part of my experience as the bar had tequila infused with whatever they put in it. Ours ended up being tequila with ketchup and sriracha - which surprisingly went down smoothly considering I didn't know what it even was before I drank it :) For $2 it's worth a try and they change it up frequently. My friend said he's had even worse so I guess we got lucky this time :)Overall, service, food quality and price, and selection of beers and alcohol made this visit enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone wanting to eat affordable quality food or just wanting to drink with friends!",,,
9,June L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,41,60,2.0,9/15/2018,"Average spot for a burger. I had the California burger and my friend had the Dirty Hipster burger and both were so soggy and hard to eat. The flavor of my burger was pretty good, but the bottom bun was completely soaked in sauce and drippings and made it hard to properly enjoy. The lettuce and tomato were already soft and wilted instead of fresh and crisp. There was a only a chunk of avocado on the burger instead of being evenly placed. For the price of our meal, which included shared fries, I'd say its not worth the trouble to be eating heavy, wet burgers! To top it off, our waiter was pretty much MIA during and after our meals, we kept having to hunt him down and he didn't even bother asking if we needed change for our check--just took the cash and later said he couldn't give us a receipt because he closed the order already.",,,
10,Sophia L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,1,1.0,11/18/2018,My elderly mother had an emergency and needed to use the bathroom. She wasn't a customer but entered and asked politely. Mel's wouldn't let use the bathroom and the staff member she asked was rude to her.,,,
11,Jon W.,"New York, NY",3012,290,1008,1.0,9/30/2017,"Great Bar....Terrible Food!This burger bar just could not live up to the hype. I came in here and took a seat and the bar to get some dinner and drinks. There is a bar as soon as you walk in a tables all over which would be great for gameday as they have tv's all over the bar.  The bartender was really cool and I got a beer from the draft and ordered the widow maker burger which is mac n' cheese, bacon, served on a potato bun medium rare and garlic fries. While waiting for my food the yankees game was on and the Cincinnati reds game was on. I asked if they could put on the rangers/devils game since it was 3-3 in the third period but the manager said no, which I thought was ridiculous. For the food It came out as ordered medium rare burger with red on the inside of the burger but it was not juicy at all, so it taste like they freeze their burgers so needless to say the quality of burger was pretty poor here and did not taste very good. For the garlic fries they give you a pretty good portion and were good. In short:- Bad Frozen like burgers- Good Fries- Nice bartenders- Won't Play Hockey- Won't be back",10,4,4
12,Christina R.,"West Islip, NY",314,186,129,5.0,5/29/2018,Great food and drinks that also shows all the sports games. Californication burger was delicious and they serve on softer buns which is what I prefer. Vodka lemonade was awesome and refreshing. They have outdoor seating which is nice during the warmer weather. Most burgers range from $10-13 but have the option to add more meat for $3,,,
13,Angely R.,"West Bronx, NY",450,61,365,5.0,3/25/2018,I've ate at Mel's burger several times and I love it soooo much!!! Ive been there during the summer in which I sat outside (sidewalk seating) and also been there at night on weekends in which it's pretty loungy. Love the ambiance! Their servers are all so friendly. And love the entire decor and concept! Their burgers are SOOO good and fresh! Ive tried almost every kind. Love their wings and their milkshakes! Favorite is the S'mores milkshake. This place also had good beers and great cocktails. Def one of my fav burger spots!!,2,,
14,McQuay J.,"New York, NY",12,20,12,4.0,10/25/2018,WOW! Burgers and boozy shakes! I mean who doesn't love boozy shakes?! The prices are good and fair and the burger and drinks are better. This is the stuff dreams are made of! I will ALWAYS love this place!,,,
15,Scott T.,"New York, NY",7,77,14,4.0,3/25/2018,Consistently good food. Burgers are great and fries have the perfect balance of crispness and greasiness. Full bar and sports on TV. What's not to like?Only criticism: fix the FRONT DOOR so it closes!,1,,
16,Eugene C.,"Manhattan, NY",415,51,133,3.0,7/8/2018,So unfortunately there are a lot of mediocre restaurants in morningside heights because of the constant churn in the area and Mel's Burger is one of them. Their burger is good but I wouldn't put it on a list of burgers to try in NYC. Shake shack and five guys is better. In fact the fries at Mels are actually better than their burgers. The decor is nice and wooden and has somewhat of a cabin feeling. They have a huge beer selection. All of these are pluses but it's hard to give a place 4 stars if the food item in the title of the restaurant is not spectacular.,2,1,1
17,Mark B.,"Presque Isle, MI",279,3,0,5.0,9/8/2018,"This is THE BEST PLACE EVER! We came in extremely hungry, ordered the WTF burger which was so satisfying and the price is awesome!!!!!

18,Kimarah L.,"New York, NY",58,5,3,1.0,7/22/2018,"I really liked their burgers. Yesterday I realized that this restaurant is stealing from their customers. When I looked a my receipt the amount of the suggested tip was complexly in accurate. So imagine for the people not paying attention or good at simple math that simple use the suggestions. Take a look at the receipt. The mgr excuse was that it was the pos system not the companyIn addition they charge our cards excessively and for in correct amounts. When calling to get it handled the manger Chris was rude AF and hung up on me and threatened to call the police if I called again because he refused to just listen to me and correct the situation. And yes I was yelling at him because he was being a complete dick. He was telling me and excise that made no sense since the charges are all for different amounts. So instead of canceling the transaction he decided to use what authority he thinks he has to do absolute lot nothing but to threaten to call the police. (This is a new thing now) and wtf were they going to do? Either way check your recipets, do your math and check your account because Mel's dinner is STEALING FROM YOU!!!!So if you've been here you probably have been charged",1,,
19,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,2.0,8/15/2017,"Saw this walking down the street Monday night and caved into cravings. This bar is known for their shakes and burgers and was pumped to try it.Noticed they didn't have too many waiters going around this place (despite the restaurant being fairly large), so decided to sit at one of the remaining stools at the bar. After realizing the shake were only on the brunch menu (booo), settled on the Widowmaker ($12.50) and a beer ($7). Given the price-tag, was hoping for some substance for my buck. In actuality, the burger is fairly small - a properly cooked patty inside a basic bun with lukewarm mac n' cheese on top and a couple slices of bacon. Overall the meal was meh, plus it didn't come with any fries (only a pickle).Service here is a certainly slow. The bartender doesn't have much help and I didn't get any utensils/napkins to go with my food. It does well given the area, but really a run-of-the-mill burger place.",1,,1

Updated review","Ok I have to revise my rating here since coming back and trying a properly cooked burger.  I confirmed my suspicions that the meat here is good quality; I got the french onion burger and it was awesome.  Dipping the rare beef in the broth put this one over the edge, but even so the onions/horseradish/swiss combo was killer.  I also got the cookie monster milkshake which was similarly awesome, and a large portion.I get why this place is so highly rated now.  Will be back!",2,,3
21,Kym G.,"Southbury, CT",3,68,28,4.0,2/17/2018,"A friend and I went here for brunch today, we were seated right away and not on top of the customers. Food was good and there was plenty of it. I got an egg omlet and she got blueberry pancakes, both were excellent.  Drinks were so so, but for 25 bucks of unlimited mimosas you can't really complain. My only complaint with this place is the unisex bathroom and the odd setup of the stalls.",,,
22,Lily K.,"New York, NY",2,33,0,5.0,9/24/2018,"I love the food and the servers are great. They're also really friendly characters. Don't come here when you're on a diet (or broke- the food's a little pricey,) because you'll want to eat and drink everything on the menu. They've got some sort of mac n' cheese burger that I get most of the time, and their gravy fries are super tasty. Also one of the guys who handles seating looks like Thor. There's an outdoor area if you're into people watching. I haven't tried their brunch or their boozy milkshakes yet, but they're on my to-do list.",,,

From the service to the food.an overall good experience.I had the hot mess which us delicious and spicy. I also had to share the disco fries smothered in cheese and a house brown gravy.

25,Victoria G.,"Fairfield, CT",104,43,253,4.0,6/26/2017,"When we first got here, I was disappointed by the service. We had already decided what we were going, and we still had to wait for about twenty minutes until the server came. Thankfully, once we ordered, our server changed (??), and he even offered to check on our food! Within a minute or two, our burgers had already arrived, and they were divine. I ordered a Bo Burger, and my friends ordered a Widowmaker and a Cheeseburger Baby. We also had chicken fingers for the table. The meal itself was very satisfying, and the portion was great, as I felt full but not overstuffed. I would  come back to try more burgers, but I wished that the service was better.",,,
26,Elena B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/5/2018,"I am very disappointed with my experience at Mels. First, we were rudely seated. The hostess did not speak to us. Second, we got the mac and cheese balls, which were $8. When we got them, there were only 3 golf ball sized mac and cheese balls. Third, we got our sodas WAY after we ordered them and when we got it, they were flat and tasteless. Our burgers were also extremely salty and wayyy greasy. Would not come back.",,,
27,Grace C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,18,3,5.0,2/19/2018,"Despite serving a clientele of mostly college kids, Mel's serves consistently good food in huge portions at affordable prices and is a place to bookmark in the impoverished dining landscape that is Morningside Heights.I'm not just being hyperbolic when I say the portions are huge. You'll likely order a burger and share the side and fries because dining everywhere else in New York has conditioned you to believe that it'd be the appropriate amount of food to order for two people.Throw that assumption out the window when you come here. Those hipster burger places where you pay $6-7 for a handful of fries in a metal waffle cone that's just enough for a chipmunk and a burger the size of your fist with a $15 markup? Mel's isn't one of them.The menu is wide and inclusive, so whether you want a classic burger or one buried under mountains of accoutrements, Mel's got you covered on both fronts.The food is good and without pretense. Service is attentive to a fault, and they have a decently sized list of craft beers that'll impress you because you're in...MoHi. Why aren't you there already?",,,
28,Rodrigo G.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",62,124,8,5.0,6/29/2018,"Love this place.We've decided to check it out because my wife name's Mel.The burger,beers, Fries and service were awesome!",,,
29,Laurielle H.,"Downtown, Boston, MA",138,38,69,5.0,5/11/2017,"Whenever I'm in NYC and visiting my friends in Harlem, Mel's is a reliable and delicious option for brunch, lunch, or dinner. The burgers are fun, although I think the actual burger is ""made"" by the crazy toppings and not so much the patty itself. The fries are good,  and although you have to order them as a separate order from the burger, it's good for sharing since the orders are huge. I'm usually fairly safe with my burger order, getting a bacon cheeseburger, but my friends have gotten the breakfast one with a fried egg or the mac and cheese one and enjoyed it.We almost always get the spiked shakes when we come too, which are delicious and huge, so they are great for sharing!I've had brunch here a handful of times now, and it's almost always available with little to no wait which is great. I usually go with at least 4 friends and we'll either get a growler or bottomless mimosas. My go to every time is the Croissant French Toast with strawberries and powdered sugar, so good! It's a great portion and I usually end up sharing with friends who are always grateful to take some!Overall, convenient and reliable spot with good food that I recommend to anyone passing through!",,,1
30,Alice A.,"Brooklyn, NY",177,43,53,4.0,10/1/2017,"Mel's burgers is a great neighborhood restaurant. I got here often as my boyfriend's family lives near by. It is typically filled with Barnard and Columbia students, but when you got past 9pm on a weekday it is fairly empty and relaxing. My boyfriend loves going there alone after work for a glass of beer while catching up on football games they have on their multiple screens. However, that being said, the place does not have a sports bar vibe. It has more of a large diner atmosphere. My favorite is their hot mess burger which has jalapeños, bacon, charred onion, cheese, lettuce, garlic, and sriracha mayo. The jalapeños are picked and definitely give a good spicy and sower addition to the burger. I also sometimes like to get the fat Mexican which has pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, and avocado. I always get fried egg added to it. They do a great job cooking their burger meat and you can never go wrong ordering any of their specialty burgers.",1,1,1
31,Kyle L.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,9/20/2018,"Recently started graduate school at Columbia and thought I would check it out since classmates have mentioned it's decent food. So, naturally when my parents visited I told them we should try the place. We went in and the atmosphere was decent enough, even with the bartender jokingly yelling with a table of students across the restaurant. It took a while to be greeted by our young waitress. We ordered and only received one round of drinks. The food arrived. My father's buffalo chicken sandwich was tough and my mother's chicken caesar wrap was all lettuce and seriously no chicken...The large order of french fries we received were cold. Side note: $11.50 for a small buffalo chicken sandwich with no sides? Not even chips? Really? Then, we were surprised to see that our waitress disappeared. We finished our meals and after fifteen minutes of sitting, twiddling our thumbs, I decided to ask another unfriendly waitress if she could grab our check. As we were getting up to leave, our waitress was returning and we realized that she had left to grab a venti Starbucks coffee...She then walked to who I'm assuming to be the manager and it seemed as if the manager had allowed her to leave for Starbucks...Bad service and  management. This is unfortunate considering I was expecting better!",,,

35,Jason K.,"New York, NY",464,56,83,4.0,3/20/2018,"Doing Brew Crew (drinking 40 different beers at Mel's) during the last month of my senior year was fun but I'm not sure my post-college body really agrees it was a good idea. For all you undergrads out there, don't forget to go to the gym. Needless to say, Mel's rotates through a large variety of beers and on the plus side I got educated on what kind of beers I like to drink now - two of my favorites were Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold and Allagash White. A happy surprise is that the food at Mel's is actually really solid - they probably serve the best burgers on the Upper West Side. Highly recommend Hot Mess ($11.75) and The Broadway ($12.75). My only qualms are that the burgers don't come with fries, which is surprising for the price, and the portions are on the smaller side. Overall, great place to hang out with friends and brings back some good memories.",,2,1
36,Marg R.,"New York, NY",1,36,19,3.0,2/26/2018,"Alright. Came here for some boozy brunch. The deal: $25 for a brunch entree and unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, or screwdrivers for 2 hours. Note that this only includes the breakfast burger and not any of the other burgers. Also, the breakfast burger does not come with any sides.The food came outrageously fast.  The food was alright. Not spectacular, not bad. Just like normal bar food.The drinks, however, were a different story. We ordered bloody marys at first and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. We just asked for mimosas while we waited. The bloody came half way through our meal and a few mimosas deep. The mimosas were mostly ""orange juice"" and the bloody was mostly mix. Sad, I know.  Drink refills were outrageously slow. About 90 minutes into our brunch, we realized there was no way we were getting and sort of buzz going and decided to just leave. Sadder, I KNOW.Overall, from a price perspective, this place sounds like a good deal, but I probably will not brunch here again. I'd give this place 3.5 stars.",2,,
37,None Of Your Business B.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,4.0,2/11/2018,"This is definitely my kind of place.Very low-key and unpretentious. It's got a bit of a southern flair, yet ironically enough, in the midst of a big cosmopolitan city on the east cost. I'd say the prices are average. This city is expensive, so anything with 'average' prices in nyc is a steal. This place is it. Lots of soul food, if you're into that. If I ever work up an appetite, I'd love a salad or some sort of veggie-type of plate. I came in for a bloody mary here a few days ago. My one complaint about it is I'm not so sure that they put in enough liquor in it. I wasn't looking, so not sure if they put in anything but the spices. I was very tired that day when I came in, and I would have expected to be even more tired after the drinks but I was not. However, whatever mix they used, plus the flavoring was absolutely wonderful. I like my drinks and food super spicy! This was my request in them making the drink. The staff seem really nice, so I'm sure they'll be happy to honor your request if you desire something a bit more bland.This was a super yummy snack! Thank you!",2,,5

In an ""Ask the Community"" Yelp question that another Yelper answered when I went to Mel's page here, someone asked if there were vegan burgers and the answer was ""no, not even vegetarian."" As a vegetarian, I can say that's not true, as every meat burger offering can be substituted for a veggie burger (and it was pretty good!); I'm also sure they remove items like cheese and make it vegan if you asked.",,,

I share my review out of a sense of duty to humanity to prevent others from suffering the fate I did at Mel's Burger Bar. My only hope is that out of my suffering will come some good and that you shall avoid my fate.I came for bottomless brunch where I had about 15 drinks and left with no buzz, just a stomach ache. I am convinced that the carafes of mimosas and screwdrivers that they served us were purely orange juice as not one out of the group of 15 of us felt anything at all. In addition to serving us beyond watered down drinks, the food was less than sub par. A friend of mine had ordered the breakfast burrito with no meat, where the waiter proceeded to tell her that the burrito could not be modified as they make them at 6am and continue to re-heat them throughout the day.

Our food was prompt and all the extra things we asked for were delivered quickly too. The food was ok. The fries were really the star of the show. They were hot and well seasoned. The LES Burger was ok. If you're looking for a place in the area to get some good bar food, this is probably it. Also they have a $25 unlimited brunch that includes and entree so I'm curious to see what that's like",,,

I've yet to have a solid complaint about this venue! Everyone is very friendly and although the food take half an eon to come out sometimes, the food is good enough to forgive and forget!   I've come here before with my Lady at the time a few times and it hasn't disappointed yet ex per for once there were fries so salty, it would've made the Dead Sea jealous. Jeez! Other than that, I've been yearning to bring my son and younger cousin here all the way from Brooklyn just to experience their awesome fried Oreos and vanilla ice cream! YUM!! My tastebuds always do the Macarena when I insert that stuff into my oral orifice!    They had burgers and fries I believe while I believe I had a salad or something. Either way, we all ate good, leaving behind no bodily parts or limbs to identify. To plainly put it, ""we killed it!"" Great stuff!!",,,

The area right of the entrance was cleared with chairs in a large circle. The staff did not directly interact too much. The decor and signage looked very good. The light did look a little dim but I was closer to the front so it was not a problem for my group.As you enter, there is a bar with booths and tales in the back. This restaurant has been on my radar for a while and I was happy to enjoy a bit. At the bar, I ordered a left hand milk stout. The staff was friendly but it did take quite a long time to get attention.For the food, it was served buffet style. There was quite a lot of food.  We had nachos, chicken wings,  cream spinach dip covered with cheese and fries. I sampled all of the items and everything was tasty. There was nothing that was amazing but it was a solid space.I would like to come back to check one of their burgers which are more creative.",2,,1

The shakes are where it's at. This place has great shakes. The mint oreo was especially good. It's a huge serving and you can't go wrong with mint Oreo ice cream. They offer other flavors as well. The menu offers burgers, fries and many finger foods.

Since I was at Barnard College - Columbia University for the Athena Film Festival yesterday, I felt it was the perfect opportunity to go to Mel's Burger Bar for a bite to eat.I went into the place thinking that I was unsure if I wanted a burger and was curious to see what other food options were on their menu. My preference was to be near the bar as I wanted to see the basketball and bowling games that were on the televisions in that area. The bartender was so nice and allowed me to take my time to look at the menu. He kindly informed me that it was still Brunch time. This was great and so I ordered the  Bottomless Brunch -$25 which included the entree and 2 hours of unlimited beverages. I selected the Hangover Breakfast which had pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham and french fries. Such a spectacular platter which was cooked well and tasted fresh! The bartender made inquiries regularly to see if I needed anything, was attentive and continously filled my glass to the brim with beverages. I was thankful for his kind presence as he exuded excellent customer service. Mel's Burger provided me with a cool, relaxing place to enjoy delicious food.",6,2,7

I ordered a Classic Turkey Burger and fries cause I'm boring, but the have some pretty off the wall choices like a burger with mac n cheese and other joices chock full with jalapeños, cheeses, bacon, onion rings, pico de gallo and guac- all for around $12. I recommend the famous Disco Fries or the Parmasesn Jalapeño- delicious full of savory touches.As for brunch (weekends and holidays til' 4) $30 will buy you unlimited Bloody Mary's, Mimosas or Screwdrivers plus and entree (STRAWBERRY CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST IS LIFE).

I'd eat the ambiance every night if it was orderable. With a spoon. I ordered the sliders and was a little disappointed when they were just placed in front of me (rather than any actual sliding happening) but they were perfectly cooked and tasty so I left it alone. When I first arrived there was a guy waiting for his friend, but he looked a lot like the guy *I* was meeting there so while I sat and waited I had a lot of self doubt about whether or not I remembered what exactly my friend looks like. Turns out my fiend was a few minutes late, and so was his. Main lesson I guess, be careful if you're meeting a friend there. They have other customers who look like your friend. Last: the beer selection was okay, and the whiskey was whiskey. I like that kind of whiskey so I drank it.",,,

It is basically paying an extra dollar to add cheese. My burger looked like an average, slightly pitiful diner burger. The outside of the patty looked cooked, but as I bit deeper into it, it was very clearly undercooked. At first I just thought it was more rare than I was used to. But there was no way I could finish that, & I always finish my food. The meat did not even come together during the cooking process. It pretty much only had a sear on the outside.$12.50 Dirty Hipster - spinach dip, jack cheese, onion rings on a potato bunMr. Joy's burger was cooked a little bit more, but still somewhat of the same raw meat, which was hidden under a mountain of spinach dip. The spinach dip was so thick and heavy, just too much. Mr. Joy said the fries were good. I guess they were. I'm not a French fry aficionado. $14 Loaded nachos with beef, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado vinaigrette, cheeseThe nacho plate is massive. It feeds about 2-3 people. Other than its size, I wasn't impressed with the nachos. But for $14, I guess they need to deliver on quantity.Mel's does have a good selection of beer and sells growlers. So that's nice, but I don't drink much at home.I thought the restaurant and service were okay, but I got to give it 1 star for the raw meat. That's a big no-no. I didn't even want to bother asking them to remake it. If they made two raw burgers, I doubt the third one will be much better. I just wanted to get out of there.",3,2,2

My burger was great (they forgot the cheese, but it didn't bother me that much), but my girlfriend's burger came out raw (she ordered it medium...this was a far cry from even medium rare). It happens, I get it. But we called and were promised a refund within two days. A week later (with no refund), we call and the dude is super rude to my girlfriend on the phone, asking her why she didn't bring the raw burger back that same day for a replacement (LOL, because that's totally your first instinct, right?), and says that they don't do refunds. That's also fine - I get it. But why did your other employee promise a refund? After the refund was promised, we were totally cool to go back and try Mel's again, but after this dude was hella rude on the phone? No way.

67,Darrell L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,36,5,4.0,1/23/2017,"This place came really darn close to getting the coveted 5th star. The only thing that kept them from that was the viewability (is that a word? If not, it is now) of the televisions. You really have to crane your neck in most areas of the restaurant. I understand that my experience may differ from others but my service was outstanding. My bartender, Dan (I believe was his name), was very attentive to my needs. My drink was always full and he made sure to check up in a non-annoying way. The food quality was good as well. I had the wings and the sliders. The wings were like a 6 or 7 probably - far from the best -but the sliders were amazing! This is a burger bar, though, and not a gastropub so why would you come for the wings anyway? Get the burgers! Last was the price. For the area, it is actually a little cheaper than most of the competition. They have amazing deals during sporting events and excellent happy hours/drink specials throughout the week. Awesome!",1,,

We had a really comfortable booth for a party of 6. The atmosphere was pretty cool though at times it had a dark and lonely feel. When we first got there at 12 it was pretty empty but slowly filled up. Almost every table had parties with kids. I guess kids love burgers??? Anyway, I came on a groupon deal 2 burgers and 64 oz growler for $29. Pretty good deal. We ordered the cider they had on tap. It was really tasty but I'm under the impression the cider on tap may change often. I ordered the cowboy burger without the mushrooms. Idk. I just wasn't in love with it. I mean it didn't stop me from eating the whole thing lol but I've had similar burgers that were better and cheaper. The bun was also really small (what's up with that?). So no matter how I tried to eat it-it was just messy! Couldn't hold it. Couldn't cut it. Sigh. Trying to cut it-you go right through the paper they serve the burgers on. We all realized we were essentially eating on the table after a point. The fries were pretty good. Not the best-but good! I also like the fact you can substitute any burger for turkey, veggie or chicken! Our Waiter was really good. Efficient, nice, etc. I won't be rushing back! If I do go back, I'd try the veggie or chicken since I wasn't overly impressed with the beef burger.",2,,

This part of  Manhattan isn't an area that I frequent at all, but after seeing an Instagram post from foodie extraordinaire, PeepMySneaks, my interest was piqued.Prior to eating at Mel's, my favorite NYC burger crown went to none other than Umami. When my dining partner and I got to Mel's, we were seated quickly in the back near the lighted marquee sign which I thought was awesome. It was kind of dark, which I don't mind at all, just not the best light for taking foodie pics! We ordered the amaaaaazing fried mac and cheese balls. I've had these at a few other restaurants, but there's was hands down the best. The last ball had to be split between my companion and I. No doubt we wanted to be greedy and hog the last one to ourselves, secretly hoping the other would decline the last out of the three. But good manners prevailed, and we shared.We both had the Mac and cheese burger with bacon. It was heaven from the first bite. I had forgotten what Umami was. Fickle burger lover? Or a sucker for macaroni and cheese? Maybe a bit of both. It was juicy, messy, cooked exactly right. I found nirvana in a burger. Every time I visit NYC, I will return.",1,,1

Full service bar if your just looking to grab a drink and watch a game.The ambience is very chill and they have a huge MELS sign lit up with old school bulbs inside. Pretty cool. Staff is really friendly and I have never had a problem with waiting too long for food.There burgers are cooked to order which my preference is usually medium, they don't overcook the burgers, which is surprising because a lot of places do. They have a vast amount of burgers to choose from, and they are a haven for alcoholic and non-alcholic milkshakes. There appetizers are not impressive. In general the nachos and spinach artichoke dip just don't do it. BURGER AND MILKSHAKE.For personal preference I've tried the alcoholic milkshakes and Ive never been a fan of mixing alcohol with my ice-cream ""happy spot"" so I just order non-alcoholic  milkshakes. Ive ordered the alcoholic milkshakes and they are STRONG. It took away from the ice-cream flavor which is when I knew it wasn't for me, but if thats what your looking for...get to drinking!! Milkshakes range from that cookie filled oreo cookies and cream to the milkshake of the month. Cookies and Cream I believe is called the cookie monster..my favorite. They bring it out in a tin can and you pour it into your glass milkshake cup as you watch the chunk of cookies struggle to exit the tin can while you try to scoop it out with your spoon. So delicious.Burgers range from your typical Burger with mac n cheese and bacon, to the simplicity of a regular burger. They have all these different names for these fancy contraptions such as the Cadillac, widowmaker, nurse betty. There all very very yummy!!My favorite is the widowmaker;Mac N cheese, bacon, served on a fluffy potato bun!! I also sometimes enjoy just the classic burger. Any burger here is a good burger. You will not be disappointed.If you order waffle fries. SHARE. They are pretty awesome perfect combination between fluffy and crunchy exterior the only problem is they usually get left behind a lot because of ordering a burger and milkshake, YOU WILL BE STUFFED! Or not?All in all one of my favorite place on the upper west side to grab a burger and milkshake. On a very positive note the burgers are better than five guys across the street and not overly oily.",1,1,1

Sure. But if you come here expecting good burgers then well, you're going to be disappointing. And for a place with the word ""BURGER"" in their name, maybe make them less bad and overcooked.

Since this place had ""burger"" in the name, we all decided to skip brunch and go straight for the burgers. Our server brought us our drinks promptly and then took our order. I had a regular lemonade and then had the most unusual lemonade (alcoholic). Then, we waited and waited and waited. I think we waited over an hour for our food. That was the only down side to our experience. I know it was busy, but it would have been nice if we were given free drinks or even some bread to munch on while we waited and waited and waited. Heck, it would have been nice if we were told at some point that our food would be coming soon.When our food came, we dove in. The California burger was cooked perfectly. I am not sure how sauce got on the bottom of the burger before it got to me...but it was good, messy but good. A half fries/rings basket is definitely enough for two people. The rings were outstanding, flaky and flavorful. They have a nice selection of beers on tap including Ommegand Witte. Again, the only down side was the wait. Delicious food.",1,1,1

Burgers are easily forgettable and consistently brought out not cooked the way you asked.

I ordered the California Burger (I'm a sucker for avocado) thinking that fries would be part of the dish. Unfortunately, that is not the case so I left the place still hungry. Additionally, the burger is below-average size-wise, it was however, well cooked and well constructed so it wasn't a difficult thing to eat.There is a good beer menu and the cheaper options are just fine.",,,
91,Daniel G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,1/23/2017,"This is the first Yelp review I've ever been compelled to write. I share my review out of a sense of duty to humanity to prevent others from suffering the fate I did at Mel's Burger Bar. My only hope is that out of my suffering will come some good and that you, dear reader, shall avoid my fate.The veggie burger is the worst burger I've ever had and can even conceive. It barely qualifies as a veggie burger: as far as I can see, taste, and smell it is 99% white rice with 1% oats (the waitress alleged there are oats in it) and then drenched in beet juice, which gives it a grotesque light pink color. If it wasn't pink, I would file a lawsuit for labeling it a veggie burger because the pink color is the only evidence that any veggie matter is present. When the ""veggie burger"" arrives at your table, you will be immediately gripped with horror and fear as you see what appears to be a patty of raw hamburger meat on two pieces of burnt toasted rye bread. This patty has zero smell and zero flavor - I've had more fragrant white rice at Panda Express. Mel's Burger Bar must've somehow invented an advanced flavor and taste removing device, which they should patent immediately. It might be useful as a food torture device in Guantanamo Bay.I can't imagine that even a sight blind, taste blind, and smell blind chef of the highest imbecility, who has eaten only the mush served on the Nebuchadnezzar ship in the Matrix, on their first day of the Trump University culinary school could conjure up a bland and insipid gruel patty of such idiotic proportion.The ""coleslaw"" was a room temperature pile of trash cabbage sloshed with mayonnaise-like substance. Had I eaten more than a bite, I fear I would not be on this earthly plane to share my review with you today - due to a violent death from food poisoning.The ""onion rings"" are fat, chewy, over-breaded, over-fried chunks of artery clog with pitiable, flaccid onions inserted for good measure that you will likely only detect under surgical light. The fries were edible.This was the worst meal I've ever had, and could only wish it upon my worst enemy. Never go to this restaurant. And all I have suffered will not have been in vain.",1,3,
92,Midnight M.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,12,4.0,6/16/2016,"Let's start with the good stuff, the food!. I had the Dirty Hipster and it was delicious!. I shared an order of garlic fries. It wasn't what I expected.  Not garlicky at all. Just a chunky of tiny fresh garlic bits in the very middle. We couldn't really taste the garlic. My date had a Backyarder Burger which was also delicious! (I totally took a juicy bite out of it). We chugged it down with a Growler of Flying Dog Numero Uno beer. It was very good. If you like Coronas then you'll like this.The ambiance was very melo. A bit dark lighting with country music in the background. But you can always request to sit outside and enjoy the new York noise and lights. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and so super sweet. Gave us a sample  of the beer to make sure we like it and had a smile on her face the whole time.  Thank you so much Simone! :-)",,1,

I have to give it to this place, the shakes are a greattt idea, I had the Dulce de Leche Jack Daniels shake. It was definitely mouth watering, the Jack Daniels whisky takes a second to taste but it'll definitely shake you when it does. For an appetizer we had the Spinach Artichoke dip which was delightful.I also had the cadillac burger with a side of sour cream bacon wall fries and my date had the Bo burger with onions rings. The burgers where amazinggg, succulent,juicy and tender. I gotta say the sides were cold and bit soggy, I barely touched them. I suggest specifying how you want fries before ordering them. Also the Onion rings were bland and lacked flavor. Over all I'm definitely going back for the burgers and shakes.",1,,

I got the haymaker, and for $8 it was pretty good and pretty strong. I ordered the iceburg salad because I was in the mood for lettuce...7/10...kind of sloppily put together but not bad. Fried pickles were super good, sweet potato fries were also pretty good, but seems like the burgers are the go to (duh), as my burger babe ordered one and it looked classic and like a normal portion, not one of those man vs food burgers. They have a large bar area and huge tables for big parties and it gets pretty loud. The service was really nice and fast.

And for lecturing us by saying that customers should be more patient. Friendly tip- if you can see your waitress is overworked and can't handle the # of tables, step in and help out! Don't tell your customers they should be more patient when they have POLITELY expressed they're in a hurry and would like to pay the bill.

Updated review","Used to be one of my favorite spots in the city. Sadly, that is no longer the case. Went in for a football Sunday, it was busy but tables were available and we were seated right away. So far so good, right? Our server seemed nice and friendly, and we ordered our drinks right away. I had a beer and my lady had a boozy cotton candy milkshake. My beer came quickly, but after about 10 minutes, our server informed us that they were out of that kind of ice cream and couldn't make that cocktail. Ok, 10 minutes seems a little long to find that out, so my lady orders another drink, a root beer based one. They were out of root beer as well, no problem, restaurants get busy and run out of stuff, I don't hold that against them (unless maybe whoever is doing the ordering doesnt know what he's doing?). My lady says regular coke is fine to substitute in the cocktail, which was a boozy ice cream float. After another 10-15 min (I was on my second drink and had already finished an order of wings) her ""drink"" finally arrived; a bottle of root beer beer (I thought they were out?) and some ice cream in a glass. No spoon, no ""sorry for the wait,"" no table touch, just an $11 ""cocktail.""The food was good, it seemed like the kitchen was the only part of the house that knew what they were doing. As far as the bar, floor, and management, I think it's safe to say they were all buried deep in the weeds. Everyone was running around chaotically, no one really seemed like they knew what they were doing, and the floor manager seemed flustered and overwhelmed. Drinks took forever, and even after our server informed us she asked a manger to check on the drinks, he never once came over so much as a table touch. Got the check and paid. Prices were the same as last time I was here, but with this drop in service, I would say this place is way overpriced for what you get, and you can do way better in this part of town, especially if you're looking for a football-type of bar. Like I said, used to be a great spot to watch football but it looks like it's become amateur hour at Mel's. The food and drinks are good, and if you want to risk it, by all means, but beware of what seems to be a poorly trained staff and bad service.",6,2,3
107,Daphne C.,"Coolidge Corner, Boston, MA",448,80,14,2.0,9/13/2016,Awful food awful customer service. It literally shocks me every time how slow the customer service is. Not only does it take me 15 minutes to flag down a waiter but the food always takes forever. Expect to spend a long time if you plan to sit in. The burgers are average. The atomic fries are pretty good as are the milkshakes. Everything else -- don't bother. Sit outside if the weathers nice. Good place for people watching,3,,
108,Crystal R.,"West Bronx, NY",8,15,106,5.0,10/6/2016,If your looking for a quick place to grab a bite Mel's burger bar is the place. They have many burgers to choose from and the best part is the bread every burger comes on potato bread. Fries are separate from the burger for a extra charge but you definitely won't be disappointed. The portions for the fries are for 2-3 people so u save money there unless your super hungry and can eat the whole thing lol. They have milkshakes as well and deep fried Oreos with vanilla ice cream if u need had deep fried Oreos please forget the diet and treat yourself u will not be disappointed. All in all this place is awesome,1,1,1
109,Howard H.,"Flushing, NY",126,688,1465,4.0,10/25/2015,"I'm tough on burger places but this place made me happy.  The menu features 15-20 different burgers each with their own distinctive tastes.  I tried the Broadway (patty with swiss, sautéed onions and jalapeños on sourdough bread) which was excellent.  The rents had other versions of a cheeseburger which met with approval.  Burgers are the right size and not messy.  Only complaint was that the onion rings were fried so hard that there was no onion left.  Service was quick and friendly and prices are very reasonable for the area (probably due to the large student population).  Highly recommended.",1,,

I went for the fish tacos instead. The tacos were HUGE but lacking in flavor. I actually got the tacos thinking they'd be a lighter option than the burgers, but the burgers really aren't huge. They're expensive burgers considering their size and they don't come with fries. I will try a burger next time and I will update my review.Very busy and it was a Tuesday night, however service was very quick.Ambiance is casual and loud with tables pushed very close together. Great place to come for a casual night of drinks and food with friends, but I wouldn't come here for a date night!",1,1,
112,Esther W.,"Carlsbad, CA",207,190,395,5.0,12/11/2014,"Oh yeah I'm giving this place 5 stars. Mood is killer for dinner, sports bar, a lot of delicious beer on draft (including a milk stout ohhhh my), and wonderful sweet potato fries.Burgers aren't the best I've seen (Cali-spoiled girl here) but the more pricier ones (~12 bucks or so) are tasty in my opinion. Also the portions to me are small (again, Cali-spoiled girl).I genuinely loved the environment here. In the downtime it's got a nice quiet pub feel, but once the night picks up, it turns lively.Anyways, galfriend and I stopped by in time for happy hour, $1 off drinks and 1/2 off fries/nachos/wings. We actually split one order of sweet potato fries and it was enough for us. She ordered the Dirty Hipster, I forgot what I went with but it had bacon onion rings and an egg. It had another sauce with it and I loved it. It was a tasty burger.To be honest though, it wasn't memorable. It was a very filling burger despite the boring presentation of using potato bun. Two giant ass pickle slices though. That made me much happy. Sweet potato fries came with a nice BBQ dip too and was not at all greasy. Would recommend that.Also got the milk stout and a frost bite (ohhh delicious delicious so very delicious).So beer, burgers, side of fries, came to about $24 a person. A littttttle on the pricey side. But whatever, what else were you expecting on the UWS.",,,
113,Dhruvin P.,"Gwinnett Place, Duluth, GA",228,1,0,1.0,7/20/2018,"Extremely unsatisfactory customer service. The waitress allowed me and my date to eat the pizza we bought from next door, because my girl wanted to try out the milkshake and I wanted a beer with my pizza. 20 minutes into our dinner, the manager shows up and asks us to leave right away. We were disappointed that we couldn't even finish our slice let alone the milkshake and beer. We were told to promptly leave. On top of that another waitress shows up with the check. I tried to confront the manager because of the unfairness, but he threatened to call the cops if we didn't pay. My girl went ahead and gave her the payment. The manager showed no sympathy for letting a girl on a date pay for the drinks (even after I repeatedly informed him that she was on a date.) I just cannot believe what happened. Very unfair.

Since I use to live in the area, I've been to Mel's more than a handful of times. So, I've tried everything from their burgers to appetizers to beers to even their salads. If you love anything avocado like me, try either their Fat Mexican Burger or The California Burger. So good. Now that I've stopped eating red meat, I decided to give their salads a try. My absolute favorite is their oriental salad. It's all I ever order here now. Everything you order here is pretty large portions, so you will be satisfied.Side note: fries come separate unfortunately. So, if you haven't had their fries before, you must order a side of fries. Overall, this place is a good, casual burger restaurant with a modern atmosphere mixed in with a bar like feel. It's a place you can go take your family out for dinner or meet some friends and watch a football game.They have a great assortment of beers, too. They even pair their beers with their burgers which is a cool aspect.",,,

It was hard to get someone's attention after we ordered our food but you just had to yell over the noise. My server asked all four of us if we wanted fries and we each said yes - a mistake. We could've easily spilt one, maybe two fries between the 4 of us. The portions are huge. I ordered the pb&j milkshake which was the quantity of two milkshakes. It was rich and tasty.I then ordered the Mac and cheese burger - heaven in my mouth. It was cooked just right and juicy.  The potato bun was slightly sweet.

118,Steven S.,"Kingston, NY",0,22,0,4.0,2/10/2018,"My wife, son & his 1 year old stopped early on a Saturday night about 6:00. It was pretty crowded but the greeter was very friendly and found us a seat right away (by the door however). There was ample room for the stroller right at the table so we were off and running. The very friendly & helpful waitress was over quickly and we ordered 2 of the house brews for my son and I and a margarita for the lady. The beers were good...the margarita...so- so according to my wife. ""Not as good as yours."" Ain't she sweet! We ordered 2 ""Widow Makers"" (mac 'n Cheese & bacon) and a California (with avocados) and an order of fries (they don't come with the burger). The food came out relatively fast, especially considering the number of people. I must say, the burgers seemed smaller than I'm used to getting, but had a nice heft when I picked it up. We all dug in! I thought the amount of mac 'n cheese was a little small, but it all mixed well and the taste of the burger really came through nicely - the texture and taste was quite good so i guess there's ""method to the madness"" as they say. The fries were hand cut and really went well - a little crispy outside bit still fluffy inside. The order was enough for the 3 of us (with a couple for Mason, too). Although there was no food leftover we were all satisfied. The manager came over to the table to ask if we wanted to move the baby away from the door (which kept sticking open) and even though we were just about done, it was a nice gesture to see someone looking out for us. We were all happy with Mel's but beware - it's more of a young crowd and the noise level is high. Later might be better as I read it starts clearing out - we noticed a lot more empty seats than when we came in. All in all a pleasurable experience - all the staff were really cool and accommodating. Nice friendly vibe going and we felt welcome. We'll go back.",,,

Can you imagine we had to wait more than 30 minutes for 2 burgers? Finally we got the burgers but this time we had to wait for the drinks and dealt with 3 different waiters just for the drinks. Eventually they brought the beer finally, but this time forgot the coke. It's just a beer and a coke and we waited for this for more than 10 mins. It was like a very bad joke.

121,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,5/18/2015,"Should I review Mel's from the perspective of a thirsty (in both senses of the word) and tipsy college student who went for the fireball and stayed for the fireball, or as a nostalgic post-grad? Well, I went here for a graduation dinner on Saturday night, so I'd say I can give people a little taste of both here.Mel's was always my favorite Morningside Height's bar. Maybe it was because the jocks were always there and while I never acted on it, I'm a sucker for athletes. But it's generally just a sports-minded place, which means it's all good in my book. I've come for Sunday football (GREAT deals) - they play a different game on every TV - and I've gotten to happily watch my Eagles with a friend or two and of course, a pitcher of beer.I've actually only ordered full meals here twice. The first was maybe two years ago and the second was this past Saturday. There's nothing extradordinary to report here. Solid, solid burgers. Every time I come here, I have the passing thought of ordering something other than a burger. But I feel somewhat obligated to. I've gotten the ""Nurse Betty"" (veggie burger, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, sauteed mushrooms, monterey jackcheese, served on toasted sourdough rye) - which is so-so. There were a total of two pickle slivers on my burger, and maybe three mushrooms. Come on, Mel's, I expect better. I have also tried the Dirty Hipster (props to the names), which is significantly better - though not if you're trying to eat healthfully. Cheese and spinach dip and onion rings .. oh my! Drinks are pretty straight-forward. I sound like a broken record, but I'm a cocktail nut. The only test that these pass is ""drinkable? y/n"". I mean, they're fine. I'm not expecting much from Mel's in this department - it's definitely more about the beer here. But they try, so A for effort? Lastly - FRIES. All of the yum. Atomic, Disco and Sweet Potato.

I got the chocolate shake and it's thick and rich, and tasted like velvet ice cream. Definitely the highlight of my dinner. The delivery service was also sub par, with the delivery man not knowing where I was despite multiple phone calls and me giving him my direct address.

Till now. I have had hands down the best burger- ever! The ""hot mess"" was absolutely superb. It wasn't crazy spicy but packed brilliantly with enough heat. Inside this potato bun is a mouthful of jalapeños, bacon , Monterey cheese, onions, garlic topped off with siracha mayo- heaven in your mouth! They do offer other delicious burgers, salads and appetizers as well along with signature sides such as garlic fries or sweet potatoes fries.

It packed a punch.Had thé hangover spécial and every one else got burgers which were moist, juicy and High quality. My meal was great but I snuck a bite of a burger and it was so worthwhile. Id recommend thé burgers by a long shot although if you like a seasoned hunk of meat then you should get toppings or walk with some salt and pepper.1 unisex bathroom, which was immaculate.

We ordered for five people, including my salad with no dressing and a burger patty, medium well, and my daughter's mac and cheese. We waited at least 30 minutes for our food. When it arrived, it was delivered with no cutlery. We immediately asked for cutlery. That took another 5 minutes to arrive. In the meantime my daughter and I couldn't eat the salad or Mac and cheese. When we finally had cutlery and I started into the burger patty, it was literally bloody. Definitely not medium well. We told the waitstaff who took the entire salad away along with the bloody patty. I then waited THIRTY MORE minutes for a replacement salad/burger. Everyone else at the table had finished. The manager came by. Sorry, he said with a shrug, the kitchen is really backed up - should I take it off the bill? Or, he offered, we can pack it up to go and we  will come it. But it could still take some time to come out. No real apology. And I was still hungry! We finally left after an hour and 15 minutes, me with my dinner to-go in a bag. No apology. And to add insult to injury, when I got it home, there was no dressing. I had to scrounge in my fridge for dressing. And the burger was at best medium, not medium well.",,,

I chose this place because of the wide variety of burgers and since it seemed to get a few good reviews. Sadly, I made a poor choice. While the food was about 2/5 stars, the service was 5/5. Our server was Andrew and he was beyond polite. He informed us of the happy hour specials which were ending within the 20 minutes that we arrived there and warned me beforehand that the iced tea I was about to order was unsweetened so that was nice of him. All throughout our meal he kept checking in on us and refilling our waters. Now, onto the food.Since it was part of the happy hour special, we order buffalo wings which were half off ($5.50). These wings were pretty damn amazing. They were crispy, mildly spicy and juicy. I loved them but with only 6 to an order, I don't think they're worth the original price of $11. Once we were done with those, we ordered our burgers. I got the Widow Maker which is mac & cheese on a burger with bacon. My boyfriend got the Bacon Mushroom Melt which is Swiss, Jack, bacon & mushrooms on a burger. Oh and a side of fries.The first thing I immediately noticed was how small the burgers were. Probably about the size of my palm and I'm 5'3. As soon as I grabbed my burger, it all fell apart. Mac and cheese was dripping and the bread was a little soggy. What upset me was the lack of flavor. The burger tasted like it had absolutely no seasoning or juices or anything. And the mac & cheese?? Bland too. The only good part was the bacon which was crispy. The fries were nice and crispy too. There were no complaints on my boyfriends end but he eats practically anything so he's useless.",2,2,1

Updated review","Honestly, this place used to be better than it is now. Those prior manager, Rich, had a better feel for good beer than whoever does now. I was in there on Saturday afternoon, March 4, 2017, and the service was really bad. My friend and I sat there at least 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table. The waiter we eventually had was pretty good, but he just seemed overworked. The beer selection has gone seriously downhill. There is very little fresh turnover in with new beers (as there used to be with Rich). This most recent time was about 2-3 months since my last visit, and the beer selection was nearly identical. I like the place, but it just isn't as good. It's fun, but definitely not nearly as good. To add insult to injury, it was freezing cold. The bathrooms, on a day that was in the mid to low 20s and very windy, had cold air blowing in.",,,
141,Brendan W.,"Manhattan, NY",98,12,21,4.0,3/28/2015,"I tried out Mel's when visiting a friend in Columbia who swore by their burgers. Ordered a side of Atomic Fries, which were delicious, spicy, and great with the blue cheese dipping sauce. Had the Dirty Hipster burger as my main and found myself loving the spinach dip and jack cheese combo - sampled my friends Widowmaker and loved the mac n cheese as well. I did think the portions were a little small given the price ($12.50) but was overall satisfied with the taste and creativity of the burgers.Finished off with some amazing fried Oreos (really decadent) and left pretty content. Looking forward to coming back and trying another one of their burgers as well as their wide selection of craft beers in the near future!",,,1

143,Melissa W.,"New York, NY",190,334,422,4.0,8/20/2013,"I've been here twice now and had great experiences both times. Both times I used a Groupon - with no problem! I always like to mention this because some establishments very much make it difficult to redeem a deal like Groupon. I've eaten indoors & outdoors. Indoors is super cool, although it gets crowded. & most recently we sat outside which was really great! I don't remember my waitress from the 1st time I went, but my 2nd waitress stands out in my mind. Her name is Stephanie and she was wonderful! Offered great suggestions, super friendly & accommodating. Stayed positive even when it got crazy-busy. 1st trip I got the Fat Mexican, 2nd time I got the Dirty Hipster (see picture!), recommended by Stephanie. And no, I'm not using derogatory language, these are names of burgers. Both were awesome. Grreeeeaaaat beer selection. I mean, just awesome. If I lived any closer this would be dangerous for me. Prices are reasonable as well. I did, however, have a slight freakout during my 2nd trip. I tell this story as a warning, so that you too don't have a freakout:After approximately 1/2 a growler of beer (see picture!) I had to use the restroom. Coming in from outside, my eyes took awhile to adjust, but in the back-right side of the restaurant I found a wooden door marked ""WC"". I went in without thinking much about it. There were 3 wooden floor-to-ceiling doors along the left hand side. All were occupied. So I wait. One gentleman comes into the bathroom. I think nothing of it. Another man comes in, and then another. Fear creeps into my bones. OMG am I standing in the men's room?!?! One of the bathroom doors open ... and a man comes out. Crap (no pun intended). I rush into the stall and collect my thoughts. I realize that there were no urinals in the main room. And the main door just said ""WC"". Therefore, I concluded, the bathrooms must be unisex. Which I think is odd - but hey, at least I wasn't in the men's room.Moral of the story: don't have a freakout. Or hold your pee.",,,
144,Abby B.,"Philadelphia, PA",168,601,4,4.0,4/6/2015,"We were semi-hungover and in need of something to eat, stat. We were not amused by the long lines we saw at the bagel shop and downer down the street, so we arrived at Mel's around 9:55am and were able to snag the first seat (they open at 10).The brunch menu is not extensive, but it does the trick. They boast about their french toast being ""the best,"" but my friend ordered it and seemed less than impressed. I got the ""Hangover Platter"" (it was called something like that) and it included all the breakfast meat you could imagine, eggs, potatoes and pancakes. It was tasty, but nothing special. My other friend had the breakfast burger and said it was amazing. Perhaps the best deal is that with any brunch order, you can get a mimosa or bloody mary for $2. Would bottomless be better? Of course. But in NYC, you can't be picky.Would I return to Mel's? Maybe just for drinks, as they seemed to have some tasty-looking milkshakes on the menu. Also, their bathrooms are, as my friend stated, ""like a puzzle.""",,,
145,Nicholas P.,"Manhattan, NY",201,1,0,1.0,10/29/2015,"The truth is, the food is great. The staff is terrible. I went there with a Groupon. It isn't the first time I've used them, and I, naturally, always feel guilty using Groupons in general. Because of this, I asked the waiter if he would look at it before we ordered. He said everything would be fine. We ordered the food. Again, great food. When the bill came, I handed my waiter the phone for the Groupon. It was redeemed and we received a bill for $35. The problem was that the Groupon should have covered everything. No big deal. I asked if they'd take a look.The manager came back and said he'd made a mistake. In fact, the Groupon was only good at another Mel's. He took our bill and came back with one for $60.So, there were three mistakes:1. The waiter didn't review my Groupon after I asked. 2. The Groupon was redeemed with a discount.3. When it was discovered it didn't actually work, we lost the discount and were charged full price, despite having a bill in hand for $35 that we would have gladly paid for the miscommunication. When we asked about this, the manager on staff (Tim, 10/29/15) made us feel like we were the jerks. I'm just a poor guy in New York using Groupons. I don't want to go out and be made to feel awful about myself because of it. Anyone who has worked in a great restaurant will tell you the manager should have just realized the error and charged us the $35. It wasn't an ideal situation, but it was better. Instead, he looked down on us and walked away from the conversation, charging us the full amount.If you want a good burger, there are plenty of great places in New York to get it without dealing with rude service.We won't be back.",7,,1

My boyfriend loves Mel's on the West Side so he already had the bar set pretty high.  Real happy I gave this place a shot! It was slightly less crazy compared to Mel's on the West side apparently - but never the less, a pretty chill burger joint to sit, grab a burger and beer. I like to eat a little bit of everything so the Dirty Hipster Burger (sub with Turkey Burger) had my name all over it. It had the most gooey Spin Dip with Jack Cheese and topped with Onion Rings. I hate when you order something totally out of your norm, real unhealthy and unfortunately unsatisfying.. but.. this burger seriously did the job! With a side order of Sweet Potato fries and warm BBQ sauce, I rolled right out the door. Ambiance: Good spot to watch the game and root on your favorite team - we watched the World Series Baseball game, lots of TVs so not really a bad view from any area of the restaurant. Lots of groups and sports fans alike were at the bar, everyone drinking different beers (they have about 50 to choose from).

""No, I'm just going to have a drink, thank you,"" was my response. I asked for a Grey Goose with a small amount of ice and extra lemon. He brought me my drink which had an over-abundance of ice. ""Please... can you take some of the ice off?"" I asked. Well... Mr. Bartender became a bit huffy, snatched the glass from my hands discarding the ice aggressively into the garbage can, I sat at the end of the bar. He slammed the glass down in front of me and bellowed, ""Are you going to make a tab?"" or something along those lines. I responded well... maybe I'll have a second a drink but I'm not sure yet. The gentleman next to me, who was from Argentina, said, ""I was having a perfectly calm day until now - what's with this waiter? You haven't sat here for two minutes and he's asking for payment?"" The waiter returned after seconds later bellowed louder than the television program, louder than the patrons at the bar, ""Miss, I'm going to need your payment or a credit card, now!"" I was shaken up that I asked to see his manager.  His name I do not recall, but bartender whispered in his ear before he came over to see me.  BOGUS!Well, listen up Mel. This isn't how guests are treated?  I would appreciate an apology and your manager and bartender need to have further training.  They will ruin your business in the end.  I  can't recall his name but based on the timeframe above, you know who was at the helm. I am a female who stopped in for a drink, alone, and was abused by your waiter. I understand the bartender had been working for you a while - he used to have long hair but recently cut it. Maybe he's suffering from a Samson complex - the manager agreed? BUT NOONE DESERVES TO BE DISRESPECTED. My boyfriend wanted to come down to teach him a lesson or two...

Honestly, my only complaint would be the exorbitantly high hamburger prices. They still were not enough to turn me away.This restaurant was on the verge of opening when I moved out of that neighborhood two years ago, and I was always pissed that I wasn't around the corner from it anymore once it did open. However, I was finally able to indulge recently, and I could not have been more pleased.The interior is fantastic and much larger than I expected; I was expecting the dining area to be skinny and straight towards the back. However, there is a surprisingly large rear dining area, a full (and beautifully adorned) bar, and the name ""Mel's"" in bold and shining lights on the extreme rear wall.I gorged myself to the point of nausea with no regrets. The garlic fries were loaded with freshly minced garlic; I was eating occasion full half-cloves with no regrets. I ordered the Dirty Hipster burger: a patty topped with spinach dip, jack cheese, and onion rings on a potato bun. It's an extraordinary combination! How I finished it is still beyond me. I washed it all down with an Original Sin and sank into an expected food coma. Yes, as I mentioned, this is a pricey joint. Even for some of the more absurd toppings, I really can not, personally, justify spending $12.40 on a designer hamburger. However, did I? YES. I did. And I'd probably do it again. Why?

I got the ""Hot Mess"" Burger. The buns seem a bit too small and made it appear like you got a big chunk of beef. I felt like they cut up half an onion and put it in my burger. Tasted nothing but the onions. I didn't taste much of the garlic sriracha mayo that was suppose to be in the finishing touch; maybe they should add more of the sauce. As for the ""Parmesan Jalapeño"" fries, they were delicious. Nice and crunchy, not too oily or soggy. But the ketchup had more flavor than the sauce that came with the fries themselves.

My table had 3 Cadillac burgers which were decent along with a side of half&half (half fries half rings-rings were pretty good) we had buffalo wings as an appetizer which were a joke for wings - they were so small and skimpy for $12.

It seems like a rice burger colored with a tiny bit of beet juice. It completely fell apart and had no texture or flavor. As someone who makes veggie burgers at home with black beans, saltines, and spices, I just don't think it's that hard to make a crispy and tasty veggie pattie. But.

169,David M.,"Jacksonville, FL",79,270,46,4.0,6/10/2014,"According to my unscientific review, Mel's seems to get a bad rap mostly for the service.  This is sometimes justified, since it's been unfriendly and inattentive on half my visits (including bizarrely slow table turnover during busy times).  But I'm guessing a lot of the negative reviews are payback by hungover Columbia kids who got thrown out by a bouncer the night before (note: if you come to Mel's late, you will encounter drunk Columbia kids).But seriously:- Beer selection: 5/5.  Draft and bottle assortment is outstanding and actually well thought out, something for almost everyone.  Rotating Founders line, Left Hand, 21st Amendment, lots of other good stuff.- Burgers: 4/5.  One of the rare places in the city that actually leaves a burger medium rare if you ask for it.  and there are a bunch of the specialty burgers that are quite tasty (the Broadway, the California, the Cadillac).- Fries: 4/5.  Will sometimes come out a little brown for my taste, but the garlic, the parmesan/jalapeno, and the sweet potato are all delicious.annnnd I haven't tried anything else on the menu really.  Beer, burger, fries, rinse & repeat.  It's a simple formula, consistently well-executed, at a good price.  Plus -- they play great blues/rock at a loud but not overwhelming volume, and the TV placement is solid.  Just maybe be prepared for the occasional rough service experience.",1,,

But we only saw our waiter 4 times during our visit, the last two of which were him silently tossing the check on our table then snatching the credit card so there was no one to ask about any of it. Or request to get anything we needed.",1,,

Updated review","Pretty damn good burgers. A little pricey, but it's NYC and you get what you pay for. There's a five guys across the street if you're frugal. The sidewalk tables provide a great spot for people watching next to Columbia university. Nice selection of beers on tap and an even larger selection of bottles. Updated: I found myself back again but noticed the prices. The burgers are fair priced for NYC but the fries... $7!  That's stupid. Oh... and an iced tea: $4It's fucking water. This is a way of telling me you don't respect me as a customer. I kicked it back 2 stars for this.",,1,
173,Cat T.,"Honolulu, HI",74,179,132,3.0,9/13/2014,"I LOVE the ambience and interior decor of this burger bar. They did a good job in matching what a burger bar should look and feel like. Also, I appreciate the vast array of beers available. If you're a beer person, you better get your butt here! As for the burger (ordered the cheeseburger) it was okay. Not the best, not the worst. I actually could taste a slight un-freshness to the meat. I ordered 'medium' done but the burger came out to be way more pink then it is. And let me say I'm the type of person that orders 'medium rare' steaks, but decided this is ground up meat which should be cooked a tad bit more.Also the 'half & half' side dish (half fries & onion rings) were ridiculously oily and overcooked. Even though I love fries and I ate them, they were by far the worst fries I've ever had in a burger joint. Overall, I give this place 3.5 stars. I'd go back because its not a bad place to hang out and chill with friends.",,,

It's new year's day and we are feeling a bit pasty.  My girlfriend loves a good bloody and they had all the fixings and then some; olives, onions, bacon, an onion ring and a big pepper. It drinks like a meal.The beer selection is great and the burgers were delicious.  Most of all I really loved the refreshing music that was playing.  It was very classic rock leaning with a good variety of artists from older acts like csny to relatively newer bands like blues traveler. They were playing many good obscure songs from a lot of artists.  Good food, good drinks, and we loved the music",,,

When the food came out it was really good. No complaints and will recommend Mel's to friends.,,,

Updated review","I've come here a few times since my original review, and I have to say Mel's really does burgers right. If you want something hearty and different, this is the spot. And brisket. Don't come here for fish tacos, though. They were mighty disappointing. And don't necessarily come here looking for any healthy options. The salads (3 options) are basic, and every other sandwich or burger is complex.Still, this spot has grown on me, and I appreciate the kindness of the people who work here.",2,,1

I've had the burgers which are juicy and creative. The fries are bountiful, delicious, thin and crispy. The beers, over 40 are great and if you don't like yours they'll get you a new one!

179,Jeremy S.,"New York, NY",155,663,13,2.0,11/7/2016,I was craving fries and decided to try this place out. The interior was cozy and the takeout food came quickly. I had the jalapeño Parmesan fries. It was quite pricey at $7.50 but it was a good portion. My main gripe is that the fries weren't crispy at all and the jalapeño is too overpowering. I also didn't feel good at night after this meal and am not planning on coming back.,,,
180,Abi D.,"Melbourne, FL",5,29,15,2.0,7/26/2015,"This restaurant is mediocre, to be honest. I came here today expecting much more from them, and it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations. The Nurse Betty Burger had little to no flavor at all, and was truly a mess. It was described as a burger, but was more of a sandwich with a saddening, falling apart, and extremely greasy veggie patty. Served on a pile of lettuce, it just seemed like a kind of burger that was just thrown together. Additionally, the menu clearly stated that this burger would have sauteed mushrooms on it, and it arrived without any. The only acceptable thing about this restaurant were the fries. I ordered the fresh cut fries. Albeit being on the nearly-oversalted side, they did taste good... Overall I was truly upset to see the quality of food at this restaurant, as it filled me with disappointment.A 2/5 is being generous.",1,,

189,Paige H.,"Guilderland, NY",0,19,17,4.0,6/13/2015,"A coworker suggested that my boyfriend and I try this place out. Originally we were just looking for a place to grab drinks and watch the game, but that quickly turned into a full dinner experience. Had I not been an avid Yelper, we wouldn't have learned about the awesome Groupon deal - $25 for two burgers and a 64 oz. growler of any beer of your choice! We couldn't believe it! Especially since the average cost of a burger at Mel's is between $11-$13, and a growler averages $30. The Groupon deal doesn't cover fries or substitutions though, so keep that in mind when ordering.After dinner and drinks, we couldn't help ourselves but to try a spiked milkshake. ""After Dinner Mint"" - mint Oreo ice cream with peppermint schnapps. It was absolutely delicious! Overall, the atmosphere of the bar is really cool. Rustic, yet industrial at the same time. Unfortunately, we were not happy with the service we received from our waitress which in turn was reflected in her tip. She checked in with us three times in a span of two hours, and she wasn't very friendly. Luckily the food and the experience made up for this. We will certainly be back again soon.",1,,

191,Jake S.,"New York, NY",105,174,10,4.0,3/12/2015,"So I have only been to Mel's for drinks / appetizers, so can only comment on that aspect.  They have a pretty nice craft beer selection on tap, which from what my friends say rotates pretty regularly.  They also had a great selection of bottles and cans (many craft / local brews) as well which is always great to see.We went for happy hour and got an order of fries, nachos, and wings, all of which were half off for happy hour.  Nachos were definitely solid and the wings were spicy and delicious. The burgers smelled great - can't wait to go back and try one!",2,1,2
192,Katie W.,"Manhattan, NY",90,4,0,3.0,11/22/2015,"I love this place but today my brunch was pretty awful. I got the $14 waffle with strawberry compote. It was one under cooked floppy waffle with charred bits on the bottom from not cleaning the iron between uses. Compote is an extremely generous adjective for the sugar soaked five pieces of strawberry on top. Side note: the last few times we've come here for dinner and splurged on a half growler, the beer was so flat it was borderline undrinkable.",,,
193,Lori-Ann D.,"Woodbridge, NJ",217,69,37,4.0,7/27/2016,We were a big group and they were very accommodating. They took our drink orders as we checked out the menu. When we began to get our drinks the waitress said a beer which was not mine but I thought she may have misunderstood me a poured me the wrong one. I didn't want to cause I fight so I took the beer. I had Bo Burger but with a veggie burger. They didn't think I wanted the bacon on my burger (an honest mistake since I did order the veggie burger) but when I mentioned I did want it they brought it out very fast. Fries were a bit too salty for my liking. So back to the beer mix up. Our checks come and we realize that they had not heard me wrong they mixed up our orders. Slightly annoying that the beer I wanted to drink was actually on the table. Other than that good spot.,,,

Like, I think I may develop an addiction and friends might have to do an intervention.  Glad I got that out of the way.I originally came here to scope out the space for a private event. the person I dealt with is probably the best events coordinator I've ever had to deal with. My emails were answered promptly.  I had a lot of questions and concerns and he was able to address all of them. I asked to view the space and he told me to come on down and even offered a tasting. I can't turn down the offer of burgers and french fries, so of course I said, ""yes, please"". It's a great space. It's a nicer take on a dinner with a large bar. The small semi-private area in the back with Mel's in big red lights against the wall is perfect for a small group. They can block off different sections of the restaurant for bigger groups.We tried a few sliders, fried pickles, shrimp, french fries, and of course fried Oreo. The price tag for an event with ample food and open bar for 50 is unbelievably reasonable and the buy-out rate sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, we decided to move the event a bit more south. I was really bummed. I loved the space and the person I had to deal with, and the fried Oreos (yes, again with the Oreos. I can't help it). Seriously, I don't think I've ever tasted something so good. The dough tasted like funnel cake and the inside just soft. It was warm and served with a side of ice cream. I did not realize the ice cream until I was half way done with the second Oreo. I liked this place so much that I could not wait to return. Which I eventually did months later. I had the Dirty Mexican, disco fries, and of course deep fried Oreos. Amazing. I went with a group and they loved it. Why can't this place be in my area?My one regret is that I did not get the milkshake....Well, now I have a reason to trek uptown.",6,5,5

It wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't good and it doesn't look anything like the burgers in the pictures here. It was just a few thin slabs of peppered chicken breast on a hard to chew bun. No lettuce or tomato or anything. Maybe it was what I ordered, maybe it was because I got takeout, but I wouldn't order again. Maybe I'd try eating there and eating something different.",,,
