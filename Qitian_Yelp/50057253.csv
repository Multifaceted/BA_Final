0,Dona F.,"Staten Island, NY",26,221,639,4.0,6/20/2018,"Came here with a party of 8 for my birthday. This place came recommended. The service and generosity of the waiter was very commendable. As a rule for every bottle ordered , a cheese plate comes with it. We had ours after the meal. Was a great touch. Muscles in white sauce and organic chicken wings for appetizers. The muscles were good but the wings were amazing. Crunchy with a sweet sauce. I'd go back just to get wings!!I had bolognese pasta. It was good. Sauce a little bitter. My mom wasn't in love with her duck breast. Ahi tuna I heard was excellent. Served over arugula and loaded with pieces of avocado. Pasta with sea food was loved. Pasta primavera was also good. My son loves his salmon. We sat for a long time and was never made to feel rushed. Great choice of restaurant for a larger crowd.",1,,1
1,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,2.0,8/8/2018,"My friends and I came here for brunch at 3pm on Sunday and it was empty. Bottomless brunch ($15 for drinks) is separate with a purchase of ANYTHING on the menu. Sounds decent right? But the food is mediocre and overpriced. We had tuna tartar, mussels, and croissant egg sandwich. The tuna tartar was good! Mussels were extremely salty and not fresh. It was barely touched. The bread it came with was hard like rock. The egg croissant sandwich was something I can easily make at home in 2 minutes. To be honest the mimosa tasted as if they added club soda or selzter to make you feel too bloated to have another glass. After 2 glasses my friends and I all agreed that we felt extremely full and not tipsy at all. I mean if that's how you want to do business. Service was good considering the fact that we were the only table they served. I wouldn't recommend coming here for brunch.",3,2,3
2,Alexis F.,"Bronx, NY",0,50,43,4.0,5/18/2018,"3 times a charm? So they say .. I've been here on different occasions one a date, the two other times girl time and Prosecco. The staff is on point, the food I wouldn't write off and say it's not good but, it's nothing to brag about based on my decisions. One visit I had the burger with fries and the second time I had the turkey burger which neither one wooed me. But would I comeback for drinks and maybe think try something out of my usual for sure, maybe something to nibble on.",,,
3,Paul S.,"Queens, NY",108,335,34,5.0,10/25/2018,"For my purposes and needs, this place is a gem. Although it took 8+ min to be waited on at the bar, I really appreciated the $5 draft happy hour and the ability to use their bathroom (it is super tiny by the way). Staff is very chill and the vibe is temporary but absolutely what I need sometimes in the City.",,,
4,Marissa S.,"San Francisco, CA",4,17,2,4.0,10/26/2018,"Champignon is a great local go-to but it definitely is more ideal in the warmer weather as the interior decor is a little bit lacking. Visited about a week ago and was impressed with the lemon drop cocktails which were totally on point and had a major to kick to them. The appetizers were excellent I highly recommend the artisanal cheese selection, octopus which is served in a tomato base with chick peas and the spinach and artichoke dip. For entrees we shared the veggie burger which was not bad as well as the seared tuna salad which I highly recommend. The food is a solid 7/10 but unfortunately the wait service is a bit slow. Overall I would definitely recommend and especially when the weather is warmer so you can enjoy the patio.",1,,
5,George A.,"Tallahassee, FL",336,91,172,3.0,4/14/2018,So I wanted more outta this place being in NYC and all. It just kinda fell short. Almost gave it a 2. Food: I tried several items cause I was in a big group. I tried 2 wraps and honestly kinda dry and unimpressive. Now I got the burger and that's what bumped it a star. The burger I ordered medium and it was juicy and thick. The bun though was dry and not fresh. Service/decor: The service here was kinda slow and the waitress didn't crack a half smile. Decor was kinda weak with a rustic French theme maybe? And pleaseeee turn on the A/C!!,,,
6,Stephanie N.,"Grand Rapids, MI",92,119,79,3.0,2/17/2018,"My friends and I came here for their bottomless brunch on a Saturday at 1 pm. It was quite empty which was surprising, but we all had mimosas and sangrias. We were told it was $15 for an hour (on the minute) for both, but it's really just for mimosas since sangrias are and extra $5. Since they didn't tell us beforehand they didn't charge us extra which was nice.The prices are very good for their extensive breakfast menu, and the portions were huge for the California omelette and avocado toast! The food itself is nothing special but good enough for the price with the bottomless brunch. Staff was pretty nice too!",1,1,
7,Andy R.,"Wakefield, MA",0,82,0,4.0,11/3/2018,"Excellent food. I ate there 3 times over the last couple of days - breakfast, lunch and dinner. The best meal I had was chicken in lemon and wine sauce. Perfectly cooked and accompanied by fingerling potatoes and veggies. I've cooked red peppers, broccoli and summer squash many times, but they never tasted like this. Increasingly I find people don't know how to cook food - overdone, underdone. The meals I had at Champignon were all above average and nicely presented. I could have lived without the dead flowers on ALL of the tables. But the servers were attentive and struck the right balance of being available without being part of your table. Highly recommend.",,,

10,Lena S.,"San Francisco, CA",245,4,0,5.0,3/28/2018,Went to Champignon on one of the rainiest days in the city. We came inside soaked and there were very few people there. The owner was beyond courteous and helped us hang our coats to dry.We only had about an hour before our show started and they were speedy without us feeling rushed whatsoever. The food was scrumptious. We order steak frites and mussels. Both were perfectly cooked and well seasoned.,,,

12,Corinne K.,"New York, NY",487,125,314,3.0,11/22/2016,"One of my best friends just recently moved to Chelsea, so naturally we had to explore the new 'hood by checking out some brunch places once she was all settled in. She had passed by Cafe Champignon on numerous occasions since her move in and since it had a cute awning, a cute outdoor seating perfect for people watching and a decent enough Yelp rating aka the 3 essentials to any good brunch place, we decided to stop by last weekend. Being it was a brunch and all, drinks had to be had (especially since this place has a pretty dope ""happy hour"" drink special from 12 pm to 8 pm) so hellooooo Passion Mimosa. As for food, everything looked amaaaaazing (as they do when you're a tad bit hungover), but I ended up deciding on the Chelsea Fritatta because it has guacamole and I do everything for the guac. After we decided on what we wanted, we waited for our waiter to stop by to take our order. That never happened. After waiting a good 15 minutes or so, we decided that our waiter most definitely got lost somewhere inside somehow so my growling stomach and I went to search for him. I found him chatting up another waiter inside, so as politely as possible, told him that we were ready to order. He seemed a little annoyed that I had interrupted his conversation (um, okay) and then grudgingly followed me outside where he finally took our order.Luckily for us, the food didn't take nowhere near as long to come as it did to order and soon enough I was devouring my fritatta and mimosa both of which 10/10 would most definitely eat/drink again. After said devouring, we again waited patiently for our waiter to bring over our check, but of course, that never happened. We ended up just telling another waiter that we wanted our check and I guess he somehow found our disappearing waiter because we did indeed get our bill shortly thereafter. While this place definitely would get 5 stars for the food and drankz, it's service ultimately brought my review down to 3 stars. See guys, that's what happens when ya mess with a hungry hungover Corinne. Don't say I didn't warn ya!",3,1,1
13,John M.,"Wantagh, NY",1,250,3,5.0,3/6/2018,"We were on the prowl for food while on our way to Penn when we stumbled across this place.  Very happy that we decided to stop inside.We were immediately greeted with menus by the person who I think was the bartender, and we grabbed two seats by the window.  It was a couple minutes before 7PM so he immediately came back to let us know that happy hour was about to end, in case we wanted anything.  Stuff like that goes a long way.We started with a couple glasses of Cotes de Rhone for $6 a piece.  From there we split a Paradise salad as an appetizer, my wife had the roasted chicken and I had the salmon as our entrees.  Salad was fine, good size and we enjoyed it.  Salmon was cooked perfectly, and the medley of sautéed vegetables it was on top of hit the spot as well.  Chicken was a complete swing and miss.  It looked dry when it came out, and the taste of it was the same.Another place they gained some points was with the cheese.  We ordered a bottle of wine after the initial glasses and we were unaware they had a special going where you got a cheese plate with every bottle of wine.  So about halfway through or entrees the waiter came over to let us know, he didn't need to do this but he wanted to make sure we knew.  Again, stuff like this really matters.  And it was a legit cheese plate.  A few cheeses, fig jam and some bread.If I had one slight issue besides the chicken, it would be with the pours on the last two glasses of wine.  But the behavior of the bartender and waiter, combined with the atmosphere and the salmon still make this a five star place.We are looking forward to trying this place again, and recommend you do the same.",,,

It's like, STFU no one wants to hear your crap when they're eating.  If I said anything, he'd probably tell me to mind my own business yet you're making it everyone's business by being a loud obnoxious douche!  Okay, I just had to say that!Our friendly server brought us the Malbec we ordered and some bread and olives.  Reminded me of Paris.  We ordered the crab cake to start, which was a good size, however, the flavor was underwhelming and the spicy remoulade didn't help.  I ordered the organic half roasted chicken which came out with carrots and kale over creamy mashed potatoes.  The skin was incredibly crispy which I liked, however, the skin was a little too salty, but I ate it anyway because of that crispiness!  Scooter had the lemon chicken which he claimed was very good, especially the sauce!  Everything came out in a timely manner and it was great to just have a relaxing dinner without being interrupted, except for angry guy...LOL!I would definitely come back to explore the menu more!",,,

27,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,4/21/2017,"We stopped here for a drink after an event at Lincoln Center and were instantly taken with the place. It's intimate but not pretentious and a bit classy yet casual at the same time if that makes any sense. I guess it doesn't. There are a ton of cocktails in the $13-$14 range, a large array of hard liquor for $12, and a pretty good beer selection at $7. The owner was there closing the place down and we got to talking. They were in the process of changing their menu from something pretty good to something pretty great. I've read reviews and looked at pictures since the change and see that it was a very successful move.There's a decent happy hour on weekdays - $7 cocktails, $6 glasses of wine, and $5 beers until 7pm. On Saturdays you can add bottomless mimosas and bellinis to your choice of entree for $15, I believe the same deal holds on Sundays.I don't know if I'd consider this place a destination, per se, but I would like to come try the new menu and will always keep it in mind for a quick drink.",4,,

31,Kelsey S.,"Ashburn, VA",0,5,4,5.0,1/13/2018,"Absolutely amazing experience! We found the little wine/Italian bar as a fluke. We had been bar crawling all afternoon after a hockey game and decided to stop in for a drink. We were instantly greeted with a warm welcome and a smile.  Brendan was our waiter and he was great. We left after our drink because we had reservations at another restaurant, but as we were getting ready to leave food was coming out of the kitchen and it smelled delicious! We said that if the restaurant we had reservations at wasn't good we would be back, and no more than an hour and a half later we were back and ordering calamari and pasta.

The food didn't make it out all at the same time either so it just seems like this place may not be equipped to handle a large group. My black and blue burger was decent.

Updated review","This used to be my favorite coffee spot in all of Chelsea. Sadly, it has changed due to a handful of awful experiences. One busy Sunday I came to get a coffee at the counter and the barista told me "" if you just want to get a coffee you should've  gone to Starbucks!"" I was in shock! I usually get a coffee and have no issues. Another time I called to get take out. Whoever picked up the phone put me on hold for ten minutes then said "" we are too busy I'm not taking take out orders"" and hung up. So rude. I get that the place can get busy, but you don't have to be rude about it.. My boyfriend also went for coffee with a colleague and saw a mouse running all over the place. I know it's New York, but that's just gross. I still must admit that the blueberry muffin and coffee brew is the best in all of Manhattan. Unfortunately, they have the worst customer service!",1,,1
41,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",874,1242,25,3.0,3/1/2015,"A touch above a diner in terms of quality and menu selection- the coffee is above average, though. Walter In For sunday brunch at 1pm and the place was busy. Bf and I were seated quickly - albeit tightly- but the service all really slow. I get they were busy but it was really slow... Glasses ever refilled, check took forever, etc. the staff as polite though. Bf had an egg wrap which included egg, turkey bacon and veggie and salad. He said it was really good. I made my own omelet with mushroom, turkey bacon, spinach and feta. I had a nice side of home fries - just potatoes (not fried)  Food was inexpensive - both of our dishes coming to $10 but the right size portion.  Not worth going out of the way but fine for the food and price in the area ..

I was a bit off my usual beaten path this morning and did a double take as I walked past the storefront.I saw the Parisian cafe and gave it a try.  Menu has a significant French accent - crepes and  Croque Monsieur but mostly American standards. I had eggs, sausage, toast, and a side salad instead of fries.  Service was quick and friendly.  Not great but good enough.  Please don't serve warm toast and cold butter.

Had the filet steak BLT salad, seriously amazing, it's a must. My girlfriend had the flatbread, loved it, was light and fresh. Today, oh, let me tell you about today... I wanted a burger, thought about the Champignon burger, but at the last minute our server, Adrian, recommended the au jus sandwich. When I say recommended, I mean his eyes lit up and he couldn't wait to tell me about the challah bad that it came on and just how popular the sandwich is with everyone who tries it. Needless to say, that sandwich is probably the reason I've so quickly grabbed my phone and started this review. If you've ever enjoyed an au jus and have any interest in having another, get on your horse and have this now!",,,1
56,Nikki H.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,271,223,1.0,4/27/2014,Stopped in for breakfast and didn't like this place at all.It was on one of those sunny days where people get super excited that the sun is out and wear shorts and flip flops. I was seated inside and the staff left the door open to allow air to get it. The problem was that it was cold. The waiter asked everyone in the restaurant if they were cold except for me. I sat with my coat on.I ordered eggs and turkey bacon and asked that the eggs be well done. They weren't. The staff wasn't friendly either.I won't be back.,,,

59,Shachar M.,"New York, NY",265,131,45,3.0,6/28/2015,"Honestly this place was my go to place for brunch. We loved the food, service and drinks. This was a 5 star on my list but one day on a sunny Saturday all shifted. couple of months ago I sat down with friends in the inside and before our food arrived we saw a little mouse running all over. We told the staff and they were just laughing and didn't do anything about it. We didn't eat of course and finished our conversation, coffee and left. Since then I only picked up coffee and their amazing blubbery muffin (the best in town for sure!!!)You probably asking by now why 3 star then? The answer is that this place still has the best ice coffee and cappuccino in the area. Affordable prices and nice people.",,,
60,Richard G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,11,0,5.0,11/1/2015,"I have to agree with Helen above. The absolute best lemon chicken and mashed potatoes I've ever had. I had a sour stomach from something I ate last night, was 'recovering' and needed comfort food. I had also just an hour before read a NYTimes recipe of chicken meuniere and was craving it. Found it! Cooked and served perfectly. Staying around the corner on holiday, I'd walked past all weekend SO good. Kind prompt service. I'll definitely be back.",,,
61,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,4.0,9/30/2013,The name intrigued my attention upon the passing of my travels.  This eatery serves both as a Parisian cafe on the right and a rustic coffee bar on the left.  Service is attentive. One onion bagel with butter was toasted which equates to $1.63 (includes sales tax).  A loyalty discount card is available where the tenth meal is free.  I am willing to return to patronize the Parisian cafe to dine in.,,,
62,Aanand S.,"Orefield, PA",202,1,0,1.0,1/1/2015,"I went to this place this past New Years and I can confidently say I was not the only person at the cafe disappointed. Actually disappointed is way too much of an understatement; brunch there ruined quality time on New Years Day, and I beg everyone in the world that comes near this place to the other way and save yourself the misery.We were seated right away, but for some reason, even though the restaurant was not jam packed, it took 20 minutes to even have a waiter come take our order and we had to flag the waiter over.This was brunch and so of course we all got some sort of coffee or atleast water. It took them another 20 minutes to give us our beverages (because I guess it's so hard to poor a beverage) and then they were delivered to is one by one with deliberately slow time, and they still messed up our order. They added an extra coffee to our order by mistake and when we told them we didn't order it, they laughed and took it back... But then tried to charge us for it later. We ordered waters for the table, we were a party of 7, and they only gave us four, and only four of us had silverware.By this time we were getting a bit antsy, but were still in okay spirits. However nobody came by to give us an update as to why everything was taking so long. Around us, other patrons were getting angry and/or waiting to even just get served. Indeed, k think it was only through complaining that you would receive your food.Our food came out in increments, 1 hour incrementsThree of our table for their food before us, and the rest of us got our food an hour later. They later tried to explain that it was because they were appetizers. However none of those that came out earlier were appetizers but entrees. A similar table size that came after us had already left after getting their food by this time. They has complained as well.When we all finally got our food it was not that great, our appetites just were not there, we were hangry, and we had lost a lot of time waiting for it. They also after tried to charge us with a 20 percent service charge. We refused to pay that charge.Every part of this brunch was just wrong, and the best that we got out of this was a story and our first fiasco of 2015. Happy new year.",2,1,

64,Mike S.,"Toledo, OH",2,127,0,2.0,2/1/2016,"Agree with other posters this place has gone downhill.I found out about Champignon a while back on the Dining rewards app.    Coffee was really and so was the pastry I had.Unfortunately they are no longer part of dining rewards so no miles when dining there but not a big deal.   What is a big deal is how they have declined.   They are trying to operate a fancier restaurant next door and the coffee shop has really gone down in quality.   Service is poor, the last two times I was there they had no chocolate raspberry coffee which is the reason I go there, and the selection of pastries was minimal.   It's like they are trying to operate a moderate to upscale restaurant (there's too many of those in Chelsea for them to compete with) instead of the quaint coffee house they were known for",1,,

66,Made In N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0,2.0,10/7/2017,"I have been here twice now, even though I have lived within blocks of it for 20+ years. Crazy right? Both times I have been really disappointed in the food but because it was such a nice evening it just called my name because of the outdoor seating. The service and servers has been very nice both times and I really do feel for them. I am sure if I drank I would have been happier with the food but in both cases there was always something. Last night, a Friday night, we sat down for dinner at around 9 so a bit late. Ordered the mussels which were the only saving grace of the meal as they were really very good. For my main I had there Bistro Caesar Salad which sounded so good on the menu, with pecans, bacon and avocado. Wow! What a let down! The dressing was an awful vinegary cheap, off the grocery store shelf version of a Caesar Dressing. Really awful and somehow from the name ""CHAMPIGNON"" and atmosphere not to mention the prices I expected more. My companion was served her main pasta dish first and somewhere along the way my silverware had been removed after the mussels so even though she offered me a taste all I could was stare. I had to ask for utensils when the salad arrived which is never great. At this point I realized we had never been served or even asked if we would like some bread. I know it is a bit sacrilegious these days but the salad and the vinegary dressing really called for it and this is when I realized why we had not been offered any. Because CHAMPIGNON, could they sound any frencher had run out of bread. They served us some very sad looking pita they had but seriously. Where was the french baguette? And the final nail in the coffin (well it is almost Halloween) came at the end of the meal when we were asked if we would like some coffee and I asked about dessert. 10PM on a Friday night. Completely out of desert. I had to tell myself how It would probably have been pretty bad so I should just think about the money I saved and move on. Which is precisely what I intend to do.",,,

The orders came out rather quickly and they were all decent dishes. Our server seemed newly hired and was a little clumsy and forgetful...we were missing 2 sets of knives and forks, we had to remind him to bring syrup for the French toast and ketchup for the eggs, and he was slow with refills but he always approached our table with a smile. The food was average but no complaints. The one thing that was annoying though was the fact that it is listed as a place that takes reservations but it forgets to mention that it does not on weekends. Considering the fact that I planned on coming for brunch with my family it was rather annoying....but besides that it was an okay experience.",,,

Maybe I should hit the lottery and set up 24 hour coffeeshops throughout the city. I mean come on, after dinner, people who can't or don't want to drink want to head somewhere else like a coffeehouse or teahouse for conversation and Starbucks is your only option which SUCKS major ass and usually have no available seats. Anyways, randomly passed by this place and saw ""COFFEE BAR"" and ""DESSERTS"" sign and decided to come here. We sat outside and server brought out the dessert and coffee menu. Prices are really decent and the desserts were pretty good. Service was ok but not unfriendly or anything like that. We ordered the Creme Caramel and Truffle Chocolate Cake. Both were very good and well-presented and not overwhelmingly sweet which was a plus. Regular coffee and the Americano were also good as well. Not a bad place to stop by for coffee and dessert as an alternative to Starbucks which offers the world's most tasteless, overpriced, and stale desserts/baked items that are NOT made in house and made in a factory.",,,

Croissants were buttery flakey and lots of eggs and turkey bacon. A plus in my book. It's not a dash and run kinda place so you'll have to stick around for them to cook up ya sandwich.Also came by during lunch for their grilled chicken wrap. Fresh avocado's and thousand island dressing. Tasty, refreshing, and a great lunch.

It's tricky finding a place on a Saturday night that isn't too expensive and crowded, yet has good food and service. We found both at Cafe Champignon. I've been to Cafe Champignon several times, but never with a large group. I made the reservation in person and someone later called me back to reconfirm it.  We were 12 people and had several tables in the room away from the bar. It was very pleasant and easy for us to have conversations amongst ourselves without yelling. There's a prix fixe not on the menu of either soup or salad, an entree and a glass of wine. I've had both the salmon salad and the hanger steak. The salmon was a nice medium rare and the hanger steak was beefy and  My guests enjoyed the food and the service (our waitress was Flavia) was prompt and friendly. We were charged an additional 20% for service (which I was planning on tipping anyway), so it was easy to just split the bill. I will definitely be back.",,,

At 3 o'clock, all of a sudden, the music went from background to party decibel level. We were alone in our part of the cafe: the joint was not jumping. It was the middle of the afternoon on a warm, slow July day. We asked the waiter if the music could be turned down. He left and returned with the message that the music could not be turned down because it was now Happy Hour and pounding music, starting at 3pm, was company policy. We were flabbergasted. So, be forewarned: if you want a quiet place for a business meeting or a chat of any kind, come here before 3pm! Sometimes, ok maybe daily, I wonder what NY has become....",,2,

To start, some of the chairs outside have nails sticking out. I snagged a pair of pants and just noticed they actually are ripped (thought they were fine at the time). Watch out. Ordered an omelette, which was awful. Aside from them forgetting the meat, the eggs appear to have been cracked directly into the pan (clear yolk sections were visible and completely flat and dry instead of fluffy). They dumped the veggies, in clumps, let it overcook flat and then folded it in half. Honestly a pathetic attempt at an omelette.

Now this cafe is more than just a coffee shop. They have a simple menu with a focus on crepes, as well. So there are kind of two different experiences you could have here. One would just be the in and out coffee shop with basic pasterties. The other wooukd be the small menu cafe.As a coffee shop, its good. Not really much memorable, but nothing to apologize for either. The only negative is that the pasteries look FAR better than they taste. They look absolutely incredible, like a cover of a gourmet magazine, but taste somewhat bland and immemorable.As far as a little restaurant goes, the menu items I ordered were surprisingly better than the prepared food.

107,Helen F.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,4.0,9/19/2015,"I've lived a block away from this spot for almost 10 years. In that time, they had some changes, renovations, etc. They used to have the BEST burger in NYC. This was 5 or so years ago... Huge portion of quality beef or turkey meat that was perfectly seasoned. I'd order it in at least twice a week. The fries were very good too. Food was always delivered within a half hour or so and came piping hot with a lovely delivery person.One day, I show up for dinner there and ordered it. The recipe changed and it was disgusting. Frozen commercial beef (I think, I hope) patties, no seasoning obviously. Other things I were also no longer tasty. So, I stopped coming here for a few years because the food in general was low in quality and the staff was both inattentive, incompetent and rude- a winning combo in a service industry.Last night, I met a few colleagues who gathered there, at the last minute. I had no expectations for staying for dinner, just a quick drink. I was enjoying my time with them and decided to order something because I was starved.I had the Lemon Chicken entree with mashed potatoes. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Best meal out that I can remember in months. I'd have licked the plate if I could. A bit pricey at $19 for the dish, but it was a very generous portion of two perfectly sauteed chicken breasts and delicious mash with a heavenly lemon caper butter sauce. I mean, that sauce. I might go have it for dinner again tonight. Service was meh at best, quite inattentive especially for less than half of the tables being occupied. Watered-down drinks upwards of $11-12 but that's nothing newsworthy in NYC.So, the Lemon Chicken. Get it now.",1,,

109,Robert C. Y.,"New York, NY",54,328,18,4.0,9/17/2010,"Came here for the first time last evening, enticed by the prix fixe for $19.95 that gets you soup or salad and a rather nice glass of wine.  We recognized our waiter from another restaurant and he made us extremely welcome.  We sat outside for some great people watching.  I ordered the hanger steak and salad.  My SO ordered the chicken picatta and gazpacho soup.  We both had a glass of a nice dry French rose.  My salad was crisp and large with a good vinaigrette.  The gazpacho soup was, how you say, magnifique.  Please don't tell a soul but it is better than I make, and I am extremely proud of my gazpacho.  And it was a bowl, not one of those stingy little cups.The entrées were large portions and really good.  The steak came with beautiful pommes frites that were crisp and fresh.  The chicken sat alongside creamy ""real"" garlic mashed potatoes (they were decidedly real potatoes because I hunted through them to find some lumps and I did).  There were also sautéed veggies that included two tender asparagus spears. This prix fixe is the real deal and the third item on the list is a rather hefty portion of salmon.  We even roped in a group of people from Boston and I can bet that they were glad we did..They have a little pastry shop next door that should satisfy any dessert maven.To paraphrase Arnold ""We'll be back!""",,,
110,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,4.0,1/17/2010,"Cafe Champignon is the border where Italy and France meet. Wait, let me check my geography...Ok, they do share a common border.This is not strictly a French restaurant although it shares the feel of fellow bistros-- small aka cozy, an extensive wine list, hand written chalk boards, an overall relaxed vibe where the staff leaves you alone to chat and linger long after the last morsel of dessert has been digested. Those are good things.You can find pate, smoked fish, charcuterie and cheese platters here along with steak au poivre. But for the Italian enthusiast there's also a pasta section. My little eye spied quite a few orders of the penne a la vodka with happy eaters.I wasn't feeling like pasta (And would need to a see a shrink if I genuinely *felt* like pasta)  and was feeling frugal so the $19.95 prix-fixe was an attention grabbing headline I couldn't resist. For 19.95, one receives a glass of house red or white wine, soup or salad, hanger steak/salmon/chicken piccata. My red, red wine: created the perfect buzz to see Eddie Izzard later that night.My salad: balance was struck between the red (tomato) and the green (lettuce). A light coating of vinaigrette made the greens go down easier. My chicken piccata: A voluptuous butterflied breast of chicken, a healthy scoop of mashed potatoes and the obligatory twigs of asparagus and carrots. (Vegetables are always a necessary evil). The mixture of capers, lemon and drippings made  for a very tasty sauce that found its way on the mashed potatoes as well. So covetous of the breast was I that I had to reach over and claim a bit of my fiancee's. (Chicken , that is. )The dessert fruit tart had me convinced this was an extremely healthy meal. How else to consider strawberry, kiwi, blueberry and raspberry atop a tart?The 19.95 prix fixe is worth a try. With most desserts in the 6.95 range, Champignon won't break the bank. And for a bistro style establishment, there's a respectable distance between tables so you can proceed with your plotting and scheming in private.",2,3,
111,Brian C.,"New York, NY",29,80,22,4.0,11/9/2011,"Champignon not only pours a good cup of coffee, but also has some decent food. Earlier today, I decided to eat lunch there for the first time. Typically I'll grab a coffee and something small like a muffin. Today I reluctantly ordered a burger thinking it would be a mistake only to find out that it was pretty damn good! The place is a friendly, chill neighborhood standby. Free wi-fi makes it ideal for weekday afternoons when it isn't too crowded.",4,,1

113,Lenny S.,"New York, NY",113,99,0,4.0,10/13/2014,"Saturday breakfast after a special reunion night in NYC. Rez for 13, that alone was amazing. Menu is NYC normal pricing. 10$$ average for most items. Some more, a few less. Not out of hand for the zip code at all. French slant, crepes, omelettes and plenty of other choices.. Coffee was excellent. Read: Strong and dark. Great looking pastries behind the coffee brewing area, did not try them but looked fantastic.Service was attentive, a little slow but we were in no rush. All the items looked good, and the groups review was all positive. Several crepes, an eggs benedict, and so on, all with thumbs up. Couldn't split the bill 13 ways, understandable, so we did the math.I'd recommend it, the other smaller tables for two looked cozy, with a nice outdoor seating area, it was rainy the day we visited but we would return. We walked here from 30th & 7th and other than Starbucks and some small fast food spots, this appeared to be one of the larger and nicer places we passed.No idea about the menu other than breakfast. Something for every palette was available for sure!",,,

115,Julia S.,"New York, NY",0,52,0,3.0,3/8/2016,"Stumbled upon this place by chance on Sunday afternoon.  We were a party of 8 - 4 adults and 4 kids.  We were seated by the window which was nice.  The menu is pretty simple but diverse - pastas, salads, sandwiches, soups and a few appetizers.  The service was not super fast but we weren't in a hurry.  You should know that the portion size is very generous here.  I ordered fired calamari appetizer but the amount was way more than the usual appetizer plate.  Kids enjoyed it too.  Juice is poured in tall glasses (and not the small glasses that are often given to kids in other places but nevertheless charging $5 a glass).  The average plate price was about $15.  Everybody in our party liked it.",,,
116,Nel A.,"Manhattan, NY",53,393,17,3.0,7/25/2012,"Good service. Great ambiance for me because, we were the only group there the whole time from 830pm to closing, and they didn't bother us. It was weird to see other big groups come and go while we still dilly dallied :)We shared a bottle of the cote du rhone. Very good. The seared tuna salad, tuna tartare, crostini were delicious. I especially liked the mushroom crostini. Mmmmm. The steak au poivre was really peppery and delicious. We had it well done. I'd get it medium next time. The chicken was good, too much mashed potatoes accompanied it (but those were very tasty mashed potatoes so I didn't totally mind).  The lobster ravioli good but nothing special. And finally the filet mignone was perfect. We were also sent a beet salad complements of the chef (prob thanking us for being the only people in the restaurant? ), it was ok :) thank you for the thought. Desserts...of course we had desserts...Creme brûlée was quite tasty. The key lime tart was good but the berry sauces garnishing the plate over powered the lime flavor of the tart :( the tiramisu needs a complete makeover. Take it off the menu or make it better. I'm sure you can do it. The dessert menu is quite extensive. Unless you are buying the desserts from a bakery, no restaurant should have so many choices. Hehehe. Cut it down to 3 or 4 and change the options in the diff days if possible. Or get rid of all desserts that aren't French cuz this is a French restaurant right? Quality over quantity.",,,

My friend had a very lackluster dulce de leche crepe for $7. It was pasty/gummy, small, and cold. Furthermore, the service was poor - maybe they were understaffed?",1,,
118,keith g.,"New York, NY",4,10,0,4.0,10/26/2012,This is my go-to place for delivery during the week. They did a major renovation on the interior of the restaurant and in my opinion made the place completely unattractive with bistro tables that are difficult to seat more than 2 people. But the food is still pretty good despite the bad looking interior.Lentil soup stands out. Salmon is very nice and the salads are great-  the lamb burger is a winner as well.Wines are good and inexpensive. Delivery is within 1/2 hour usually.,,,

122,Marc H.,"New York, NY",4,8,0,1.0,2/19/2012,"This place is way overpriced, typically very crowded and the personnel is really unfriendly. Champignon clearly benefits from the fact that it is near a busy hospital and there are only places like Dunkin Donuts or diners around it.",,1,

I think its a perfect spot for harmless snack or coffee during a date. It has great coffee, fresh pastries, and two cute benches for restful outdoor seating- cute and easy!I got a cold prosciutto with red bell peppers sandwich and lobster bisque while my friend got genoa salami, black forest ham, and turkey sandwich. Iced coffee for drinks. All really good! I felt the bread was a bit dry but everything came out within 5 minutes, they put a GENEROUS amount of salami and ham in my friend's sandwich (about 10 slices each)- no complaint!Will come back for casual coffee and snacks :)",1,,
124,Tracie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,2,0,1.0,10/10/2014,"The place and food was good , but Flavia is the worst waitress I've ever had though. She brought drinks never cleared the empty plates and after 20+ min of waiting I had to get up and go ask for the bill. She's generally disinterested in her tables and her tip reflected that . Not worth visiting again. Ppl like her ensure I'll never be back here again. I love wine bars but I suggest you skip this one. This was out second stop on that night and we definite should've just kept walking.",,,

Their smoothie was watered down and I couldn't even taste any of the fruits or flavoring in it. I couldn't even bear to finish it; the more I drank of it, the worse the taste seemed to get.",,,
127,Amy W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,0,1.0,3/28/2012,"This place gives a new definition to SLOOOOOOOOW Food!Waiter service was fine, we got seated right away, all the waiters were nice and polite and did nothing wrong, hence the one star here. To be fair, the food was not bad.  We tried the country pate (which i did like), stuffed pork chop and fried calamari (both were ok, lot of fat on the pork chop, but it wasn't bad in anyway, though it didn't come with the spinach side as listed, we were given asparagus instead when the meal finally came out). But i will NEVER go back there.  We waited about 50 minutes for our food. And we weren't the only ones. Looking around the restaurant, we noticed everyone else were also waiting for their food.  Not sure if this is typical for this place, but i would not be tempted to go back to find out.  We had movie tickets for 8pm, we got to the restaurant at 6:30 (5 minutes away from the theater), thinking we have plenty of time. But we ended up missing the movie :(",,,

(I've rarely visited in the afternoon or evening.) Two thumbs up for their tasty house coffee, well-made breakfast sandwiches and selection of traditional, low-fat and fat-free muffins (including unique flavors like carrot and lemon poppy). I've never used them as a caterer, but I wouldn't hesitate. The menu's got plenty of variety, with nice breakfast, bagel and luncheon platters.There's a cute little 2-seat table right by the front window I'm dying to settle into.

We usually go with the prixe fixe but the other options on the menu make you double guess it. Last time was the pork chops or Duck breast in a fig port sauce. All of these by the way are under $20!The Prixe Fix you get a very nice and fresh house salad with vinaigrette or fresh soup(haven't tried their soup yet) Glass of tasty red or white house wine and either Hanger steak with a huge serving of Pomme Frit and fresh roasted carrots and asparagus, Chicken Picatta and I believe an Salmon dish.  Yes, all this for $19.95! We always seem to get the cheese plate after for desert with Cheve, Petite Basque, Manchego, Brie,fresh apple, fig preserve, spiced walnuts and crackers.I can't begin to tell you how good the food is here  for the price you just can't beat it!

In warm weather it is a great place to sit outside and watch the never ending parade of characters that  populates Chelsea . It is not a great idea to come to a place like this and expect to find very good pasta . There are plenty of Italian places in the area if that is what you want . But if you seek a pretty good burger, an excellent salad, a glass of wine or mixed drink followed by a very good cup of coffee, then you will do well here .

144,Cindi W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,11,9,1.0,6/30/2015,"Came here with a party of 5 on a Sunday. It was the day of the NYC Pride March, right on the heels of the news of nationwide marriage equality. I understand they were overwhelmed because of the extra business, but the service was SO SLOW. And the place wasn't packed to capacity. First, we ordered an appetizer of guacamole and they gave a portion barely enough for one person. I think they could have been more generous considering 5 people were sharing it and all ordering individual meals and drinks so spending a decent amount of money. I understand there is a set portion and you need to order multiple to feed a big party, but again, the portion size was barely fair for one person! And the guacamole was sub-par, guess that's what you get for ordering it in a French cafe. The portion sizes in general were too small and the food didn't taste particularly amazing; definitely not worth the high prices they charge. After the appetizer, it took another 20 minutes to half hour for the entrees to be served, and then, THEY FORGOT AN ENTREE. They didn't say whether it was going to be coming out in a minute or what, just completely disregarded it. I had to give the waitress a dirty look several times to get her attention. She then went to the kitchen to check on it and found out they don't have certain ingredients to make that particular entree. I was fuming. How could you not notify the patron immediately after they order about this? Instead she made us wait the lengthy amount of time for the other entrees to be served and then an additional 10 minutes til she investigated it, only to find out they couldn't even make that dish. They made an alternative dish and I demanded compensation for our time and inconvenience, which was granted by the owner and manager, who both came to our table. The dish that was delayed was not charged for, which was only fair. But they DID charge a 15-16% service charge and it was not mentioned anywhere on the menu that this was their policy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",,,

My friend got the primavera and also really enjoyed itThe waitress was kind of absent, but since we were just there for a quick meal it wasn't a big deal.

I know, you think I am exaggerating but if you still do after you've tasted them, then you know something that we, mere mortals, don't (please share!). They are truly exceptional.We've also tried most of the brunch dishes (eggs Benedict, omelet, pancakes) but were disappointed. Pretty boring stuff.They also have nice freshly squeezed fruit juices and smoothies. Service is OK, prices are reasonable.Overall, a solid option if you are in the neighborhood.",,,

It's two pieces of bread and some meat, not oil poaching quail eggs, people. I mean, they didn't have to toast bread or even add cheese for this food item. No decent restaurant/cafe should NOT be able to deliver a cold sandwich in less than 20 minutes during lunch rush. You usually prepare extra sandwiches in case you do get a lunch rush. A customer usually ordersq a cold sandwich because it's fast, and ideally also delicious. Fast, and delicious. Not too much to ask. We also had to remind them to make our iced teas while we waited. Cute spot, terrible counter service and order execution. The staff is nice, but they look completely overwhelmed and undertrained.",,,

Instead of the typical ""What would you like"", Eduardo (the man who opened and refurbished the cafe many years ago) invited me to sit down and rest a minute. It was such a relief to have someone take the 3 seconds it takes to actually view me as a person, rather than just another customer. The coffee and ambiance was wonderful and I talked to Eduardo for a bit about my trip. He was even kind enough to offer me a fresh Valentines day cookie for the extra energy on my trip (I pretty much walked the length of Manhattan).",,,

Solid wine and beer selection (no liquor) and after ordering two drinks, they become nicely generous about topping you off (at least that's been my experience!)The atmosphere is super relaxed...there is no rushed feeling here.   If you are looking for a quick in and out place, let them know when you get there.  Otherwise, don't hate on the relaxed vibe!",,,

The dude clearly asked if it was to stay or to go. We said - to stay. We didn't have time for table service, and its notoriously slow here. It's a nice day, we went outside to sit. The dude at the counter did not stop us - it was NOT busy whatsoever.A waitress comes out, and in all honesty, ""scolds"" us. We are eating food from your establishment, from the deli, and its not busy. Why can we not sit here. There were no signs that said ""Table Service Only"" and there was no indication that we were not allowed to sit there. We were spoken to like 5 year olds, and being grown adults who have just purchased our lunch from your establishment, that's absolutely ridiculous, whether or not you are serving us, you are still a representative of that company.Food was good, would never go back based on the treatment we received.

We heard an entire conversation revolving around dental work and a failing marriage....Anyway, we both ordered pasta dishes and they were satisfactory. I had the penne a la vodka, and the pasta was too well done so it was mushy and hard to get on the fork. It was also cold in places. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead if three is because the service was rude and short. They did the minimum amount they needed to do and weren't very nice about it.

But, being that I had no idea what frack he was referring to,  he felt the need to tell where we were.Well, anyway we found a cute little place. They had great coffee. My hubby ordered the organic oatmeal with fruit and I had the eggs on croissant. The oatmeal was the best we've ever had in a restaurant. It was creamy and porridge like, adorned with bananas, strawberries and blueberries. It was so so good just lightly sweetened with brown sugar. I should have ordered that too.Now the croissant was a different story. They had microwaved the croissant, yuck. Although the it tasted like a real butter croissant, it was not flakey and tender. Instead, it had a tough and rubbery texture much like butter flavored rubber bands. the eggs were eggs, nothing special. Someday, we'll comeback and I won't order the croissant.",4,1,4

My chicken piccata, a generous serving,  was very tangy with a great lemon sauce and lots of capers.We enjoyed a very pleasant bottle of Albarino from a moderately priced wine list.Overall, prices at Champignon are modest...an important consideration after being pillaged by the movie theater.Overall, good quality, pleasant ambiance, at decent, almost cut-rate prices.

In fact, because it's relatively close to where I work, it has become the ""Jesus, I'm too hungover to walk much further"" place to go for lunch on Fridays. And there are hangover cures aplenty. My favorite is the dry poppyseed bagel and lentil soup. The soup is good and thick and...lentil-y. There is a ton of seating, so I can always slump over and pretend I'm looking at a magazine when I'm actually thinking about all the drinks I will never have again and considering a lifestyle in which drinking is replaced by actual hobbies, perhaps a craft like needlepoint or decoupage.Minor detail, but they have mirrors all over the place.

I managed to finish 2/3 of the steak and doggy bagged the remaining of the hearty portion.I can't say enough how good the food was, even if I was expecting a French meal.The host was very accommodating when we requested to finish the bottle of wine at the outside sitting area where we can smoke.

If you look at the pix below, the one of the left of the pastry shelf is from the cafe, not the restaurant.  The middle one is also the cafe, and the one on the right is the outdoor seating of the restaurant. The restaurant is a sweet little bistro with a laid-back vibe and a french feel.. The food is very good, and reasonably priced. The waitstaff is very friendly.  The service can be slow, as I think the kitchen is tiny. Once we have a glass of wine in hand,  we like the slow pace and leisurely dining, but if you're in a hurry, my suggestion is to tell the waitstaff before sitting down and asking if that's going to be an issue.One thing I love about this place is that it's quiet.  So if you're a loudmouth reading this review, please stay away.There is outdoor sidewalk seating in the summer.",2,,

The food took about 30 minutes to get to the table.  Not awful.  But, when it got there, the Turkey burger was room temperature, at best, with barely melted cheese and fries that were limp and cold.  My friends Eggs benedict was a touch better but the home fries were not hot at all.
