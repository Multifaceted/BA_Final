0,Olivia M.,"New York, NY",28,100,320,5.0,9/25/2018,Really not sure how this place has such low ratings. I eat here all the time. Come at 5pm for half off the sushi and hot bar. Roasted veggies and grilled salmon and allll the possible salad toppings. Once I walked in and there was a massive whole halibut that you can take pieces off of. The pics I'm posting are from different days. I'm gonna go again and take some more pics now that I know this place is so poorly rated lol,,,
1,Nelson L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,82,60,4.0,8/16/2018,"I've been getting lunch from here occasionally. I like Chinatown much more but since this place is closer to my workplace I come here quite often. There aren't many options in Fidi, so this 4 star is a relative 4 star.The food is decent. The portions are okay.I've never had any issues with the staff.",,,
2,Cody B.,"Austin, TX",95,6,0,2.0,7/22/2018,"Can someone PLEASE tell me when they stop serving breakfast on the weekends? We've gotten:""We serve breakfast all day on the weekends but ..."" ""We are out of eggs."" ""We are out of vegetables."" ""We only make breakfast sandwiches.""""The griddle is dirty."" ""The griddle is broken."" ""We stop at 11."" ""We stop at 10.""""We stop at 12.""",,,
3,Diana T.,"Brooklyn, NY",400,135,256,4.0,6/29/2018,"The rating is for the buffet only. I come here whenever I want some buffet style food. I feel like the buffet food here is more fresh compare to the other places in the area. They also have other varieties and types of food there. Ramen, burgers, sushi, mexican place, and a huge variety of drink collections.",3,,
4,G B.,"Kenilworth, NJ",11,760,4908,1.0,11/2/2018,place is kinda dirty. tables r so sticky and have crumbs all over. there was a bag of trash on a table. no one threw it away and people wanted to sit there. they need to get that in check a bit better. they only thing i liked is that they have a big selection of packaged snacks and bottles of water when i need.,,,
5,Teresa V.,"New York, NY",153,170,808,3.0,4/15/2018,"Chances are if you work in the area, then Open Market isn't so bad. If you're visiting--especially over the weekend--then I recommend searching for a different place to make your visit more worth it. Think of it as, would you go to Chipotle for lunch/dinner if you're visiting a new city? This is a convenient location with nearly anything your body could possibly be craving for, which also makes it a great place to hit up for lunch with co-workers. The food quality is basically what you can expect from a cafeteria so don't compare it to a restaurant. Prices are fair and if you come in after 5 PM then everything is half off.",,,
6,Saya N.,"San Francisco, CA",26,8,0,5.0,10/28/2018,"Nice place. Coll deal after 5pm 50% off the food, ask them more about the deal. Liked the food out there. Nice spot like it a lot",,,
7,Jenny X.,"Manhattan, NY",44,11,17,4.0,10/26/2017,"What's there to say about Open Market? It's probably the best hot food/salad bar I've encountered, seeing how I've almost been going here exclusively whenever I buy lunch at work. I think it comes down to a good, wide selection that tastes fresh, well-made, and generally not too heavy/greasy. Give it a try! (Of course as other reviews have noted, there are so many other options here, too, but the cold/hot food bar is my go-to.)Docking a star because sometimes I see flies. Gross... but #letmelivetho.",2,,
8,Mengjia Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",45,178,801,5.0,3/3/2018,"It has discount every day after 5pm. The tuna, fresh fruit is excellent. Also the salmon is great.",,,
9,Brian C.,"Austin, TX",81,140,717,4.0,4/17/2017,"A versatile lunch spot if you're not quite sure what you're feeling and down in FiDi. Selection and variety are the greatest assets of this place. You've got food ranging from your standard salad and hot food buffet bars, to deli sandwhiches and stir fry. Oh and word to the wise, this place gets busy during the lunch hour, so either go early or late if you want to avoid having to fight through the large droves of people.First time here I had a turky sandwhich, and it was like Thanksgiving! The turky was moist and not dry, had cranberry sauce, and the bread/vegtables were a good compliment to it all. The mainstay I have here is the stir fry for sure though. It's not the best of ingredients, and a little heavy on the soy sauce, but still solid for lunch at $8. The ramen is also solid enough, but nothing to write home about, I'd definitely get the stir fry if you're on the fence between the two.",1,,1
10,Felix C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",0,10,12,1.0,2/26/2018,If I could give them 0 Stars I would! I purchased just salad for my coworker. About 10 mins of consuming the salad she had to run to the Rest Room to through it all up... yeah I know just horrible. It turns out when she looked at the Kale it appeared to have mold growing on it. Just look at your salad thoroughly if you must purchase from this spot.In general look at what your about to eat before you eat it... well I smell everything!,1,1,
11,Jordan K.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,9,4,1.0,10/23/2018,"served raw omelet , did not refund or address, tossed it wrote it off, Going to write more words here to fill up more space because otherwise you won't let me post this review this is too short but this is the key point there's nothing else to say",,,
12,Kacee S.,"Bronx, NY",54,6,0,1.0,7/25/2018,"They ruined my lunch by squirting a bunch of sriracha all over my food AFTER they asked if I wanted my stir fry spicy and I CLEARLY told them no. It's completely inedible, and I don't have time to go back and get it corrected. I ended up giving it away. It shouldn't be this hard to get an order right when you're taking them one at a time.",,,
13,Jingting W.,"Hayward, CA",82,142,653,5.0,5/19/2017,"Came in here for coffee and I was amazed by the variety that Open Market offered. They had an appetizer bar, a salad bar, a cafeteria-like line for BBQ items and such, and of course, a coffee bar. Imagine this place as a fancy cafeteria with food that looked really good! The coffee bar had many options for types of coffee, creamer, milk, and sugar, and it was pretty cheap for a large cup of coffee.",1,1,1
14,Andrew A.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,180,49,3.0,5/23/2017,"Open Market is pretty much a fresh, new look on your standard lunch place, with sandwich/grill lines, salad bar and made to order salad. I've tried both salad and some of the sandwiches here. It is solid and not a bad choice, but nothing majorly different from other places that offer similar fare. Couple that with a B rating, and 3 stars seems like a fair call.",1,,
15,Ray H.,"Bronx, NY",107,138,50,2.0,10/26/2017,Popped in here on a busy work day to grab a quick breakfast. They have pretty much everything here that you can think of for breakfast. I ordered a veggie omelet which was pretty good in my opinion. The only reason I'm giving this place two star rating is because of my interaction with one of the employees when I checked out. I asked a few simple questions and he seemed like he was irritated. I'm guessing the questions I asked were simple. I get it's early but it's early for everyone. I'm big on customer service and I think he could have across a little more friendly. There's a lot of competition with breakfast spots here and I probably won't return because of the customer service experience I had my first time.,2,,
16,Yuk C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,12,8,1.0,11/6/2017,Arugula salad prepped for 11/6/17 comes with a long strand of hair at the buffet. Gross.,1,,
17,A H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,9/5/2018,I haven't had a salad here in over a year... what happened to the quality??!! I was shocked. The lettuce was old and the ingredients had a stink to them. So sad that I wasted $10 here. Will need to find something else to eat :(,,,
18,Alon M.,"New York, NY",83,16,19,3.0,6/2/2018,Good bodega style food. Really shines after 5pm weekdays when there buffet is half price and they have the fresh roast meats out there,,,
19,Corinne B.,"Hoboken, NJ",314,123,196,3.0,11/8/2017,Some things are hit or miss but for this sort of place there are a lot of food options and a wide beverage selection. Salad bar is always good for some variety at lunch.,,,
20,Ame B.,"Manhattan, NY",53,10,0,2.0,4/26/2018,"So I would sometimes come here for lunch and even though it's a little pricey, they have a lot of variety and options.  I was waiting for a while in the Korean food line for Kimbpap.  There were other people standing near me and cut me in line not clear of where the effing line is. It's like it's already taking time to make our dish and then other people go ahead of me not even asking if others ordered or are in line. It's not even clear with the set up. I'm already hungry and pissed off and cursed underneath my breath. Make it clear of where the people need to line up, not have it be some ambiguous corner so others aren't cutting without realizing it. Not that hard.",,,

23,Alex H.,"Philadelphia, PA",18,34,19,4.0,10/23/2017,"This is a pretty decent buffet place for the neighborhood. Not a ton of seating during lunch hour, but a wide variety of food options. The grilled chicken plate is good! Tasty crispy chicken & sweet sautéed zucchinis.",,,
24,Ray L.,"Manhattan, NY",57,98,80,5.0,12/13/2016,"The go to lunch spot for Wall St. regulars working in the area. They feature different stations serving everything from salad, ramen, Korean, sandwiches and a very fresh and well appointed buffet. Great spot if you're not sure what you want and more likely than not, they will have something on your mind for lunch. I visit here at least 3x a week since it is right by my office. They also have soup, coffee and an oatmeal station in the mornings. Gets very crowded prime time at 12:30-1 but the lines and service moves quickly. The buffet is a favorite and there is a slight variation from day to day. Buffet is FRESH and most dishes made extremely well. A very good weekday lunch resource.  This is the Swiss Army knife for workday lunches. I would be lost without this place.",2,1,
25,C C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",2,108,64,3.0,9/12/2017,"Quick and polite service! I came in for a fresh green juice, I was able to build my own. 1 base and 4 fruit/vegetable options. The price was moderate for a medium in Manhattan. Enjoyed it. I will return to try the food!",,,
26,Michele P.,"Lyman, SC",84,184,91,4.0,8/2/2017,"i went here several times for lunch and once for dinner.  The buffet was very good.  It had so many choices and every seemed very fresh and well cooked.  Everything I was great,  The buffet has such a variety that I feel everyone should be able to find something to their liking.  I would definitely go back here if I work in the area.  I would recommend this place.",,,
27,Dayna C.,"Brookline, MA",3,15,1,1.0,3/22/2018,"The most wasteful eatery! Each person receives food in plastic container, given plastic utensils, in a plastic bag, that is thrown out into the trash right outside their doors within 10 min of receiving. PLEASE CONSIDER BIODEGRADABLE CONTAINERS AND UTENSILS. Even a quick throw away plastic sample cup is used to ""try your smoothies"". How about paper cups?? I've watched this for months and months and won't be coming here anymore until things have changed. I have also managed to spread my concerns to my entire office to say no to open kitchen as well. Shame on you- I hope your practices change.",,,
28,Jennifer E.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,6,0,1.0,3/19/2018,Salad bar is extremely low quality. Produce is not fresh. Grilled chicken pieces are tiny and overcooked (like chicken flavored pellets in your salad).,,,

32,Taylor Y.,"New York, NY",0,9,1,1.0,4/4/2018,"False advertisement on their sign saying 50% off. Manager Andrew Cho (212)785-5555 said 'the sign is wrong, and you are correct, but I will not honor it for you'. He wasted my time, was rude, and on principle lied. Not worth your time to come to this poor establishment. Would give zero stars if possible.",1,,
33,Ofunne O.,"New York, NY",2,57,120,3.0,11/28/2017,"Yea this place, Open Kitchen, as we like to call it, is just average. Overly expensive, but then again, look where it's located. You can get better food elsewhere for far better prices than here. I will say, that I enjoy their calamari when it is available. Just be mindful of the time you come, this place can become so packed. I wouldn't say don't eat here, give it a chance, what do you have to lose.",,,
34,Olivia B.,"New York, NY",0,91,1,4.0,12/3/2017,"Great stir fry! The lines get long during weekday lunches but at least the food is hot. The pizza here is surprisingly good as well.I had to knock off one star because the service on the weekend is a complete 180, despite the fact that there is significantly less foot traffic. The line for breakfast sandwiches is so unorganized and the employees are so unhelpful.",,,
35,Sissi L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/10/2018,"Food is ok. Be mindful of the price. They will bump up the price during check out - the price of buffet food being weighted does not equal to the actual amount charged. They overcharged 1 dollop or two, thinking that people would not notice. Today after I finished my food I took a look at the price and it said 11.65 but I remembered the cashier said 12.68 so I checked my credit card and yes I was charged $12.68. I guess they just assume you don't pay attention. The chaser didn't ask me if I wanted a receipt or not. Is this how the business make money? Always ask for a receipt.",,,

37,Megan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,7,0,5.0,5/5/2017,"I love this place. You can pretty much order whatever you want, and they'll make it for you. The best thing is that it's cheap without compromising quality. Great place to stop in for a quick breakfast or lunch. The service is really good, and I especially appreciate the guys at the breakfast counter in the morning. Even when it's slammed, they make sure to get your order right, and always wish you a good day. The hard work they do in serving busy, cranky New Yorkers on their way to work really shows.",1,,

41,Peter C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,1.0,5/10/2017,"I just got the shrimp from the buffet. You guys need to clean the sh*t out before you serve it. This is disgusting. Lunch ruined. ...UPDATE: I got the shrimp again after a few months and the poopy shrimp situation was solved, but alas, it is now a handful of months after that, and the poop has reappeared in the shrimp.
