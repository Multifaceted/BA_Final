0,Meredith R.,"Marietta, GA",492,697,0.0,4.0,10/26/2018,"Good Jewish delis where I live in Marietta GA are.... non-existent!  The Second Avenue Deli (albeit in a relocated spot) is a NY institution.Delicious pastrami.  Delicious corned beef.  And as we learned from our last takeout order, excellent matzoh ball soup.  Sandwiches come with sour pickles and to our surprise, they threw in mini black-and-white cookies.Sandwiches are expensive.  A little cheaper than Katz's, but quality -- particularly in Manhattan -- comes at a price.",,1,
1,Amos Y.,"Somerville, MA",265,112,170,4.0,10/15/2018,"Delicious Pastrami. I had the 2nd Ave Specialty of Twin Double - with a  really generous stack of hot Corned Beef and hot Pastrami. Be sure to get there early as seating is quite tight and packed. Its a tourist spot as well as a local favorite. They provide free cabbage salad and pickles which is a plus. I also go to try their potato pancakes with applesauce, Matzoh Ball Soup. The service was great the waiter was very nice and was helpful throughout the whole service. The only downside is that, the menu prices are quite steep in general. Other than that I thought it was a great Deli - must try lunch spot.",,,
2,John C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,122,19,5.0,10/7/2018,"2nd Avenue is the Pastrami Standard!I grew up visiting NYC as a child, and we try to go back every few years, primarily to eat. For deli we have eaten at Katz's and Carnegie but for us 2nd Avenue is the prefect neighborhood New York City Jewish Deli.Now don't get me wrong. Katz's serves a very respectable pastrami sandwich. I am not a fan of their potato salad, but now I am nitpicking. So did Carnegie before they closed. But 2nd Avenue is a little smaller and a whole lot friendlier. Maybe less tourists -- I am not sure. But it seemed a bit more welcoming, like a neighborhood diner that you've been going to all of your life. At least that is the way they make us feel every time we go.They have all of the your Kosher deli favorites, so if you are not a fan of Pastrami, you poor lost soul, you will be able to find something else. Great egg creams too!",5,,2
3,Alexis B.,"Nashville, TN",775,2101,4258,4.0,10/15/2018,"Until this past week, I hadn't been to 2nd Ave Deli in years. And it was just like I remembered: a classic, traditional Kosher deli. My husband and I stopped by for a late breakfast/early lunch. Hot pastrami on rye for him; noodle kugel for me. Black coffee. Health salads and pickle sample (on the house). Complimentary chocolate soda to end the meal. 2nd Ave Deli is just a classic. Definitely worth a stop if you like deli and love to visit old school NYC spots.",1,,
4,Ayumi S.,"Pasadena, CA",4082,1092,1783,4.0,9/15/2018,"Bf wanted a giant pastrami sammich, so onto Yelp I went and found this gem.Service was quick, the waiters and waitresses were great, and the food was delicious!We split the: 4. Hot Pastrami, Corned Beef, wide Salami, cole slaw and Russian dressing $28.95-They gave us the cole slaw first and a few pickles as well. The sammich is a bit difficult to eat, but it was still tasty! They provided some mustard and dressing, and that totally elevated the sammich. I rarely eat these types of meats, but it had a lot of flavor.Can I talk about the bathrooms for a second? Their seats had revolving seat covers on them!!!!!! You just press a button to give you a fresh seat cover. I LOVED IT. This needs to be everywhere.-edit-Forgot to mention that they gave us a chocolate soda shot at the end of our meal. It was interesting, yet tasty.",13,10,10
5,Will H.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",9,95,258,5.0,9/30/2018,"Forget Katz's or anywhere else, 2nd Ave is the deli to frequent in the city. The atmosphere is awesome, lots of locals, very friendly staff, clean bathrooms and most importantly, awesome food!I came here with my sis who is visiting from New Mexico, land of very few Jewish folks and sadly no delis at all. She loves chicken liver and 2nd ave delivered it in spades. She said it was the best she's ever had. I had half of a smoked turkey sandwich and asked for mustard on the side. You don't need it! The meat is fresh and moist with awesome flavor, as is the bread. To go with the half sammies, we each got matzoh ball soup. It's probably just as good or better than what your bubbe made, for real. Most places salt the hell out of theirs, not here! Just perfect. They serve it with a couple slices of challah, so good that we got a loaf to go! I also got a whole smoked turkey sandwich to go to bring to work the next day. They separated the meat from the  bread up front and wrapped everything nicely. I can't wait to eat that. Pickles were provided and also very good, definitely done in-house. Finally; we finished with babka. If you've never had it, get it. It's like a cross between bread, cake and donut: fluffy, sweet (but not too sweet and it won't sit in your stomach like lead. It's awesome. Our waiter Brad was the man. Very personable guy with great suggestions and excellent service. Guys up front were great too, we had nice chats with an older gentleman and another guy, perhaps owners? Don't waste time waiting to get into Katz's and feeling rushed. Come to 2nd ave,Enjoy what's really a relaxed atmosphere especially for the city, and most importantly, I guarantee you'll love their food! It was so good it almost brought a tear to our eyes, seriously. You sadly don't find soul like this often anymore.",1,,

9,Suzy S.,"Albuquerque, NM",59,67,75,5.0,9/30/2018,"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. First, your ""Jewish Penicillin"" soup (matzo ball soup) was incredible - fresh, beautiful, tender matzo ball.. soothing, delicious chicken broth...  with just a delicate sprinkling of dill to give it distinction. After that, I had the half chopped liver sandwich on rye with tomato, onion, and lettuce. The liver was smooth and rich, the rye, light and not seedy. Excellent! For dessert my brother and I split the babka (chocolate). It was my first time trying it - so good! Each layer was tender, delicate heaven. The restaurant is clean, the restrooms are impeccable (and there's a changing table for baby!), and the our waiter was 100% fantastic - genial, knowledgeable, not rushing us at all. This is my new favorite deli!",,,

We had the salami omelet which was very good along with fries and toasted challah (yum). The potato knishes we all shared were good - but not at the level of Jonah Schimmel knishes in the Lower East Side. The whitefish salad sandwich was tasty and plentiful on excellent rye bread, and the salami/pastrami sandwich was very good and, of course, huge. Since we don't get good deli in the Bay Area, we enjoyed all of it here our first night in town, but as we tried other places, we found some things were better elsewhere. Appreciated the friendly service, too.",3,1,2
13,Laura P.,"New York, NY",893,408,246,5.0,3/12/2018,"""How can I help you today?""A cheery host greeted me as I used my body weight to trudge into 2nd Ave Deli; my body and spirit were wracked with a bout of tonsillitis that would ultimately lead to a tonsillectomy a few weeks later. ""I'd love a cup of matzah ball soup to-go, please,"" I said with all the grit and force of a lazy gust of dust on a baseball diamond in the summertime. ""Absolutely,"" he said before taking a closer look at my alarmingly ill and pale face. ""You don't look so good.""""It's my tonsils,"" I think I managed to say, but maybe I only pointed at my throat; it's hard to remember much about my first experience at 2nd Ave Deli due to the haze of a fever that kept me up for three nights and counting before walking into the deli at 9am hoping a holy bowl of matzah ball soup would cure all of my woes.""If there was a magazine for tonsils,"" he said, after calling out my order to a cook, ""yours would be the center spread.""The matzah ball soup helped my illness immensely. Ever since that day, now sans tonsils, 2nd Ave Deli has been my go-to for matzah ball soup and other Jewish deli fare. The portions are large and help to balance out the high price tag. My two favorites dishes, other than the matzah ball soup, are the chicken salad and the potato knishes. Oye!",15,12,14
14,June F.,"Merrick, NY",116,664,51,5.0,10/14/2018,We've been here many times and the food is consistently good.  Service tonight was excellent!  We shared a side of Kishka (stuffed derma) and we shared an amazing side of French fries.  The mushroom barley soup was delicious as was the pastrami sandwiches.,,,
15,Brian K.,"Huntington Station, NY",71,3,0,1.0,11/12/2018,"This place is highway robbery. A pint of chicken soup is $11, a quart is over $20!! Sandwiches start at $22 and go up. I have eaten at many kosher and kosher-style delis in my life so I am familiar with the high prices but this is insane. Also, I understand the pricing of Kosher meat, but this place rips you off on everything. $7.50 for French fries?? $8 for coleslaw? They can't even use their location to justify the pricing. Was empty when I went. Can't understand how this place stays in business. In comparison, another Kosher deli, Ben's, which is by no means cheap (and is superior) charges $8.00 for the same quart that this place charges over $20. Ben's charges $13 for a Pastrami sandwich (here $22+) and $4 for fries (here $7.50). While Katz's gets about the same for a Pastrami sandwich, everything else at Katz's is cheaper and better.  Katz's is fair superior and they can at least justify the prices due to the rent in the LES.  Do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and skip this place. Too many other Kosher and Kosher-style delis in NYC that are either cheaper and/or better.",,,
16,Becky J.,"Milwaukee, WI",94,36,21,5.0,6/14/2018,"2nd Ave Deli was our first stop once we got into the City and walking into it just takes you back in time. It has such a cool feel with the older booths, tiled walls, and the old ceilings. It's a Jewish Deli. The service is great and everyone is attentive to your needs. Upon sitting down, they immediately bring you coleslaw and pickles. We went with the Matzoh ball soup (which was just simply amazing), the chicken salad sandwich, and the pastrami sandwich. Not a single complaint about anything to do with our food or visit. They bring you a shot of chocolate soda at the end which was a really nice touch. Definitely a must do in Manhattan.",2,,2
17,Cendy C.,"Gainesville, VA",157,124,187,2.0,9/27/2018,"Came here because my cousin recommended it and I've got to say I was severely disappointed. We came here for a 8pm dinner and it wasn't that busy. We got seated relatively quickly but it took forever for a server to come assist us. By the time we finally placed the order we were starving. Hoping that we would get our orders at a reasonable time based on occupancy, I was again, disappointed. It took almost 40 minutes to get our food and I don't think a burger and two pastrami sandwiches should take that long. Pricing was on the expensive side. Nothing special and I probably won't be back based on the experience I had.",,,

The pastrami was juicy, the rye was toasted and the mustard was out of this world! Since I only had one hour, the waiter knew and looked after me. I got back to the job right on time.

Updated review","2nd Avenue Deli used to be great. I remember going to the original one as a kid and everything was amazing. It's been a few years since I've been to the new one.It's not the same. The potato pancakes are really bad. They used to be amazing, and I loved them. The taste of childhood. These are not the same. These are probably bought frozen, they definitely are not made in house.The babka is still great, but something happened to the potato pancakes, and it's a tragedy.",,,
21,Scott H.,"Tacoma, WA",26,196,341,5.0,6/21/2018,"This place is legitimate...well at least from an ""outsiders"" prospective looking in and enjoying their food during a recent visit.With what appears to be a strictly Kosher menu and tables full of folks who obviously have been there many, many times one must assume they are doing it right. Just remember. No milk in their Chocolate Egg Cream....just soda. Still tastes great.....I sat at my table marveling at a picture of Eli Wallach rubbing elbows with the owner.

22,Jacqueline S.,"New York, NY",469,87,204,5.0,11/30/2017,"There is nothing like eating matzo ball soup at home when you're sickTonight, I ordered off of postmates because I'm on the BRAT diet for a few days recovering from the flu. No fun.What was fun though was ordering on postmates, specially requesting that my soup arrived hot, and finding that 30 mins later my wish was granted. $10 may seem steep for a soup, but this is a meal. People, this wasn't a tiny, dumpling size matzo balls. This was a pillowy, baseball sized delight. And it came with two slices of amazing challah!You know you're going to pay a bit more for a legit, kosher deli. But it's worth it.",2,,
23,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",180,220,726,4.0,5/12/2018,"On entering 2nd Ave Deli which is snuggled between 3rd ave and Lex on 33rd, you are instantly transported years back to old New York. The warm and wooden interiors are further accented by a long display of meats and desserts which then opens up into a larger room with booths and tables snuck together. As soon as you re seated, they bring a bowl each of Cole slaw(best Cole slaw iv had) and pickles for the table. All of these are complimentary .Between the two of us (with decent appetites) we got-A pastrami sandwich to share ($21.50) and a Matzoh Ball Soup ($14) both of which arrived pretty fast.The pastrami sandwich tasted incredible and the meat and rye bread were just perfect! The matzoh ball was nice too but I found the carrots a little too overdone for my taste. On reading the many reviews, we figured we should share the pastrami and the soup but towards the end both my husband and I were still not entirely full. PRO TIP-I would say that you re better off ordering a pastrami sandwich each if you re decently hungry and avoid the soup all together. The matzoh ball soup is pretty great but the pastrami is definitely the star.PRO TIP 2- On that note i will say that the sandwich itself seemed pretty pricey because we expected a huge sandwich with a more meat than what was served , but the flavor and quality of the pastrami were among the best we ve eaten in the city. (Please correct me if this was a one-time thing, and if they otherwise usually serve immensely huge sandwiches)Our sever was great but handed us the check without so much as announcing or asking is if we wanted anything else(we actually were contemplating on having a babka, but then let it be) or checking with us if we were done, which seemed a bit odd. However, the complimentary shots of chocolate-soda were a good surprise and lofted our spirits back up while were leaving.",3,,2

28,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,271,1038,4.0,9/17/2017,"I've been searching for a really great pastrami/corned beef sandwich spot for a while since unfortunately I find that Katz's just doesn't live up to the reputation...and I feel like I've finally found my go-to.As it turns out, 2nd Ave Deli is a misnomer as it's between 3rd and Lex, which meant I had some minor trouble finding it. It's also much less ""grand"" than the large Katz's, which is hard to miss even if you want to. I ordered a pastrami sandwich to go and it was prepared quickly for me at the deli counter. The sides all looked amazing too (was super tempted to get beets or slaw but I can only pack away so much food) so I'll have to go back for more at some point. It's a little on the pricey side, but that's what you get at a Kosher deli (and it turns out that unlike Katz's, 2nd Ave IS indeed Kosher - although not all of the meat is Glatt). My pastrami sandwich was $23, but hey, I was craving some good pastrami and in this case, I got what I paid for. I'm taking off one star because the workers were slightly (and unjustifiably, I might add) rude. I was clearly slightly unfamiliar with the system at 2nd Ave as I'm more accustomed to the ticket system at Katz's, but I was totally apologetic about it and they still were a little gruff with barking orders at me. It wasn't enough to deter me from going back, but still, I was taken aback. All in all, I'll totally return because of its proximity to my apartment and the fact that I just had a phenomenal pastrami sandwich and I'm still in the honeymoon phase. I also like the fact that it's genuinely Kosher. I don't keep Kosher but I recognize that it justifies the higher prices. I also need to come back and try the Nova, matzah ball soup, and a few sides.",2,1,2

35,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",427,1264,5633,4.0,6/29/2017,"I've been to the Carnegie Deli on 7th avenue when it was still around.  I've been to Katz's on East Houston and for the third installment of a renown NYC deli I wanted to visit the 2nd Avenue Deli.  This visit to the 2nd Ave Deli would be our last meal in Manhattan on this trip before heading over to Long Island for the weekend so I wanted it to be special.  Ok so the place is not on 2nd Ave but it used to be (the original) and now this place is on 33rd between 3rd and Lex.Last year I had watched an old episode of Food Wars where the 2nd Ave Deli squared off against Katz's in the usual subjective food competition tv show.  I figured since Katz's is so famous and this place is going up against them for this show, they must be good enough to compete.  I'll be honest I've not heard of the 2nd Ave deli if it weren't for the show and since I'm not really keen on how Katz's is just a sandwich factory and you're essentially treated like a number there I wanted to stay away from it this time completely.  My wife can't stand Katz's because it's just too loud and busy and I get that.  I'm not fond of how things are done there either but you're not there for the ambiance, you're there for the food.  The bustle is a sacrifice you have to make if you want to eat at Katz's.This is why the 2nd Avenue Deli looks so attractive.  Not only do they have a full menu of many delights and choices but the place is not a zoo.  It's a laid back much more polite kind of place.  I don't care where Meg Ryan sat faking an O for a movie really.  I'd rather have great food at a nice place and feel comfortable and not treated like a number and submit a ticket to pay and leave.  That right there is a good reason to choose the 2nd Ave Deli over Katz's.  Now, ambiance aside there's also the food to eat as well.  I remember when I had Katz's that the meat was thickly cut whether it was pastrami or corned beef.  Both meats and sandwiches were good but I simply like 2nd Ave better.  I like the meat thinly cut as opposed to thick pieces.  I like that fact that we are seated and there's a server and I know his/her name and that I don't have to line up at a counter like I'm lining up at Disney World for a ride.  We were first given 2 small plates of coleslaw and 2 half sours and 2 fully brined pickles.  I had ordered a pint of Brooklyn Lager to make the meal complete.  Our server Tony had brought over what looked like thousand island dressing or the kind of thing you'd see on a Reuben along with sides of mustards for our sandwiches.  My wife ordered the brisket and I had asked for the corned beef.  I like pastrami too but I prefer the juicier corned beef.  While there's options to change the bread the sandwich is served on we both went with the default which is on rye.  I couldn't order sandwiches without have a side of hot and freshly made fries as a side as well.The sandwiches were absolutely great.  It's NYC in between bread as far as I'm concerned.  If you're going to go to a different place for a visit this is the kind of food I want.  Something that the city is known for and that's deli sandwiches and yes, 2nd Ave makes it great.  I always apply mustard generously and a reason for that is that these sandwiches are so thick and there's so much meat it helps lubricate it and doesn't just enhance the flavor but makes it easier to eat.  We sat beside two ladies that were friendly and one of them had ordered blintzes and they looked so good.  They were saying how they enjoyed the place and how they've been coming for years.  I liked everything about 2nd Ave because it was an enjoyable last meal in Manhattan as well as the food was exactly what I had hoped for.  The service was good and the place will probably become a favorite to visit with future visits to NYC.",10,6,7

37,David W.,"Queens, NY",28,96,6,4.0,12/11/2017,"In its rawest form, ""2nd Ave Deli"" is a glorified ""Mendy's"". However, unlike ""Mendy's"", this place has MUCH more to offer. ""2nd Ave Deli"" is a traditional Jewish restaurant that gives that authentic Jewish culinary experience"". Overall, superb quality meats, but disappointing soups. When it comes to generosity in terms of portion size, they definitely do not undercut with their sandwiches (specifically the meat quality AND quantity). Customer service friendly, no complaints here.Upon taking a seat, you will receive coleslaw and pickles (both sour and half-sour). As you're about to leave, they'll give you chocolate seltzer. I'm always a fan of these ""formalities"" if you will,, Their prices are a bit on the high end, so just keep that in mind!!3.6/5.0",10,6,5

Updated review","Update: worst customer service ever.. placed an overpriced order off of their yelp page...ten minutes go by and I get a call from the owner reprimanding me for ordering past 9pm...food for thought buddy - don't advertise it if you're not accepting orders. Seamless and yelp cant both be wrong. What an awful experience. Whoever is manning the phone has a lot of aggression...and I thought I was temperamental...However, if you're gonna charge $25 for a platter instead of $18 for a sandwich, with the only difference being an added side salad... at least get the order right. Called to simply ask that if a delivery man is coming my way, would be great if he could  drop it off on the way to his next delivery. (Even if that meant dropping it off the following day)After chastising me for ordering via their Yelp page and not directly through them (seriously? Ummm you're welcome for my business?), the overly aggressive person on the other end of the phone said, they don't drop anything off for less than $20. BUT, he would throw in a free cole slaw the next time I place a takeout order...really dying to drop another $50+...""do I make myself clear ms.(insert butchered last name here).?!"" He proceeded to tell me I spelled my last name wrong .. again, really? I ordered ONLINE, you can't mess that up! Maybe it was his condescending tone or maybe it was the fact that they messed up my overpriced order but..not really dying to spend more money with this place.Mistakes happen, totally get that...but customer service is everything. Appreciate the credit but check your ego and attitude...do I make myself clear, Lenny?",1,,

41,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,3.0,7/29/2017,"Came on a Saturday early afternoon for lunch. Don't let the name confuse you, this place is between 3rd and Lex. They have another venue further up town on 1st... so also not on 2nd. Can only assume there used to be a place on 2nd avenue...or they're going for the average. The decor is excellent - significantly better than your average deli or diner. Plenty of booths and dividing screens to give you a bit more privacy. I got the pastrami sandwich and had to order a side of fries as they weren't included. It was good but no where near the best pastrami I've had in NY. My wife had a frankfurter omelet which looked pretty lame tbh and apparently nothing to write home about. Ultimately it was an adequate lunch but nothing special. The decor really boosts the experience. There were a lot of solo diners as well so clearly a popular spot for those who live nearby. Oh, we did get some chocolate soda shots as well. Need to find myself some of thatFor me, the prices are a little high for what you get and what you could get elsewhere.",,,

I wish the sandwiches came with the toppings instead of having to pay extra, blah blah blah but yeah. I am sure there is equal-quality pastrami in NYC that is not at Katz or 2nd Ave Deli.

51,Mike R.,"New York, NY",101,402,2,5.0,9/17/2017,"My parents have been deprived of legit Easter European Kosher food since they've lived in Minnesota. I had to take them here, since you know the menu hits on so many favorites. We came just wanting a few sandwiches but ended up ordering a bunch. After having gone to Katz's and finding it overrated, I was hoping 2nd Ave Deli would be better.We had the pastrami sandwich, brisket sandwich, gefilte fish, matzoh ball soup, potato knish, and blintzes. * Brisket Sandwich: My grandma made the best brisket ever and I've never had a brisket that came close to hers....until now. High, high, high praise to 2nd Ave Deli for ALMOST being as good as my grandma's. Seriously really close, not quite, but  that was one good brisket sandwich.* Pastrami Sandwich: I'll pick this Pastrami any day over Katz's. I said it - and it's true for anyone being optimistic I think. It's pretty damn good.* Gefilte Fish: Pretty good and pretty soft, but not too soft. My mom kept saying how it was close to tasting to how her grandma made it. Again, high praise.* Matzoh Ball Soup: Pretty good with good noodles and soft matzoh ball. At any places, you  either get the soup pretty salty or not at all. This one wasn't that salty but it was nice - just wish it was a little more salty to begin with. Not the best I've ever had but pretty good.* Blintzes: Pretty good with some good parve cheese that would make people believe it was real.* Potato Knish: Good, though the outside in places was too burnt for my tastesOf course the pickles and cole slaw that came with the meal was good too. Service was great. Overall, this might be one of the best Jewish Kosher delis I've been to. Any place that can make a brisket close to my grandma's deserves to be visited. My advice? Skip Katz's and come here.",2,,1
52,JJ J.,"Queens, NY",38,16,7,5.0,4/24/2018,"Best matzo ball soup ever. I love this place. Visit all the time. Food is so consistently good. Love the pastrami and corned beef. Both full of flavor and goes well with their mustard. Rye bread is ok but the sandwich is all about the meat. Half sandwich is enough meat for one full sandwich. Soup has soft but not mushy matzo, homemade chicken broth, carrots and small noodles. Half sour pickles are crunchy and fresh. Cole slaw is just vinegar which I prefer...not sweet and mayo soak. Service is great. Love my usual waiter and they have attentive bus people and owner family member who always says hi. End the meal with their complimentary chocolate soda.Few considerations: closed during jewish holidays, gets very crowded during weekend lunch hours, a bit pricy, and sometimes enforce their minimum per person.",1,,

We read so many good things about the Matzoh Ball Soup & decided to give it a try. Our waiter was kind enough to split it for us since we told him we were sharing. The soup was perfect for the cold NY weather, chicken noodle soup with a Matzoh Ball! We also split a pastrami sandwich, which was AMAZING. The pastrami slices were so soft & totally melts in your mouth when you take a bite!

I was not at all excited to visit a deli. I was like, we are in NY and instead of some cool or fancy restaurant we are going to a deli?? Boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. Not only did I love the food and the experience, I was introduced to pickled green tomatoes for the first time. Since then, I went on searches all over the bay area to find some!Anyway, this place has plenty of seating. It's kosher so they ask that you do not bring outside food and beverages, fyi. They bring out pickles, including my long desired pickled green tomatoes, for free! Think free chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  Yes, it's glorious for pickle lovers such as myself. Between my cousin and I we ordered the potato knish which was good and quite hearty. We also ordered the pastrami samdwich, which I remembered I liked last time and I was not disappointed. Pastrami is not something I ever order but theirs is just delicious and fresh. Our server was really cool and when I told him I specifically came for the pickles and pastrami, he packed up some extra pickles for me to take on my flight back home! He was sweet!

My son and I decided to see which is a better pastrami sandwich...Katz's or 2nd Ave.Katz's is the deli of my childhood. It was what I've based every pastrami sandwich on. Growing up, we came to Katz's. When my son was in school, we came to Katz's. I never questioned for a minute if any sandwich, anywhere, could be as perfect as Katz's.We had identical sandwiches. Pastrami on rye. Pickles. Mustard. No fancy stuff. We went to 2nd Ave.  first and it was amazing! This is a perfect sandwich. I like the thin lean cut and the freshness is unbelievable. It's moist, it's flavorful. It's huge. We each had half. They bring an egg cream in a shot glass. Delicious. We were in and out in about 30 minutes. We walked to Katz's for the second sandwhich. It was agreed that we would have the same sandwich and split it. Katz's is famous because it's on tv and well, I guess because it's on tv. You have to wait in line. It's a mess inside. You get a ticket and a warning. The stress of performing in here is unbelievable. There are different lines. It's very stressful. Finally a table, our sandwich and a strange man sits down with us. Okay, forgetting the strange man, the sandwich dry to the point of not being able to swallow. It's like salty sawdust on rye bread. The spectacular winner by far is 2nd Ave.  I saw someone eating the chicken soup and it looked delicious.

Now I must speak of the pastrami. It's melt your mouth, fresh, perfectly cured and the bread is fresh as well as the mustard delicious. The fries were ok. The matzah ball soup was special and delicious. We didn't even ask but they split it for us and poured hot broth into each bowl at the table.

The sandwich also came with Russian dressing and mustard, along with slaw and two whole pickles. The pastrami was beautifully layered and bright in color. It was savory and tender, melting in my month. Before I knew it I finished everything. Another note, the space was filled by the time I left at 11:25am.",3,,
78,STEVE C.,"Seattle, WA",9,146,0,5.0,10/3/2018,"I live in Seattle and unfortunately, the joke in Bellevue that professes to be a Jewish deli is just awful. This venerable deli brings back wonderful east coast memories from the Fifties. The service is as good as it gets in so many ways, without being intrusive or obsequious. I had a real matzoh ball that did not float in salted broth. It was large and perfectly textured. The knish with gravy was large and delicious. My wife had one of those famous tall sandwiches with pastrami piled high with accompanying mustard and pickles. When I mentioned that Jewish delis used to have matzoh served before every meal, they immediately brought some at no cost. Then they brought small shots of chocolate phosphate, also gratis. If there is a better such deli in the universe, please let me know.",,,

I rarely find food tasting exactly like my babushka makes it, but the 2nd Ave Deli nailed it. The matzo ball soup was pretty good too. I'm not a huge fan of matzo balls, but the broth and the noodles were spot on. I tried the pastrami sandwich, the meat was good, not as smokey as I like it, but I would come back for it again. Finished the meal with some chocolate babka, which was perfect, so I got half a loaf to go.The service: 4/5. The service was good, attentive and friendly. Minus one star for the price point, because it's fairly expensive for a deli. Overall: 4/5. Can we get one of these in Chicago? ;(",1,1,

This location on the upper east side is simply a delight and highly recommended.The menu is large and requires several visits to conquer. I began with Jewish Penicillin - matzoh ball soup with noodles. It was perfect with a light and fluffy matzoh and delicate broth.My main desire was the Twin Double. They serve two sandwiches piled high with corned beef and pastrami on rolls instead of rye. These were legendary and worth every calorie. Mustard is great but optional with both meats having excellent flavor and texture. This pastrami rocks and is easily one of the best ever.What really sets this place apart is the dining experience. The restaurant is attractive and classic with a great clientele and menu well worth a trip.

I grew up in this east midtown neighborhood and remember this place from back in the day.  Times are very different in this area and so too is this deli although it still serves great Jewish deli fare.Imagine my surprise though that even in the late afternoon there was a line of people out the door to get a table. The line did move quickly but it was hard for me to understand the sheer number of people now wanting to get into what used to be just a neighborhood joint.The food came quickly and was delicious.  One pastrami on rye sandwich with a side of half-sour pickles and cole slaw was big enough to share and easily fed both of us.  The deli menu is vast with all my old-time favorite sandwiches. Although you get a lot of food, the price point is high but that's just how it is in most NYC delis these days.  It was great to be in the old neighborhood and see that while different from the place I recall years ago, the 2nd Avenue Deli is still a good choice.  You don't have to be Jewish to love 2nd Avenue Deli!",13,7,12

It's a little pricey, yes, but the portion of meat is pretty generous and, more importantly, it was absolutely delicious. I do like the thickness of the hand-cut pastrami at Katz's, but this one is very good, too.However, unlike Katz's, the atmosphere is way more relaxed here - no ridiculous crowds to deal with. Moreover, the service was not only efficient, but friendly! (I get the whole NY attitude thing, I've lived here for seven years - but the staff at Katz's sometimes seem like they just relish being dicks for no good reason.)

There was still collagen in the grain of the meat giving it a resistant bite. They did not portion out sauce on the sandwich nor do they top it with anything at all. No cole slaw, sauerkraut, or thousand island on the sandwich. Nothing. They gave us two small takeaway cups filled with dijon mustard and thousand island dressing. The rye bread was standard. The meat did not have a char or seasoning around its edges. It was unimpressive. At $20, this sandwich is about $13 overpriced. Pastrami is not an expensive meat. Find one of the thousand delis on any corner and order a pastrami sandwich for $5-7 that is probably better. Skip 2nd Ave.",8,2,1

The knish was flavorful and warm and just wonderful. I shouldn't have eaten it all but I did. The health salad and half sour and full sour pickles that they give you  as an appetizer are just fantastic. I'm a big full sour person and boy I ate them all up.My son got his usual which is the number 4. The number four is hot pastrami, hot corned beef, wide salami, and coleslaw on rye bread.

96,jed k.,"Trenton, NJ",39,143,275,4.0,7/12/2016,"Had to come to Manhattan for Drs appointment. Was in the mood for good deli and this place fit the bill because it was within short walking distance of Penn Station and near the right subway line to head uptown  When we first arrived which was shortly before noon it was pretty empty. By the time we left it was full including most of the small counter.   It's not a very large place but it did have between 15-20 tables and booths. It's s decorated in an older style with tin type ceilings and some small tiles in the wall. Their are photos of many of the old Jewish stars from Vaudville and later eras. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman and were seated immediately. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. After we gave our orders we were served a small dish each of health salad and a plate of 4 pickles. The health salad was fresh with a little sweetness to it. There were two types of pickles on the plate; sour and new pickles. The sour pickles were wonderful. I used to work in a deli in high and I remember going into the cold storage where there were barrels of pickles and salamis, balogna, et al hanging there. I long for the days when there would be a small container of pickles on each table. Those were the days!!I ordered a pastrami sandwich. The rye bread was fresh and thinly sliced. It was a nice sized sandwich and it was good. My wife ordered a hot corned beef sandwich. We ended up taking a good portion of it home. We also split a slice of of potato kugel. Growing up we were a noodle kugel family but the top was nice and crunchy and the body moist. It did need a little salt. This place is also a deli for takeout with their foods displayed behind there glass showcase. This place has a long history between its original location and the present location. At the end of the meal we both revived a little shot glass filled with chocolate soda. The seltzer was a little flat but it was a nice touch. Definitely a place to go in Manhattan.  The bathroom toilet had an automatic seat cover!  Pretty cool!",1,1,1

Yes, please!  With all the places to try, my wife chose this out of the way spot, and I'm so glad she did.  The three of us split a smorgasbord of items for lunch...matzo ball soup, potato knish, potato latke and a hot pastrami on rye sandwich.To start, a relish tray was brought to the table with two kinds of pickles (dill and sour) along with a vinegar-based cole slaw, all of which were pretty traditional and tasty.  First course was the matzo ball soup...it was typical ""Jewish penicillin"" that was made better by the addition of fresh dill.Next up was the potato knish.  it was sort of round, baked and had a very mild onion flavor (but the dough to potato ratio was off with way more potato filling than I'd expect).  Same for the potato latke, fried and with good onion flavor but the crispy outside to moist inside ratio was off due to the incredible thickness of the thing.Last up for our meal was the pastrami on rye sandwich...served warm, moist and delicious with spicy deli mustard (which I liked it more than the Russian dressing option).  The meat was perfectly seasoned and went well with the seeded rye bread.To finish the meal, you get a small chocolate cream soda ""shot"" which was a really nice touch.  So glad we gave this spot a try, I would definitely come back!",1,,1

99,Justine S.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,54,0,5.0,9/4/2017,"Hands down the best jewish deli I have been to, ever. Full disclosure: I am Jewish and I go to a lot of Jewish delis. But like, it was so good that when I left I wanted to tell everyone working there how much I liked it on my way out. And like, I bought a damn logo hat. At a Jewish deli. And then wore it all day. Here are a few examples of its greatness:Example 1 - I'm rarely impressed by matzo ball soup, but my girlfriend loves it, so I try it everywhere it's served. The matzo balls here were just to my preference for spongy, dense balls. They didn't flake off in the soup, which came with plenty of dill and carrots. The broth was flavorful but not overly salty or oily.Example 2 - I love coleslaw, but find it to be hit or miss because often it is overly mayonnaisey. The complimentary coleslaw that was delivered to our table, along with delish crunchy tasty pickles, had NO MAYO, and was excellent. I ordered extra on my corned beef sandwich.Example 3 - My corned beef came freshly, thinly sliced on fluffy rye bread with a generous glass jar of Russian dressing and our own serving of grainy mustard. No need to request extra condiments or share jars with other customers, which are things I often feel persnickety about. Honestly there seemed to be no end to satisfying details at this place. The service was awesome, the French fries were house sliced, and (spoiler alert) the meal ended with surprise complimentary chocolate soda shots!! The bathroom even had an automatic seat cover button, which while pretty weird, fit right in with the elder chic/kitsch vibes that authenticate the place. I can't wait to head back next time I'm in the neib!",1,1,1

They constantly put out the less fresh batch of challah and make me ask for a fresh one then wait for the stare down from me to know I'm serious.

My go to, tourist trappings and all, is the Carnegie Deli, but on this trip they were closed for repairs. After asking a number of folks for a worthy alternative, I was steered toward the 2nd Ave Deli, so I headed there for lunch.Much like Carnegie, 2nd Ave Deli has ridiculously huge sandwiches with insane portions of meat. They also cure their own tongue and corned beef. I knew I wanted hot pastrami, but after looking through the Three Decker sandwiches, I decided to get the #4, which included hot pastrami, corned beef, wide salami, cole slaw, and Russian dressing. The sandwich was so tall that even my big mouth couldn't bite down on everything at once, so I attacked it in sections. Each of the meats was utterly delicious, though the pastrami and corned beef were the clear standouts. The slaw and dressing were also very good, and the entire sandwich, which stayed together surprisingly well, was simply amazing. I did manage to eat almost the entire thing (I left some of the bread in favor of finishing off the meat), but this is a sandwich that could easily be split between 2 people.Much like Carnegie, the atmosphere is casual but a bit chaotic due to how busy it is. They do get people in and out very efficiently, though, and the food comes out very quickly. The sandwiches aren't cheap, but if you choose to split one amongst 2 people, it becomes much more reasonable. This also may provide the opportunity to try some of the amazing looking desserts, but I was too full to think about them this trip. 2nd Ave Deli proved to be a fantastic alternative to the Carnegie Deli, and I definitely plan on going back again.",3,,

Pricey for sure, but they stack 'em high and bring 'em out hot.But, if you're really hungry and not running low on dough, hit up the Roast Turkey sandwich with Tongue, coleslaw, Russian dressing, lettuce and tomato ($29.95)NOTHING washes down deliciousness like this like a Diet Dr. Brown's Black Cherry. If I could drink one thing for the rest of my life, it would probably be fresh squeezed orange juice (if I'm being honest with myself). But that black cherry nectar comes in a close second.Beware: This is a kosher establishment which means no meat + cheese i.e. there is no real cream cheese, just a tofu substitute. It may or may not do the trick for you. There's definitely a difference in taste.",1,1,1

Ok.... I know it is NYC and all but $21 for a pastrami sandwich on rye bread??????  Really????  My natural reaction was to say ""$21 for a sandwich?""  The cashier gave me an annoyed look and said ""It's Kosher""  Oh makes more sense now why I'm paying $21 for a sandwich.... (insert sarcasm).  So I thought, well maybe it is a REALLY GOOD pastrami sandwich and I won't feel so bad paying $21 for it.  Unfortunately it was not worth $21 at all... super salty.... even the pickles were so salty that I couldn't even take a second bite.  I normally love pickles!!   I force myself to finish my $21 sandwich, and now I feel nauseous and instantly bloated.  Note to self... always ask how much first before ordering!",2,2,

When you sit down, complimentary pickles and coleslaw are brought to you along with lemon water. I ordered matzo ball soup, a side of noodle kugel and a triple stacked brisket sandwich on rye. They bring out everything at a reasonable time (considering how busy they are) and do so in a course by course fashion. The matzo ball soup was delicious and presented nicely. The Kugel came next and was rich and heavenly. The entré was spectacular and had to be cut up for me to eat it. It was gigantic but was some of the best brisket I have ever had. Your check is given to you with a shot of chocolate soda which was quite good. The menu is reasonable for a quick bite. If you really want to spoil yourself then there are some sandwiches that range from $20-$50. WELL WORTH IT.",,,

(Perhaps I looked parched and under the weather.)When you enter,  are the glorious smells..maybe I'm feeling better!  Is it the pastrami?  The toasting of bagels?  Whatever it is,  it is divine!  I couldn't resist ordering (my favorite) a toasted onion bagel,  kosher cream cheese,  and (of course) matzoh ball soup with noodles.

131,Terence T.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,39,65,4.0,7/11/2018,"This is one of those restaurants where you wish you could give ratings in half-star increments as 4.5 stars would be more appropriate.I don't live in NY, but whenever I'm in town, I order 2-3 pounds of pastrami to go along with 1-2 loaves of rye bread. I'm yet to find pastrami in Los Angeles that I like as much as that of 2nd Ave Deli (sorry Langer's). If you are a flight away from NYC plan to bring pastrami back home, here are my suggestions:1.  Place your order at least a day in advance. 2. For an extra $1, they will vacuum pack/seal your pastrami (typically 1 pound of pastrami per package)3. In theory, your order comes with a side of their house mustard and a side of russian dressing. Ask them to freeze these items! TSA has taken these from me at the airport, but has also told me that if they were frozen, I would have been allowed to bring them through (and was able to do so once, but they didn't inspect it so not sure that this counts).4. They do deliver if you are within a certain radius of their 2 locations (I don't know what their delivery radius is). Of course, you can certainly pick up your order. For delivery, allow sufficient time for the delivery to be wrong and for them to come back with missing items (more on this later).5. Come prepared with your own Ziploc bags (or similar item). After you get past TSA, put ice in the bags along with the pastrami. This is where the vacuum sealed packages are key. You can stick them right in with the ice without ruining the pastrami.For the food, 5 stars. Don't get the lean pastrami, that's like ordering a prime steak well done. If you're going for pastrami, you gotta get the nice, fatty pastrami. The mustard is fantastic! The reason this isn't a 5 star review is the inconsistent delivery service. I would say that 1/3 of the time, they don't bring the mustard and russian dressing. One time they said they'd throw in a free sandwich the next time I ordered (which they didn't as they said they had no record of that promise) as I didn't have time to wait for them to bring any. Another time they sent another delivery person with the mustard and dressing and a few free cookies, which were delicious. The other issue is that they may try to deliver earlier than your requested delivery time. On my last trip, I asked for a 3:30pm delivery (timed so that it would work with my trip to the airport). I got a call around 1:00 saying they were downstairs with my delivery. Given the frequency of these delivery issues, I'm bringing the overall rating down. Again, if you choose to pick up, then you shouldn't have this problem.",,,

One of my favorite parts of being a Jew is are food. 2nd Ave Deli, in opinion, is a truly authentic deli, as it should be because it was opened in the 1950's and is obviously a very important institution that has it's rightful place in Jewish Deli history. The last time I went, it was my first trip alone to NYC as I was going to see the finale matinee of the long running beloved music The Fantasticks. I was in a rush as, but the waiter was a  who served me was a truly a kind man who (I guess) was (maybe not, but he definitely seemed like it) and had a nice, comforting NY accent. I order a Pastrami Sandwich with Sauerkraut on rye and it came out extremely fast, which I was very pleased and somewhat surprised, as some restaurants here in DC take a while.

However, after having wondered how it was that there were so few old, deli type establishments around, and after having heard about 2nd ave deli, I made the trip up here to check it out.Being in midtown, it's a lot smaller than Katz's naturally. Also, the counter is a little bit different, in that it's more similar to a typical restaurant. Anyway, I only got one thing, so that's what I'm going to compare it to. In terms of quantity of meat, you get an alright amount- probably similar to what you get at Katz's, but maybe slightly less. As for the quality of meat... it's okay, but nothing outstanding. The way that the meat tastes at Katz's is pretty amazing, while the meat here doesn't have very well marbled fat.

The guys in this small but roomy shop were very hospitable giving us a place out of the way to store our luggage. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but also let us enjoy our meal. I had the pastrami which is easily one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. My wife had the tuna and absolutely loved it!  If we lived in the city we'd be back too often. Easily our best food experience of the long weekend, and the others were good as well!",1,,
164,David N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,22,17,4.0,5/14/2017,One of my favorite Deli's. quick service food is amazing.Pastrami is buttery but a bit fatty. Mazoh ball soup is better than Mom ever made. A must try.,,,
165,Caroline F.,"Portland, OR",168,281,7,4.0,1/15/2016,"We somehow missed the memo that is was a Kosher deli, so when my mom walked in with her Starbucks latte, they could've been snotty about it. But they weren't. Our lovely server just put it in a bag for her and let us hold on to it.I have grown up at Jewish delis, but this was my first experience at an authentically Kosher one. So there was soy cream cheese for my bagel, and my egg cream was just a chocolate soda... But nothing I couldn't adjust to.The chopped liver was the best I've ever had.And our server was the best one I had during my entire stay in New York.I'll be back!",3,1,1
166,Matthew K.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",103,264,179,4.0,5/15/2016,"Biggest positive about 2nd Ave is that they're simply good people. Many of the other big delis are kind of pricks and you also need to wait on long lines. Biggest drawback about this location is that they're kosher. That's a huge deal if you like a 'melt' with yummy American cheese like me. Yes the pastrami is a fortune, but it's rock solid. Best bet is get the Heart Attack because it includes two massive potato latkes. Just politely ask for some apple sauce and rye on the side and you're all set.",,1,
167,Steve H.,"Nashville, TN",268,74,133,3.0,3/20/2017,"We had a decent meal here. We wanted Matzo Ball soup but they were out. That was a disappointment for sure. Seems like that's something they shouldn't ever run out of. Anyway, we had a  pastrami and a corned beef sandwich and they were good. I also order a hot dog. The hot dog was the best part of the meal. Loved it!  If they weren't out of the soup I might have gone 4 stars but that was a pretty big deal.  Btw they served us a free chocolate soda shot. We hated them but it could just be a taste thing so I didn't figure that in to our review.",,,

It's also a staggering $28.95 plus tax. It's a big sandwich but not the type where you can eat half and take the rest back. A can of Coke is $2.95. I asked for a vanilla egg cream but they only offer chocolate. This is unacceptable and a violation of Jewish deli rules and regulations. I was offered a free shot of chocolate egg cream but vanilla folks don't blend well with the chocolate ones. The place is clean and service is good, but the sandwich and soda, with tax and tip set me back $42. How do I explain that to Mrs. Soy? I need a payday loan to cover this.",,,

We ordered slaw, kugel, and a pastrami sandwich.Strangely, they didn't mention you get slaw and pickles first. Before we could do anything, we got our order of slaw, which was mayonnaise based. I actually preferred the ""free"" slaw.The kugel was decent. Crust was only slightly crispy and the middle was a mushy. As to the pastrami, it came with mustard on the side, which is much needed on both sides of the rye. The meat was not especially fatty, but still a bit moist. A solid pastrami, but nothing to be excited for.",2,,1

Katz's is a whole lot better and so is Fine and Schapiro on the UWS. Avoid this place. It is also SUPER expensive. $22 for a not-overstuffed pastrami sandwich. Ridiculous. The rye bread was awesome. $16 at Fine and Schapiro. Oh, and $3 for a can of coke from these robbers? Skip it.",1,,
181,Jim B.,"Frankfort, KY",0,41,13,1.0,11/14/2017,"I live in KY and go to NYC every year or so to visit with my son and daughter-in-law. I always like to go to a good Jewish deli and get a pastrami or Rueben sandwich. This trip I decided to try to take some of these delicious meats home with me. I would divide them into 4 oz. packages, freeze them, and carry them in a collapsible cooler in my suitcase. I went into the 2nd Ave Deli and ordered 2 lbs. of pastrami and 2 lbs. of corned beef. When I got the packages to my son's to portion it out I found the pastrami to be short almost 3-1/2 ounces and the corned beef to be short closer to 4 ounces. They charge $39.95 /lb. for the pastrami and $37.95/lb. for the corned beef. One would think that they would make enough profit at those charges that they would not need to steal from their customers. They will not be getting any more of my business. I would recommend that if you want to get a good deli sandwich go the Katz's or Sarge's or any of the other New York delicatessens.",2,,
182,Sasha D.,"Middletown, NY",58,69,14,5.0,10/17/2016,"My recent craving for corned beef prompted my husband to kick off the journey of a well-traveled sandwich. Last night a hot corned beef sandwich, with my name on it, was born on 2nd Ave in Manhattan. It took the four train to Grand Central, and kept my husband company as he wandered around the Central Market in search of his own grilled chicken wrap for dinner. Then it shared sweaty backpack space alongside the chicken wrap on the metro north trek to Beacon enjoying a beautiful view of the Hudson. Finally, the duo made the half hour drive in a dinged-up Prius over the Beacon Bridge to my kitchen table where myself and three dogs had salivated a small pond. The sandwich undressed on my dining room table to reveal a soggy pinched rye sweater with a generous 3-inch filling of corned beef. A goddess hidden in a wet blanket, the sandwich bloomed when dipped in alternating bites of Russian dressing and mustard. Vinegared slaw gave a welcome bite as I munched my way through half the sandwich, as the rye threatened to burst under its heavy load. My husband rolled his eyes as I clenched my corned beef with two hands, threatening to Jenga itself all over the table. The dill pickles were a bright garlicky back note against a beautifully meaty corned beef. Not too stringy, just tender enough to fall apart in your mouth and enough fat for that luxurious mouthfeel. Screw grilled chicken. The best corned beef of my life.  I need a smoke.....",1,3,1
183,Joel P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",193,78,141,3.0,8/30/2015,"I was showing my brother around town much of the weekend, giving him the prototypical NYC tourist experience, so where better to take him to eat than a Jewish deli?As we entered the Murray Hill institution, would couldn't help but be reminded we were in New York City. The decor and layout is the epitome of a classic diner. After we were seated, we noticed the prices were a little on the high side for a deli so we decided to go halfsies on the matzoh ball soup ($8.50) and the hot pastrami/salami combo ($24.95) . The matzoh ball soup was...Wow...Completely deserving of the nickname 'Jewish Penicillin'. It was the perfect combination of light/savory/comforting. The broth was fantastic with just the right amount of salt, the matzoh was cooked perfectly, and the little square noodles were a nice touch.As for the sandwich, sorry to say, it just didn't wow me. The pastrami was a bit dry and lacking in flavor and the salami was mediocre at best. Aside from the meat, the rye was flimsy and the sandwich barely had any Russian dressing. It's disappointing because I really wanted to be floored by the sandwiches here. It was just average. Until I find otherwise, Katz remains my gold standard for deli sandwiches in the city. I'll come back here at some point, but it will be for a bathtub full of the matzoh ball soup, not the sandwiches.",4,,
184,Anna B.,"Austin, TX",83,11,0,5.0,3/17/2017,"This place is worth every penny. It's small and very clean and the Deli meat sandwich was legendary... the pastrami was sliced super thin and piled high. The matzah ball soup was gorgeous. Here's what impressed me the most... I misjudged my time and had to get back to my hotel on the upper west side to grab my luggage and catch a flight. Being that it was St. Patrick's Day, the city was getting crazy and a lot of streets were starting to close. I asked my waiter to please bag up my sandwich and explained my haste. The sandwich was wrapped with such care, double wrapped in wax paper and foil and they lovingly packed up some condiments and pickles as if Grandma was packing my lunch for school. THAT'S the mark of a great restaurant... when the food is prepared and presented with care. I'm making this a MUST place to visit every time I visit NYC.",,,

I mean 24 dollars for a Tongue sandwich is rather ridiculous which is why I stuck with corned beef and pastrami for 21 or something similar.The pastrami was good.  Not the best I have had but pretty good.

It only took a few seconds of chatting to figure out wm the wife and I were from out of town but he was extremely welcoming.They have a bunch of things on the menu I wanted to get but it was about 8:30 in the morning so I went with potato pancakes instead of a pastrami sandwich.  I pretty much order potato pancakes whenever I get the chance and I think I'm spoiled now.  These were hands down, full stop the best I've had.  Super crispy outside and soft enough and peppery in the middle.  I was impressed. My wife got the challah French toast.  It was pretty good not amazing though.  I did like that they brought out some pickles and cole slaw to start and they gave us a shot of chocolate soda before the check.  That was a nice touch.I'd definitely recommend this place I'd just for the potato pancakes, next time I'm in New York I'm coming back for the pastrami.",3,1,1

I really liked how they served coleslaw and pickles at the beginning when you sit down. I ordered the Nova Scotia Lox and Eggs, and loved it. It was not what I was expecting since the salmon was cooked in with the eggs but it was delicious. My friends ordered the pastrami sandwiches. Supposedly, they are famous for it. It looked delicious and they were very happy!The only thing negative I have to say about this place is that is pretty pricey.

Updated review","I returned to 2nd Ave Deli, this time opting for a roast beef sandwich. It was a good experience, indeed. The meat was juicy, the lettuce was crispy, the bread was bready. Definitely better than the latkes I had 6 years ago. My husband got a sandwich and some matzo ball soup- I couldn't resist the soup, I had to have a bite. It was surprisingly bland and the matzo ball itself was extremely dense. Obviously it's a matter of opinion but the density of matzo balls is very important to me.",5,5,8

Texture, flavor and broth all went so well with each other. Paired with a sandwich, even better. My friend and I split the twin double...the corned beef and pastrami, heavy and delicious! You can't eat stuff like this every day, well you can, but you really shouldn't, tempting I know.There's also the house slaw and pickles, right amount of tangy and a bit of salt. The chocolate shot at the end of the meal was interesting, I kinda liked it. Service was quick and friendly at all times.
