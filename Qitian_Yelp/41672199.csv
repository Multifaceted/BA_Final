0,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",752,1658,15188,5.0,10/7/2018,"If you love cheese, go to Murray's Cheese Bar. It's a cheese shop that converted a nearby space into a cheese bar. It's in the West Village and maintains a healthy flow of patrons who love this spot. There are small tables throughout the space and bar seating making it a great date spot.They sell wine by the glass, sangria, cheese plates, and entrees. I ordered the Northeastern cheese plate and it came with three healthy servings of the best cheese I've ever had. Each cheese was paired with a garnish from blackberry jam to dehydrated maple syrup (so good!). A brown bag of small slices of bread comes with it and the server will give you more if you just ask.To eat, I ordered the BBQ pulled pork mac and cheese. Hands down the best mac and cheese I've ever had. The creamy cheese and the BBQ of the pulled pork were perfectly balanced never overpowering the other.To drink I had the sangria and it was good, but not life changing like the rest of the experience.",1,,1
1,Dona F.,"Staten Island, NY",26,221,639,4.0,10/25/2018,"Great spot for a late night snack. Obviously you should like cheese   Small tables - a little tight. We had the Raclette for 2 which was totally adorable. 2 cheese melting platters with 3 tea candles underneath. 3 cheeses are served with amazing mini pickles, chorizo, salami, the most amazing mini onions and slices of baguette. You melt the cheese and slide it off into the baguette adorned with the extras. Totally yummy. As if that wasn't enough we also got-- smoked sweet potato with a cilantro chimichurri and sprinkled with feta. The feta was so mild you couldn't really taste it. The sweet potato was a little crunchy and not overpowering. Delicious - Murray's melt (grilled cheese) with a smoky tomato soup with a cheese cracker in it. Soup was very rich. Actually took home half the grilled cheese. It was fine warmed up the next day. Wrap in tin foil in the toast r oven and open the last 5 minutes   Beware of cheese OD! I'd go back just can't do it that often!",1,,1
2,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",357,80,43,4.0,10/1/2018,"Cute little place for cheese lovers. Overpriced, but you are paying in part for the experience/fame of Murray's. The restaurant is quite small, but very long. It makes all the tables very closely pushed together, so it was a bit hard to hear my friend and we ended up yelling at each other to be heard. The food was delicious! The beets to start came with lettuce and delicious blue cheese and all the flavors paired together so well. The mac and cheese was very rich, creamy, and buttery, but somehow, I didn't like it as much as I thought. It's a blend of four ""secret Murray's cheese"" and I don't know which one threw the flavor off for me. Would like to come back at happy hour to try some drinks, and I definitely want to try the grilled cheese and soup sometime, too.",1,,
3,Rob C.,"New York, NY",234,221,144,2.0,11/1/2018,"I was excited to try this place, but the food was average, and the service was awkward. I got Murray's Melt sandwich and added prosciutto to it while my girlfriend got the kale, egg, and cheese sandwich. My girlfriend's sandwich did not even contain cheese which was very disappointing considering this place is famous for its cheese. Had I not added meat to mine, it would have tasted no different than a regular grilled cheese sandwich. Portion-wise, the sandwiches are rather small for the price paid. I would not recommend this place.",,,
4,Isabel T.,"New York, NY",28,20,14,4.0,11/16/2018,OMG this place was fantastic. I love cheese and had no idea what to get. The waiter asked me ehat i liked abd he found me the perfect cheese plate. I had a hibiscus drink that was very refreshing. I cant wait to go back.,1,,1
5,Stephanie L.,"New York, NY",15,59,160,4.0,8/7/2018,"I am a cheese lover and this place fits the bill!Great place to grab a few drinks and relax with a cheese sampler.  We asked for 6, told them our cheese preference and they came back with 6 great options for us to try.  Also don't forget to order the buffalo fried cheese curds.  After your cheese tasting you can head right over to store and purchase your favorites!",,,
6,Alex W.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",486,644,1656,4.0,9/28/2018,The grilled cheese was very tasty as were the Buffalo Cheese Curds.  Recommended as a lunch spot,,,
7,Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,14,11,5.0,11/3/2018,This place is amazing. The cheese was amazing and every cheese came with something to pair it with. The cheese expert was super excited about the cheese and very knowledgeable. There's fondue and mac and cheese. Such a good place for a group to order a bunch of different cheeses and just try them all!,,,
8,Daniella S.,"Boston, MA",231,84,91,4.0,6/25/2018,"The service is a little bit slow, but the fondue ($40) is amazing! I would definitely come back for this cheesy goodness.

9,Alexa T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",330,50,76,5.0,5/29/2018,"Literally one of my favorite places to go to hands down. Cheese? Wine? YES!My boyfriend and I did the raclette for two and shared the mac & cheese and it tasted so amazing! Next time i go i want to try it with their suggested wines. I cannot stress enough how this was one of the best mac & cheeses i've ever had in my entire life. Best combo of cheeses! The raclette for two included bread, meats, pickles, and these mini onions and is enough to get you pretty full. I definitely intend on returning to try their various cheese plates/wines. Tip: make sure you don't wind up at the cheese shop that's a few storefronts down, I know this usually causes a confusion for some.",1,1,1
10,Jodi S.,"Ardsley, NY",0,4,0,5.0,11/16/2018,Just a thank you.  My father was so happy with his gift.  He said itwas some of the best sturgeon he has ever had. Best gift ever.Thanks so much,,,
11,Rosa Icela C.,"Chula Vista, CA",110,37,67,5.0,10/25/2018,"one word: amazing.We had the 5 piece cheese and meat tray, mc&cheese, cheese melt, and the truffle broccolini, finished with the ricotta lemon dessert. A must if visiting NYC.",,,
12,Sandra M.,"San Antonio, TX",136,117,643,5.0,5/16/2018,"Cheese heaven. I don't just like cheese, I love cheese. I knew I had to check this place out and I'm glad I did. We initially went to the cheese shop (next door) by accident which put me into a cheese frenzy - there was cheese everywhere! OMG, I wanted it all. They had a lovely cheese tasting by the door which I partook in and the gentlemen very kindly showed us to the ""Cheese Bar"" next door after letting us over sample his offerings. I didn't realize how nice of a restaurant it was, I was expecting it to be casual and it wasn't. We didn't have a reservation (oops!) but there was room at the bar for the 3 of us. I have to say that I think the bar seating is usually the best since you can watch the food being made and the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. Murray's is a very small and intimate space, the lighting was dim and it felt very romantic. I loved the vibe!  We ordered wine (I had a Pinot Noir), their famous mac n cheese (we got the original but I wish I had splurged for the lobster mac n cheese, it was double the price so we were hesitant to spend that much before we tasted the original), and their grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and a smoky tomato soup. IT WAS ALL FANTASTIC. We ate that mac n cheese in a minute - it was so good. It's a blend of several cheeses and it was delicious. It went so well with the wine! The grilled cheese sandwich was delicious as well, very hearty and I'm glad I added the bacon to give it a salty kick. The soup was good but the cheese was definitely the star.  I wish I had more room in my belly, there were so many dishes I wanted to try! Their cheese is phenomenal!  In case you're wondering, I didn't get the cheese plate (my usual go to in a place like this) because I had already had one of their cheese plates at Aldo Sohm earlier in the week. All of Aldo's cheese's, which are carefully selected by the cheese monger, are from Murray's! I'll do a separate review on Aldo Sohm - which was also amazing!! This is one of those places you have to visit before you die, especially if you are a cheese fanatic like I am. Worth the trek across town to the Lower West Side. Pros: ambiance, wine (affordably priced!), and cheese selections. I would start with the mac n cheese (just go for the lobster - I wish I did). Get a cheese plate!!! Grilled cheese is good and hearty and is a good dish to split with someone else. Cons: Small place gets packed quickly. Get a reservation! We lucked out and were seated right away but it looks like a reservation is usually required or else there will be a long wait. The biggest con - not enough room in my belly to get more cheese in there.",1,,
13,Hannah P.,"Boston, MA",316,213,181,4.0,3/27/2018,"One of my favorite spots to do Sunday snacks and drinks. Their sour beer selection makes me ohh so happy (I know I know, I'm pairing beer with cheese, I do what I want) and their mongers are gifts from above. My friend and I are cheese fanatics and prefer to do mongers choice and be surprised. Never eva been disappointed with what we've received. I would suggest pre-gaming this stop with a whirl around their cheese shop next door to excite the senses, then come here, do a surprise board,  imbibe and THEN, go back to the market and go wild and get way more cheese and accompaniments than you should. Full proof plan. Ready go.",1,1,2
14,Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,54,100,4.0,3/23/2018,"First of all...I Love Cheese! And second...their cheese is fantastic! Sooo i went here with my wife and shared a small plate of Cheesemongers Choice.  It came with 3 different cheese, each one of them came with a small snack like raisins and pickles. And also 2 different meats. The staff is very attentive. They will ask you specifically what kind of cheese you prefer like nutty? Or creamy? Or if you have any dislikes. They come with the cheese plate pretty fast, and once they put it on the table they explain immediately what kind of cheese it is and why they put specifically this snack with the cheese.Everything tasted more than great, but ya it's kinda on the pricey side. And I'm actually a little bothered that I didn't get a side of bread. I don't know why, but maybe I'm just used to always get bread with cheese lol. I will definitely come again and I would recommend this place for all cheese lovers!",,,3
15,Tiffany W.,"New York, NY",248,294,177,4.0,8/5/2018,"My friend and I came on a Friday as we were craving mac and cheese, We waited for about 20 minutes for seats at the bar as wallk-ins. We ordered the cheese melt which came with tomato soup and the mac and cheese. For drinks we got the fresco, which unfortunately wasn't great. It was hard to drink since it tasted mostly just like ice. It needed more strawberry purree to bring out the flavor. The food though was definitely satisfying.",,,
16,Michaela R.,"San Francisco, CA",15,4,6,5.0,7/25/2018,"Came here with two friends for brunch on a Sunday. We had bloody Mary's but if I come back I'd try the mimosa flight because it looked amazing! We ordered the 5 cheese plate, the kale Caesar salad, and the breakfast Mac n Cheese to share. It was all to die for. The cheeses were amazing and all paired perfectly. The kale Caesar was good but the dressing wasn't fully tossed, so some leaves had a ton of dressing and others were naked. The breakfast Mac n cheese was insanely filling and tasted pretty good. Between three people, we left stuffed and couldn't even finish everything!",1,,
17,Mich M.,"Manhattan, NY",24,93,684,4.0,4/17/2018,"I'm a cheese lover, very passionate about cheese and good meats. I've been dying to check out Murray's Cheese Bar. The pictures on their instagram tempts me every day.First, I went to Murray's Cheese Shop for a Garden Goat since it's National Grilled Cheese Week and they have it this week only. But the lady staff says they stop serving grilled cheese at 4:30pm (I got there at 5:30pm) and told me to go next door so I did. Turns out they don't have the Garden Goat in Murray's Cheese Bar. However, since I sat down already and I've always wanted to come here, I browse through the menus and chose a Cheesemonger's Choice of 3 cheeses and 2 meats for $32. French restaurant? Happy Hour? This led me to pairing my plate with a glass of Pinot Blanc from Alsace, France, for $8. I love cheese. But the pictures look better than it tastes. Salamis were tough and hard to chew. So were the slices baguette. I was thinking you gotta have super strong teeth to bite this baguette. Overall, as a cheese lover, I appreciate the cheeses but they're not my most favorite. I'm open to try the other French cheeses on their menu though. The service and ambiance was a 10/10.",,,
18,Sofia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,50,72,5.0,4/2/2018,"Good cheese, great service. We stopped by Murray's Cheese Bar for their happy hour and it was a lovely experience. Upon ordering the cheese platter (three cheese, two meats) my group was pretty mesmerized. The platter came with bread and each cheese was paired with a unique spread (we got pistachio butter, a caramelized onion spread and  a fig and olive spread). This spot is great for cheese fanatics and enthusiasts because you don't get to choose what you get, but as long as you love cheese, trust their pairings and enjoy the hell out of it. The cheeses served change regularly so it'll be a new experience every time.Along with the cheese, we ordered the grilled artichokes--also very tasty, but as you can imagine, you come here for the cheese.",,,
19,Vaibhav S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",612,224,58,3.0,7/12/2018,"My girlfriend a self-ascribed cheese aficionado sat salivating at the brunch menu but ended up leaving a little more disappointed than what we thought would be a cheese bonanza. We partially blame ourselves for being ambitious and going with the DIY Raclette which is more trouble than it is worth. The waiting game to have cheese melt just makes you hungrier and hungrier and you just start munching on all the things that are supposed to be topped by the delicious cheese. I really liked the cheese plate, but after all that cheese, it just felt like a little too much in my stomach at one time. Overall, I think we may have ordered wrong, but it was an underwhelming meal with pretty good but very similar flavors through out.",,,

Updated review","""I don't believe in brunching, but I really liked this place.""  Yea, I'm anti brunch.  Is this something worth taking a stance on?  Absolutely not, so I'll just leave it at that.  I came by on a Saturday afternoon.  I tried their Mac & Cheese as well as their avocado toast, both of which were delicious.  Be sure to add bacon onto the Mac & Cheese, as it really adds to the flavor, in case you didn't know that about bacon lol.  The cheese to macaroni ratio was pretty on point too.  Yup, that matters to me.  The portions aren't too filling, so if you've got a huge appetite, you may want to order two dishes.  The burger here is very good too.  I believe the meat comes from the butcher shop down the street.  Very high quality and well prepared.  I ordered the burger with an egg in it, but I don't think I'll do that again because the yolk exploded off the burger and I had to eat them separately.There was no wait to be seated, but food took a while to come out.  However, it's definitely worth the wait.  The wait staff is really friendly, and I really liked the laid back atmosphere.  Would come back.UPDATE: This place is still great",,,
21,Sy Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",263,210,1809,4.0,6/19/2018,"When in West Village, this is my go to cheese stop. Love the nice variety of cheese, cured meat, crackers, lobster mac yum... if you're a cheese lover, you're likely to find what you're looking for than not. And Wine!! Yes, they have great wines too. Nice beer selection as well. Sour beer? May not sound very appealing but, worth the try. Becareful as you might get hooked.Perfect for brunch or just some cheesy snack!",1,,
22,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,256,201,2.0,7/5/2018,"Overall underwhelming. This place was on our ""to try"" list for awhile as my roommate and I both like cheese. We came on a Thursday at about 6pm. I don't know what I expected for the atmosphere of a wine and cheese bar to be, but I guess I assumed it'd be a bit less like a rowdy bar. It was so loud throughout our dining experience that we both found ourselves shouting to be heard by the waiter or each other. (It was one of those awkward places where the waiter wasn't speaking loud enough and after asking them to repeat themselves twice you just give up on ever hearing whatever it was they said.) We got the seasonal squash blossoms and the raclette for 2. We both really really enjoyed the squash blossoms- those were a 5 star bite for sure. However, you only got 3 for $18. The portions of the raclette for 2 were equally sparse. We both agreed there wasn't enough ""stuff"" for the cheese. They give you one area to melt cheese too, which makes it a bit odd because essentially only one of you will be eating at a time. Considering we left here and made a b-line for the pastry shop across the street, I'd say it wasn't a great value for $35 either- don't order this expecting it to be an entree size deal. (We also had to prompt the waiter to get all of the accompaniments stated on the menu.) I'd sill like to try their grilled cheese, but I'll probably do it from their cheese shop instead and skip this place again.",,,
23,Ciara D.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",49,21,2,5.0,9/23/2018,"Finally made it to brunch before they sold out of the prosciutto hash! Totally worth the few times trying to get it, and the croque madame was amazing, as was the breakfast burger that my bf had. The bechamel on the croque was better than I could have imagined. I just came back from Paris so I'm hyper aware of cheese quality and choice, and this was the perfect welcome back brunch. The flight of the mimosas was also perfect. I thought I would have liked the classic orange juice mimosa the best, but the apple and strawberry lemon drop were equally as awesome, and strong. The staff are also well versed in the food and beverage pairings and are just really cool cheese people.",,,
24,Recel L.,"North Bethesda, MD",184,133,179,5.0,1/18/2018,"If you love cheese, you need to come here. My friend and I split the Murray's Melt and the mac & cheese. Hands down the BEST grilled cheese and mac & cheese I've ever had! The blend of cheeses went perfectly together and were creamy and delicious. I loved the smokiness of the tomato soup, but it lacked the typical liquidy texture of soup and got cold pretty quickly, so it seemed more like a dip for the grilled cheese. Otherwise, amazing meal and we left stuffed. My other friend ordered a combination of meat and cheeses. Our server was helpful in picking out a few cheeses based on her preferences. Would love to try that next time as well. Service was quick, the restaurant itself was cute and cozy... 5/5 experience.Definitely coming back here on my next trip to the city!",,,
25,Liz T.,"New York, NY",508,165,124,5.0,11/16/2017,"If you love cheese as much as me, you HAVE to come here. This is cheesy heaven. My friend and I came here to feast on their wide assortment of cheese based foods. We got:The Fondue: Fondue is one of the best forms that cheese can come in. This fondue came with a huge mound of toasted bread, pickled onions, and pickles. On top of that we had a choice of apples or potatoes. The potatoes were sliced into wafers and baked to be crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It was a perfect pairing with the cheese. The cheese itself had some nutmeg mixed in, making it taste super Christmas-y. Absolutely delicious, highly recommend.Cheese Plate: They gave really generous portions of the meat. We got a huge mound of prosciutto, which was way more than other places typically give you, but we ate it happily. Each cheese you get comes with some sort of spread to pair with it. We also got a bag of soft, cut up baguette.Mac and Cheese: Covered with fried onions and bacon. Super heavy, but super creamy and delicious. We couldn't finish it at the restaurant so we took it home and it was just as good reheated the next day. They also have quite an extensive wine list and the wait staff is knowledgable about pairings. The space isn't great for big groups in my opinion, but this is a really cozy spot for groups of 2-4.",2,,
26,Enya G.,"Edison, NJ",578,89,108,4.0,12/6/2017,"Food: we got the cheese plate with three cheese and two meats. It came with bread and jam. A good portion for a casual cheese night. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip. It came with crispy bread which complimented the warm cheesy dip. Service: good service. We made a reservation and they seated us right away. Overall, this place has a cool atmosphere and a classy wine and cheese restaurant. I enjoyed the cheeses we got and they had a variety more to pick from. I'd recommend coming here to get a cheese platter!",1,,
27,Angela L.,"New York, NY",289,223,186,2.0,1/1/2018,"Definitely don't go here if you aren't SUPER into cheese. Aren't any ""less cheese"" options. In fact, for a cheese restaurant, the menu could be better (i.e.: more Raclette options). Also, the cheese trays contain really sharp cheeses, not the type from the deli - be prepared for that. Came here for NYE, no mandatory pre fixe which was nice. The mac And cheese was nothing special really. The cheese was wilder than what is usually made to make mac and cheese. Waitress messed up our order but it's whatever I guess. Brussels sprouts were good and I did appreciate their extensive list of ciders",,,
28,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,529,28,4.0,5/12/2018,"We were in the area with time to kill on a Monday evening and decided to stop in on a whim. The prices for everything were definitely on the high side. Yes, even for Manhattan. I wanted to try the lobster mac, but at $30, we felt priced out of that option. But the menu is truly a cheese lover's dream. Aside from what we actually ordered, I wanted to try the burrata, the melts, the fondue...The saison was pleasant and quite light. It had a slightly bitter aftertaste and a yeasty quality with fresh cut grass notes and a hint of sweetness. An excellent pairing for cheese, as it really allowed the cheese to shine.BBQ Pulled Pork Mac - This apparently won a 'people's choice award' from TimeOut, and it's easy the see why. What wouldn't the people love about tender barbecue meat coated in a cheesy and sweet'n'sour barbecue sauce? The cheese had a nice, sharp bite to it. Tiny little bits of banana pepper add some tang. My boyfriend gave it pretty much the highest compliment that he'd pay to mac and cheese: It wasn't too heavy.We also ordered a cheese plate with three selections from Italy. Unfortunately the menu isn't available online for me to reference, but I believe that one was a blue cheese (gorgonzola), another was goat cheese, and the third was sheep's cheese. Each cheese was served with a recommended pairing, although you can feel free to go wild and combine different cheeses/accoutrements.the blue- sharp and pungent with an astringency that the honey doesn't so much cut as complimentthe goat- soft, creamy, and buttery, paired with rich, decadent, dark berry jam that packs a punchsheep- the most offbeat of the three. Mushroomy and a bit earthy. The maple flakes were unique to a cheeseboard (at least for me), but I don't know if they added a whole lot of flavor or excitement aside from some texture and sweetness.",1,1,1
29,Allie R.,"New York, NY",302,99,19,3.0,10/11/2017,"Please tell your server to put a smile on her face. Every time we spoke with her (which was only twice...she ignored us all night except to take our order and finally give us our bill), she was very curt and not receptive to our ""thank you""s or questions. Had she come back sooner, we probably would have ordered another drink!When we got to Murray's, we were seated right away. This was great considering we got lost multiple times on the way and ended up 15 minutes late for our reservations (note: we called the restaurant and the hostess was not very helpful in getting us to the right place). We had one minute left before happy hour ended so we ordered two glasses of wine right away (maybe this is why the waitress hated us...because we ordered wine with the guy who filled up out water - who did an amazing job at keeping our glasses full, mind you).For food, we ordered: The New York cheese plate, the brussel sprouts, and the buffalo cheese curds. Everything was really good! The cheese curds get cold fast so my tip to you should you choose to order these is eat them fast! The bread served with the cheese plate seemed a little stale.This restaurant is pricey for what it is and what you get, but it was still a fun experience.  They have an actual cheese shop a few steps down the block from the bar and while I did not get to check it out, I would think it would be a fun place to check out following a meal or snack at the restaurant. The restaurant it really cutely decorated and definitely ""cool"". It almost has a rustic hipster feel with wood tables and old chairs and benches. If you get a drink, the price range is definitely above $30/ person if you are eating too.I probably will not return because of the negative experience with the waitress and the price, but if you love cheese and dishes including cheese, give it a shot!",3,,

31,Devki P.,"New York, NY",299,72,33,3.0,4/10/2018,Wasn't the biggest fan which made me super sad because I was so excited to try this place. We had made a reservation and were pretty early but we still somehow ended up with a horribly cramped table in the corner by the bar where we kept getting hit by people sitting/standing at the bar. Service was slow and the food also wasn't super great (this may have been our fault and we may have just ordered wrong). The Mac and cheese was REALLY good but the grilled cheese and curds were just ok. Maybe would consider coming back and ordering differently,1,,

Yes, cheese smores!  Seek her out, find her and sit at the bar to have her serve you, you will not be sorry!The menu selection, with the mac and cheese (Selena said add bacon, so we did) was incredible.  Everything cheese ramped up a thousand levels.  I recommend a cheese and charcuterie board followed by mac and cheese with a pile of bacon.  Just get that, period.go here",2,1,2

Got here with a friend right before 6pm and we were able to get a glass of wine for $8. I highly recommend getting a cheese plate to share. We ordered the cheesemongers choice plate of five cheeses or meats. The cheesemonger selects your cheese and meats themselves, so I recommend this for indecisive people like us. You can also order a la carte. So the plate also comes with some bread and jam! These go really well with all these cheese. My favorite cheese had to be the brunet, which was a goat cheese with a very sweet flavor and creamy texture! We also ordered some mussels and fries to share. The fries were a little too salty. The mussels were very good, but a little on the smaller sides but they were very flavorful! The restaurant is pretty cute. Great for intimate dates or to catch up with a friend, but definitely not good for big parties. It was pretty empty when we arrived but filled up by 8pm.

35,Taryn R.,"Charlotte, NC",285,466,2505,5.0,7/17/2017,"In a whirlwind visit to the city we essentially ate our way through Lower Manhattan. Of all the amazing spots we visited, Murray's Cheese Bar was my favorite, hands down! First, let's talk about their beer selection. Ted scored the Double Daisy Cutter from Half Acre. A unicorn beer for sure! I enjoyed the Granola Brown Ale from Black Hog Brewing -- specifically designed to pair with cheeses. We never expected a cheese bar to have a world class beer selection but boy were we pretty pleased that they did! Once we had beers in hand, it was time to explore the food menu. Obviously, cheese was on the docket. We went with a pecorino and willoughby plus a little spicy chorizo. So. Much. Yum. The friendly cheese monger that delivered our selection struck up a conversation with us and took great care of us all night long. Pro tip... Sit at the bar, ask for Selena, order all the cheese, and prepare yourself for an awesome night.We shared the Mac & Cheese (add bacon, obviously), ooooohing and ahhhhhhhing over every creamy bite. Selena surprised us with a crazy dessert -- I'm not sure what it's called but it was like a s'more with a graham cracker base, chocolate and flambeed cheese. That's right, folks. Dessert with cheese on top. It was just wild enough that it worked. As we were leaving, Selena recommended we check out Blind Tiger, a beer bar just a couple hundred feet from Murray's. It was an awesome suggestion (tons of awesome, hard to find beers!) and we pretty much want to be Selena's new BFF.",5,2,3
36,Carmen W.,"Brooklyn, NY",217,301,226,4.0,2/13/2018,"Murray's cheese bar has an innovative way to get your cheese fix while making you work for it if you choose to get the raclette. Here, they give you a little DIY station with 4 different cheeses, 2 pieces each. Accompanied with a choice of bread or I think another carb, you can scoop your melted cheese onto literally anything. My favorite dish was probably the brussel sprouts which was totally unexpected for a cheese bar. It was well flavored and addictive. Shishito peppers were alright, and a little oily, and the mussels were also a winner. We had to ask for more bread to dip in the mussel sauce. My only complaint was that the mussels were a little tiny. My party and I also ordered mac n' cheese which was a solid, but nothing extraordinary. Malbec wine went great with our dinner, and I can't wait to come back and have another great time :) Ideal dinner date between your boo or with a group of girlfrans",1,,

The specials looked incredible as well. You might want to schedule in a nap after eating here.",1,,
38,Jaana S.,"Glen Head, NY",298,166,165,4.0,7/16/2018,"Murray's Cheese Bar is the perfect date spot to cheers a glass of wine and split a raclette! Sadly, I'm very single so I came here with my friend who I like so it's fine. My friend and I each got a glass of wine and decide to split the raclette! The raclette was a cool ~diy~ dining experience. You get to melt your own cheese and then pour it over your meats, cornichons, mini bread wedges, and caramelized onions. It was really fun, and the waiters were funny but clearly recycling their jokes because we heard our waiter reuse his same one-liner about Tetris to an adjacent table. Whatever. I guess the takeaway from this review is that the cheese here is crazy good and that I want to go on a date here.",,,

These two things made me quite happy. I got the sake bloody mary (which was delicious), and the Brie & Blueberry Compote Melt and OMG, it was seriously one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever consumed. It was perfectly buttery, cheesy, and the sweet compote was the perfect pairing to the Brie - just so GOOD! I must come back to try all their cheesy creations.",3,2,3
40,Rhondel W.,"New York, NY",1034,22,71,5.0,2/7/2018,Murray's Cheese Bar is a phenomenal experience for a date or just for a casual catch up with friends! What I like the most about the bar is that it's very small which makes it intimate and it can be likened to the Cheese version of Hot Pot if you get their Raclette With that being said GET THE RACLETTE! The value proposition is there from a food standpoint because you will be filled and it's such a cool experience that I think it makes the overall experience wonderful. I can't say conclusively but this restaurant may have sparked up my love life...but we'll see about that soon haha! I haven't had an opportunity to get a lot of things on their menu but it was such a great time that will definitely be back!Foodgram: @letschifan,1,,
41,Gerrie L.,"New York, NY",493,73,49,4.0,12/10/2017,"I've been wanting to try raclette ever since I saw those Facebook videos. You know which ones I'm talking about. Also, I LOVE cheese, despite being lactose intolerant, so you know I suffered for this meal. :) My SO and I ordered the raclette for two (plus potatoes, an extra $4), and the classic Mac and cheese. We thought about getting the seasonal, but currently it's something with butternut squash. The classic was decent, definitely tasted it's price. I thought the cheese in it is a little on the light side, not in amount but in taste. It could use a bit more heaviness. The crumbly crust was nice though. I'm not sure what kind of noodles they used but I enjoyed them! they were like little spirally balls, like those mixing balls you put in your morning protein shake. As for the star, the raclette, it's mostly about the experience. I had a mixed emotions. I guess because i was expecting a big slab of cheese and melting it off the top, but instead they gave us a little metal tray that's hoisted above three little candles. Surprisingly gets hot enough to melt the cheese! The three cheeses we got were an American white cheese and two French ones? I was worried that they would be pungent or funky because I have heard that as a common complaint, but they were just fine! They were served with prosciutto, baloney, pickles, bread, potatoes, and........mushrooms? Not sure what the brown thing at the end of the tray was. All in all it was good, but the raclette came off as a glorified cheese plate and for $35 I'm not sure it was worth that. It was fun to put the little breads on the metal tray and making mini-grilled cheese sandwiches! Also, pro tip: pour the cheese all over your potatoes. Mmmmm. I'm not sure I'd come here again until I've made my rounds with all the other cheese/raclette places, but it definitely makes for a good date place. The atmosphere is romantic, the seating is intimate, and it can be fun to do together. I want to give it 3-3.5 stars because it was quite expensive but I love cheese and carbs and that's all our meal was!!!",2,,

This restaurant combines both. Let's explore what we had for dinner. Our reservation was for 4 pm. At that time there was only one other table being that they open at 4. The restaurant seemed a little small but for that area it was basically standard. Since we had never been to Murray's we had many questions. The waiter was happy to answer them all. What I thought was amazing is that they have something called a Cheesemonger. A sommelier of cheese! I do not know exactly what the selection of cheese we had ordered but it came with it's own sauce pairing. One I do remember is that it had a goats milk caramel sauce. To die for!They slice the pancetta fresh on a sliced in plain view which was pretty cool. We ordered a fried cheese curd happy hour appetizer. Not that big a fan but interesting nonetheless. Then it came to dessert.  OMG OMG OMG.Ch'mores Azura Ulloa, (cheese) chocolate fudge, caramel, peppered marshmallows and maple flakes.

The hostess was so friendly and outgoing. I sat at the bar and had the chance to interact with three guys working back there. All were so nice!! They checked on me frequently without making me feel like they were standing over my shoulder. They were also really helpful about answering my questions regarding cheese and wine. The ambiance: 5 stars. Very cozy, clean, not too loud and not too quiet. The food: 5 stars. Wow! I had a selection of 3 cheeses and prosciutto with a glass of sparkling rose. The cheeses were phenomenal and paired nicely with the accompanying spreads. I was also given a taste of the wine before the full pour which I always appreciate.  Can't say it enough this place is a must go!",,,

I always go for the cheese monger plate which allows the monger on duty to choose whatever they are loving that day for you to try.

It has been on my NYC to do list for as long as I can remember. So needless to say, when my BF got me a class for the holidays, I was PUMPED.We booked the Cheese 101 class for a Thursday night. The class was $70 bucks each, which like you can't beat for unlimited wine/prosecco and cheese tastings. The class started at 6:30pm, which was a bit tight for right after work to get to the West Village, but lots of subways do go to the area.The whole front store is amazing. You walk in and it is cheese heaven. Then the classroom is upstairs. It is a really good size, definitely not overfilled, so was easy to learn and ask questions.You have 7 pieces of cheese that equal a pound of cheese, so you get a lot. With that you also get dried fruit (apricots, cherries) as well as nuts (walnuts, macadamia) and bread slices. I was definitely full at the end.Best part was all the different cheeses and of course unlimited drinks. Overall, great for a group of friends as well as a date night. Highly recommend!",4,3,1

I have it here in Jersey in Atlantic Highlands so it's ok. I'm good. Ordered the cheesemonger and shared it with my hubby. It was something I craved and it's my bucket list. I'm so glad we did. We had three cheeses and two meats. I honestly don't know their names but they were exceptional. The waitresses and the staff were all so wonderful. When we ran out of crackers, they gave us more to go with the rest of our cheeses and meats. So memorable was this place. Thoroughly enjoyed every taste.",5,4,6

We split the Murray's Classic Mac & Cheese and a cheese plate.The Mac & Cheese was incredible. My usual complaint about about mac & cheese is just creamy but lacks a sharper cheese taste. This mac & cheese was a perfect blend. It was rich and creamy, with a great crispy top, but it didn't lose the kick associated with sharper cheeses. While not my favorite combination of cheeses, the cheese plate was very well done. The server was clearly extremely well informed, and the plate was extremely thoughtful.I cannot recommend this spot enough and will definitely be back to try more of the menu.",,,

The customer service isn't the best, our blonde waitress never checked on us once and forgot most of the things we wanted.

This is definitely a great date spot to impress your partner!Mac and Cheese w/ Chorizo: 4.5/5 - Would get Bacon or Lobster(!) with this next time. Chorizo was a little too oily for me. The macaroni held the cheese SO well, and the cheese was delightful. Not sure the mix of cheese here.Prosciutto Hash: 4/5 - I felt this was a little too salty, but it is hash with a cured meat, not sure what I expected. The crispy prosciutto was delicious!Alpine Eggs: 5/5 - They serve this with a thick cheese sauce that you drench your poached eggs with. What's not to love? (20/20 Hindsight: I should have tasted the hash with this sauce...)Croque Madame: 5/5. I'm not that good of a wordsmith to describe how much I loved this.

Updated review","This place is a cheese lover's dream. I recommend the cheesemonger's selection of 5 cheeses and 3 meats. It's not a meal but rather an experience. The boyfriend and I were torn between that and the raclette for two. We're happy we got what we did to say the least. The Buffalo cheese curds are also delectable and I'm usually not a fan of curds. The hard kombucha was a great drink to pair this meal with, especially with you like tart drinks.",,,

Within a few minutes the waitress politely asked if we can move so a bigger group can sit in our are which was no biggie. We had the three flight cheese with three meats and jams. The pairing were amazing! There was an onion pairing which was interesting. It was a tad bit salty, but it was balanced out with the different pairings. The waitress gave us a complementary Buffalo Cheese Curds for moving and it was cheesylicous! There is also a shop next door. Perfect place for your wine and cheese night.",,,
55,May M.,"Charleston, SC",221,43,73,4.0,11/28/2017,"This place was an awesome experience for my boyfriend's birthday and we loved their wide selection of wine, beer, and cheeses. We especially loved how the cheesemonger came over and presented the meat & cheese platter to us, giving us descriptions and awesome pairings. The buffalo cheese curds were very good, however I was a little disappointed by the grilled cheese and artichoke dip. The grilled cheese was overkill for me and just way too rich, and the bacon on it was very fatty. The artichoke dip was okay, but the artichoke flavor was drowned out by the cheese. The smokey toasted baguette made it tasty though. Overall, it was a very cool experience and I would definitely recommend this place, but really only to taste different cheeses and their pairings. It was also quite pricey, so keep that in mind.",,,
56,Eliza S.,"Lincoln, CA",0,12,4,1.0,6/23/2018,"Ew. This place smells like farts. Zero stars.That's what I said immediately after visiting this restaurant and hopping in a cab.Also the service is terrible. We, a party of 4, waited 90 min for a table so a couple could have a date at a 6 person table. When we realized, we kindly asked if they would be willing to switch to a smaller table in exchange for buying their next round of drinks. [Please note: some average looking reds in normal wine glasses.]That next round consisted of the two most expensive glasses of wine on the menu that had a much darker hue, huge bulbous glassware and a $30 price tag - each. To make matters worse, midway through our ""meal"" we discovered they both worked there.Anyhow this was a year ago and I never posted because who has time for this - but every time my husband and I look a restaurant up on yelp and laugh at the ridiculous complaints (probably like this one), we always say ""ew this place smells like farts, zero stars.""All and all if you are such a terrible chef you can't cook a cheese board at home you deserve this establishment.",,,

The staff was super helpful in making our plate and explaining the flavors.The classic Mac and cheese was also amazing and very creamy.

If you are interested in doing this, get the buffalo cheese curds that are lightly fried then coated in buffalo sauce which you dip into a blue cheese.  Im not even a fan of blue cheese, but it is so creamy and delicious. Cheese on cheese is amazing. I also liked the sliders.  Each of the 3 sliders is topped with a different cheese.  The burger itself is grilled perfectly medium.  Too bad they don't serve fries, which I would have totally requested to have smothered in cheese.  Note, during the week, lunch is only available on Fridays.  You order from the dinner menu so  it's a tad pricey for lunch but nothing is too pricey for cheese lovers.",4,4,3

Just skimming through the happy hour menu, I got the impression that this place was NOT cheap. A limited number of cocktails were available for $10 and small bites were hovering around $10 for such a small proportion. We ordered Chorizo al Sidra and and Cheese Bar Sliders. Chorizo al Sidra is basically fried chorizo. Only a few spoonful of fried chorizo was served. It wasn't bad but for $10, I could get a proper dish somewhere with a bigger portion.Cheese Bar Sliders were quite disappointing. Three micro sliders were served with a tiny little cube of cheese melted on top of the patty. For a restaurant that highlights cheese, this frugal existence of cheese is pitiful. The buns were broken and dry. The patty was very rare. I personally don't mind this because I tend to eat my meat rare-medium, but this blood dripping rare patty should be noted to the customer if this is how they serve their sliders. I can't believe this is $18 which is $6 for each. The service was good but the food was not impressive at all.",1,,

I would say the blue cheddar cheese was my least favorite as it was strong in taste and odor. To share, my bf and tried the Murray's Melt which included a grilled cheese with tomato soup. Every last bite of that grilled cheese and tomato soup is worth it. My mouth is still watering over the cheesy, creamy taste! YUM! To top off our evening, we opted for the ch'mores which is a totally overpriced piece of cracker, chocolate, marshmallow and a bit of cheese. Was it good? It was okay.

Ambience was lovely though; small, quiet, good date spot.Another review to come in the future, hopefully!",3,2,3

On a Saturday night it was crowded, but we managed to get two sits at the bar in no time.The place is nice, service was very good, but obviously cheese is what matters here. We ordered the fondue, which comes with a lot of good bread and some vegetables. One can say that there is that fondue mix sold at the market to finish at home, there is the fondue you do by yourself by melting cheeses, the ones at restaurants and then this one... this is at a different level for sure. Not super cheap but not expensive either, definitely recommend.",,,1

Between two people, we ordered a cheese board, the curds, and the classic grilled cheese with tomato soup dip. Could have done without the sandwich which was a bit heavy and greasy. We called ahead which was a good idea on a Saturday because it was BUSY!Definitely plan on going again!",,,

Came here for the first time about 3 years ago and remember having the best grilled cheese of my life. 3 years later and now living in the city, the food is still as amazing as I remembered.Came here with my best friend and we got the raclette for 2 with potatoes and the bacon marmalade melt. Both AMAZING!Let's start with the raclette. They give you 3 types of cheeses (today was some Swiss cheese, one from vermont, and traditional raclette), 2 meats (pepperoni and prosciutto), some type of shallots, pickles, and we ordered the potatoes for an extra $4. They give you these cute little skillets to melt the cheese yourself. Literally everything about this dish was amazing. All the cheeses, meats, and even sides were great quality and the perfect flavor. I was so happy that the prosciutto wasn't overly salty. Hell, it wasn't salty at all! Once you pile all those ingredients on top of a piece of breaded with melted cheese you can't go wrong.Omfg the bacon marmalade melt with tomato soup was fantastic. I can still taste the delicious bacon mixed with the sweetness of the marmalade and creaminess of the cheese. The bread is also somehow just toasted perfectly. Soup is delicious and smooth.If you can't tell, I literally love everything about this place. Definitely in my top 5 meals I've ever eaten anywhere!",1,3,1

I didn't have reservations but they were able to give me a table for a couple hours(which was plenty) until their reservation arrived. We were greeted by several waiters and waitresses, all were very eager to help and answer any questions we had about the menu. We started with the buffalo cheese curds. We got the sauce on the side because we're weren't sure how spicy they'd be. Sauce was superb, curds even better. Next up, classic Mac and cheese. One word: delicious We finished with the Melt. It was really yummy. The tomato soup had a smoky taste to it. Worth a try, but def not your classic tomato soup. Ps. All items were under $42 Would definitely return!",2,,

Fried little nuggets of squeaky cheese covered in a traditional buffalo sauce and served with their house made blue cheese dressing.  These little buggers never stood a chance!  The three of us scarfed those down in no time.Last was shared an order of their version of fried chicken.  The four (smallish) pieces of chicken looked super-crispy from the outside and was served with dipping sauces and some slaw...but it turned out the inside of the chicken was way underdone and the breading soggy.  This was the most disappointing dish of the evening and really ended the meal on a sour note.As others here have said...presentation of the dishes was well done and the food okay, but not worthy of a repeat visit, in my opinion.",3,,

Also, a lot of what's on their happy hour is on their regular menu for the same price. This to me kind if defeats the purpose of happy hour.I also made a reservation for 5pm and apparently the reservations have a timed duration of stay. Maybe because this is a popular restaurant? Usually when I go to other places, unless it's an all you can eat, you have the table till whenever.Since I want to leave on a good note:I did really like their seasonal mac and cheese and their cheese curds were also pretty good. Their artichoke dip was also pretty good. I also ordered the grassfed burger, which could use a lot less salt. Their sangria was also A+.",2,,

88,Kelly E.,"New York, NY",124,399,56,4.0,4/23/2017,"Yeah I love cheese I won't hide it, but Murray's cheese bar is just an EXCELLENT place to enjoy everything (not just cheese!)If you're a fan of a classic tomato soup/ grilled cheese combo I highly recommend the Murrays Melt ($12 for a full grilled cheese and cup of tomato soup).Fried chicken ($22) comes with ONLY chicken no sides so just be warned. The chicken itself is quite moist and decently seasoned, can taste a little burned though.Mac and cheese ($10) is delicious and pretty filling for one person! Could be served as an appetizer for the table to split too.This place - no surprise - can get pretty crowded on saturdays or normal meal times so if you have a group of more than 2 people i recommend you make a reservation in advance.Happy hours Monday-Friday until 6pm and they also host a lot of ""meet the maker"" sessions (for cheeses, wines, ciders, beers, etc) so it's a good way to try some tasty new foods for a slight discount!",1,1,
89,G B.,"Kenilworth, NJ",11,760,4908,2.0,8/12/2018,"ok let me start off my saying this review is mainly for the staff. the food is very good.prosclean bathroomi had the murrays melt (aka grilled cheese) with fries instead of soup. fries were very good. they gave me a thing of ketchup for dipping. sandwich is huge! i suggest you share because i couldn't finish it. i didn't wanna take it home becuz i wasn't sure how it would heat up again. cons: service is horrible! the hostess sat me at the bar and there were many empty seats she could have sat me in. mind you i'm just not comfortable sitting at the bar. table is very high for me. so i asked if i could sit at a table and they said yes. my waiter took my order and boom i was done. i was starving. it literally took almost a half hour for this dish to be made. WTF?!? its a grilled cheese and fries! didn't think it would take that long. he didn't check on me a lot by saying ""oh it will be just a few mins. ""sorry for the wait"" etc. he only asked me once how the food was and thats it. i asked for my check twice by him and someone else. he kept bouncing around taking selfies with the hostess. and last but not least the price of this sandwich was a bit high at 16 dollars. did i know? yes. did i pay? yes. was it worth it? ehh. your choice. cheese was very good. everything was good. i wouldn't come back just because of the service. i think its a bit stuck up for me. things on the menu didn't really catch my attention besides this sandwich so whatever. bit over priced if you asked me.",1,,

It smells kind of yucky, but if you can get past that, it's a great spot to go with your date or some friends. We sat at the bar and ordered a Hill Farmstead soluble galaxy IPA on draft. They had a good beer and great wine selection. They have a menu of meats and cheeses, each listed, and then a few cheese plates listed that were pre-made up so you didn't have to figure out exactly what you want. Then they had the ""Cheesemonger's Choice"", in different quantities - we opted for this, with 5 total cheese and/or meats. I was confused at first and thought that meant we had to pick the cheeses out, and I felt overwhelmed, but our server told us it was up to the cheesemonger. I just had to tell him what kinds of cheese I DID NOT like. That made me feel better, all I had to do was sit back and wait for our cheese plate!I was highly satisfied with whatever cheeses and meat they ended up picking out. I don't know what the cheeses were called but they were all VERY good. If you're looking to do something a little different than just sit at a bar or restaurant, I recommend going here.

My friend and I made our way over around 8 PM on a Friday night. The hostess quoted us a 40 minute wait, but since it was just the two of us we quickly found two seats at the bar. Because our sole purpose was to get cheese, we ordered the Cheesemonger's Choice with five cheeses and meats. The waiter asked us if we had any preferences on cheeses, but we aren't too picky so we left it up to them. We ended up with two soft cheeses, one hard cheese, prosciutto, and salami with accompanying jams and pickles. The spread was very nicely curated and we enjoyed everything. My friend and I came in hungry and left surprisingly full (it must have been all the bread). Overall, we had a really nice time at Murray's Cheese Bar. The cheese was delicious and we liked sitting at the bar and seeing all the different cheese. I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes and cheeses!",,,
94,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",232,296,601,4.0,2/22/2017,"I've been to Murray's Cheese Bar on two occasions, I could have sworn I wrote a review after my first visit but I guess I didn't...womp womp.1st Visit - 5 stars and more worthy.  The cheese expert working that day was amazing, she really took the time to get and idea of what we liked and put our preferences into consideration when creating our cheese/meat plate. Unfortunately I can't remember the different types of cheeses and where they were from but everything she prepared for us was so amazing and we ate it all. Her pairings with the cheese were on point. 2nd Visit - not 5 star worthy, maybe 3 or 4 if I am being generous. Granted, the place was really busy this time, so I get it, we're not going to get that deep one on one attention with the cheese expert like we did last time, fine. But at the end of the day, I am a paying customer, and I should have the opportunity to discuss some options before I order. The waitress who I found to be a little snooty insisted that you never discuss the cheeses with the cheese experts and that she was well equipped to go over the different types/flavors. I told her the previous time we were here, we not only discussed our order with the cheese expert but we had a very long detailed conversation. I wasn't going to start an argument with her, so I gave in and trusted her. We told her our likes and dislikes and even showed her a picture of our cheese spread from our first visit, as we really wanted to get the same type of meat and blue cheese specifically. She was confident that she knew enough to get our order right but she didn't. The cheeses that came out we're not 100% to our preference and the blue cheese was nowhere near close to what we had ordered last time. The only thing she managed to get right was the meat, thankfully. The experience overall this time around was not nearly as enjoyable or delicious as it was the first time. Next time I come back, I will only order my cheeses through the cheese expert.",6,4,4
95,Cee M.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,30,37,4.0,9/28/2017,"This is where I come when I want some of the best possible cheese that you can find in NYC. I love leaving the choices up to the cheesemongers. They know all of the cheeses intimately, and give a great description for each one. The small pairings for each (raw clover honey, maple flakes, various jams and compotes, cornichons, etc.) are put together seamlessly. I just wish they paid as much attention to the wine selection as they do the cheese selection, which is why this is only 4 stars. From a standard view, the wine list looks great! But I'm in the wine business and saw very little variety. What I look for when I want to enjoy a cheese plate is at least two different glasses of wine that I can enjoy throughout the cheese plate and then one more glass of wine to end on after the cheese plate is finished. I generally look for something as earthy as some of the cheeses, like a Red Burgundy-- a perfectly earthy wine to start out with. In the middle of the cheese plate I look for something with a little bit more fruit, but still exceedingly dry-- maybe a Californian Cabernet Sauvignon, or a New Zealand Pinot Noir. And then to end on, I look for something that's still dry, but maybe with a little bit of effervesce. Their Lambrusco is much too sweet for my palate, so I opted for the Crémant, which is dry, but just not very good. They do however have a wonderful Chateauneuf-du-Pape; the Clos du Mont-Olivet. They have a 2003, which isn't the best year, but that's okay because it's a wonderful wine regardless. However... the wine was poured from a spout inside a wine holding tank. I guess I'm more traditional when it comes to my wine, so when I saw all of the aeration and bubbles that occurred in the glass when it should've been a completely flat surface, I was a bit turned off. Once I let the glass sit for about 5 minutes, it was okay, but I think the system is much too aggressive for a wine that fine. Also, they have one of the BEST rosés I have ever known. The Buchegger Austrian Rosé is phenomenal. The only downside is that it's not offered by the glass and I personally cannot commit to a whole bottle of rosé. One last note: I am splendidly happy with their fortified wine list with the selection of sherry and vermouth. The ciders I have yet to try, but for the cheese's sake I hope there's an earthy unfiltered cider to pair nicely. Come for the wonderful selection of cheeses and friendly service. Don't get your hopes up for the wine. Maybe one day hope will be renewed.",1,1,1

However, I wouldn't recommend this dish. It was very awkward to eat, hot cheese is neither cooperative or graceful. It was very heavy, which is to be expected. That being said I think Murray's cheese bar deserves 4 stars due to the cute environment and nice selection of cheeses. I can speak to the quality of the cheese because I often visit the cheese shop next door, and it is fantastic!",,,
97,Joanna G.,"Manhattan, NY",50,142,0,4.0,4/6/2017,"There's a cheese shop and a cheese bar - don't make the same mistake my friends and I made and walk into the cheese shop really confused and trying to sit where they teach wine/cheese pairing classes. We made a reservation a few days before and we were seated right away. Plus, there were a few empty tables on a Wednesday night, but this was after HH ended.My friend and I had the Murray Melt (grilled cheese) and it was an amazing grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. My other friend had the seasonal mac and cheese with buffalo chicken and he really enjoyed it. They have a pretty nice wine/beer/cider menu and they have suggestions on wine/cheese pairings, but my friend and I opted for a cider instead. Service was great. Decor was cute and simple -- if you sit towards the back of the restaurant near the kitchen, you'll get hit with more of the cheese smell that can be somewhat overwhelming but the front doesn't smell like anything.I don't know exactly how I feel about the restaurant - it's a bit expensive given the smaller size of the entrees. I almost wish I splurged on the cheese platters or the cheese fondue so I could try as many cheeses as possible and have that unique cheese-themed restaurant experience..

I'm always down!  I enjoyed each cheese with its unique jam pairing + mini baguette slices / flatbread crackers.  Our favorite cheese was the Vermont Creamery Bonne Bouche (aged goat cheese), which we ended up buying from the store afterwards.  Can't wait to devour it this weekend with a warm, crusty baguette!  We enjoyed our experience and will definitely be back for more!",2,,1

My gf had a serious issue with a sitter and as a result, she arrived an hour late! Ashley and Madonna both were cool and I appreciated them greatly for it. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I ordered the beet salad and it was terrible.

If a good night involves good wine, cheese, and charcuteries; then let me say Murray's is the spot hands down. Cheese mongers know their stuff and servers were very attentive; small details can go a long way in the restaurant industry.Was feeling for some wine, cheese, and charcuteries platter to start off my evening. If it's your first time at Murray's I would recommend going with their weeks special. Which usually consist of 3 cheeses paired with condiments that will elevate the flavor of a cheese by contrast of saltiness and sweetness. Bringing out unexpected flavor and adding textural complexity to each bite. Tonight I went with the ""week in France"" consisting of the Brebirousse d'Argental from the Rhône Alpes region paired with rasberry jam, the Mimolette Lille region paired with pistachio butter, and lastly Persille de Rambouillet Île de France region paired with a flower based honey mixture. It wouldn't be a platter without some type of charcuterie; went with some smoked cured meat did the trick. That smokey flavor in the cured meat was amazingly good.The Brebirousse d'Argental was definitely my favorite, a creamy texture that's very clean and clear to the palate, the cheese was smooth and very soft. Not overly salty and the rasberry jam compliment the cheese well. You got saltiness snd sweetness all in one. The Mimolette was a crusty orange nutty flavor cheese reminds me of an Edam cheese. The cheese was ok (as you can see from my lack of writing about the cheese) but the pistachio butter was awesome; condensed milk like texture with pistachio flavor. The Persille had a sweet undertone taste to it; earthy with a bit of white pepper kick combination. A one two punch combination; get it lolHigh expectation going in and came out very satisfied.",,1,

It took a few decades for Murray's Cheese Bar to open up right across the street in 2012, but in this case, it was definitely a ""better later than never"" scenario. The venue is a modern, casual counterpart to the cheese shop, offering a variety of beverages, cheese plates, and tasty dishes that feature their star ingredient.I'd visited once before back when they'd first opened to enjoy a curated Cheesemonger's Plate with a friend at the bar. My second visit was nearly three years later, but this time for a weekend brunch. A quick reservation via OpenTable secured our spots on a Saturday afternoon once we'd all arrived and checked in, were seated at one of the tables towards the back of the restaurant. As with most restaurants in West Village, space is a commodity, so the three of us found ourselves doing our best to make do with a two-top; not infeasible, but certainly a little tricky once our dishes arrived.I opted for the Alpine Eggs, which can easily be described as the MCB version of the classic Eggs Benedict. True to form, I was presented with two poached eggs served over sauteed mushrooms, sliced ham, and toasted english muffin halves. The best part, however, was the 3-cheese fondue on the side that was served in place of the typical hollandaise. A side of well-seasoned and slightly crispy potatoes rounded out the dish and were even better when dipped into the fondue.Also worth mentioning are their cheddar grits. Although they were served with a slice of unmelted cheese across the top (not the most attractive presentation), it was solved once we mixed in the cheese. Creamy, savory, with just the right amount of tang from the cheese, it's a perfect side to share... or just eat for yourself.Quite frankly, as long as you're not lactose-intolerant (but isn't that what Lactaid pills are for?), there really is no reason to dislike Murray's Cheese Bar. The venue is suitable for almost any occasion, the selection of cheeses and their utilizations in a wide variety of dishes will appeal to any palate, and it's one of more approachable and affordable options in the neighborhood.",16,9,14
112,Kristin M.,"Fairfield, CT",150,5,4,5.0,5/21/2018,"Amazing!!  This place was wonderful from the moment we walked in. My friend surprised me with this great spot after a long and active day in the city. It's cute and cozy feel makes you feel comfortable and laid back. We ordered a couple drinks which were perfect after what turned out to be a fairly warm day. I had the hibiscus spritz it was delicious, refreshing and beautiful!  We started with the simple salad and a cheese board which we made a la carte. The salad was perfect to split between the two of us and the cheese with their pairings were fabulous!!  I could have lived off of ordering more of the cheese boards alone. We did order entrees. My friend ordered the Murray's Classic Mac and Cheese which was delicious and a decent portion considering how heavy and rich it was. I ordered the Murray's melt, which came with a smoky tomato soup. As silly as it seems seeing as it was essentially a grilled cheese and tomato soup, it was hands down the best one I have ever eaten!! Think you let childhood favorite gets an amped up grown up twist. The soup had so much flavor and was just amazing even after a warm day. The mixture of cheese in the melt was wonderful it was that perfect amount of gooey and melty and just so pleasing to the eyes, nose and taste buds!  The service was a little slow to start but we also walked in and the place was pretty full but our waiter was great and then once the place emptied a little it was a little quieter too. Definitely loved this surprise and will be making this a go to stop on future trips to the city!",,,

The restaurant is intimate, the staff is knowledgeable and helped me be adventurous and try different cheeses with the pairing of the beer they had on tap. The first time I went, the cheese connoisseur gave my boyfriend and I am extra cheese to try on the house. The second time I went was during happy hour and even though I didn't make a reservation on a Friday night they were able to sit me in.As for the class, everyone has to give this class a try. I took the beer and cheese pairing class and the two teachers were informative but also kept things light by adding a few jokes in.  I always knew about wine and cheese pairing but never had knowledge on beer and cheese. During the class you could noticeably tell which beer complimented a cheese.It's my go to place now whenever I'm in the area.",,,

116,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",428,651,2820,5.0,12/2/2015,"I met some friends here for happy hour the other night. Murray's has established itself as a premier cheese shop in New York City, so I was pretty pumped to try their cheese bar down the block (no pun intended ;-). The restaurant itself is kinda narrow but doesn't feel cramped. The decor is simple with wood tones, white walls, and red chairs which add some color (and go with the red Murray's logo). They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner - additionally they have a separate menu completely devoted to cheeses.I started with their Specialino cocktail which contained Cappelletti, grapefruit juice, and seltzer; it was refreshing and not too overpowering. Since there were six of us we decided to go big and split the cheese tower: various cheeses selected by the cheesemonger all nestled on a three-tiered serving stand. I can't remember exactly which cheeses it contained, but there was a nice selection of mild to sharp and soft to hard varieties - all of them tasted super fresh and top quality. Additionally, the tower contained fruit preserves, spreads, and dips PLUS fresh prosciutto and chorizo. Each of us also got a paper bag of crackers and crostini to complement the cheese. It was $65 and worth every penny. I really enjoyed myself at Murray's - their cheeses are top quality and the service was super friendly as well. Looking forward to returning and exploring their cheese shop.",2,1,4

My roommate and I made reservations on Opentable and were seated right away on a Saturday night at 7:30. We noticed it got really busy more around 8pm. We started off with a bottle of white wine and the Buffalo cheese curds on the recommendation of a friend. If you like buffalo sauce, then this dish hits the mark. The curds were denser on the outside but inside was light with a good chew with that buffalo sauce shining in flavor. Mix that with blue cheese dip and you got yourself a solid appetizer. We then shared the Gouda burger which was large in size, plenty of beef and avocado. There was a lot going on in the burger so I actually didn't notice the gouda too much which was a little unfortunate but it was still nice executed, very juicy. We also shared the 5 cheese platter, cheeses chosen by the cheese monger. Each cheese was accompanied by a sauce or a garnish and it ranged from mild to strong. Some sauces that were most memorable were the pistachio Nutella and this cherry sauce. So good. Everything was really well made and the pairings were both smart and delicious.Overall, a really wonderful, cheesy meal. I would definitely go back for that cheese platter again.",11,6,12
124,Kerry A.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",0,12,0,3.0,3/13/2018,"I came here and got seated right away during a weekday. It is a cute place, good for date night. The reason for the 3 stars was the food. I heard about this place and was dying to go. I am a cheese fanatic! I got the cheese board that was pretty good. The seasonal mac and cheese was just ok...the lamb meatballs were mediocre. Not sure if I would go back but if I do, I would try something else. Maybe we chose the wrong dishes?",,,
125,Mala L.,"Long Island, NY",510,312,1261,5.0,9/24/2015,"Omg. Murray's exceeded my expectations. We came on a Wednesday evening and it was *packed* - 25 minutes for a table for two but we didn't mind. They allowed us to order a bottle of wine while we waited which was great.We started off with a meat and cheese board - delicious obviously. I get la tur anywhere that serves it but it was especially good here with their jam. You have the option of ordering meats and cheeses a la carte ($6 each) or allowing them to assemble boards of various sizes which works out to being slightly cheaper.The food was so unexpectedly AMAZING. The menu is quite simple but I still couldn't decide between the mac and cheese, grilled cheese, burger, etc. I just wanted it ALL. I ended up getting the mac and cheese with fried onions on top and my friend had the jalapeno pimento burger. We shared both. So. Freaking. Good. The last bite of my mac and cheese was just as good as the first. Yes, the hype is real.The service was great as well. Our waiter was funny and attentive. We stayed for a while. No one rushes you out here even though it's a small space and the set up makes it feel crowded and loud. There are only a couple big tables so I'd say this spot is better suited for groups of 2-4 or sitting at the bar. Also, Murray's is more modern and NYC-esque than other traditional wine bars.If you're not careful you can end up spending a ton of money here between the wine and meat/cheese but it's worth every penny. Do it.",4,2,4
126,Jen P.,"New York, NY",126,176,149,4.0,10/31/2016,"I accidentally wandered into the cheese shop when my friend told me it was actually a few doors past. It was empty since we came a few minutes after opening. We ordered wine, seasonal mac and cheese, brussel sprouts & kale, and mussels & fries.The seasonal mac was a burrata mac with sage. It was really yum. I kind of wished the burrata was hot. I know it's supposed to be cold, but the cold burrata was kinda weird with the rest of the hot dish. The brussel sprouts & kale tasted clean and really good too. I would not really ever want to eat it on its own, but was good with the mac & cheese.The server was attentive and friendly. He asked us if we were ready for our mussels, but it actually took more than another 30 minutes to come out. That was weird, but we were on our 3rd or 4th glass of wine so we didn't really care too much.The mussels come in this Thai-inspired broth which is so delicious, but could definitely benefit from more reduction. It was slightly too watery. This comes with a small handful of fries, which is disappointing but we were really full anyway. Our bill (for two) was nearly $140 dollars after tip/tax. A lot of damage was probably from the wine (HH isn't that generous here). It was a great dinner, but I still think it's possible to have a similar experience for less.",2,,
127,Ally K.,"Old Lyme, CT",0,7,0,3.0,11/11/2017,"The food was awesome and deserves 5 stars and the music was great. Amazing selection of cider and cheese galore. However, the service was the worst and deserves one star. The hostess was rude and wanted us to eat and leave so she could seat others (I made the reservation 2 weeks in advance so don't rush me!!). Our waitress didn't want to speak to us at all and barely stopped by to ask if we needed anything. She offered no help with the menu and when I asked about cider she seemed to not know at all. I'm not a food snob by any means however I take cheese very seriously and I was hoping for a more intimate experience. The times the food runners came over to serve the meals was the best because they explained everything and seemed actually passionate about lifeFood was great but you could get better and cheaper service in your living room.

This place gets everything right. My sister and I walked in at about 6:30 without a reservation and the lovely hostess told us it would be about 20 minutes for a seat at the bar since the tables were booked straight for the night. Usually I don't like bar seating because it isn't spacious/comfortable - however the bar here is big and beautiful and overflowing with cheese, so we agreed to wait. Not even 15 minutes later, the hostess came outside to show us our seats. We were promptly attended to by our server, and the menu was exploding with possibilities. We settled on the sliders and the raclette for two. I also had a delightful rosé.The raclette was delicious and fun (I'm a kid at heart and still like to play with my food!) the cheeses were all so rich, and the prosciutto and salami were just perfect tasting. The sliders were also seriously mouthwatering! The ambiance is cool & casual, staff is super friendly and conversational but not overbearing, and everything was spotless.I fell in love with this place and can't wait to come here and order some of the other delicious menu options like the mac & cheese, lamb meatballs, and the other amazing cheese/charcuterie choices they have.",5,2,2

That'a in fact exactly what I did. I thought this place would be easily accessible always. My do things change.I lived around the corner from here and would find myself here more frequently than I care to admit. This place is the shit.The shit.I mean, it's a cheese bar. They specialize in cheese with a bar! Ugh. Does it get any better? Yes, yes it does. Immediately you walk in and you're greeted by Ashley who has personality and a beautiful smile for days. Then depending on the luck of the draw you will be served by whichever one of the servers who will impress you even further. Maybe Brendan maybe George? And to further solidify the amazing service there's Jamar or Brian or Eduardo at the bar. Jamar orders the wine and he gets it. I can sit here and rave all day about the amazing cheesy goodness at your fingertips. (Literally cheesy goodness because I have zero qualms and will smack down on the fondue solo. No. Fucks. Given.) I love this place. The cute sleek unassuming romantic decor, the great playlists, the ambient lighting and most especially the people who work here. (Shout out to the cooks in the back. I see you and I love you)I try to come now whenever I can. You'll most likely find me towards the end of the bar telling the staff how much I love them breaking for sips of wine, bites of fondue covered fresh baguettes in between chapters of my  kindle.  Everyone needs a place in New York like Murrays Cheese Bar is to me.

The cheese plate curated by the cheesemonger is the all-star. I went with a friend and ordered 4 cheeses and 1 meat - chefs choice - but looking back, I should have skipped the charcuterie and ordered another cheese. Each cheese was different and distinct, and definitely things that I could never have picked myself. We also ordered the cheese curds in buffalo sauce - a nice treat since I'm originally from Wisconsin. We also split the sliders, which surprisingly, each was topped with a different cheese. Loved that I was able to try so many different options. The key to experiencing Murrays is to share and try as many things as you can. Can't wait to go back!",,2,

I must say, that changed after visiting here. The servers are well versed in all things cheeses. Told them my preferences, and they brought out 5 cheeses I never heard of, but all of them were great. Options outside of blocks of cheese were also very good. The mac n cheese was very good, as well as the grilled cheese.

Everything was beyond delicious and the staff was extremely friendly. Murray's Cheese Shop is next door, we've been in a few times. Again, the staff was unbelievably helpful and patient encouraging you to try differ cheeses before purchasing and they even paired them with delicious accoutrements (things that you would never even think) a delicious creamy blue cheese with a cherry and salted caramel... after we buy our cheeses we then hunt around the shop to find the items that they paired with our tastings at the counter. Never once have we felt rushed despite the long line, they have several Cheese Mongers behind the counter, all who seem to really enjoy their job and eager to please their customers.

140,Eric H.,"Manhattan, NY",50,15,2,4.0,6/24/2017,"If you love cheese plates, or cheese in general, then you should check this place out. I'm not the biggest cheese person, but I've been here twice and loved both meals. The restaurant is a bit cozy, so try to make a reservation if you can. It gets packed during prime time nomming hours, but I've been lucky enough to grab two seats at the bar without much wait. Cheese & meat plates are delicious. The chefs pick the plate for you and they serve it with bread, crackers, and toppings that work well with the cheese - such as honey, jam, etc. I would definitely recommend getting this as an appetizer. Sliders are ridiculous. I'm a huge fan and could eat this every day. It's very simple - bread, patty, and cheese - but extremely flavorful and juicy. Grassfed burger was decent. We ordered a lot of food and this entree got a little cold, so it tasted a bit dry and there wasn't much flavor to it. However, the fries that came with it were awesome. As a side note - I wish they would space out the delivery of the food, if you're sharing plates. They brought out 4 plates at the same time and it was overwhelming to tackle and some food got cold. Piri piri shrimp had some spice to it. It came with a side of potatoes, which I liked more than the shrimp. We were debating between the shrimp or the mussels....I wish we would've gotten the mussels! The mussels looked like a better bang for your buck. Fried chicken will never disappoint me. I'm a bit biased because I love just about any fried chicken. The breading on this one was tasty and the meat was juicy, no complaints here and would order it againDefinitely a cool spot for a date. It can be a little dark and intimate so that you can hide how much mac and cheese you're stuffing into your face. Seems like a win-win to me!",,,

I'm not sure what the crowd is like after work or the weekends, but during the lunch hour it is fairly empty and quiet. I love that. I ate my food in peace to a Bob Marley soundtrack.I opted for the fried chicken sandwich to go along with my mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is so cheesy and flavorful. Giving me tones of the multiple cheeses used to make it. The fried chicken sandwich was good, but I should have requested it without mayo. I think it over powers the sandwich and makes everything messy (according to the mayo stains on my shirt). My server was friendly and quick.

142,Melissa R.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",0,5,1,5.0,3/21/2017,"When my friend told me she made a reservation at a cheese bar, I was both hesitant and intrigued. A bit hesitant because, though I do love mild cheeses and some sharp ones, stinky cheeses scare me. At the same time, I was looking forward to it because we definitely do not have a restaurant like this in Boston and I enjoy trying new things. Thank goodness she made a reservation because the place was bustling.Murray's was a very compact space, which I was informed is normal for NYC restaurants. I literally had to shuffle my way around. That aside, the atmosphere was absolutely awesome. Everyone didn't seem to mind that they were on top of each other and all look like they were having fun. The music was so on point. Murray's had us jamming to some throwback 90's tunes.Like I mentioned before, I'm not the biggest fan of stinky cheeses so the smell was overwhelming when I first sat down. I definitely had to get used to it. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an absolute understatement. Everything we had was incredibly delectable. Every bite was satisfying, mouthwatering. I didn't want it to end. We shared the grass-fed burger, fondue and a side of fingerling potatoes. I knew cheese was good, but darn, this was life changing. I couldn't get enough.I'm definitely returning. In fact, I can't wait. And perhaps, I'll be a little more adventurous next time. This is a perfect evening spot for any occasion.",1,1,1

The entire evening was just a dream from start to finish! We got there a bit early, anticipating having to sit at the bar an enjoy a few drinks (torture, right?!) but the hostess graciously switched some things around and got us seated immediately. Once seated, the server, who couldn't have been more delightful, came by quickly to take orders and when he found out it was a birthday, came by with 2 complimentary glasses of Prosecco, which was such an incredibly generous gesture and so appreciated.For dinner we ordered mac and cheese, fondue, and the mussels - all were simply divine!

There was a group of four of us and we were sat right away. We ordered some Raclette for two, with potatoes on the side. The cheese slices are melted on a cast iron-like pan and then slid into your choice of accompaniments such as meats, baguettes, and pickles. The process was super fun and it was great making combinations. The Murrays Melt was a grilled cheese with a side of tomato and saffron soup. It got high marks from those around the table. I personally went light and got the mushroom and Brie soup... it was so delicious and I'm so thrilled I got to experience it. Highly recommend.",,,
146,Neha P.,"Manhattan, NY",46,145,201,4.0,6/1/2015,"Murray's...they really do know cheese. This is a review for their class - ""Beer and Cheese""Class had about 15 people. There were two instructors (Anu and Kevin) who were both very knowledgeable, and funny. The class was interactive - you could participate if you wanted to, but you didn't have to..which was nice. We got to try 6 different beers (each beer was about one-fourth of a can) and 6 different cheeses (a good size chunk for each one, more than I had expected). They also have dried fruits, nuts, and bread to cleanse your palate between tastings. A hand-out was given at the beginning explaining everything and included space to take notes. Some tips:1. Eat a snack before coming - You don't want to come here in a starved state.. because then you can't completely direct your senses to touch/taste/smell/explore the textures (that's right, i'm getting fancy) of the cheeses. But you also don't want to be full..it has to be the right balance.. which leads me to tip#22. Bring a small tupperware especially if you had dinner beforehand. I couldn't believe the amount of cheese that people had left on their plates at the end of class. Don't waste cheese, take it home!Taking one star away because the class didn't start on time, and everything seemed a bit rushed towards the end. Will definitely be back here. They have a class schedule on their website and offer a variety of other classes - wine and cheese/ whiskey and cheese/ cheese making / grilled cheese, etc. This is also a GREAT date idea..",2,,

Updated review","For all cheese lovers!!I really liked this place. It's a very cozy, cute spot. Make sure you make RESERVATIONS. We didn't know that we needed reservations but we got lucky because there was open space at the bar so they sat us there. We tried the mac and cheese and the grits. Both were great plates. Next time we go we are looking forward to trying the Cheesemonger or the ala carte cheese plates.I recommend this place if you love cheese. If you absolutely cannot stand cheese (or the smell of it), do not go anywhere near this place!      There's Murrays cheese shop a few doors down from there where U can actually purchase cheese blocks and other items as well. It's definitely worth checking out.",1,,

151,Alec M.,"New York, NY",29,21,28,4.0,5/30/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants ever, but then again... I LOVE CHEESE! I'd definitely recommend the Cheesemonger's Choice. Let the waiter (or Monger) know what you don't like, what you do like, or what you're int he mood for. Give them any type of description too! Feel free to say something as simple as ""I don't like stinky cheese,"" or as specific as ""I like nutty semi-firm cow's milk cheeses that have a washed rind.""If you're getting cheese that pairs with red wine, I'd always recommend the Bedell Cab Franc from Long Island (trust me...) if they have it. Otherwise, they are good at recommending something by preference or pairing. They change their menu regularly, but if they have the following I'd highly recommend getting them: mussels, kale sprouts or meatballs. I've never been disappointed in an entree, but in general I'd recommend sharing items, particular ones there are heavy with cheese (ie their mac and cheeses, obviously...). The only issues I have with the restaurant are that you have to make a reservation on OpenTable, they rarely help you if you call in and it is a bit cramped, which makes it harder to get a table, or at least a good one.",,,
152,Brad C.,"Seattle, WA",54,8,4,5.0,6/24/2017,"Do yourself a favor and place your meal in the hands of their cheesemongers!There are several options for meat/cheese combinations and they will build a selection to your tastes.  Want more meat than cheese?  Done!  Want more cheese than meat?  Easy!  Looking to just try something new?  Even better!During our meal Brian (who is either a manager or owner) came over to help us make selections.  We ended up getting the 5 selection option with 4 cheeses and 1 meat, cheeses from ""mild to wild"" each served with a perfect tasting compliment.  We added some mac and cheese and grilled peppers to round out the meal, and a beautiful wine from the Loire valley.  This turned it from a meal to journey as we got to try buttery cured ham, soft cheeses, and the most robust rouquefort I have ever experienced.Local or out of town visitor, they seemed to be inviting and friendly to all their guests.  It is pretty clear they just love what they are doing, and being able to share it with their customers, so do yourself a favor and go be one of them!",,,
153,Ivy S.,"Staten Island, NY",117,60,177,4.0,5/30/2016,"Service was great. Came here with my 6 year old and ordered the classic Mac n Cheese for her but some reason she didn't like it. I actually thought it was delicious and didn't have any funky taste.  Not much else for young kids to eat if you are a parent contemplating ... I had the Rockefeller (fried) Oyster Salad.  I thought the greens were perfect with the slightly tart dressing but too much breading on the fried oysters, felt like I was not getting much oysters out of it.  Lots of cheese and wine selections, obvi.  Can be a cute and casual date and happy hour spot.  Even if the place sucked, there's so many other places to eat and drink at in the neighborhood that makes this a good place to meet up.",1,,1

155,Crystal Y.,"Flushing, NY",194,428,858,4.0,8/10/2015,"Their RW menu is not particularly interesting but since their a la carte is not expensive, we went with their regular menu. We started with the Cheesemonger with 4 cheeses and 4 meats. They were really good. I would say it's the perfect size for our party of 3. My friend and I shared the fondue. The cheese was WAY WAY WAY too salty. Even after we dip the bread and everything, it was too salty for us to really eat it. Maybe it's the particular kind of cheese? Not sure but I'd say not worth it.My bf ordered the Crispy Spring Chicken and we waited at least 20min when we asked our waiter where it is. We were going to cancel it but it was made already so they got it to us and our waiter waived the item on our bill. They were worth the wait though. Super tender meat but the right amount of crisp on the outside. My bf is a lover of fried chicken (popeyes only lol) and he loved it.It is a very nice place with a couple friends since it has really good ambiance. Cheese platter is great. I'd go back again but no fondue this time!",,,

I was really looking forward to this restaurant after all the great reviews, but I just give it 3 stars for the following reasons: Pros:The seasonal mac and cheese is bomb. Their assortment of cheeses are pretty good too. Cons:The raclette was subpar, not what I was expecting. The experience was anti-climactic. It's this rectangular skillet thing that's heated by a candle? and you wait for your three slices of cheese to melt. The fondue is great if you like an un-melted wheel of cheese that breaks the piece of dipping bread you're given. So, we sent it back to be reheated. Womp. The service was eh.",3,1,1

The cheesemonger asked us what our likes/dislikes were for cheeses and he hand selected the BEST cheeses. Throughly explained each cheese, the reasoning behind his choice and even how it would pair with our wines. Each cheese was paired with a homemade jam or candies fruit or specialty mustard. If heaven were missing it's cheese, it resides at Murray's. Now most importantly, we got the flamin' hot cheetos mac n' cheese special and it was bomb. Go there NOW. It's a must. Waiters are super chill. Service was great. Overall an NYC must.",1,,1

Updated review","An update from my review from one year ago-- Murray's is back on my list in a big way!Went on a Saturday night with the BF and sat at the counter (highly recommend-- these are my favorite seats in the house!) and we feasted. Jamar (our waiter, but possibly also manager?) was super attentive, thoughtful, and just all around made our experience great-- I cannot speak highly enough about the service we received! And the food... oh my, the food...Three Cheese Cheesemonger's Plate- per usual, your cheesemonger comes and asks you what you like/don't like in cheese (e.g., BF doesn't love blue cheese), then they pick out the selection for you. This time got a soft-ish cheese, an aged cheese, and a very soft cheese, all of which were out of this world good, each served with a little pairing (a little sauce, cornichon, candied nuts, etc.) and a little bag of bread and crackers. I have yet to be disappointed by any cheese selected for me by these guys-- they know what they are doing!Artichokes-- Didn't expect much from these but WOW. Artichoke hearts (not the whole crazy thing) with tons of flavor. Definitely would get again.Kale Sprouts - sounds like a veggie side dish, but it's also sprinkled with more delicious cheese. The sprouts and crispy and ridiculously good. Love this dish.Burger with fries, bacon added- A good basic burger that comes with this over-the-top side of cheddar cheese gravy(?) that you pour on your burger at your discretion. Burger was perfectly cooked, fries were great, and that cheese sauce... wow. Really something unique and special.Overall, per usual, the food was outstanding and totally unique from anything else I've eaten in the city. Just as importantly, though, the service was flawless-- thanks again, Jamar, for a wonderful Saturday night!",2,,

If you love cheese (and who doesnt) and you haven't tried Murray's Cheese Bar, you NEED to get off your ASS. I'm still salivating about the buffalo cheese curds, the cheese plate was wonderful and so was the burger. PRO TIP: Buffalo cheese curds and everything else",3,,
160,Stanley C.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",3,21,0,2.0,7/24/2017,"Was really looking forward to trying Murray's Cheese Bar since I love Murray's Cheese Shop so much and I've heard generally good things about the restaurant. I'd been looking forward to go since they opened but there's always been a wait whenever I've tried and because the place is on the smaller side reservations use to fill up fast.First we started off with some cheese. Got the Leonora, Jasper Hill Harbison, Mimolette, and the Brunet. The cheese came with a small paper bag of a mix of baguette and crackers. The cheeses themselves each came with an accompanying garnish, a nice variety of clover honey, granola, pistaschaio butter, and I think a balsamic type spread. Barely used the accompaniments since the cheese was so good on its own and the portion sizes didn't really allow for much sampling. At $7 per cheese a la carte it's on the expensive side.Smaller plates followed with grilled artichoke hearts, blistered shishito peppers, stuffed squash blossoms, buffalo cheese curds, and the burrata. Unfortunately, I feel like at this point of the meal the dishes started to go downhill a bit. The artichoke hearts were good but not very memorable. The shishito peppers weren't exactly all that blistered and I felt probably could have been left in the pan or on the flat top longer. The stuffed squash blossoms were interesting enough, they were stuffed and deep fried and overall tasty but I felt like the soft, stuffed squash blossoms just softened up the outer fried layer by the time the plate got to our table. The buffalo cheese curds were okay, basically like mini mozerella sticks with a light buffalo sauce on it and a surprisingly weak tasting blue cheese sauce. The burrata came in two small balls with a bunch of crusty bread and some heirloom tomato slices with a balsamic dressing on it. The cheese on it's own and definitely with the bread tasted really bland and really needed the tomato to give it flavor. Texturally the buratta was good but flavorwise I think it could have used a sprinkling of a nice sea salt to really bring out the flavors of the cheese itself.Mains came after and I think were overall very disappointing. I had the lamb meatballs and there were only three small meatballs in the order. Came with a bunch of crusty bread I assume would be used to soak up the tomato sauce that came with the meatballs. The meatballs themselves didn't seem to absorb any flavors from the tomato sauce, they looked as if they were cooked and then just added to the sauce and brought out right away and not cooked in the sauce itself to allow flavors to develop. And instead of a spiced tomato sauce, it tasted way too sweet to me, almost like a ketchup. I didn't try my friends' grassfed burger or piri piri shrimp but from what they told me and from what I saw, they could have been better. The burger looked way too overcooked and grey and didn't seem all that juicy although I would blame my friend for getting a grassfed burger medium well. To be fair though, there still is a difference between medium well and well done. My other friend told me the shrimp was super spicy and he's usually a spice guy so I guess he probably enjoyed his main.One note about service that was disappointing was that we never got our water refilled which surprised me since our table was right in the middle of the front dining area. Granted we had also gotten a pitcher of sangria but when it's 95°+ outside you can't assume people don't want water just because they have alcohol.So I'd recommend just going to Murray's Cheese Bar as either a pre or post dinner snack, just going to maybe sit down at the bar and grab a few drinks and a variety of cheeses but go elsewhere for the main food. And considering the price of the cheese per serving I would almost say you're better off going a few doors down to the main cheese shop and just grabbing some cheese and snacking at one of the tables they keep in the middle of the shop.",2,,

The wine and food selection was also excellent we had A wonderful Spanish Rioja red wine and grilled artichokes and mushroom toast which was delectable. The Italian white marble bar is beautiful and the atmosphere is lively and sophisticated. As you eat you get an education about wine and cheese and how they go together.This is a fun and unusual way to spend an evening out in one of the most happening sections of New York City. The cheese shop next-door has a staggering display of cheeses and meat from all over the world a selection that you will not see anywhere else.",,,

165,Cameron C.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1,1,3.0,7/15/2017,"I've been going to Murray's Cheese Bar ever since I've moved to NY about 5 years ago. I've tried many things on the menu, but I always end up going with the Murray's Melt (the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo). It has never disappointed me. So I came in on a rainy day hoping to get my cravings filled, but alas that wasn't the case. I ordered my usual order and immediately when the waitress brought it I could tell something was off. The grilled cheese didn't look like it normally did and the cheese was half-cooked having a grainy texture. The bread that it was made out of was like a generic white bread as well - nothing special. The soup looked alright, but when I tasted it it didn't taste as I remember - it tasted as if someone added barbecue sauce to the recipe. I asked our waitress if they changed the recipe of the items and she looked at me like she didn't know what I was talking about. Overall the ambiance is still fine if you're looking for an intimate space to go on a date or to catchup with a friend, but as an avid fan of this place I probably won't ever come back. The food and the service have both gone downhill from what I remember. Very disappointing, as I always loved this place especially in the winter.",2,,

168,Ashley G.,"Tampa, FL",82,159,191,5.0,3/6/2016,"I'd give this place 10 stars for the hundreds of cheese options, more than amazing and extensive wine list, but most importantly how knowledgable and approachable the staff was behind the bar!  I learned so much about cheese here and I am a self-proclaimed cheese nerd.  I had some ""funky"" cheese which I never really knew what that meant but I digress. It had an orange rind and they heated it up slightly so it was easy to spread on bread. I ordered a big, smoky red wine as recommended by the bartender and the cheese changed the flavor of the wine - in the best way possible. It's basically magic!    I don't even remember the rest of the cheese and meat I had but nothing disappointed and if I wasn't by myself and in fear of overdosing on the cheese and being judged, I would have stayed all night!The atmosphere has white tiles and sort of a vintage vibe. There are many seats at the bar which makes it a perfect place to go solo, but there are also many other seats for such a narrow space. Go there - you will never regret it!",1,1,

We always sit at the bar where the service is excellent. The cheese specialist always explains to us about the cheese and what it goes well with. Even if it's an unusual side like pickled onions it's always on point. We usually do the 4 cheese and 1 meat where the cheese specialist will pick whichever he thinks would like best. We just tell him no blue cheese plllllease. It's always a pleasant surprise. Definitely recommend.

Our waiter took forever on everything from asking our drink orders, taking our orders, and bringing out our orders. Not to mentioned, when 45 minutes had passed and out entrees still weren't served, we asked him what the status of our food was and his response was an irritated ""it's coming"" excuse me?? Incredibly rude!!! Not of fan of him at that point. Refilling the water and out wine was a chore to him and when we didn't want dessert we got another look! What a jerk!

174,Andre N.,"Long Beach, CA",681,24,49,5.0,10/8/2016,"This place definitely changed the way that I look at cheese.Started out with the Brussel sprouts that had pomegranate molasses and they were great. Honestly, you can never go wrong with brussel sprouts! We then had a cheese tasting board that came with bread and crackers. There were probably 5 different types of cheese and each cheese was paired with a condiment! The pairings were amazing and each cheese (can't recall the names of all of them) were perhaps the best cheeses I've ever tried! My favorite cheese on the board was the blue cheese (which I usually don't like) with a little bit of honey. I started eating the Brussel sprouts and blue cheese together! I'm normally not one to order cheese boards at restaurants but was with my GFs family and they ordered it and I'm so happy I was able to try it. For my main, I got a burger with goat gouda. The burger was cooked perfectly and came with perfectly crisped fries. What I enjoyed even more than the burger was the spicy sweet pickle that came with it! My gf got grilled cheese and tomato - whatever cheese they put in it is great. Definitely up there with one of best grilled cheeses I've had. For dessert we shared almond cake and an apple crisp. The apple crisp was spicy which was cool and the almond cake was served with a really good/light cream. Only complaint is that I wish this place was in philly as well!",,,

The volume was at a club level, plus the place doesn't look or feel like bar otherwise.  The staff did turn down the volume a bit but it was still loud.  (I like music more than most but not blasting over a meal.). When we ordered a cheese plate as an appetizer and the cheese expert came to tell us about each but we couldn't hear him.  We spent the whole meal saying ""what?""  We also checked out other tables but it wasn't any better at others.My parents both ordered the mussels but the waitress came back to say they were out of them.  They ordered something else but then the mussels showed up, which they were happy about but we were confused.  My wife's and my meal showed up more than five minutes later, she with the classic mac & cheese and me with the sliders.  Clearly there are communication and coordination issues going on.None of us thought our meals were very good.  Not bad but not good either.My wife enjoyed her artichoke appetizer and the rest of us enjoyed the cheese plate.If I ever come back, it would be just to have a drink and some cheese but honestly, I doubt I'd even do that as it's also bit overpriced for what it is.  (For example, $9 for a craft draft beer.) I'm happy to pay for a good meal but this wasn't one.",1,,

We started off with buffalo cheese curds - these are fantastic. I could have ate them all by myself.Then we moved on to a meats and cheese platter - it came with some bread & crackers and we chose 2 meats and 3 cheeses. There was only one cheese that I wasn't too fond of because it was a little too funky for my taste, but loved everything else they selected for us. For dinner I ordered Murrays Melt which is a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato soup - one of the best grilled cheeses I've had in my life. My boyfriend got pulled pork mac & cheese - which I believe was a special, if they have this when you go there get this. Long story short. I will be back.",,,

Otherwise the restaurant was packed and they said they had no tables left for the rest of the night. We were immediately greeted by our waiter and ordered some wine. The menu was a bit more intimidating because of all the cheesy goodness options. Our waiter brought us our drinks and asked if we could have a few more minutes. I think then he felt awkward and didn't come back for another 10 minutes. We ended up deciding to get the burrata and the brussels sprout salad as appetizers and finish off with some fondue. We were hoping everything wouldn't come out at once, but unfortunately it did, and our little bar area quickly got super crowded. The burrata was creamy and delicious, but they served it with burnt, bitter bread. The salad shockingly was my favorite part. It was shredded brussels sprouts, kale, apples, cheese, and spicy pecans. I wished there were more pecans but I devoured the whole salad!We had to sit and wait to have the fondue because there was too much food in front of us at once, but once we got to it, it was decent. The bread was stale but the cheesey fondue was perfect. Overall, I want to come back because I've been told the customized cheese plates are awesome and they cater to your specific likes. But it is a little overpriced and service could have been a tad better.",3,,1
181,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,3/29/2015,"It is worth more than five star as I have learned much more than summing up my past year experience on cheese. At first, I thought cheese should be consumed on a standalone basis, or at most pair itself up with bread. However today after I started to explore the feeling of cheese together with bubbling wine, I knew I was wrong at the beginning. With the shadow of either apple or woozy aroma from the bubble, cheese can present its texture more sound and complete. Personally my favorite was blue cheese adding honey with dessert wine, yet I'm also a fan of sweaty cheese or cheddar.One and a half hour was simply too short for people like me to understand cheese culture, nevertheless it was absolutely a good start of exploration. The class is offered on a regular basis with its price ranging from 75 to 80-ish.",,,
182,Alexa O.,"New York, NY",474,75,21,5.0,11/4/2015,"Went twice in a one week period with all the great choices in NYC to choose from if that tells you anything.Delicious cheeses, burgers, vegetable dishes. I've had very good service both times. The cheesemongers were extremely helpful in picking out cheeses. I wish cheese wasn't so bad for you or I'd eat here every night. Definitely looking forward to my next visit. I would recommend the French onion soup. It's the best I've ever had. I would sing to it.",2,1,2
183,L P.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,67,0,3.0,4/19/2018,"We came here for brunch on a Saturday. I am a fan of Murray's cheese and have had their sandwiches so was looking forward to the restaurant. Unfortunately it did not quite live up to expectations.First, within about 3 minutes of us sitting down, our server came over and asked if we were ready to order. We said that we just said down and needed some more time but could order our drinks. He took our drink order and then came back about two minutes later and asked again if we were ready to order and then seemed annoyed when we said we needed a few more minutes to decide. (It was not even busy at the restaurant). When we were ready to order a few minutes later- no server was in sight. We tried repeatedly to get someones attention from behind the bar but no one looked up. Finally had to get up and go to the bar and get someone. The confusing part is that you cannot tell who works there from customers.Our food came and I ordered the farmers breakfast and the biscuit sides. The breakfast was one fried egg, 3/4 of a plate of salad, two cheese wedges and toast. ONE small egg. The toast was not toast- it was basically really hard and weirdly chewy sour dough bread.  There were also a few pieces of salami that were so hard you cannot chew with your teeth and I even tried to cut them with a knife and fork and just gave up. The biscuits did not come till the end of the meal and were dry as if they had been over cooked. When we asked a server (again had to get up and find someone), if the biscuits were coming, he told us they would be ready when they were ready. Disappointed give how great the cheese shop is but clearly does not translate into the restaurant or how the restaurant is managed.",,,
184,Emile G.,"New York, NY",334,91,169,4.0,4/22/2016,"​Murray's is a dimly lit cheese bar with great meats and cheeses.  In addition, they recommend beer and wine to pair with each item, which was a great touch.  Best to come with a big group so you can order a lot of food and eat family style.The buffalo cheese curds are absolutely incredible and a must-order.We also got a 3 meat, 3 cheese combo of the chefs choice.  The duck salami was very good.  It was oily (in a good way) w/ nice spice.  The prosciutto was delicious.  La Tur was amazing, and was my favorite cheese they brought.  It was creamy and buttery, paired with an almond honey that complimented it well.I will definitely be back, and cannot wait to get more of those buffalo cheese curds and La Tur in my mouth!",,,
185,Julie W.,"New York, NY",282,173,208,4.0,11/5/2014,"Came here for dinner NYC summer RW. Personally, I would recommend coming here for lunch or just regularly - not sure if the price fix dinner was that much different from what's normally offered. Do try: Cheese monger's choice. Trust that they know their cheese because they do, esp if you're a cheese noob like myself. We were surprised to have loved everything we tried because some of them sounded questionable. Pesto Mac and cheese is delicious. In fact you probably can't go wrong with any cheese dish. Also really great service, decor and feel! Nice casual/fun date place",2,,
186,Joe C.,"Greenville, RI",2085,877,141,5.0,9/30/2015,"Cool ConceptI love Murray's and I am not afraid to say it.  I live in Rhode Island and I want this place in our state.  Let me explain.This is a cheese bar that does cheese tasting parties with products from around the world.  Now you can just go in and get a sampler tray and sit and eat cheese and talk and relax.  Or you can order wonderful cheese based sandwiches on multiple options of breads in the middle of the store for around 5 or 6 bucks.  Honestly what is better than fine cheeses and breads to snack on.  They also serve beer and wine to go with it.  They have a great selection of craft beers and of course great wines to go with the crazy cheeses.  The last option is a cheese tasting party, where you can have 10-15 friends experience this together.  They also give you a history lesson on the origin of the cheeses that are selected for the gathering.  Just an awesome place, I cannot wait to go back.  Thanks",4,1,3

188,Christina L.,"New York, NY",302,173,213,3.0,10/28/2016,"My friend and I came to eat dinner after working out. We ordered the seasonal mac & cheese (with burrata), buffalo cheese curds, and cheese plate. It took 45 minutes for our first plate to come out which is ridiculous. The waitress could tell we were hangry, so she apologized and said she was going to fire up the mac and cheese now... but why did she wait 45 minutes to put it in?! Ok, getting over it. She threw in an extra artichoke dish, so we were happy. It was actually the best dish we got. I don't recommend the mac & cheese or buffalo cheese curds. The cheese plate, which came at the very end of our meal, was fantastic. The cheese expert came to describe all the cheeses and sides it came with. I really enjoyed the experience. I would go back for cheese plate and wine, but nothing else was really appealing to me. Don't go here in an empty stomach because it might get 'busy' and you might have to wait a long time to get a piece of cheese.",2,,1
189,Dave K.,"Silicon Valley, CA",126,515,76,4.0,3/5/2016,"Fun place, great cheese, and meats, friendly service.  Only downer is they pack it very tight when it's crowded so it can get a bit uncomfortable and noisy -- even for NYC.Definitely have a cheese and meat selection to start.  The Mac and Cheese was great.  Though the Melt (grilled cheese) with bacon was even better.  Killer mimosas to boot (blood orange).",,,

193,Member B.,"New York, NY",1,88,21,4.0,2/12/2018,"Wow I practically ordered the whole menu and I don't regret it. It was o delicious and they utilize the cheeses to every degree. The mac and cheese was almost perfect but mine just happened to be too peppery for my taste. It was still up there though. I appreciate the quality of cheese served. The sliders were delicious as well as artichoke cheese dip. We also tried the cheesecake which is highly recommended. This place is definitely a must for cheese lovers. Service was also amazing, surprising for the city. Can't wait to go back!",,,

Updated review","Another 5 star review is in order! Came to Murray's for cider week and was yet again blown away. We did the cider flight/prix fixe lunch and it was ridiculously delicious. I wish I could bathe in all that cheese and cider. The spacing between meals was perfect, the wait staff knew every detail about all the cheeses (as always,) and I'm just so happy Murray's exists. If you haven't been yet, you've gotta go!",1,,
195,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",295,1309,45,4.0,9/20/2015,"Murray's Cheese Bar, the sit down alternative to the deli style Murray's Cheese Shop, has some great things going for it. It represents a curated experience to the depth of cheese that the real shop provides and a good intro for those whose knowledge of cheese extends only to cheddar and velveeta. The menu is not really split along traditional lines (starters and mains) but is more of a huge spread of shareable bite size dishes and deli boards of curated cheeses and meats. The drinks list is intimidatingly pricey, but still on the right side of accessible and interesting (for example, they have cider from Normandy that's really nice, though not as funky as the stuff you'll find from Brittany.)Basically, don't come here if you're starving, but instead want a great taste experience and want to learn something.It's sort of a .... cheezakaya.I'll show myself out now.",1,3,2
196,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,4.0,10/22/2015,"Murray's is a classic and one of my favorite places to take visitors. You can come for brunch or dinner and can't go wrong. It's a great ambiance, great food, the people who work here know their cheeses.Favorite dishes:- buffalo cheese curds: I did not understand what cheese curds were until I tried these. Please note, these are non-squeaky. The spicy buffalo sauce makes these the must get appetizer every time I come here.- grilled cheese with tomato soup: cannot go wrong with a classic, and the Murray's one obviously does not fail to impress.- mac & cheese: love all the different seasonal mac & cheese's here. the cheese to mac ratio is always perfect, as is the sauce.- brunch! this is such a laid back spot for brunch. eggs are always cooked well and you can get your table a cheese plate appetizer.Murray's is worth the hype and will always be a classic!",1,1,1
197,Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1615,1444,4566,3.0,11/13/2014,"Probably the 2nd time in my life I went to a restaurant completely dedicated to cheese. This had more variety than the cheese fondue place in Paris. Their speciality here seems to be Mac and cheese so I opted for that and shared it with my friend. We had the pulled pork Mac and cheese, not too shabby but I've had better mac and cheese elsewhere. It's served on a pot pie like platter, there's not much pork and the macaroni didn't seem chewy enough. Cheese was good though. Overall I think the concept is cool, I'll give it that and I like the set up of their restaurant",1,,
