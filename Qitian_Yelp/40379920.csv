0,Mimi T.,"Tokyo, Japan",321,187,36,3.0,6/18/2018,"Yes the prices are a bit high, but I tried their 3 salad plate (the egg salad is amazing) and their classic ham and cheese sandwich and it was delicious. I would, if my wallet permits, go back there again. I mean yes, $28 for a ham and cheese sandwich is pretty insane, but if you want to splurge on a sandwich on Madison while you're shopping, I think it's worth it. The service was pretty good, a little slow, but not agonizingly so. You get a bread basket, with all types of bread. I love the brioche/challah and the nut and fruit bread slices are so chewy and delicious! I've been here before in the past, and only have fond memories. If you aren't comfortable with the prices, then don't come.",2,,
1,Kelley L.,"Greenville, SC",100,40,50,2.0,7/29/2018,"There should be someone standing outside to shake you down for all the cash you have on your person before you walk through the door. Or run a credit check. A woman in front of me walked out the door when the total for her and her daughter's two sandwiches and one side (to-go!) was $49. My friend and his fiancé's order was $38 for one sandwich, a bottle of water and a small side of cucumber salad. I am willing to pay above average prices, but the quality better match. It's simply average deli fare at way above average prices. The cheapest sandwich here is about 12 bucks. And it's tiny. My friends shared a chicken salad sandwich that they described as ""Meh."" My son said his Matzoh Ball Soup was ""average, and not authentic"" and my Mozzarella and Tomato Sandwich was rendered almost inedible by the too tough to chew bread.  For your viewing pleasure I photographed the quarter-sized ""Mini"" Brownies for $2 and the miniature Black and White Cookies for $3. Do yourself a favor and keep walking, there are plenty of other options in the area with less-hype, more flavor and just your average ""crazy"" Manhattan prices.",3,,
2,Jennifer F.,"Astoria, NY",26,111,3,2.0,7/12/2018,"It's fine. We were starving, pressed for time, and standing in front of it. The food was good. But the prices are 2x what they should be. It's a diner. I only tried egg salad sandwich $16 (yum) and ratatouille omelette $24 (surprisingly good). The waiter refilled my water glass after it sat empty for most of my meal (you ain't paying 2x bc the service is amazing - it's not) Go elsewhere. Unless you're staring, pressed for time, and standing in front of it",1,,

The quiche portion was so small...It was embarrassing. The worst is that it made him sick all afternoon. My mom ordered the macaroni and cheese...a joke, $24 and again served as buffet style and very greasy. I ordered the eggs with LOX $24...it was disgusting and so poorly presented. This place is nothing more than a diner and you get no more than a diner service but their prices are like at a very nice restaurant...and their portions so small it's purely stealing customers especially when you think of what it cost to cook pasta and cheese... I told the waitress what I thought about the whole lunch and she admitted not understanding why people were coming to this place!",,,

You know it's good when there is a constant flow of traffic inside the very small shop aisle. There is a self-serve baked goods pantry, loads of freshly made gourmet foods and packaged goods as well, there is a dining area, great coffee, the bustling of hungry New Yorkers. This place has practically taken over the upper east side. I can't wait to try everything.",,,

7,erika p.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,5,0,5.0,10/11/2018,"This place is amazing. The scrambled eggs are fluffy perfection, the coffee is hot and strong, and the setting is great. I've eaten here a couple of times over the years and think of it as an institution. The best part is the way they slice the bagels twice - so you get a really thin middle slice, which is perfect for devouring even more of the whipped cream cheese. Yes it's expensive, but it's the UES. Treat yourself!",,,
8,Sara P.,"Manhattan, NY",426,79,233,2.0,1/14/2018,"Cute sit-down cafe that has an attached pre-made food section with grab and go sandwiches, pastries, salads, and drinks. The sit-down section is very crowded, especially towards the front of the cafe. I cant comment on the food, but I got a hot chocolate, green tea, and bagel. The hot coco was delicious, the bagel was toasted just the way I like it, but the green tea tasted like fish so it was super gross. The severs were fast and attentive but every-time they brought something to the table next to us, they literally had to lean over me. Super annoying and intrusive. Not sure if I will come back",2,,2

11,Jim G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/11/2018,"My friend and I needed a place to sit down for approximately nine seconds, which is about how long it took to open the menu and observe delusions of grandeur in the form of diner food prices. This place really did the trick! Noting the $6.50 price for a cup of coffee and the $25 sandwiches, we knew the next step was to evacuate hastily. As we shuffled past the host who had seated us seconds before, I considered concocting an excuse for our premature departure, such as ""We were supposed to meet our affluent friends at the other diner"" or ""We're both about to vomit."" But then it occurred to me that this probably happens all the time, and after reading the rest of these reviews, now I know it does.",1,1,1

We waited and it was ok but the thick bread was sort of uncooked mushy inside. Bacon, Egg , Cheese sandwich was very good as was the Quiche. It was pricy but convenient location and nice wait staff. They seem to be doing ok even with the problems and you can get a beer or glass of wine with breakfast. We did. It's good to be on vacation.",,,
15,Michael B.,"Chicago, IL",212,602,2848,3.0,7/10/2017,"If the zip code 10128 were a country, it would probably be one of the ten richest countries on the planet. Thus it should come as no surprise to anyone that one should expect to pay royalty prices when dining in the heart of the upper East side.  So paying $14 for a bowl of soup, which was good but not hot, large or anything special, while not surprising, was still hard to swallow. (No pun intended). The sandwiches were in the $26 range. I guess for those in the neighborhood with 7, 8 and 9 figure incomes it doesn't really matter what a bowl of soup cost but for the rest of you, know what you're getting into before you enter.",8,2,3
16,Resa C.,"Old Lyme, CT",6,160,393,3.0,1/12/2018,"E.A.T. is befuddling to me. Everything looks yummy in the deli counter- salad , breads, meats etc.  You walk in and you are seated very quickly. Immediately the staff gives you a menu and a water and asks what you would like to drink. You look over the long menu of deli salads- omelettes- some hot foods- sandwiches etc.  I ordered a salad plate that you choose two items. I got the tarragon chicken salad and the artichokes Roman style. This comes with the bread basket which ended up being the best part of my lunch along with my earl grey tea.     First of all- chicken salad was almost flavorless. Lots of mayo- no salt- no onion and very little tarragon flavor. The artichokes were fried and cold. I've been to Rome. They had fried artichokes and artichokes Roman style.  Roman style in Rome is sautéed in a little white wine and olive oil. Not fried and never are fried artichokes served cold in Rome!The bread basket star was the raisin bread- delicious with yummy soft butter. Waitstaff is quick to refill your water and check on you. Food was lack luster.  Prices are outrageous! My salad plate was $24 and tea was $6....CRAZY because it wasn't even a generous portion. I did buy a loaf of sourdough to bring Home to my son- he ate the whole thing.Don't think I'm rushing back to E.A.T.",3,1,
17,Hedge M.,"Newport Beach, CA",343,63,14,5.0,4/5/2018,"Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on a brioche roll.  DELICIOUS.   Almost as good as when I make them at home.  Generous portions of egg, bacon and cheese. The eggs were like a fluffy pillow of egg heaven. The price $10 before tax. Any NY'er would get slapped for paying that much for a bacon, egg & cheese..but every informed NY'er knows that anything coming from Madison is going to cost you a pretty penny- especially food and it's quality may be questionable.  In this case food is excellent, price not so much. Updated Review 04/06/18**I'm updating this review..as I just devoured another one of these sandwiches. Yes, I was willing to pay triple of what I would at my usual greasy spoon.  Was it amazing?...yes..was it delicious?..yes...here's my take and why I'm adding another star to my review...Don't be cheap with your food or your healthcare, save that for your shoes in case you step in dog poo.",,,1
18,Jessica A.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,3,0,1.0,12/11/2017,"So we needed to eat lunch before going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and we found this place. The prices are INSANE!! My mother-in-law wanted a salad with some protein so she got mixed greens, cole slaw and cucumber salad (maybe 50 cents worth of stuff) and it was $29!!! She also asked for 2 slices of smoked salmon to put on it & that was an additional $20!!! I got a bowl of matzoh ball soup, which was $24 & it was 2 tiny matzoh balls, some clear broth, a few carrot pieces, a few celery pieces and some shreds of chicken. It was in a shallow saucer type ""bowl""; it was like 3 bites!!!Let's not even get started with my husband's turkey club for $26, that was on the small side & average at best!! We were SHOCKED when the bill came still are recovering from what a negative experience the whole thing was!! Next time, we'll just eat at the museum!!!",6,,
19,Nick P.,"Norwalk, CT",0,24,0,4.0,6/23/2018,EAT is not for the faint of wallet. But the fruit plate was beautifully served and each piece was at peak flavor. And they had almond and soy milk for the cappuccino.,2,,

21,Rob L.,"Richmond, Canada",0,6,0,1.0,9/4/2018,"Avoid this place at all costs! This place totally caters to the super well-off Upper East Side residents with money to burn or to one-off tourists like us.  Our group of 6 were dropped off from our driver tour guide to try this place before going to the MET. This place looks very authentic, with a large deli display. The large seating area is well staffed and clean. But looking at the menu, we realised the prices are off the chart! Since we were pressed for time we decided to eat here regardless of the expensive prices.  Big mistake, the sandwiches are average size with a small dollop of potato salad for minimum $24, and the soups were small bowl for $14.  They advertise fresh ingredients and great tastes, but in reality it tastes just average.  We bought 2 sandwiches and 2 soups to share, altogether with tax and tip it came to around $100 for lunch!  I know some people say this is just NYC prices, but we tried a lot of dining choices during our trip and no restaurant compared to E.A.T in receiving so little after paying so much.  We live in Vancouver, Canada and are blessed with a huge variety of dining choices, when I mention this restaurant experience to all our travelling friends who are also foodies, they all laugh.  I cannot believe the locals actually sustain this restaurant, if we had this restaurant it would be out of business in a year. Do not be in on the joke and go to this restaurant.  I guarantee if you do, you will absolutely feel being ripped off.",1,,

The restaurant is almost always dirty. There was a cockroach the size of a pony on the floor of the dining room the last time I had dinner. The manager stepped on it and had a busboy bring out a huge dirty mop and bucket full of dirty water that reeked of pine cleaner to mop the floor up in the middle of dinner! And of course it's all at astronomical prices. Literally fine dining restaurant prices- tho it may as well be a dirty old diner in the middle of the Port Authority in terms of service and atmosphere.So be advised....,5,,
40,Rose P.,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",313,180,176,1.0,10/22/2016,"We went to this location because it appeared as 'Zabars' on Google Maps.  Strange, we thought, as it wasn't supposed to be on this side of the park.  When we arrived, we saw it was a very small location, not at all like the regular Zabars.For $20 I got a mediocre cup of coffee, two rolls, and a loaf of gluten-free bread.  The rolls were incredibly stale, and the gluten-free bread was also stale and had a terrible taste to boot.  All of it was thrown away except for the coffee, which was good in comparison.  Unfortunately, since we did not eat it until we got home, there was no way to tell them about it.  So I wrote in to their customer support line.  They asked which Zabars I usually go to.  When I told them, they blamed it on the fact that I usually go to the regular Zabars, and said they weren't affiliated with regular Zabars.  I was not offered any form of refund or gift card. This is one of the dumbest replies I've ever received, for a few reasons:1. It suggests I don't know what stale bread is like.  I do.  Like most people on this planet, I knew what stale bread was before I ever went to a Zabars.2. It suggests that regular Zabars is good, and since we're not the same company, we can't be expected to be good like them.3. It offers no explanation or apology for the terrible product I paid for.  When you pay $9 for a loaf of bread, it shouldn't go straight in the garbage. When you use the name 'Zabars', its because you want to be affiliated with the original business.  So you can't use that as an excuse for why your food is bad.  The service inside the store was excellent, with courteous and attentive employees.  It's a shame that the person who answers their emails is less interested. What a bizarre excuse.  I would have been willing to try again next time I went to the Met, had they offered me a gift card.",3,1,

We were really disappointed by the food. The broccoli was under-cooked, the salmon salad over-mayonnaised, tomato & mozzarella salad mushy, the chicken and fish dishes underwhelming. The best parts of the meal were the matzo ball soup (naturally) and the giant basket of fresh bread they put on the table. The raisin pecan bread is particularly awesome.

They pull you in with the spiral stairs and huge array of sandwiches, soups and food bar. Took about 25 minutes for the food to finally arrive which is just unacceptable for a place of this small size. When we asked for coke, they gave us a weird ""cola-like"" soda which tasted terrible.

The bread, butter and jam basket comes with an entire jar of jam imported from France that you could eat a bucket of (go for apricot!) The Tower of Bagel, at nearly $30, is a bagel stack wih cream cheese and smoked salmon that is just terrific. There's a wide array of items to go, from deli salads and sandwiches to nuts, cookies, and more. While we were there a customer was telling a harrowing story about a catering order and the person she was talking to didn't seem terribly impressed.

When the clerk rang it up and told me ""$10.83 please,"" I was quite shocked at the price tag, but then I thought, maybe it is really good soup. So needless to say, it's going to take a lot for you to live up to $10 for a bowl of soup, but this bowl of mushroom barley doesn't even live up to a $2 bowl. It was bland, and very oily.

I usually buy a sandwich or some hot items (e.g. salmon) from the deli area - they can toast the sandwiches and heat up the deli items.  The salmon was delicious and soft and not dry, even though it was reheated.  The last time I was there I had a tomato mozzarella sandwich on a baguette - awesome!  I have also tried the egg sandwich on brioche which they advertise and it is quite good. Not very healthy, but yummy!They have great coffee and it's great to also have the option of wine by the glass.  Regarding prices, yes, it's not cheap.  Critics can call it very expensive deli food, but it's new york and they are providing comfortable seating.

I wish words existed to adequately describe that experience.

So let me divide into two parts: 1) FOOD: The food is sublime. This is owned by Zabar's, as it says on the front window under the logo, and as such it's absolutely phenomenal, like Dean and Deluca. Hands down THE best grilled/roasted/marinated veggies of my life: eggplant, onions, peppers, squash. Wow. Just wow Caprese very good but not the best of my life. In any case, I prefer buratta to mozzarella and the tomatoes were just so so. For that price, they should have been heirloom flown in from Florida or wherever fancy New York restaurants and delis get their veggies in the dead of winter. 2) SERVICE/VALUE/ATTITUDE: In a word, obnoxious. I had a big pancake lunch at Sarabeth's and walked  home over a period of hours. I just wanted a little something and thought I would bring some veggies or cheese home. When you order, you have to repeat self many times because the glass/plastic on the deli case is about 2 feet too high. The man working spoke no English and didn't understand I wanted to try the calamari. Also, he couldn't hear me very well due to this moronic design choice (I take it this is about hygiene but I'm 5/8; God forbid you're a short person in the 5 foot range, you'll have to scream to be heard). There is an older woman, 60ish, who supervises the guy working behind the counter. The tall black guy was great and funny: he works the cashier and he's very tall. So I might have had a shot with him. It took an awfully long time to order 2 half-pints of veggies and a caprese salad. There seemed to be a brouhaha with a woman who ordered something and then decided she didn't want it. All of this is just bizarre. I didn't pay attention as I knew it was overpriced but was shocked at the 21 dollar tab.The guy behind me had a Horizon milk, the kind kids like to get at Starbucks or Whole Foods. FOUR dollars! An older lady--70s--was cool (she didn't work there) and said when the blonde 40ish guy said the prices were like St Tropez, ""Yes, it's very expensive here."" Expensive is fine. Obnoxiously expensive with poor service is not fine. The only affordable thing? Sandwiches. They all--12 or so--looked terrific and at 10 bucks that's not offensive to me. But the prices --and I got vegetables for God's sake not lobster or shrimp or crab which must be triple--are staggering.  I'd rather splurge at Dean and Deluca.",3,1,

I tried to join them and was stopped by a very rude manager, who refused to let me sit in the cafe with my friends (who were about to purchase food) because I had just bought the blondie and was bringing it into their restsraunt.

And my cucumber and chevre sandwich had only ~8 very thin, very tiny (think like a quarter) slices of cucumber on it. Strangely, though, my friend's egg salad sandwich was HUGE. We could have split just that and been better fed. Maybe we're supposed to be there for ambiance... but the tables are so close to each other that it's distracting! You feel like you are accidentally looking at other people, they're looking at you, they're eyeing your food, you are eyeing theirs. Ugh.

You read cook books; and only cook with pans that make weight lifting a superfluous after thought. With all that attention to detail, you start to notice that making the perfect French toast now requires an $80 bottle of vanilla and a hard to come by rum ... The cream has to be picked up at the farmer's market before 8 am on Sunday, otherwise they might sell out (even though you've adopted the cow). If this sounds like you, Eli Zabar's delis will feel like a steel that rescues you from your kitchen woes. There's no need to worry. They make some of the best French toast in town.

Every reviewer who said the prices are high are absolutely right. My bowl of matzoh ball was $10, the sandwich I ordered was $20, and my cup of tea was $4.50. The quality of food is what you would expect from a Zabar's establishment. I enjoyed everything I ordered, especially, the matzoh ball soup. The wait staff was attentive, but unfortunately, they had a horrible memory and they don't write anything down. My sandwich came and it had mayonaise on it, which I specifically asked for none of and mustard, instead. It also had the wrong meat. So, I politely reminded him and it came back with the same meat but no mayonaise OR mustard. At that point, I didn't bother to send it back again, but I was annoyed. The menu, itself, is not very helpful. They don't have descriptions of the items. For instance, they have ""Focaccia Sandwich"" listed. I inquired as to what it was, assuming it was a sandwich with focaccia, where you could pick the ingredients. Wrong. It had plenty of ingredients, but none were listed. The same for the ""Country Sandwich"". I asked the waiter what it is, and he said, ""it's ham or salami."" Okay....does it come with cheese? lettuce? tomato? onion? mustard? what kind of bread? It was like pulling teeth the get a description of menu items. My assumption is that the staff is either not very well trained on the menu, or that they assume since it's a neighborhood joint that everyone should know the menu. Overall, I can see myself returning here for a lazy breakfast/brunch or coffee and dessert. Even with the laughably outrageous prices, it's the kind of place that is quiet, easy to get into, and great for people watching.

Secondly, I am a student. Thirdly, MACARONS.I was looking at the prepared sandwiches in both awe and disgust because not one sandwich was under $8 (some were 12!), and not one sandwich was simple. Like, damn, all I want is some ham and cheese!I settled on a ~~baked prosciutto sandwich (and I don't even remember the rest of the contents). I was determined it would fail to pleaseHowever I was wrong! I liked the sandwich, though really, I could have some regular ass ham. For dessert, I got a caramel macaron (let me just state here that I love the fact that they have so many flavor options). It was my first macaron ever, and I wasn't expecting much.But omg.O.M.G.SO GOOD.Disgustingly sweet, yes, but SO GOOD.I actually went back and bought two more. Raspberry and pistachio.

164,Elle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",346,869,24,4.0,1/20/2010,"***********TUSCAN PEASANT SOUP*******************Five unbelievable stars for the soup!!!!! BEST SOUP IN THE WORLD. IT TRULY IS THE BEST THING I EVER ATE.Oh, yeah, I watched Food Network's ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" and I had to come here after Ina Garten described the grilled cheese. She said it was a must to have the grilled cheese with the Tuscan Peasant Soup, and who am I to not listen to the great Barefoot Contessa? Clearly I went to a different restaurant than many of the Yelpers here. I have no idea what they're talking about. First of all, I thought the portion was huge. The grilled cheese sandwich was two big portions (a single portion was the size of a regular sandwich) and a salad. Very good grilled cheese as Ina G. had promised, but it didn't make me sing.The Tuscan Peasant Soup, however, did make me sing and shout for joy! The freshly grated pepper and fresh herbs  (rosemary and basil) perfectly complemented this chunky, yet melt in your mouth smooth, tomato soup delicately flavored with what I think is sausage and cheese (parmigiano-reggiano or romano). They put in cubes of stale bread. The bread just soaks up the flavors of the soup and melts into the soup, so it provides the soup with a nice mouthfeel and texture, but you don't realize it's bread unless you're looking at it very carefully trying to figure out what it is. It soaked up so much of the soup that at first, I thought it was a chunky tomato.The grilled cheese, yes, good, but I can definitely make it at home. The TUSCAN PEASANT SOUP most awesome thing EVER. I want this at home every day for the rest of my life. Next time I'm coming here, I'm just getting the soup. No need for anything else. The awesomeness of this soup just cannot be described. It's not soup. It's not food. It's heaven in a bowl. Every drop is a blessing saying that life is truly good and wonderful.Yes, E.A.T. is expensive, but I found the portions generous (I could only eat a little more than half of the grilled cheese), the quality of the food is top notch, and the service impeccable. No sooner I put down some teeny tiny trash (like a used sugar packet), then it was whisked away. And the place was crowded too, so it wasn't like the waiter didn't have a million other people to take care of. So, yeah, just have the Tuscan Peasant Soup and you'll be happy about eating at E.A.T.I also bought a slice of the apple crumble cake ($3). Not bad. Not overly sweet, which I liked. Perfect for a Sunday brunch.",4,2,2

Okay, I know.  I should've ordered the grilled cheese, but since my friend and I were sharing and she didn't want the grilled cheese, we just ate the chicken salad.As for the soup: it was delicious. Although it's like a tomato soup, the flavor is very light and not at all too-hearty. The bread pieces that are soaked in the soup are so delicious. Overall, the soup is really good.As for the chicken salad sandwich, it was okay. I would've hoped it had a more complex flavor, but all I could taste was a sweet chicken in a mayo-type sauce. I wish there were more things in the chicken salad (i.e. pears, green apples, currants, etc). Overall, it was okay. But the bread that it came in was delicious. It was this multi-oat-grain bread with pieces of walnuts in it. It was delicious.This place was good, but I wish it wasn't so expensive. My friend and I each paid $17 including tip for our shared meal. It wasn't worth the money, even though the soup was good.

BIG MISTAKE. i finally decided to leave the met because i was getting delirious from the hunger. Maybe i made the wrong turn, but the only restaurant i saw was E.A.T. I was waaaay too hungry to be picky so i just walked in despite reading some iffy reviews on this place on Yelp already... I guess the decorations were sorta ok.. but you definitely do not expect the prices of the dishes to be as expensive as they are given the vibe of the place. The ONLY good thing was the bread. Or maybe i was just too hungry. Got the Free Range Chicken. UGH. No flavor whatsoever. Had to add salt on the entire thing. The chicken was dry and tough. Wanted to get ranch dressing to make it a little easier to swallow - ""Sorry, but we don't carry ranch dressing here."" WHATTT??? Don't they have SALADS??? I can't have RANCH dressing even if i ordered a salad from that place?! The sides were blah also. How can you mess up the veggies on the side?!
