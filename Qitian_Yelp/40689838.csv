1,Chris S.,"Arlington, VA",262,696,403,4.0,7/28/2016,Crowded but service is friendly. A surprisingly good selection of cigars at good prices. It is best if you already know what you want. The staff I talked was not very knowledgeable about cigars.,1,,
2,Kaitlin W.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",18,1,0,4.0,10/31/2016,Came here to get new vape and salesperson was very helpful and informative. When vape starting acting up constantly and I returned he let me exchange for brand new one. Every time I come in he lets me try multiple different flavor juices and is very nice and let's me take my time!,1,,1
3,Allan H.,"Stockton, CA",112,8,3,5.0,7/31/2015,Lost my Vape traveling to NYC. They were open late which was perfect. Good Vape shop. Aspire tanks and lots juices.,1,,
4,Ben J.,"Natick, MA",208,67,3,4.0,7/31/2015,"Forgot my vape pen charger, and being new to vaping, I knew none of the terminology.  These staff here was able to figure out my awkward descriptions and get me the charger I needed for under $10.Tiny and cramped place, but lots there for the space they have.",,1,1
5,Swet T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,24,0,4.0,8/25/2016,Great deals for the city. Customer service is decent for a smoke shop. Not rude but not helpful. You tell them what you want and they ring you up.,,,
6,Samantha B.,"New York, NY",15,45,0,4.0,8/9/2016,"Pretty solid smoke/vape shop. I vape a lot so i like to try new flavors and sometime need to replace my hardware. the service here is decent, but sometimes they are really busy and don't have time to let me try a lot of flavors. but they are nice and the prices are reasonable",,,
7,Kat S.,"Elizabeth, NJ",32,46,2,4.0,12/26/2015,"I stopped in here to get wraps but when they told me they were $3 each, I started to leave till I inquired about a vape pen.  I decided to take the $30 one just to try it out. Couldn't get it to work, no matter what I or a friend tried to do.  I returned and they said no returns.  I was angry.  They told me to contact the manufacturer.  I started to leave and then told them I would post review on Yelp.  He asked me to see the pen.  He cleaned it out and used tobacco (and his own tip).  It worked.  The place is very cramped but they have a lot of great stuff in there.  Even the the pen is half the cost online, I am satisfied with it.",,,
8,L M.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,2,4.0,6/10/2016,"They have a friendly staff and were very helpful with what i needed, their prices are good and the product itself was adequate, satisfied with my purchase and the in store experience, coming back for sure.",1,,
9,Paul D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,5.0,6/6/2015,Descent prices for time square. This is from a native new York that frequents the city often. Eleaf blew wanted to go to beyond vape but was working a block up from this place. Guy was very knowledgeable and willing to help got off the phone when i asked a questions. Selection of e juice pretty nice for a tobacco shop 15 2 for 25 ejuice .,,,

11,Renya P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,5.0,6/22/2015,"not sure why this place doesnt have better reviews! i stopped at 2 local smoke shops in my neighborhood on a saturday night at around midnight and both were already closed! although not as close to my home in UWS, this place is open 24 hours!, and has a very nice selection of hookahs, tobacco, pipes, grinders, glass, papers, coals, butane, cigs and most other items that you would go to a smoke shop for. also, the price for the hookah i purchased is below the standard amazon price. and the salespeople are very helpful as well, and know about each item they are selling, just have to ask. i was pleasantly surprised by this shop, and although yes its small, they will have what you need.",3,,
12,Chandler C.,"Nashville, TN",1,29,0,5.0,8/24/2016,"home to some of the fattest cloud rippers in NY, sometimes you just gotta bless up and rep the naysh",,3,
13,Lisa K.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",82,228,282,2.0,1/10/2010,"I came here to buy cigars for a Christmas present. Smoke scene had a wide variety of cigars, lighters, and, cigar case holders. It is slightly overwhelming. I did some research before going to this place, so I had an idea of what I wanted.The workers there are nice, but they aren't necessarily there to help you. They were constantly trying to sell me a more expensive cigar or a pricier item. I went in there to buy Ashton cigars and some lighter fluid and they kept persuading me to buy a different type that was ridiculously oversized for a casual cigar smoker and wayy too dark. I stood my ground and bought the kind that I originally went in to buy and don't let them fool you with the lighter fluid. They also claim to have a ""special lighter fluid"", but just buy the regular $2 one. I didn't want to fall into the trap because the one they tried to sell me was about $14. Good merchandise here, but the peeps who work here are a bit annoying.",1,1,
