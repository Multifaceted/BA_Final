0,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,5.0,10/5/2018,"I paid a visit here once evening because I was craving bubble tea for the longest time. I was originally planning to go to KFT across the street but after hearing that they were out of tapioca, I paid a visit here. I arrived 20 minutes prior to closing, so shout outs to CoCo for still having tapioca! I ordered a large jasmine milk tea with 30% sugar and ice with pudding and tapioca. Everything was prepared efficiently and the one girl who took my order and made my drink was extremely friendly. The store was empty aside from one other party when I came and was it kept clean. The tapioca was nice and soft and slightly sweetened, while the egg pudding was also delicious. The jasmine milk tea had a nice slight hint of jasmine to it, without being too overwhelming. Overall, I'd highly recommend CoCo whenever you're in the area and craving a bubble tea. I think this just be my new go-to spot over Kung Fu Tea now.",2,,

2,Joshua D.,"Liverpool, NY",323,399,1039,4.0,7/29/2018,"I have to give CoCo some credit.  In the city where bubble tea places are absolutely everywhere, they definitely stand out.  From really tasty flavors to having a really cute look,  they know how to keep you coming back for more.  They aren't my favor bubble tea place, but they are definitely ranked pretty high on the list.  The prices are about the same between them and all of the competition in the area as well. This location on St.Marks is extremely convenient due to the fact there are so many places there that have wait times.  I often get on the wait list at a nearby restaurant, then come here and relax with a drink until it gets time to go eat. As for flavors. You can get everything from your standard milk tea to all sorts of fruit teas as well. I do recommend coming here if your in the area.",3,,1
3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1550,2.0,7/11/2018,"Came here largely because Kung Fu and other drink spots on St. Mark's were super crowded on a hot Sunday afternoon.Although CoCo had a shorter line, it ended up taking about five minutes to order and another five to get my drink. They only had one person working both the cash register and the drink making-- what? She did a great job but they need more people staffed.Interior is your standard corporate fare, but unpleasantly, the climate control wasn't working properly and it was quite warm inside. I wouldn't want to hang around here.I had one of the cheaper drinks, which ended up being around $5 after tax and tip. Chocolate milk tea sounded appropriately indulgent, but I definitely shouldn't have skimped on the sugar-- at 50%, it was super bitter and artificial-tasting. What's worse was that the powder wasn't all mixed up, so I kept drinking clumps even after I tried to mix it around.Boba isn't my usual bag, but I've had enough in NYC and Houston that this stood out as a disappointment to me.",3,,1
4,Joy H.,"Toronto, Canada",14,92,298,5.0,4/30/2018,"CoCo has really consistent drinks, even across countries!We ordered a pearl milk tea and passionfruit tea with tapioca. Both drinks tasted like the same CoCo from back home in Toronto, which was nice. They are also generous with their tapioca!The staff there were also really nice, although soft spoken. The drinks were made pretty fast on the lazy Sunday afternoon we were there, there was only one other customer already inside when we arrived.CoCo is a really reliable franchise to get bubble tea. Their prices are pretty decent and their custard jelly option is pretty neat too.",,,

It was definitely fair price for what I got. Actually a bit cheaper than other bubble tea places like KFT I think.Experience: The service was super fast and the seating was plentiful. Probably got my drink in under 3 minutes. The bathroom was out of service though.Taste: The tea was mild and not too sweet. I got the warm tea by the tea was sitting out for a bit so it was just warm. It didn't bother me but know that your hot drink might not be piping hot.,1,,

The ones in China taste very fresh and has a lot of pudding and bubbles. Over here there's less. I order the 3 guys large and it was almost $7. It has bubbles, pudding and grass jelly. It was okay. Nothing compare to the one I had it China. The area was spacious but the back smells like cigarette smoke.",,,
7,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",485,3957,29995,3.0,7/23/2017,"CoCo started out in Dansui, and its menu offers milk teas, fresh milk, chocolate beverages, fresh fruit teas, tea lattes, yakult, tea machciator, and slush & smoothies.  The hubs and I stopped by to order some drinks - we tried the Fresh Lemonade and the Grapefruit Green Tea, both with no toppings/bubbles.  The Fresh Lemonade was pretty refreshing, as it had a nice tartness to it; the Grapefruit Green Tea, on the other hand, didn't taste good, as while it had bits of grapefruit flesh throughout, the combination with the green tea didn't work, making it more of bitter drink.There are only about 4 tables, and a waiting bench in front of the pick-up area.  For those who need to use the restroom, it's unisex and locked, and you need to get a key from one of the employees.This isn't a place to do any work, as the volume is extremely high.+Fresh Lemonade drinks+unisex restrooms - requires a key",4,2,4

There's more seating than I'd expect from a boba place and it isn't usually crowded- It isn't the best boba I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst eitherCons:- Like most boba place, this places uses artificial flavoring and depending on what kind of drink you get, it can be very noticeableSpecifics:- Grapefruit Green Tea = Very strong grapefruit flavor and not too sugary. Perfect for a hot summer day.- 2 Ladies = The milk was very creamy and the tea taste was distinct. Did not order this myself since my friend chose it but after trying it I would",1,,1

10,Young Y.,"Boston, MA",76,291,157,4.0,7/22/2018,I had their traditional milk tea and it was fine. If I am in the area I will get it again but I don't think I'd go out of my way to go to this place over others.,1,,
11,Catherina L.,"New York, NY",662,95,195,2.0,8/24/2017,"Do not get bubble tea here―there are plenty of other better shops literally a few doors down or across the street. I got the taro slush and it was so bad I didn't even bother taking a picture or finishing the drink (threw more than half of it away). You could tell from the first sip that the flavor was soo artificial and extremely sweet. The tapioca itself was also gritty and weirdly chewy. I can't really speak for other flavors, but do not under any circumstances get the taro slush.Besides that, the service was really nice and and inside is cute and clean. But the flavor of the bubble tea I got was so repulsive it didn't really matter. Sad to say I won't come back any time soon :/",,1,
12,Bunny M.,"Reno, NV",16,41,28,4.0,6/23/2017,"It wasn't too busy here on a Thursday night, so placing and getting my order in approx 5 minutes is a definite plus. I got a medium classic milk tea with reg sugar, less ice and enjoyed it. They're not stingy with the pearls and the beverage to pearls ratio balances out, yay!The pricing isn't too bad since they don't charge tax (or tax is already included, I can't tell), I only paid $3.75 for my drink. The only thing I found off was that the pearls were smaller than what I was used to and that there was no music playing. The place is clean and there's seating further in the back as well as a bathroom. I would come back here to try different flavors but it's pretty average IMO. It's got pretty hefty competition since three other boba places occupy the same block as CoCo.Tip: there's a minimum purchase of $5 (I think) to use a card.",1,1,3
13,Michael C.,"Orlando, FL",570,260,844,2.0,11/20/2017,"Don't get the boba here; it's a disappointment of Coco. Having spent a lot of time in Coco's birthplace of Taiwan I was super excited to see it back here in the States. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed by the level of Boba at this Coco. First of all Coco is supposed to be a place to get cheap but consistent boba. Price is average at around $5 for a regular sized drink. I ordered a warm san xiongi (three kingdoms - boba, grass jelly, egg pudding) and was really disappointed by how lukewarm the drink was. Nothing like the boba I had in Taiwan - it was especially chewy nor especially sweet. Finally the seated area was fairly dirty with napkins and drink straws on the floor. They really need to do a better job about keeping this place clean. Will not come again.",3,3,3

15,Danielle W.,"New York, NY",111,96,112,4.0,11/29/2016,"One of my go-to bubble tea shops in the East Village. I prefer it over some of the other bubble tea places nearby. It's open late, until 1 AM, on Fridays and Saturdays which is super convenient. There's also a few tables and seats inside towards the back. The service is very fast. They've always gotten my teas right, even when I mass order drinks for friends. They also take credit card (minimum of $5)! I really enjoy their Three Guys (milk tea with tapioca, grass jelly, and pudding) and Jasmine Milk Tea, which both come in cold and hot versions. My favorite topping is the lychee jelly!",1,1,

20,Kate S.,"New York, NY",76,679,3070,3.0,2/27/2017,"As far as bubble tea places go, this place was just okay. It's a bit more pricey for sure. My large passionfruit with bubbles was $5.50, and my friend's large passionfruit with bubbles and pudding was $6. Normally I can get a large for less than $5. And I'm glad I asked for only 50% sugar because otherwise it's deathly sweet. My friend tried the normal sugar one and she drank some of it and then asked for some water, but the person behind the counter wasn't very accommodating because he only filled the cup just a little bit.",1,,

The boba was a bit on the hard side, a bit harder than PaTea, and I tend to prefer my boba a bit on the softer side.

24,Han C.,"New York, NY",151,397,80,5.0,11/19/2016,"Coco is probably my favorite bubble tea chain in the city - the most consistent in quality and flavor. What I particularly love about the St. Mark's location is how hot they actually serve hot bubble tea here. Most places will give you a borderline lukewarm cup when you order hot bubble tea, but this location wants you to give you third-degree burns to suck up that juicy, soft little bubble, and I LOVE IT. Perfect for drinking bubble tea on a cold, wintry day. I always get classic bubble tea, and it's the best!",2,1,2

I always get pudding milk tea when I'm craving something more rich. The tea is not too sweet and the pudding is always the right texture. When I want something refreshing, I go for the mango yakult.

Sometimes the boba are undercooked, or there's too much ice, or they add too much sweetener. Luckily Coco's is a pretty solid boba spot. I stopped in with a friend after an evening of ramen and was pleasantly surprised by this boba haven hiding in the mess that is Astor Place. We both got the standard bubble tea and despite our order taking a little too long I was pleased with the experience. You could taste the flavor of the tea, they hadn't tried to hide it with milk and sugar. I think I'd have to try more of their offerings to really fall in love, but I definitely will be coming back.",2,,1

I really wanted bubble tea so I went to grab my wallet from the car. I came back (as I go through the door I hear her talk shit about me in Chinese), I ignored it and ordered the same thing and handed her a $50 (I only had $50s on me). She looks at me with disdain again and said we don't accept $50s and said ""there's a sign"". First of all what type of cheap business are you running in St. Marks Manhatten that you need $5 minimums on credit cards and don't accept bills over $20?? This is not flushing or Chinatown - this is St. Marks.  Second - I probably would have bought something else to meet the $5 minimum if it wasn't for the uber rude staff with an attitude - please learn some customer service!  I went to Kung Fu across the street and they happily accepted my $50 with no issues.

34,Adelina M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",390,303,676,5.0,12/17/2015,"OK let me put it out there, again. I love me some bubble tea. Double the bubble is the only way to go. I love cold iced tea with some tapioca pearls, some jelly, or some crema. Now, crema is this delish topping of just salted whipped milk or something like that. It is both sweet and salty at the same time and goes SO WELL with an iced glass of tea. It is my jam. I found out about this when I was recently in San Fran. Unfortunately, no where in the 'burgh has this tasty topping. I keep looking but have not found it at all.Imagine my surprise when I am in NYC and I see crema on the menu. I busted out with a loud, ""hell yes!!!"" surprising both the cashier and my friends and then proceeded with a little dance/song that I made up right on the spot. Yes, I was that excited.  And yes, I was that embarrassing. Granted this was the same day as the NYC Santa-Con so maybe I wasn't the most obnoxious person to come into their place of business. Or at least I hope....I ordered the salty cream black tea. Damn...it hit the spot. This was almost like the first experience back in San Fran. The one in San Fran had a sweeter aftertaste but this one was still pretty good. They also had bubbles. Oh yea, that is why we went here! The other two places on the block RAN OUT OF BUBBLES. How do you have a bubble tea place and run out of the bubbles....The tea was brewed very well and did not have a bitter taste to it. Sometimes those late night orders have the aftertaste of the day mixed into them. This one tasted fresh. SO FRESH. I loved it. I enjoyed it the entire time trying to find a cab and in the subway home when the cabs failed. I am so happy that luck brought us to this joint. This tea place will now be on my list of places to go when I am in NYC. It has the tea I crave but on the closer coast!!",2,2,1

They said yes u can order something else. So I thought they were just out of milk tea. So I asked again if they had tapioca. And then they said yes.

I've been to coco a lot in Beijing, but this was the first time I saw it in the US. I got the regular milk tea with pudding. They don't show that you can change the sugar level, but they do. You just have to let the cashier know. Whenever I try a new place, I always get the milk tea to gauge how good they are. So the milk tea here is pretty solid and I enjoyed the pudding. They gave me a lot of pudding so I was a happy camper! I was too full to ask for bubbles, so I can't comment on how those are. On the sugar aspect, I got 70% sweetness but I may go for 50-60% next time, as I like my milk tea a little less sweet. A lot of places just pack in the sugar to satisfy the American customers, so be careful if you're like me!Other than milk tea, they have a bunch of other flavors to try.

They also offer regular teas/juices/coffee/etc. They have specials on the monitor so be on the lookout!You can customize the sweetness and amount of ice. You also can add extras such as pudding, sago, grass jelly, tapioca, etc. Quick service and there is plenty of seating!

My favorite is actually their grapefruit yakult with coconut jelly. Their regular Caramel Milk Tea with bubbles is alittle sweet so i make sure to keep it at about 50% sugar and 50% ice, but even that gets alittle too sweet. If you want boba, get the jasmine Milk Tea 50% sugar with Boba. It's not overwhelmingly sweet and they base it with a tasty jasmine tea so its very enjoyable.",2,1,2

Tastes exactly the same but the only difference here is the price (more expensive in NYC) and they don't offer or honor any stamp cards. Bummer. Forget Starbucks and go to CoCo instead Yelpers! ;)",6,4,5

46,Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1614,1444,4566,4.0,3/31/2015,"With so many bubble tea joints in East Village, you can imagine how cutthroat competition can be. I've had my share of bubble tea at Saint Alp's, Tkettle and Kung Fu tea. In terms of taste, CoCo is comparable to Kung Fu Tea. I had the passion fruit passion fruit green tea with sago. The drink was refreshing and not overly sweet, I wasn't a big fan of the sago though I think I'll stick to my usual herbal pudding or tapioca. Like most places CoCo gives you an option for how much ice you want and how much sugar you want. I like that they offer seating unlike Saint Alp's and Tkettle where it's only reserved for dine in customers. This forces people to get tea to go rather than sit in. But not at CoCo, their sleek and modern interior welcomes you and allows you to enjoy your drinks at your own pace rather than walking and drinking at the same time. Prices are slightly cheaper compared to everywhere else, I like that they offer a monthly special where you can get 2 featured medium drinks for $4.95. This might be my new go to spot for bubble tea spot if I'm around East Village.",2,,
47,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",70,301,102,5.0,8/31/2015,"I love that CoCo is open late. We were in the area and I was craving boba, and none of the boba shops were open (I'm looking at you, KungFu and TKettle). But CoCo saved that day (or night), at 1AM. The regular milk tea is perfect. I usually get 70% sweet at KungFu, and I forgot to customize the sweetness level at CoCo, but I didn't find it overtly sweet. So maybe CoCo's milk tea is not as sweet as KungFu's? The tapioca bubbles are perfect at CoCo- just enough chewiness with a bit of sweetness. I will definitely be back at CoCo for more bubble tea! Oh, and I think they have a $7 or $8 minimum for credit card charges.",,,

I ONLY drink bubble tea from here, even though they have competitors Kung Fu Tea and TKettle across the street. I've tried a few of their drinks that didn't wow me. I'm not a fan of the fruit teas, personally, but my friend really likes the grapefruit yakult. I tell myself to try new drinks but I always end up getting my fave - the pudding milk tea. People get weirded out by the pudding but it's SO GOOD. I don't like tapioca in general so I get the pudding. I used to come here every week, but I've managed to cut it down to every two weeks 4 stars instead of 5 (but more like 4.5 stars) because their staff is really inconsistent in terms of service. I know Asian people are generally rude so I expect it, but still...some are nicer than others. I also wish they had a stamp card!",,,1
50,Umar T.,"New York, NY",201,111,324,4.0,8/1/2016,Bubble tea is delicious and even more so in slush form - especially when it's 90+ degrees out. A friend and I went here for a casual bubble tea in the evening. CoCo has a fun atmosphere and is a great place to go by yourself or with a group. The Passion Fruit + Mango bubble tea was on point. My only suggestion would be to ask for a little bit less than the normal amount of tapioca because there was a bit too much boba than I needed and the syrup from the tapioca cut through the drink a bit much. Overall great place!,,,

The staff here are really nice and very willing to explain any drinks to you if you're unsure about it. We had the large Cream Black Tea for $4.00, which is just about the same price as Kung Fu Tea. The Cream Black Tea is basically black tea with whipped cream on top. They make the whipped cream on premise so you know it's fresh! I really liked my tea - it was something new that I had never had before and it tasted really great. The cream helped cut the bitterness of the otherwise unsweetened black tea. Nom!",1,,

Obviously not the same pricing strategy as Taiwan. Milk teas with one topping are about $3.50 for a small, which seems fair. As you get into other teas and slushies, prices rise dramatically into the $5+ range.I ordered a jasmine milk tea with tapioca and my sister ordered a Tapioca milk tea. I love when they use the automatic shaker to shake the teas, as it makes the milk foamy and rich. After we got our drinks, we luckily squeezed at a small empty table, which happened to be the only empty table left in the back room. There is limited seating, and if there's a big group occupying two-ish tables, you may be left standing. However, large groups equal large sound and it was so noisy that we could barely stand it, and had to leave even before finishing our drinks.Nothing extraordinary, although I am sure there are even more expensive bubble tea joints in the area.",1,1,
58,Ron L.,"New York, NY",1080,409,2175,5.0,8/19/2014,"They've got a repertoire of bubble tea drinks just like the other Coco locations in NY in this multi national chain. As always, the staff are competent and helpful in picking out a drink that matches my mood.I'd picked out a large passionfruit green tea with not only bubbles (tapioca), but also rainbow jelly (50¢ extra for each).  I didn't care... I wanted a PARTY in my mouth! It certainly hit the spot after a hefty meal on West Village.Although I didn't get a chance to enjoy it in-store, I did notice they've got enough seating further in the back with contemporary lighting befitting the St Marks vibe compared to the other bright stark colors of their other stores.In the St. Mark's area, I'd put them on par with St. Alps in terms of overall experience, above the rest of the competition.",3,1,4

It tastes so good, I got it with coconut jelly which was kind of overkill because the aloe chunks and coconut jelly were super filling, almost too filling, and then my mouth got tired from chewing all the jellies. The taro slush with boba was equally delish, and I'm just so glad that there's a place that's open until 1AM, where most boba places closed at around 9 or 10 in the city.

It's been around for a looong while as I remember...I wonder what makes it quite trendy here lately? But I suggest you try....

Honestly I don't get the boba at any boba place, but they make it great here, chewy and not too tough. Usually I add aloe to my drinks for a great extra taste, but if you fancy something else, they have many options to choose from. My favorite drinks from here are:1) Jasmin milk tea + Aloe - no ice, this tea off sets the sweetness, so no need to adjust the percent.2) Coco milk tea - 70% sugar and no ice, trust me on the 70%, it can get pretty sweet.3) Yakult mango or green tea 4) Matcha green tea with puddingExtras:AloeBobaMixed jelly Coconut jellyPuddingAnd MORE!Overall: Although it may be a chain, its worth every penny and one of the bast priced!",,,1

I recommend adjusting the sugar levels: I've found 30% sugar still tastes amazing. The one thing Kung Fu Tea probably does better is the taro flavor and the slushes.

The workers constantly brew green and black tea every few hours so that they maintain that herbal and fresh taste. The tapioca bubbles are cooked to perfection! They are always sweet, chewy, and delicate!  The workers also generously put in a lot of tapoica and other toppings into the drinks, which I give them extra brownie points! Everytime I come into Coco, I always get the green tea yakult and grapefruit green tea. The yakult adds a nice tart but gentle sweetness to the green tea. The grapefruit adds a strong acidity and pungent taste to the green tea. Not only are these drinks great for any weather or season but they are also the best and healthier drinks to get! If you are not a big bubble tea fan, Coco also sells smoothies and slushies! I have to say, Ive tried their mango smoothie with lychee jelly and it was absolutely out of this world! They put lactaid milk into the slush, which gives the whole drink such a creamy and refreshing taste! This drink is perfect and ideal to drink during hot days!Coco will always have a place in my bubble tea-loving heart. I can never get enough of the service of the store and the quality of the drinks. So if you guys are in that bubble tea mood, go to Cocos!!",,,
94,Alexandrea C.,"Austin, TX",118,45,3,4.0,12/10/2014,"This place is great! A lot of yummy options. I usually get the milk bubble tea. They also have many mix-ins you can add. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because although they have many options, I have experienced a bubble tea shop with a lot more smoothie and coffee mixtures. But regardless, I come here often.The space is clean, always busy--you can tell it's a staple to this neighborhood. Lots of sitting room. It's a go-to spot for me during the summer.",1,,
95,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1700,2743,655,3.0,2/7/2015,"Fast and efficient, they popped out the drink in no time. $5 for credit card means that you basically have to buy two drinks to get there, and you have a space in the back for seating (it's a long thin space) to drink if you wanted to have your drink to stay.",,,

The flavor of their tea always taste the same no matter which location you go to and the sweetness of their drinks are well balanced and best of all, I never ran into a hard boba incident at Coco (after many many visits at various locations), the boba has always been soft, chewy and with the perfect sweetness.  My recommendations- go for the 3 ""HOT"" Guys if you like boba, grass jelly and pudding and 2 ""COLD"" Ladies if you like pudding and coffee jelly. and if you want to baller it up- go for one of Yakult drinks (flavored yogurt drink), I like the Mango one and trust me on it, you won't be disappointed.",,,

It's also a chain I recognize from Flushing as well as LA. This couldn't be a more perfect location for the East Village. I know both TKettle and Saint Alp's is closeby but the price doesn't compare the CoCo's! This is also the first CoCo's I've been to with indoor seating. Definite plus!Also a plus when you can actually taste the tea in their milk tea's! you can also adjust your ice and sweetness level. Always a plus for me!,2,,1

She had an attitude from the very beginning and was rude the entire time as if she was mad i placed a large order. She did not smile nor say please or thank you at all. She was hostile and proceeded to throw things around when making the drinks. Upon receiving the drinks i stood to the side to check my order during which she addressed me saying ""you don't have to check your bags, i put your entire order on your receipt and thats all you have to look at.""

They must have opened within this past week because it looks super clean and there's this huge blue inflated mascot thing adorning the entrance that welcomes your presence.Currently there's a BOGO offer on their tapioca milk tea, the most simple item on the menu, so I paid $3.00 for two of them and gave the extra one to a friend. I just couldn't pass on this deal so I didn't try to explore the menu, but the matcha items caught my eye. I'll have to come back soon to try them.They seem to be inconsistent with the amount of tapioca they add to their drinks, however. One of my friends was left with a considerable amount of it by the time all of the drink was gone, while I was able to finish nearly all of my tapioca. Maybe it's just me, but I like a balanced ratio between drink and tapioca.There's a good amount of seats and room to move around in the back of the store, unlike a lot of places in St. Mark's. I'd definitely come here for dessert in place of Spot Dessert Bar when I don't feel like breaking the bank but still want something sweet.",2,,
108,Cynthia Y.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",275,121,12,5.0,10/21/2014,SO GOOD!!I personally prefer this to Kung Fu Tea because the milk tea is so much thicker and the bubbles have just the right amount of chewiness to them.

(My partner's tea was not quite as bad, but had similar issues.)  I kept retrying with the straw, stirring, and each time the bubble clumps jammed up the straw.  As I went to pull up the straw again a cluster of about 10 came up with the straw right through the hole for the straw, spilling some of the drink on me.  I showed the nasty cluster (wish I had a photo to post) to the girl who had put it together and she said ""it's the way it's supposed to be, just shake it a little"".  Really?No - but she was too busy eating food behind the counter and checking her cellphone to be bothered to offer any assistance or an apology to her customer.

However, I found the environment to be very noisy with the employees in the background working and other customers were sitting too close to us. This made it a difficult place to just sit down and catch up with a friend. We ended up leaving a little earlier than we would've liked because it was too noisy.

Boba had the right texture, gummy on the inside and soft outside. Vanilla milk tea was nice and sweet. Didn't add too much powder. Mmm and on top of that, we got to sit around for a pretty long time to talk and hangout. Nice, clean space with white lighting and a restroom for the customers. This place is awesome. On a side note while I was there:By 12am, the light suddenly turned off and someone walked out with a birthday cake for a co-worker to celebrate his birthday. Next thing you know, we were offered cake all around! And we were served to eat this chocolate birthday cake with a boba straw. They didn't have any utensils since this place is all about serving delicious drinks.

They don't have the tapioca ready until about an hour after they open. 2. They only make it every 4 hours and it takes 45 min plus to finish. So your odds of missing out on the tapioca when the last batch is gone is pretty high.",1,,
152,Bibi M.,"Queens, NY",0,36,0,1.0,5/20/2015,"Came in during the day, and they were completely empty. The girl who works here is honestly the rudest and most barbaric person I've ever come across. She was yelling angrily, gesturing violently, and slamming things down as she was making my drink. I was standing there waiting, and she suddenly cursed, because she realized that she made my drink wrong. Fuming, she made my drink again, and I must say it is the worst tea I've ever had. Disgusting, watery milk powder with absolutely no tea flavor whatsoever. It was so undrinkable that I had to throw it away. Fellow customers, please don't waste your money like I did. Go somewhere else. Believe me-- you don't want to drink something that was made with such aggression. I have no idea what she was yelling about because I don't understand the language, but I hope she finds a way to chill. I understand we all have bad days, but damn, girl needs to relax. CoCo, please consider hiring employees who will carry themselves with some grace and class. The quality of your employees directly impacts how your customers feel about your establishment.",1,1,
