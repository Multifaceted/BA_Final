0,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,7/30/2018,"I stopped by Saturday around 1pm and the place wasn't busy. The ambiance was quite beautiful. The tables are only for full brunch service. However, you can sit at the bar located at the back of the restaurant which is what I would recommend if you're unsure about what to get. At the bar you can order drinks, bakery items and anything on a regular menu. The bartender was super friendly. We decided to share a grilled chicken sandwich along with some drinks. The sandwich was $16 but the portion definitely made up for it and it tasted great! The chicken was juicy and it paired nicely with the creamy avocado and balsamic sauce. The tomatoes were plump and the mozzarella cheese melted nicely. The bun was super soft and the mountain load of fries were fried to perfection! I recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet nice brunch spot with a group of friends. I would love to return for dinner.",2,2,2
1,Rebecca D.,"New York, NY",20,69,714,5.0,7/6/2018,"We got a reservation for a Sunday morning, on Sunday morning.  This place is huge! We couldn't believe how many tables there were. The decor was super cute. I enjoyed the lights. We scoped our the croissants for dessert on our way in, they had a good selection.  We kept a few in mind for later in the meal. We started with smashes for the table. We ordered a burrata, avocado and berry smash. We asked them to cut them in 4ths for us since there were 4 of us but the guy just told us they were already cut in half. Oh well... we tried ‍The smashes are really where this place shines. The burrata was great! The balsamic was sweet all the flavors worked well - excellent. The avocado fell short for me. Not a ton of flavor. I wouldn't order it again.The berry was not one I wanted or ordered but it was great. It was like having dessert for breakfast! Would order again.Next we had our meals. I went back and forth between 2 items and settled on the eggs in a nest. I'm glad I did. It was suggested I mix it up. In hindsight I would suggest you leave it as prepared which leaves the texture of the shoestrings crunchy. After I mixed it up they got a bit mushy. The flavors were great with the cheddar grits and the mushrooms. The mushroom flavor really came through in this dish. My aunt ordered the croque madam. It was rich and I had a bite of it and it was good. It was a lot of food!We also got some croissants for the table. We asked for the birthday cake and the almond. When the waiter returned he told me they had run out of birthday cake and gave us the fruity pebble instead. I was a little disappointed but had wanted to try the fruity pebble anyway so we cut in.  The fruity pebble was filled with a lemon custard. I'm not a fan of lemon so I didn't care for this one. The almond was okay. Others at my table found this their favorite. It was dense and moist and not filled. Our waiter then brought out a birthday cake croissant with a candle. He must have just been joking so he could bring it out for my birthday. I appreciated this ploy!The birthday cake was my favorite. Overall I would come here again and bring friends. I've already suggested a few people come here and try the smashes. I'm sure I'll be back for those. Glad my cousin picked this spot for us!!",,,
2,Ms G.,"New York, NY",150,262,129,2.0,7/3/2018,"On a brisk Saturday evening, a group of us got together for a last minute birthday dinner. Note that they do not seat you unless the entire party arrives. Also note that there is a $5 plating charge per person if you bring your own cake. (We passed and ordered their vanilla funfetti birthday cake instead. It was enough for the 8 of us.) While the restaurant is spacious and romantically lit, it makes the perfect backdrop for a date. However, the food was just disappointing. There was a dish - we weren't sure if it was tofu or crispy rice or sushi. But it was hard and kind of tasteless. This made us sad. The lettuce wraps however, made up for it. Drinks flowed freely that night. We took turns trying different cocktails but we mostly ended up having wine as some drinks were too strong. No one raved about their meal. There was chicken and there was steak and there was pork and there was fish. Other than those descriptions, I couldn't tell you much about my experience food wise. The star of our dinner though, was the cracker jack sundae. It was very very good. To sum it up, the dinner, while subpar, was saved by ice cream. Would we come back for dinner? Unlikely, but..... perhaps we shall come back and try the baked goods and see if that's better.",1,,
3,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",946,751,3018,5.0,4/23/2018,"Bomb brunch spot. Fo realz.I didn't realize what a cool place this is. Great vibes, good eats, and didn't break the bank like many brunch places in the city do. I came on a Sunday with some girlfriends and we all loved it. I had the brunch bowl with poached eggs and it was fantastic. We also shared the sausage side and loaded tater tot side, both of which were good too. The bloody mary was decent, not the best one I've had but it was good. May have had two...The service could've been a little bit better but I get it, it's the Sunday brunch crowd and things get crazy. Anyway, I'll be back and maybe even try one of their famous stuffed croissants.",3,1,3
4,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",37,235,1745,3.0,4/11/2018,"I was told that this restaurant is a food hall during the day in one section and a sit-down fancier restaurant in the other section.Decor is spruced up warehouse looked with lots of hanging light bulbs that has a garden party feel.  Chairs are either wooden or criss-cross straps (which aren't very friendly to pantyhose or legs when wearing shorts).  The plates are all mismatched which can be quaint.  Though couldn't see since the lights are dimmed for ambiance or romantic setting.Each dish almost had something interesting to make it not 'Wow' for me.  Starters:The calamari was good.  The shishito peppers were perfectly cooked but all flatten. Mains: Crispy Fried Chicken: 2 small pieces of chicken on collard greens with grits.  Didn't see nor taste the bacon.Corn Salad with Shrimp was a good size portion though the popcorn didn't enhance the salad flavoring...guessing more for texture.Chorizo Carbonara was a bit too spicy.  Yes, chorizo can be spicy so be aware.The bathrooms are located downstairs which the lights are a bit dimmed.  Be careful of the door when opening or closing.",3,,
5,Barron C.,"San Francisco, CA",63,76,126,4.0,5/14/2018,"Solid brunch spot. It helped our hungover crew to get our life back in order, especially aided by the deliciousness that is carrot cake waffles w/ fried chicken and spicy syrup - yes please!The rest of the food was solid as well, but that was the standout to me.",,,
6,Akash M.,"New York, NY",108,51,79,3.0,4/14/2018,"I usually don't think of Union Fare when it comes to brunch because it's a popular local lunch spot during the work week, but I came here for brunch on a Sunday to try it out.For starters, you get a complementary mimosa before 10:30am, so I made reservation for 10am (make sure to make a reservation because it gets packed on weekends). I ordered the Brunch Bowl, and my friend ordered the Steak & Eggs with Loaded Tater Tots. I really liked the Brunch Bowl because not only did it fill me up, it was actually pretty healthy for the most part. The menu has a decent amount to choose from, but one major downside is that it does not list any allergen info (i.e. gluten, soy, nuts, etc). I had to ask the waitress what can be made gluten-free, luckily the Brunch Bowl was naturally gluten-free. According to the waitress, the chef does not make substitutions unless if it's a health-related issue...like what? How do you not make substitutions?!",,1,
7,Carola B.,"Weehawken, NJ",93,99,329,5.0,3/8/2018,"I came here yesterday night during the snow storm and all I wanted was a hot cappuccino and a Croissant. My cravings were 100% satisfied. The red velvet croissant is AMAZING and the cappuccino was very good as well  I love the atmosphere and the style of this place, I'll definitely come another time with friends for dinner.",1,,
8,Tuanh D.,"Los Angeles, CA",338,127,169,4.0,2/26/2018,Came here the first time I was in NY because my cousin suggested it and I was totally wowed. Everything was so interesting to look at - love the decorations and layout and theme- that I couldn't help stare at everything.Food wise- we were eating all around NY so didn't wanna load up too much here. We ended up getting the red velvet croissant and sharing it between us. So so yummy. Nice and flaky with cream cheese filling in the middle!,1,,1
9,Jackie G.,"Jersey City, NJ",239,203,165,5.0,2/17/2018,"What to eat: salmon poke, ribs, lamb pasta. Really enjoyed the cauliflower raclette but depends on personal taste. Super cute place with hanging lights and intimate seating. And it's huge, which is always nice to find in NYC!",1,,
10,Christina B.,"New York, NY",284,257,756,4.0,1/15/2018,"Union Fare is trendy, large and innovative in their menu items. I've been here twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. The cocktail menu is the same for brunch as it is for dinner. Make sure to make reservations prior to coming as it's always packed. I'd come back here for dinner again as the brunch service itself was lacking and I felt the dinner menu was more unique. For brunch, try the smashes for the table. For dinner, get the burrata and ribs.",2,,1
11,Ally B.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,66,50,5.0,2/18/2018,"One of my favorite brunch spots in the city, especially because they actually take reservations! Also, the atmosphere and space are beautiful. The smashes for the table are by far the best part. I recommend the berries, burrata, and avocado. We also tried the loaded tater tots (obviously amazing), eggs in a nest, breakfast mac and cheese, and the yoghurt parfait.",,,
12,Pamela A.,"New York, NY",157,313,685,5.0,2/17/2018,"Delicious food and too service! This venue is definitely hip and young. I loved it as I loved all of our appetizers ( mac and cheese and bread appetizer with cheese) and my food. The shrimp salad with corn and avocado was absolutely scrumptious and I highly recommend it. Every single meal that we had, the ambiance and the great service truly made our experience wonderful. Can't wait to return!

13,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,3.0,10/24/2017,"Our party of six came in on a Friday night with a 7 pm reservation for a birthday dinner. I don't know if it was because the space was big, or if it was still early, but the restaurant didn't seem that packed.To start, we ordered a bunch of apps to share:Mac and cheese - this was really good. It was smooth and creamy, and they didn't overdo it on the breadcrumbs like some places tend to doFried calamari with lemon aioli - the calamari was pretty standard, but the lemon aioli was a unique and nice change of place from the typical marinara sauce that's usually served with it at other placesMeat and cheese plate - not sure of what all the meats/cheese were but there was this brie (?) cheese on there that was greatAhi Tuna ""Melt"" with chipotle, tomatoes, provolone - again, very unique. They use tuna tartar, melted provolone, and peeled cherry tomatoes in two thin, perfectly toasted slices of bread. This was probably my favorite appAs for my entree, I was really excited to try the Chorizo Carbonara (pepper jack, poached egg, chipotle, crispy chicharron) since I love chorizo. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in my head. It was super oily. I could only eat a few bites before all the oil from the chorizo and the smokey chicharron was getting to be too much.I don't mind coming back for drinks and appetizers, because it seems like the appetizers are where their strength lies.",4,1,1
14,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,4.0,4/15/2018,"We went to Union Fare for brunch and we really enjoyed our meals. The space is very open and airy. The staff is very friendly and eager to please.We had:- Yogurt Parfait - very good with fruit and granola- Mac n Cheese - very tasty and the portion was huge- Baked Eggs - with spicy tomato sauce, feta and chorizo - delicious- Eggs in a nest - the hubby liked but didn't love. He didn't realize when ordering that the nest was made of crispy fried onions - not his favorite. He did like the eggs and grits- Red Velvet Croissant - very tasty. They have variety of uniquely flavored croissant. Most of them are create filled.Overall, a really nice experience, I would like to come back for lunch or dinner.",11,2,7

16,Natalie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,158,892,5.0,9/11/2017,"I'm in love! With a restaurant  The lighting, the decor, the ambiance, the food! Love, love, love!Cold and hungry we stumbled upon this gem in the Union Square neighborhood. It was so inviting that we burst in through the back door. I was wondering why there was no hostess then we were politely ushered to the entrance where we were greeting with warm friendly smiles and seated immediately. It's a large space yet somehow still feels intimate. It was almost at capacity but not uncomfortably so. Tables had a decent amount of spacing between them which meant privacy. The menu had good options, not overwhelming or intimidating at all. There was also a pretty decent wine menu. We settled on a couple of appetizers to share and the trout and mussels for entree. The grilled octopus was a delight. It was flavorful and cooked to perfection and enough for two people. The tuna tartare melt was also good but I definitely preferred the octopus. The trout was melt in your mouth goodness. It was deboned and served with rosemary infused fingerling potatoes which I try enjoyed. The mussels were ginormous! The broth was also pretty good. We were too full for desert but I did notice those delicious looking opera chocolate cakes everyone seemed to order. Will certainly try on my next visit.",3,1,2
17,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72,4.0,5/14/2018,"Union Fare is a super cool spot in a great location, just off of Union Square (who would have guessed?) with a open concept-like market during the day and a really nice sit down table service restaurant by night. The space is very open and hip, with a great crowd of people.Decor aside, the food was delicious. We started with the chicken lettuce cups and fried calamari which I would highly suggest. For main, we went with the Thai Steak Salad, Poke Bowl and Cauliflower Raclette. On the side we got some brussels (AMAZING). One better than the other (specially the cauliflower because who doesn't like melted cheese?).My only complaint was with the service. This could have just been an off night although we had a very disinterested server, who actually questioned me when I asked for a clean glass (as mine was filthy) and was often non-existent. Maybe just a bad day. Anyway, great spot!",,,1
18,Taylor P.,"Mays Landing, NJ",170,99,226,3.0,9/2/2017,"Let's just start off with aesthetic. The lighting is top notch and makes for a really great look. Now let's get to food. Some mixed feelings there. We tried a few things to split:Local Burrata salad: The burrata wasn't as creamy as I've had in other places but paired with strawberries and an acidic vinaigrette was perfect and light.   The Tuna melt: I wasn't blown away by this one, it looked good but was just ok.Sweet chili Ribs: YUM. Such amazing tangy sweet flavor, I loved these! Fall off the bone meat. Definitely recommend this!Home-made fusilli with lamb ragu: Id come back to this place everyday for just this dish. WOW. The pasta was so well done, the lamb ragu was tender and perfectly seasoned. I loved the slight gamey flavor from the lamb. So perfect. For dessert we had to try the opera cake. Unfortunately it was not as exciting after the caramel cage was broken through. Don't get me wrong it was a yummy chocolate cake and I loved the crunch from the hazelnuts, but it didn't blow me away. Overall, yummy little spot, but not my favorite. Definitely would come back for that pasta though!!",4,,1

The spahgetti was perfectly chewy, al dente.The pepper jack was spicy, but similar to black pepper spice. Chicharron had a similar texture to gritty mash potatoes. Rigatoni Pomodoro: $18 Out of all the pasta, this would be the most worth it in my opinion. The home-made Ricotta cheese topped of the pasta was delicious, and melted. The pasta was a bit too chewy. -Jack Nouveau contain pomegrate, lemon, lime and pinot noir. Great strong drink but not for me. Thought it a fruity citric alcoholic drink but clearly mistaken. Bathroom was clean. Service was average.",1,,
22,Leslie T.,"New York, NY",29,206,140,3.0,4/9/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday with a friend. Complimentary mimosas before 10:30am on weekends is a great deal. The mimosa is fairly boozy. We had three smashes to share -- burrata, lox, and avocado. They were all very good, especially the burrata. It was also surprisingly filling. The grilled chicken sandwich was a bit of a disappointment, since the chicken was bland and the bread was neither grilled nor firm. It was more like a lukewarm sandwich I could get at any deli.",,,
23,Annie Y.,"Montreal, Canada",132,19,35,4.0,2/24/2018,"So so yummy! I got the ricotta toast with truffle, the sweet chili ribs, the calamari, and the carbonara, brussel sprouts, and the opera cake with caramel cone (shared with me and my bf, we both gained 10 lbs from this meal). I have to say, the ricotta toast was soooo good!!! It was fluffy and creamy, and the honey added this faint sweetness. It's a must try whenever you come to this restaurant. As a final dessert, we ordered the special that used to be known as the opera cake in caramel cone. Very cute and interesting to break through the exterior to get to the ice cream and cake that is waiting inside!",1,,
24,Christine K.,"New York, NY",40,321,1,3.0,4/1/2018,"I've visited Union Fare twice, and I still have mixed feelings about Union Fare. Inside, the decor embraces the warehouse theme--I very much appreciate the lights and the synergy between practicality and aesthetics of the seating furniture. (Spacious seating is a plus) From this perspective, Union Fare fits right in line with what you're seeking for a Friday night or brunch date.Compared to most other brunch restaurants, you do get your ""bang for the buck"" with the portions. My only gripe is the flavors of the various menu items aren't exactly standouts. The food isn't too heavily seasoned or salty, which is another plus for me. If you want something hearty and filling, the brunch bowl will do the trick.For some reason, I continue to feel conflicted. Not sure what to do--perhaps, the third visit will resolve my uncertainty.",,,

I saw reviews that the place accommodates larger groups, and I wasn't disappointed. The staff at the front of the house was very accommodating. I was running late due to traffic but they accommodated our party without any issues once we all arrived. We ordered a bottle of champagne for the table and I also ordered a champagne bitters cocktail. It was well presented. The flavor was pretty good too.The pickled vegetable app was kinda interesting but kinda strange too. The burrata with strawberries was DIVINE. I'd go back just for that any day!! I also ordered a roasted chicken entree. It was tasty and not too high priced. Overall the place is kinda pricey but not unreasonably so. I did think the waitress could HS e been more attentive, but otherwise we enjoyed our meal!",2,,
26,Jaime D.,"New York, NY",13,82,25,5.0,3/10/2018,At first glance you can't tell how huge this place is but indeed it goes through the block. Interestingly enough besides the amazing croissants they sell (fruity pebbles stuffed or matcha green tray stuffed) you can get fashion forward and by a clutch or a purse.But to the food. Came here for brunch and was able to make a reservation. The choices on the menu are great options. They have a smashed toast option for sharing at the table which we did because we were three ladies. The berries and ricotta toast was delicious. Perfect starter but it did come out together with my brunch so I was pretty torn. I ordered the chicken and waffles and I loved it. The chicken was perfectly friend and flavored and it was boneless - like as in boneless thighs!! And the waffles great too. It comes with a spicy honey which we gladly asked for second and paired perfect with the waffle.I would say that dish was a perfect dish to share if you order the smashed toast. So don't go over board because they have excellent croissants which actually sell out by the end of my brunch. The waitress was excellent and knew her food was able to accommodate all our questions with patience.We got the check and they let us linger and did not rush us out.So overall our total for three coffees board of smashed toast / three brunch dishes ended up $75. Great quality dining good service and space was great. You can have a conversation with your friends and neighbors were not on top of yo and noise level was decent.I would go back again and dinner looked like a next idea to try there!,,,
27,Doug J.,"New York, NY",6,36,7,2.0,6/10/2018,"2 stars for the overall experience.   Tip:  Do NOT make a reservation for later than 9:45pm.   Why?  The restaurant closes much earlier than you think - last reservation is at 10:15pm, the kitchen closes at 10:30pm and the bar closes at 11pm.   And it's not a great experience when everything is closing around you.To be fair, the restaurant tried to manage my expectations on the fact that the kitchen closes at the aforementioned time.  But my party of 5 arrived on time, were ready to place our order, so we made our end of the bargain.   The issue is just how much you could tell everyone wanted us out of the restaurant.  This included someone cleaning up nearby us with a broom as we were eating our entrees.   I'm just so aghast at this, because even if a guest arrives on time for a reservation, and just as it's close to closing, you should feel welcome and not rushed for the entire experience.   Union Fare: don't offer reservations at 10 or later if you don't want customers then.4 stars for the food.  My partner's salad and whole trout was excellent.  My starter of salmon poke was over a bed of cold rice (maybe intentional), but it felt like it had been sitting in a fridge for an hour.  Icelandic cod was pretty good.",1,,
28,Secil A.,"Manhattan, NY",637,156,222,5.0,5/8/2017,"Went here twice - for brunch and dinner. There is nearly no line to get seated as it is a very big place with lots of tables. The banana bread that came with the pastry basket and the pancakes are delicious for brunch. The ricotta smash, avocado smash and burrata smash are simply amazing.For dinner, we got ricotta toast, burrata, linguini, and the opera came. The toast and burrata were spectacular.

Finished with some drops of kalamata aioli- Cape Cod Musses ($29): a huge pan with the largest mussels I have ever tried. The sauce with white wine, garlic and fresh herbs was delish.The place is huge, has an entrance on 17th and one on 18th. We sat at the bar and had a great time. Bartender was very nice and making sure we had the wine at the temperature we wanted (beware, they keep reds at room temp, which is too hot in summer). Not much of an issue, as he chilled it for us. But given how big the place is, they should invest in a wine fridge.They also have a gastro pub and coffee shop next door. It was closed when we came 4th of July weekend, but should be fun when open.",,1,1

I keep coming back here for their croissants - my favorite being the fruity pebbles croissant. They're not authentic really, since they're usually stuffed and smothered with fillings on the inside. But, they're good. And they're fun.Let's talk about the meals here. It's exactly what you'd expect and it's nothing special. We ordered brunch on a Sunday. The restaurant was pretty filled and the decor is really nice. You'll notice instantly that the menu has steep prices. Two eggs with a side salad and tator tots is $20. Three pieces of toast with choices of cheese/toppings are $24. The salmon dish was ~$24 and all it was was one sheet of smoked salmon. The food was very underwhelming. If you're coming here, I'd suggest sticking with the cafe portion / bakery side. Get a few pastries, and then go to a different restaurant in Union Square to eat.",,,

Upon entering we found a beautifully set up restaurant. The decor and lighting gave it a perfect Saturday night out atmosphere. The space was massive which makes it perfect for large groups and events.Our server Rebecca was fantastic. She was super nice and engaging. Rebecca made fantastic recommendations on wines, cocktails, and food. I settled on a white wine and my girlfriend got a cocktail. For appetizers we decided on the salmon tar tar. The salmon was very fresh and the toast was perfectly crisp. The slice of avocado on top made it a perfect starter meal.For the main I went with the linguini. This was a suggestion by Rebecca and boy was I glad I chose it. The linguini tasted AMAZING. It had the perfect amount of cheese and butter, the noodle was perfectly cooked, and the presentation on the plate was great. Overall a fantastic choice, I recommend this to everyone that comes here. My only gripe with this place is that the tables are to close to each other. Considering how large the space was, I felt that they could have moved the tables 1 inch further apart. I felt way to close to the couple next to us. Also the price was a little on the high end for what it was. Considering the area, I guess it is acceptable.Overall, great experience. I would definitely be back soon.Pro tip: Do not skip on the fries, perfectly crunchy with a bomb ass aioli for dip.",,,
35,Stella D.,"Indianapolis, IN",417,310,635,4.0,6/16/2017,First orientation big dinner. I am super impressed with their interior design especially the lighting that looks like snow falling from the sky. The restroom also is like fancy but not in the extravagant way. Most of them dishes are just okay but I don't have the pay for it so I don't have any complaints. But the mussels are like the best. They are at least 2 times bigger than the regular ones and the bread soaking into the soap just tastes so good. They also gave us free dessert which I am not sure why...,,,
36,Chris C.,"New York, NY",148,185,24,3.0,3/18/2018,"The space at Union Fare is pretty big. The nice part was that they were able to accommodate me and my gf on a Saturday night. My gf had been here for brunch and wanted to try their dinner menu. So let me start with the good, the food was actually pretty decent, the calamari was lightly breaded and flavorful. The two main dishes we got were the house made fusilli and the fried chicken. The plates were both pretty packed with food and despite the 20$ price range for each dish, they do give you a sizable portion. The fusilli was cooked al dente with a good amount of lamb and the fried chicken was juicy and crispy. Now for the bad, when we walked into the restaurant to ask about any open tables, the hostess was for some reason really curt with us and when she asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar, and I responded with ""Which bar?"" (since there are two bars that are in the restaurant from my initial observation) she replied with ""I can't tell you, I need to know if you want to sit at the bar or not"", this was such a bizarre response, and when we agreed to sit she shooed us away to follow another hostess. Next, the restaurant seems very nice as you are you sitting there, lots of staff moving about, but for some reason our server was absolutely no where to be found. She came initially took our order, and then 50 minutes later she would come and check on us, multiple times I had to flag someone down to refill our water. If I am desperate for food and am stuck in Union Square without any other options, then I'll be back.",3,,
37,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1197,355,2204,5.0,4/4/2017,"The only negative about this place is that it's too far for me, for a weekly brunch spot!We were in NYC for a bachelorette weekend and had reservations to come here for brunch at 11 on Sunday.  We had 2 tables of 6 side-by-side, and the server was super helpful in keeping us on the same timing schedule so we could all get our food at the same time, etc.  This is the cutest hipster spot, with exposed wood, edison lightbulbs, and uncomplicated decor.  It's about the food and the drink - and I completely respect that, because they do an AMAZING job.  The food was amazing.  We started off with 3 Smashes to share with the table (actually, both of our tables did this!) was a perfect pairing with our morning cocktails.  We ordered the burrata, berries, and avocado smashes - all were phenomenal, but the Burrata was my favorite!  For a meal, I ordered the breakfast bowl - it was probably big enough to share, but I did my best!  It was perfectly paired with a egg-over-easy on top, with its' ooey-gooey-eggyness all over.  DELISH.I  the drink special, if you go soon - I HIGHLY suggest it.  It was called the St. Germain, and I believe it was St. Germain, sauvignon blanc, and prosecco.  So good, refreshing and light!Time-wise, 11am was perfect, by the time we left around 1pm, the place was swarming and the line was to the door (almost).  So tip: get here early for a hassle-free brunching experience.  If you can swing it, snag reservations here for a fantastic morning brunch - you won't regret it!",1,,
38,Celina H.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,21,37,5.0,6/19/2018,"The setting is so beautiful, and the dim lighting really sets the mood. I got the Benedict Board: smoked salmon, prosciutto, and lobster. For the smashers, I got burrata, lox, and strawberry banana, all of which were served on boards (very cool). They tasted amazing. Of course I couldn't leave without trying the croissants (the main reason I came XD). I didn't like the red velvet one. ""Red velvet"" doesn't really have a taste; it's kind of just the color from food coloring, but I like it for the cream cheese frosting. So the red velvet croissant tasted like a normal croissant but the cream cheese filling was a little too savory instead of sweet for my taste. The birthday cake one is so pretty and delicious, but my favorite is the creme brûlée one. The croissant was very sweet and crunchy but was balanced out by the cream filling. I'd definitely recommend this place!!!",,,
39,Monica M.,"O'Fallon, Saint Louis, MO",257,427,732,5.0,3/9/2018,"Love the concept of Union Fare. Several stations where you can get anything from a sandwich to a donut or entree like salmon and rice. There is definitely a little bit of everything for everyone. Went here and went to the entree station and had salmon with veggies and couscous I believe. It was a huge portion and was delicious. You get it in a lunch line style then go to the checkout area. After, you go to the dining area which is very rustic chic and find a place to sit. It seemed very clean and they even had a bar. Love this place, great for lunch! Will definitely be back when in the area.",2,,1
40,Clint H.,"Brooklyn, NY",338,465,45,3.0,5/15/2018,"This place is 3.5 stars and I think that´s about as fair as can be here.One of my oldest friends had her cousin in town visiting from Switzerland, and I had my friend in town visiting from Milano, so we decided to get the friends together with other friends and brunch it up. My friend picked the spot and I´d never been so I said why not. The layout is really cool, sort of like a cafe in the front restaurant in the back set up. And it´s HUGE. From the outside it doesn´t look that big but my god is it big when you get inside. I think it goes all the way to the other street! Plenty of room. There were a lot of tables this Saturday afternoon but it wasn´t super packed, which is why i found it so strange our server wasn´t very good. It felt like she forgot about us a few times. It´s fine. Onto the food, etc.So I have a thing about brunch: your brunch place needs to have pitchers of mimosa available to buy. Not all brunch places do, but they should. If I go to the your brunch place, and it doesn´t have that available (as this place does NOT) your food will have to make up the balance with my yelp review, because now I have to order a mimosa one at a time like some alien from another planet. I´m from NYC, aka planet Brunch, and I want my mimosa pitcher! They didn´t have one, so i got one glass of mimosa. Ok. Their loss. Food wise I got the goat cheese omelette and their breakfast potatoes. Those potatoes were really good, and though my goat cheese omelette was kind of plain (it was literally eggs with goat cheese inside, and a side salad) it went well with my potatoes. My boy from Milano got the eggs benedict, which they serve three ways, one of which is with lobster. he said it was very good. Actually everyone seemed to really enjoy their food. Mine was fine. Nothing to go crazy about. I found their brunch menu a bit lacking. I guess I was expecting more brunch staples? It´s not a bad spot, but if I can´t get a pitcher or carafe of mimosa, I can just have brunch in Brooklyn in one of the places close by me...where I know the food is really good.",,,

This is really the spot.Know this:1. Make a reservation if you want but there can be little to no wait depending on the time.2. Everything is Instagram worthy. 3. The breakfast mac and cheese is definitely one of the must get dishes. 4. Our tater tots were a little cold... which was questionable.5.

42,Anna T.,"New York, NY",25,29,3,1.0,3/31/2018,"I [used to] visit Union Fare often during the week for lunch because I work in the area. About 6 weeks ago they had some issue with their POS system, and my card was charged repeatedly for an $18 salmon dish - racking up over $1500 in charges. The same thing happened to my coworker, over multiple days and on different cards, so I'm sure we're not the only ones affected. When I brought it to their attention, the manger acted as if I was burdening him and wasting his time. No attempt to make it right. Weeks later I am STILL fighting with my credit card company to get the dozens and dozens of charges reversed as fraudulent. So I guess, if you must go to this place, and I recommend that you do not, bring cash, because they apparently they don't know how to work a credit card machine.And if you've visited in the past 2 month or so, check your statements!!!",1,,

It's a large venue with beautiful decor.  We ordered the ricotta toast, avocado toast, and the kimchi ribs for appetizer. Everything was good but the ricotta toast was AMAZING! The ricotta toast is a must order. For entrees we got a fish, filet steak, a salad, and a turnip soup that was part of the specials offered that day. Everything was pretty good but out of our entrees I have to say the turnip soup was a standout. It was creamy and full of flavor.We were stuffed but still trooped on to order dessert! We got the cheesecake and the cracker jack ice cream sundae. Wow the sundae, so simple but so good!Overall we had a great experience and would recommend if you're in the area or looking for a dinner place with friends.",,,
47,John S.,"Queens, NY",159,49,2,3.0,6/2/2018,"Its hard to rate this place because its kind of a coffee shop, bakery, food hall, restaurant, and bar all at once depending on what time of the day you go there.Every single pastry is unbelievably sweet so don't plan on ordering more than one.  They have recently become popular for their filled croissants which to me all last basically the same.  They are literally the sweetest dessert I've found.Its a great place to get coffee and work before 3pm because you can kind of sit anywhere and its not super loud. The coffee is really expensive but worth if when you consider than you can basically occupy space and connect to the wifi for seeming as long as you wish uninterrupted. Ive only had the tacos from the ""food hall"" which is not a food hall at all, your options are poke, hamburgers, tacos, and thats pretty much it. the tacos weren't particularly memorable",,,

Updated review","Union fare is a massive place and we had a reservation thankfully. We were initially sat at a bar table but asked for a normal table and were reseated.

It took forever to get out grain bowl main and sausage. Maybe an off day but they were very busy.",2,,

Updated review","I came back for more delicious food and was not disappointed.  The only issue I had this time was the individuals at the hostess stand.  Even though I made a reservation I was told for 30 minutes my table was being prepared.  Just be honest and tell me the table isn't ready.  I can handle waiting but to be told your table is being cleaned off, prepared or almost ready when in fact none of that's true is obnoxious.",2,1,1

The barrata salad was EVERYTHING. The short ribs were perfectly seasoned and tender.For my entree I had pasta and veggies - can't remember the menu name for it. It was ""meh"". I'd definitely go back and try other menu items. I'm especially interested in trying out their brunch. The restaurant is huge.

52,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,5.0,3/14/2017,"I really really enjoyed this place!! Came here on a Friday night with 3 friends. Easily made a reservation on open table. The space is sprawling, chic, and lively. We were seated once our entire party arrived. The menu has so many yummy options on it, it was hard to decide what to get! We ended up each choosing an appetizer to share and each choosing our own entree. We shared the poké (one of my favorites!), the chili ribs (savory, fell off the bone but spicy), the ricotta toast with truffles and honey (so great!!), and the grilled octopus. Portion sizes are perfect to share with 4 people because the toast and ribs come in a serving of 4. For our entrees, three of us got the lobster fettuccine, and one got the short ribs. Portions were big! After our appetizers, I was stuffed and actually took a good amount of my pasta home! The short ribs were not finished either. The ribs came with pita, and they even packed extra pita for me in my to go box without me asking. The pasta came with an entire lobster tail, and it was so delicious and fresh!! Finally, the most important thing to get is their famous chocolate opera dessert with caramel cage. It's brought out with such a show and has a candle lit underneath. The cake itself is not huge, and the caramel isn't the best thing to actually eat, but it's so cool and fun to have! Quite unique. We also each ordered a cocktail and shared a bottle of wine. Total price came out to around $120 per person including tax and tip, which is definitely pricey, but we really got so much quality food with fresh ingredients! (The seafood tower starter was so tempting to get as well but super pricey at either $20 or $40 per person depending on the one you choose.) Overall, yummy and unique food! Great for a special occasion or going with a group. Somewhat pricey but totally worth it. Only flaw of the night was the waiter was slightly rude at one point when I was trying to take pictures of my food while he was serving us, and apparently I was in his way while he was putting a plate down...I look over it because the food was that tasty",,,

54,Lauren P.,"Manhattan, NY",21,119,149,4.0,3/13/2017,We tried as many pastries as possible because there were four of us and everything looked delicious. Fruity pebble croissant - this was the best pick out of the 8 items we ordered. It was sweet and a little bit overwhelming but perfect to share with someone else and very photogenic. The fruity pebbles add a nice crunch to the flaky pastry.Crem brûlée croissant - this was the next best. Very sweet and sticky. The inside is very creamy and we had to take some of the cream out because it was too filled.Red velvet croissant - this was way too sweet. I bit into the center where all the icing was and I almost got sick instantly. Very sugary and very creamy inside.Matcha green tea cookie - the lady told us this would be the best but it was dry and hard. Almost stale tasting.Strawberry donut hole - this was disappointing. The donut part was great but the center strawberry filling was tart and too sour. Ham and cheese roll - yum this was delicious. Perfect amount of cheese and ham and it was nice and warm and soft. It looks small but it is enough to share with someone.Spinach and feta croissant - nice saviry croissant. Not too cheesy and not too much spinach in the middle. Could use more to fill it in the center. They were very stingy with the filling compared to all the cream that's in the sweet croissants.Black and white cookie - this was okay. I've had much better elsewhere. It tastes more like cake than anything else.If you are making a trip here I would recommend the fruity pebble croissant and then ordering stuff from the restaurant menu. I will be back to try the menu food because it looked amazing while we were in the cafe and watching people's orders come out. The ambiance is really nice. It is a little pricey. But that's what you should expect at a trendy place in NYC.,,,
55,Amanda K.,"Great Neck, NY",0,4,6,2.0,8/20/2017,Came for brunch- ambiance is cool and the Bloody Mary was strong. where they go wrong is the food - for an empty restaurant (there were maybe 6 other tables filled for 11:30 brunch) the food should be executed nicely. We ordered the 20 dollar brunch bowl with eggs over easy. The eggs were completely over cooked- no runny yolk. Getting eggs right for a brunch dish is pretty much necessary. The chicken in the bowl was good- but I didn't find the dish any better than a burrito bowl at chipotle. We also ordered the loaded tater tots. The cheese was on the bottom of the tater tots (?) so it was like stuck to the bowl? Very weird. And the sour cream on top was hardened. Will maybe return if I'm in the area to grab one of their pretty photogenic croissants but other than that there are cheaper and better brunch bowls in the city.,1,,

We ordered the main bread basket for the table. The rainbow croissant and the cinnamon bun were the standouts. I love me some Cinnabon and this one was at par or even a bit better than that. The banana bread was a little try for my taste though. We got the smash board for the table (pictured). All of these were great but the avocado was the favorite at the table.Finally the chicken and waffles were decent. Not my favorite as the waffles were a bit soggy, but not a bad dish. I'd be back for the smashed because I love opened faced things. $80 for four people, not bad.",1,,

I got the popular smash plates - strawberry and banana, prosciutto with parmesan cheese and basil, and avocado, tomato and radish.The prosciutto smash came without the basil and there was so much cheese I couldn't finish it. The avocado was okay, but my favorite was surprisingly the sweet banana/strawberry one.I also got the baked eggs which were just okay - one egg was overcooked and the center was completely solid.The restaurant does not serve pastries so after finishing, we headed to the back and found the cafe take-out next door and decided to try the red velvet croissant. It was creamy inside and the croissant part tasted like red velvet!

59,Alan L.,"New York, NY",115,1,0,1.0,1/14/2018,"We ate in the casual portion of the restaurant for dinner.  The service is non existent.  You have to wave down the servers to get their attention.  They did not proactively check on us at all.  The service is not why I am giving a one star review.The food is the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant in the five boroughs of New York.  Yes including diner and fast food.  I have never written a review on Yelp because I will have a satisfactory experience relative to expectations at every restaurant I eat at.  This is the only time where there has been such a disparity between expectation and experience that I find the need to warn others about how horrible this food it.We ordered truffle fries, calamari, salmon poke, sausage shrimp and fingerling potato skillet, and their steak frittes.  The truffle fries were pre made and sitting under a non working heat lamp.  It still took them 15 minutes to bring it over and they were cold.  The calamari was okay but the dipping sauce that was included was just straight mayonnaise.  It wasn't seasoned or touched up; it was straight mayonnaise.  The Salmon Poke was inedible.  Poor cuts of raw salmon that were not trimmed properly and salad ingredients that were not fresh and would make a Chop't salad taste gourmet.  The ""shrimp sausage and potato skillet"" was 99% potato and 1% shrimp and sausage.  The sauce they used was tasteless.  The $38 steak frittes was completely unseasoned and not marinated.  They were kind enough to cut the steak for you but otherwise I would rather eat a steak at any diner in NY.I can say that we always finish our food stamps pretty much every restaurant we go to and we never have many complaints because we generally know what to expect at different grades of restaurants.  This place was priced as if it were a real restaurant meanwhile it was worse than an Applebee's.  We didn't finish more than a quarter of any dish because the food was just that bad.I strongly doubt we will return to try out the full service dining area in time before this place closes down.",1,,

The truffle and honey combo is fantastic.  Add the ricotta and it's a winner.

A little heavy on the sauce but definitely enjoyed it. GET THIS. - Grilled Skirt Steak - perfect dish to share.  Presentation also on point. - Opera Cake (dessert) - GET THIS.  It's straight out of your insta-dreams (and tastes good too).  It's a delectable chocolate/hazelnut cake that comes out in a huge caramel bird-cage type shell.  Cardamom ice cream is also a nice touch.",2,1,1

65,Nati Y.,"New York, NY",0,44,4,4.0,6/16/2018,"I was in Union Square on Saturday and needed a place to eat a late lunch whilst running errands. On the outside, there's a mystique about Union Fare. There's not a huge sign outside or an outdoor seating area to indicate this is a spacious restaurant. Its cafeteria-sized dining room is well-lit and well decorated. I noticed the consistency of the decor as I went downstairs to the restroom; the basement floor has a lounge area. Depending on the time of day, it has a blend of a cafe, restaurant, and or lounge vibe. The menu is quite diverse with a steak, sushi, and salad offerings. As a party one, I quickly sat at the bar (there are two bar areas) located in the backside of the restaurant. The female bartender didn't seem overly enthused that I was a party of one. She managed to pause the personal conversation she was having with another waiter to greet me with a glass of water. She did answer my menu questions with much knowledge. I decided to go forward with the hanger steak cooked rare. My hanger steak was cooked to perfection and had the right amount of seasoning. The reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is because I had to consistently ask another waiter/bartender to refill my water glass. The female bartender didn't seem to care if my water needed to be refilled. If you decide to eat dinner here, I'd recommend the hanger steak coupled with french fries. Delicious!",,,

Our waitress was handling too many tables; she never checked in unless we flagged her down and a few times forgot to bring us things we asked for. Although I understand that it is difficult to charge 6 people individually, she tried to convince us to split the check evenly, saying it would come out nearly the same as if she charged each person what they ordered. This was far from the truth (entrees we ordered ranged between $14-24) but we had been waiting on her to bring us the check for so long that we just agreed to it. Honestly I would have preferred if she had truthfully said ""I'm running around like crazy, do you mind if I split this evenly?"" Sure, no worries.

Here is what we ordered: Burrata and fig salad- super hearty salad, the burrata was creamy Grilled Octopus- grilled to perfection and I loved the kalamata aioli. Ahi Tuna melt- *MUST GET*. Omg the bread was cut super thin almost like a buttery bagel crisp. The tuna was scrumptious with the melted provolone!! Sweet chili ribs- *MUST GET*these are finger licking good!! The spicyness is perfect and the meat just falls off the bone. So incredible. Grilled skirt steak- my boyfriend loved it, I thought it was just ok. I think there probably were more creative entrees on the menu. It was served with chimichurri sauce...felt like I could have gotten this anywhere. But it was still good! Cheesecake nest- looked just like a birds nest. The cheesecake was shaped like eggs and the phyllo was the nest. I personally am not a huge fan of white chocolate but a must try if you are a fan! Opera cake- the presentation was stunning. It arrived in this caramel drizzle dome that you had to lift up to reveal the cake. It definitely had the wow effect. All in all, it was one of the best dining experiences. The staff was always refilling our waters, and making sure we were happy. I'm planning my next visit!",,,
70,Veronica B.,"Manhattan, NY",567,41,90,5.0,5/24/2017,"Came here during Happy Hour after graduating to start the night off with some drinks + appetizers. Our bartender, Tuli (sp?), was super welcoming, incredibly friendly and just seemed like an all-around chill person to talk to and get to know. He mentioned his younger brother ended up graduating the same week and gave us a complimentary pineapple shot that was delicious--must ask what it was and go back for it soon! :)Drinks were great, appetizers delish. Got the Vegetable Tempura and Fried Artichoke that were available for HH. The sauces that came with the dishes were really tasty + definitely notable (apparently secret recipes that are made specifically for pairing food).",,,2
71,Gabrielle D.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",536,9,4,5.0,2/22/2018,"So I came here for brunch fairly hungover, which was not smart cause everything on the menu looked insanely delicious. I thought ordering eggs would be smart. FALSE. Started with the smashes, OMG the burrata one was to die for if you don't get it, you're doing everything wrong.I then ordered eggs in a nest. Interesting combo of food. Personally I thought there were too many crunchy potatoes in the dish. Mushrooms were an odd vegetable to have incorporated into the dish. It was still delish though. Would have been better if I wasn't hungover.But remember you didn't really eat at Union Fare if you didn't get a croissant",,,
72,Sam K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",134,190,351,3.0,6/3/2017,"Went here for a work dinner, as it's close to our office in union square. I've walked in here for lunch and been so confused by the set up that I've walked out, so I though this as our dinner selection was a little weird.We were a group of 6, and we were seated at a high top table wedged up against the bar, leaving little room for people to walk past, and made it difficult for us to get in and out of the table.With our big group, we were able to try a lot of different things- for apps we did Ricotta toast with truffles (I say this is the number 1 item we ordered- so try it!), the chili ribs, the burrata and some oysters. Everything was tasty and plates were cleared.For mains, the steak was a big hit, and I did the roasted chicken in pea mash which was juicy and flavorful (would order again). The Brussels sprouts were selfish too as a veggie side!Desserts were super weird. We got a chocolate cake and it came out covered in a sugar dome (I'm sure this is all for Instagram) that 3 of us tried to break apart by hitting it with our spoons to get to the cake.. and we ordered the cheesecake which was presented as 3 cheesecake eggs on this nest of something inedible- so really wasn't getting the theme here (again maybe for insta?).Overall atmosphere was not my favorite,food was good, and skip the desserts!",,,
73,Andy K.,"Atlanta, GA",538,52,123,4.0,3/26/2017,"Union Fare was one of the most recommended restaurants from my colleagues when I was in NYC. Out of the diverse menu selection, I was informed that the pastries were a must-try. Therefore, I gave it shot - actually, gave more than one pastry a try, ordering 3 different pastries with the Creme Brûlée Croissant being our first. It was far the best one. It was generously filled with creamy and sweet fillings. I would definitely order it again next time I visit the restaurant.We also ordered the Fruity Pebble Croissant to spread out the sweat, creamy to fruity as well.  Not only was it delicately fruity, the pebbles added a unique, crunch taste to the overall pastry. In addition to the fruity pastry, we also ordered the Birthday Cake Croissant - which... actually was way below the definition of appetizing. It absolutely broke the rhythm of tastiness throughout the night. Don't get it.For the small plates, we orddered the Breakfast Mac and Cheese which definitely had to be the second highlight of the night. Cheesy and delicious, impeccable. We also ordered the tater tots but it was rather quite bland. It just tasted like.. normal tater tots. Service was great and the prices are fairly on the higher end - which makes sense for a classy, modern atmosphere restaurant with elegant dishes. An unfortunate 4/5 for the taste of food not being consistent - make sure to order the right things and you'll leave happy without any regrets.",1,1,1
74,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",59,467,2648,4.0,10/28/2016,"Got brunch here, and left somewhat conflicted. For example, the food was good, but the service was pretty bad. (I usually don't even care to mention service, even when it's bad, but this was really bad.) We spent more than I would have wanted to for brunch, but in retrospect we didn't actually need to -- the portions are enormous, and you could get out cheaply if you know that going in.That all being said, I care most about the food, and the food was very good. We got three smashes (burrata, avocado, and strawberry & banana), two of which I absolutely loved, and one that I wasn't a big fan of. (The strawberry & banana had almond butter on it, which I'm not a big fan of.) We also got the chicken & carrot cake waffles, which were great, and the silver dollar pancakes, which were good, and surprisingly came with a huge piece of cotton candy on top.Overall, a mixed experience, but really good food always wins in the end (for me, anyway).",,,1
75,Jennie C.,"New York, NY",53,354,492,5.0,6/22/2016,"Love!!!! The only drawback was the bathroom downstairs is so dark I couldn't see the W for women's also a bit confusing because there is sign that says gentleman with an arrow but not signage saying ladies/women just a big W on the door but like I said so dark down there can't see anything.Now back to the point...Bottle of rose (Côte de roses) nice and dry a great roseHomemade ricotta toast: holy snaps this was amazing. Sliced truffle over ricotta and honey is heaven sent! Def order this as a starter!Fried artichoke with lettuce and anchovies: YUM! The mustard vinaigrette dressing was super delish. Tastes like a Caesar salad, sort of.Eggs and shrooms? I think it was called: had mushrooms over wild rice with a poached egg. This dish was phenomenal but a little salty. I forget how good wild rice is, it's SO good!  Garganelli: with lamb ragu was also super delish! Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and lamb was not gamey. Seared black bass: presentation presentation presentation!!! And tasted just as pretty as it was plated! Roasted cauliflower: as good as roasted cauliflower could taste lol. Melted cheese (raclette) on the head with some red sauce underneath (romesco) and tasted like it was marinated in some sort of vinegary sauce. All the components tasted great but at the end of the day it is still just a giant cauliflower head. And for dessert we struggled to pick just one but ended up deciding on the strawberry creamsicle and it did NOT disappoint! Omg it was amazing! Every last bit of it was inhaled within seconds. Sweet but not itchy throat sweet and refreshing not heavy. A great way to end the meal. The most perfect dessert for me. I love fruit and am not a chocolate lover or of all things too sweet. Service: TWO THUMBS UP!! We were always being checked on but not annoyingly so. Everyone that worked there was amazing and nice and attentive. One other drawback, hard to find host station which is in the middle of the space between the two entrances (17th street for cafe and 18th for restaurant, but just looks like one giant room) really weird set up, there was no one to greet or help us we walked all the to one side then back to the middle and had to ask a bus boy where the host was.Not cheap but worth it. Amazing food, amazing chill ambience (can get noisy during dinner because of patrons, but music was at a medium level), amazing service. DONT SKIP DESSERT!",3,,1
76,Mike T.,"New York, NY",225,98,29,4.0,11/28/2017,"This place is both massive and self-decidedly hip. But that's not a bad thing, since you'll be hard-pressed to find a better-looking restaurant in Union Square, with both its endless array of mood-inducing string lighting and across-the-board attractive and friendly waitstaff.I came here during Thanksgiving Dinner since I wasn't down to quell family arguments with my pant-dropping rendition of Adele's Hello, and I was quite struck to see how expansive their menu was. Rather then opt-in for their obligatory turkey offering, I reluctantly went in for the chorizo carbonara. Yes, this is blasphemous on so many levels, but I was still juicin' off a high from their unique appetizer offering of truffle ricotta toast (go ahead and order it, it's that good). And if you like your pasta spicy, you'll also enjoy the chorizo carbonara.",,,
77,Javonne M.,"Manhattan, NY",33,52,6,4.0,3/9/2018,"Stopped in to see why the place is usually crowded after working hours, and was not disappointed.  The cod, the cauliflower, and carrot cake made my night and I'll continue to stop in!

78,Martha M.,"Manhattan, NY",140,39,0,3.0,1/30/2018,"It was ok. The big salads are big. My one friend loved her corn and my one friend hated the Caesar. Said it wasn't a traditional Caesar. I got the Asian steak but they were out of steak so had shrimp. Who runs out of steak at 7pm? In the middle of union square? Go to fing stop and shop. It was mostly carrots, dressing and shrimp. The Asian noodles were chill. The staff was fucking rude. Wouldn't seat us until I called as I was literally stuck on the M track and finally got service when I got off and was like you wouldn't seat my 2 friends because the M train is a piece of shit. I texted to tell them I was late because of it. Needless to say they weren't welcoming the rest of the night.I hear the croissants are good. Try that.",,,
79,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,1273,1201,3.0,5/7/2017,"After hearing about this restaurant opening and hearing how good it was, my friends and I decided to give it a try. We had no trouble making a reservation on OpenTable and when we got there, I immediately saw why: the place is enormous. There are 2 bars. What restaurant has 2 bars? Anyway, it was nice because that meant lots of seats. This place is REALLY trying hard for a super NYC uber trendy vibe. They want people to come here to be seen. That's the type of place they are striving to be. It was a bit much to be honest. This is also a restaurant were you can't be seated until your entire party is there, so once everyone arrived we got our table. The service is a bit spotty and it took a while for a server to come to take our order. The menu is pretty well rounded if you eat meat. If you don't you are stuck with salads and very uninspired entrees. We split the beet salad which was actually quite interesting! In fact, I think the salads and appetizers looked more interesting than any of the entrees. Back to the salad: there were beets with radish ribbons and a cheese that had been shaved into a flower formation. There were also edible herbal flowers on top of the salad. It was great! The cheese paired perfectly with the beets and radishes and then flowers complimented the salad perfectly. We were all a little bit wary of the flowers, having never really eaten.....well, flowers before. But it was great!I ordered the cauliflower entree and it was literally a head of roasted cauliflower that had maybe been soaked in some sort of vinegar with rachlette cheese and a romenesco sauce smeared on the plate. The cheese didn't really go with the dish and just didn't add anything. The romenesco was delicious and imperative to the dish because without it, it would have been like eating dry crackers: impossible to swallow. Overall, it was fine but a pretty boring dish. Would have been better off as a side. My other friend who got the same dish agreed. My friends who ordered the chicken seemed to like their so perhaps this restaurant does meat dishes better. I probably wouldn't come back here for dinner. There are so many delicious options that they could put on the menu for vegetarians. It's a little embarrassing for them that this is the best they can do...I might try the brunch because it seems the reviews for that are quite good. If this place works on their menu a bit, improves their service, and makes their dishes worth the prices on the menu....it could be something. They need to focus less on being such an ""it"" restaurant and improve quality.",,,

84,Stephanie S.,"Miami, FL",469,416,820,1.0,10/8/2017,"Stopped in here yesterday and was super disappointed. It was about 4:30pm and we were hoping to try their different flavored croissants. Upon arrival, we were told that all of them had already sold out except for their green tea, which there was a huge stack of. We are not fans of green tea flavored items, and were very bummed. Considering the stack of this flavor left, I am surprised that they wouldn't make more of an effort to make more of the other flavors. Needless to say, we left without trying these croissants. Maybe another day.",,,

To start, my friend and I got the duck egg and shrooms, which was to die for! The mushrooms and grits were actually inside a hollowed out / mashed squash. The entire squash was edible (skin too), but the best part was definitely the grits + mushrooms. It was topped with a poached duck egg that we broke and let the yolk drip into the grits. Such a unique and yummy starter!For my entree, I got the house-made fusilli with lamb ragu. I don't normally really like lamb, but this lamb ragu was very tasty! I didn't think that the taste was too pungent (which I normally do with lamb), and I really enjoyed the al dente homemade fusilli pasta... totally cleaned my dish!The vibe of this place is very hip--good music and a nice way to kick off the weekend! I with the servers were a little bit nicer, but no red flags.Random, but the bathroom (downstairs) is very cool!

96,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1266,914,3.0,1/6/2017,"Usually when you go to a food hall you can expect some type of unified decor with lots of different vendors selling all sorts of food.  Union Fare however has a slightly different philosophy.  This beautiful space has several different counters you can go to with foods ranging from Tex Mex to burgers to pizza (and even a full bar) but they are not all name brands or outposts of restaurants.  Instead all the food here is united under the banner of Union Fare, and that helped draw me in.The space is absolutely gorgeous, with some large communal tables and other smaller two person tables.  The main area with all the food has some seating, but a majority of it is on the other side of a wall (which you get to via a doorway in the middle).  This is the section the full bar is located in.  Rest rooms are downstairs in a lounge like area.  This space could easily be used for a fancy, upscale restaurant.I decided to try a veggie burger on this visit.  Each counter is separated into different lines.  I ordered and I have to say, it might be because of the lunch time rush but the guys cooking the burgers and pizzas looked like they were absolutely exhausted.  They weren't rude, but they were not exactly giving off an energetic vibe either.  That said, my burger and sweet potato fries were made relatively quickly.  I walked over to the cashiers, paid and went over to the other side of the wall to grab a seat.The atmosphere was very cafeteria like, in a somewhat upscale sort of way.  My burger was...okay.  I've had a lot of veggie burgers in the last year and this one probably rates around #9 or 10 in my top 10.  It was by no means bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  Sadly, the sweet potato fries were disappointing.  They had neither the sweetness or saltiness you expect of ;them.  Instead they were rather bland.Overall my visit to Union Fare was more pleasnat for the atmosphere and scenery than the actual food.  I will go back however as I am curious about some of the other offerings.",1,,

Ate in the restaurant at the bar.Good: Our bartender. She was nice and very fast. Our martinis were great.Bad: Management. I don't know what it is with entitled managers in New York. If you have such an issue with bartenders making a drink specifically to YOUR needs over a CUSTOMERS needs, why don't you just get behind the bar then? We asked for martinis in a specific way (skipping details) and the manager made the bartender pour out the drink and start over to make it HIS way. (?) Sir, customer is always right. You also just wasted booze. We felt bad, we told the bartender she was right, she then remade the drink for a THIRD time the way we asked for in the first place. Bless her. She didn't need to do that.It made us so uncomfortable the way this bartender was treated. The manager (short, round, bald head with a ponytail somehow) needs a wake up call.

They refused to move our table despite there being open ones in the other room. They gave him a chair... but come on. Who wants to sit in benches anyway?Strike 2: after 15 mins the waiter came over and to take our order. we said we needed a little more time for mains but put in drinks... another 15s mins went by. before he checked in again. way to long. strike 3: ordered food and after an hour it didnt come. AN HOUR. after compaining to the manager he came over and said ill give you all prosecco. We said no thanks we dont want to drink anymore, if you could comp this round that would be great... he said OK! then he came over with pastries. oh how nice we thought... pastries on top of the drinks. they must feel bad.strike 4: bill comes and drinks arent comped. He said oh my manager said no, so i gave you the patries instead. Oh yea that makes TOTAL sense. $20 pastries in liu of the $80 in prosecco you just offered. Also just like be transparent... tell us that instead of just putting it on the bill. strike 5: my friend say the pastries and wanted a different flavor, we went up and asked to exchange it. They wouldnt. Ok, can you just throw us another since weve been here for 2 hours now and the serice sucked. Nope they said. We cant just go GIVING out pastries. But you offered us prosecco, then took that back, and now we are here asking you to make it right. They didnt care. Literally no concept of customer service there. I would give this place one star, but the food WAS pretty good. Waffles were dry though. They just need to learn to communicate better. This is NYC, you need to rely on customer retention or you will burn fast in this town. You cant think your huge space is going to survive on your fun croissants alone. Im no mathematician but it doesn't add up to me. DO yourselves a favor yelpers. Get the croissants to go, and have your food elsewhere, there's a ton of great places in this city.

It was an uninventive menu that lacked flavor or excitement. Too bad because the ambience and space could make this a dependable ""go-to"", like ""Fig and Olive"" which is as basic as they come, but at least the food never disappoints.(The ricotta and sausage toasts were good. The Tuna Tataki salad was far too salty. The Steak Salad was bland and the meat portion was far too small for the price. The donuts and ""coffee"" mousse were good as well, but not amazing.)Would have given this place 3 stars if it weren't for the absurd prices they charge for lackluster dishes.",,,
106,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",183,236,300,5.0,12/10/2016,"I really enjoyed this place. The food is very good (enjoyed every dish I received: (1) some sort of truffle and ricotta toast (wow!), (2) grilled octopus (yum!), (3) homemade fusilli w lamb ragu (solid), and (4) coconot sorbet (yowza!)) and the space is absolutely amazing. I tried the main restaurant but there's also a nice bar spot and a more casual side within the restaurant as well. Such a combination of ""areas"" may seem odd but it works. Mainly because the space is HUGE!!! Union Fare is buzzing throughout the night and the crowd is definitely hip (leaning professional of course). I think this is an ideal place to come to with a group of friends and colleagues. I will most definitely try the casual food experience on my next visit to New York. Thank you Union Fare!My friends all agreed re: this bullish assessment.Were it possible, I would probably rate as 4.75 stars because of one hiccup: the service isn't as fast as it could be. This is more of a quibble though so I didn't feel a knockdown to 4 starts was merited at all. I also suspect that this dimension will continue to improve due to ""learning by doing"" effects. Also, to be clear: (1) the staff were, universally nice (great!) and (2) slight slowness may be part of the bargain with a place that is so large and so packed. Right? Life is full of trade-offs.",1,,

108,Katie H.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1239,688,492,4.0,10/21/2016,"Genuinely surprised at the low ratings for Union Fare since I had a pretty great experience there earlier this week. I've been to their more casual market next door for their over-the-top stuffed croissants (which are equally as good) and have been meaning to try their restaurant for ages.Inside is beautiful. It's a more gastrohall feel with low lighting light-bulbs hanging from the ceiling which makes for a trendy, intimate feel. I didn't do my usual research beforehand since I just came back from a trip to Ireland and purely relied on the waitress' recommendations which sometimes is the best route to go (esp in this case). We ended up ordering a few plates to share and were pleased with all of them!Ricotta Toast topped with Shaved Truffles, Honey and Pollen: AN ABSOLUTE MUST. This was the best ricotta toast I've ever had in my life. I would order this appetizer a million times again. For those curious about the pollen, it's a very subtle note in case you're worried.Summer Peach Salad: Very refreshing, light and packed full of flavor. Mixed inside was hummus, quinoa, cashews, tahini and we chose to add the extra falafel (you should too).Burrata: Can't ever go wrong with this option. They give you a pretty generous portion paired with a nice medley of watermelon, pepitas, heirloom tomatoes and a sweet yet tart balsamic drizzle. The burrata has a nice thick skin and once you crack it open, there's a wave of silky smooth cheese. Fusilli with Lamb Ragu: The flavor was great. I love that their Fusilli is in-house and it emited a very hearty, home-cooked feel. To be honest, the texture was a bit off for me regarding the lamb. It was almost too stringy in nature which we both agreed was an off-putting component to the dish. Nonetheless, still a good option.All in all, I had a fantastic experience at Union Fare. I really gravitate towards the dishes they offer on their menu. They're creative and hit home with the flavor pairings/combinations. I wish I had the room to try their desserts since I know how popular those are! But alas, I'll be back!",6,3,8
109,Shu Jin S.,"New York, NY",129,880,5,3.0,7/30/2017,"We wanted something sweet, and came here for a late night dessert. We walked-in around 9pm on a Friday evening and were seated right away. Got both chocolate desserts off the menu, and the opera cake was Ah-mazing.

110,Shah B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,9,0,3.0,2/24/2018,I've been here many times and the food is fine. But they wouldn't sit me on the gastropub side on a Saturday even though it was completely empty.

The decor is spectacular as was the food. We split a fruity pebbles croissant... damn! That thing was heavenly. I split the seasonal market Tagine and the brunch bowl with a friend. LOVED the brunch bowl, the market tagine was more or less an omelet but was decent as well. Other friends split three smashes which they really liked. The only thing lacking was service. Our server was new, so I guess he got a pass, but they really should have had someone more experienced helping him out. Will certainly be back for more!",3,1,1

116,Louise D.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",3,7,0,1.0,11/12/2017,"Pretty weird and bad experience here today. Went for a late-ish brunch (1:30p) with four other friends expecting a nice, headache free, time. Other reviews of the place are great so we weren't expecting any problems. Boy, were we wrong. We were seated at 1:30 and our table went unacknowledged by any server or staff member until at least 2pm. We had to get a waitress' attention as she was walking by and asked if we could order. So blah blah we ordered iced coffees, a few drinks, and our food. Our water glasses were empty so we asked for refills. One would think the beverages would come out in under 5 mins. But no. It was a solid 25 minutes later before my friend got her glass of rosé. And that's all they brought out!!! Not even the water! Or the ice coffees which literally take 1 second to prepare! So we obviously said something and it was weird because they didn't seem very apologetic. At this point It was probably 40 mins before we even had our waters refilled. The coffees finally came as did the other drink. The ""smashes"" came out too and they were good but my friend pointed out that she  could easily get that at any other restaurant. Agreed. So waiting waiting waiting my friend has to be somewhere by 4 and it's now almost 3pm. A 1:30 brunch should have been no problem. Finally they bring out our ""orders"". But no not really. My one friend got her breakfast bowl no problems. Then they brought out a side of scrambled eggs and a side of fried eggs. And an ""eggs any style"" with poached eggs. Problem! We didn't order an ""eggs any style"" with poached eggs. It's honestly not even worth me explaining what we ordered and what they served us but they got 4/5 dishes wrong. And my friend ordered something that came with olives but olives were not listed on the menu. Definitely an ingredient that should be disclosed at the onset. The food wasn't even that good. Ketchup tasted weird and tater tots were too fried and oily. We were clearly mad and disappointed and after complaining a few times we had our whole meal comped. Good. They kept blaming it on the kitchen being backed up but it literally wasn't even crowded  so it made no sense. Also we were not the only table having problems. We saw the table behind us making similar complaints to their waitress as well. Very disappointed. Will NOT be returning.",2,,
117,Katrina D.,"New York, NY",0,12,3,1.0,7/28/2018,Absolutely horrendous service and not great food. My pizza came raw and my friend's eggs were sitting in a pool of water and the waiter gave us a hard time about sending them back. Also messed up our order multiple times. Would not go baxk,,,
118,Carolyn G.,"New York, NY",4,21,1,5.0,7/3/2017,"Came here for brunch and it was SO GOOD. Got two croissants, the fruity pebble and matcha. The matcha is unassuming on the outside but ridiculously good and light that doesn't make you feel awful for eating pastries. For breakfast I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was fried perfectly, have never had a more juicy chicken in my life!!! and the waffles were good especially with the chili honey. Everyone around me had the toast scrambles which are as good as they look. They take the time to make each one really beautiful and fresh looking and that really adds to the taste. Amazing presentation. The green bloody mary was really good, dont know if i would consider it a bloody mary, but whatever it was, tasted like nothing I had ever had before. Our latte was also really cute!! The latte art was a little bear. Everything they do here is for the customer experience, and they do a wonderful job to make sure that the food tastes and looks irresistible!",,,1
119,Tory G.,"Manhattan, NY",6,112,55,4.0,1/8/2017,"I came here for brunch after seeing a video of the cinnamon bun sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. It's a very trendy place and the menu has a lot of interesting breakfast options. My whole table ordered the same thing, the grapefruit mimosa and the ultimate breakfast sandwich. Both were very good, we all loved the mimosa. The sandwich was tasty as well and came with a side of bacon glaze and a side salad that I enjoyed. My one complaint would be the egg was a little bit rubbery and over cooked, I wish the yolk was a little bit runny.",,,

My friends enjoyed their salmon and shrimp salads, and I loved the steak - juicy and well-seasoned with two nice side sauces, a tangy steak sauce and flavorful chimichurri. The side of cauliflower was surprisingly delicious with a creamy sauce and cranberries. Recommend getting that especially on a cold winter night.It's a beautiful, expansive restaurant with a fun (but not rowdy), young crowd. I saw a few people celebrating birthdays who were presented with a treat under a gold bird-cage like covering, so I'd consider returning for a birthday. It would also be a great place for a large group.Service was good and food came quickly.Only negatives are that we felt a little rushed out and that I couldn't swap out fries for potatoes. But at least they had variety in the fries - waffle, curly or plain.All in all, a good experience and I'd definitely return.",,,

124,TIFFANY C.,"New York, NY",3,30,21,5.0,7/14/2017,"I had the pleasure of having a group dinner this evening and it was outstanding! This restaurant is great for groups because it's a very large open space with lots of room between tables, something seldom to be had, esp in such a hot neighborhood as union sq is. We had several vegetarians in our party and they all raved about the variety of options. For appetizers, duck egg with mushroom (a+) , tuna melt - not typical , well seasoned tuna tar tar(a+) and house made  ricotta (a+) were highly notable. We also tried the oysters, grilled octopus, which were also good.  Luckily we had a big group so we're fortunate to have tried almost everything on the menu. Everything was super fresh and well presented. For entrees the rib eye for 2 was good and came with a glutinous side of bone marrow + sautéed onions, skirt steak, and mussels were good. The vegetarian eaters had the cauliflower and pasta which I tried , both were also solid dishes. One thing I must mention is that most NY restaurants charge a lot but their portions are often too small to leave you satisfied. However at union fare , they do make sure you don't leave hungry! Aside from the food, the restaurant had really good ambiance. The decor has an industrial chic feel in a large open loft like space with floating edison bulbs all over the ceiling. I would recommend this place if you have a group dinner , date , or guests from out of town. The menu covers all types of eaters. It will not disappoint!!I will definitely return to try the brunch!",,,

I also really enjoyed the atmosphere: the restaurant was nicely decorated with a lot of space. There is plenty of seating and room at the bar. The music was different but fun.

128,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1700,2743,655,3.0,8/17/2016,"As wide as the block between 17th and 18th, this is a large, long, tall-ceilinged gastropub, complete with a couple bars, a seafood bar where the fresh catch is displayed, and lots of tables. Bathrooms downstairs share a common sink (laughing as we discovered that one) - interesting pipe/trough design, though dark. Downstairs are also two areas for larger private parties, one was open and you could see the sofas, TV, private bar for events. The other was closed off, but looked like more traditional dining tables.Check-in is in the middle of the very long restaurant. Empty when we first arrived, it really filled up on a Wednesday after 8p. Slow turnover, so even when empty, reservations may still be in order to save yourself a seat unless you are ok eating at the bar. Very loud. Be prepared not to hear people more than two seats away. Best to be side-by-side for conversations.Seated only when all the party arrived, which was a shame, we probably would've ordered more if you didn't make the poor ladies wait on their feet. Bar had a number of microbrews and wine was a decent short list.Union Fare salad - so so, average salad. The Summer Peach Salad wasn't light and citrusy - it ended up being heavier, meater with the cashews. Not exactly what we expected, but an interesting change of pace. The best part was the fresh housemade ricotta toast. Fantastic - rich, creamy, cold, and savory all at once with a touch of honey. Delightful. Roasted purple cauliflower was too heavy with the smoked raclette on it; the base spicy romesco would've been enough, I think.The lamb ragu on garganelli was a good portion, and tasty. Not too sweet, thin pasta sheets cooked al dente and just enough lamb to be tasty, but not too salty. The 32oz prime ribeye was done medium rare, and was only just - perfectly cooked for the three of us who shared it. Only a few portions of the outside edge were too salty (rare - most cooks oversalt), and didn't need the brown butter (though that was tasty, too). The french onion bone marrow would've been perfect... without the cheese. When the Italians don't put cheese on it, you shouldn't put cheese on it. Absolutely sad how that beautiful bone marrow was ruined, and we had a very French diner with us that absolutely refused to touch it.Side of duck egg & shrooms was good for a bite (too salty for much more), and the brussel sprouts & ham was a good balanced side.Service was square, when we said we'd split a few things, brought out the sharing plates and divided up salads appropriately. They were a touch on the slow side with watching for wine and water refills, but were ready whenever we ran out to suggest another bottle. Changes of dishes between courses and silverware. Overall not bad for some dishes, could be better with others - will pop back here to try different things like the spaghetti carbonara (looked good), and the Maine lobster fettuccine.",3,1,1
129,Jane S.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",55,95,180,3.0,8/13/2016,"Came here for a group dinner on a Friday night. Made a reservation through OpenTable for 6. It was a reunion of sorts, where some of us hadn't seen each other for 4, 5 years. I don't really understand the point of needing the whole party to arrive before seating a reservation. A reservation! The decor is great, the food is good, the music needs to be turned down a notch, and the service really needs work. We barely saw our waiter, and when he did come over, he wouldn't always check the whole table to see if anyone else needed something before walking away again. He also countered with me when I asked for plates when our oysters arrived. We were a table of 6, so not everyone had arm's reach to the platter. He clearly didn't see that someone would have to stand up each time and reach over several wine glasses to get an oyster. Plates in this case makes sense. Don't argue when the customer just wants plates.Lastly, the waiter took a huge amount of time to come back to get our check at the end. He took so long I started to wonder if he even wanted a tip that night. I've never had service this slow in New York before.Btw, the oysters weren't shucked well. There were pieces of broken shell in every one. Not a pleasant experience at all to get a mouthful of shell to spit out.",4,,
130,Adrienne S.,"Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan, NY",706,20,14,3.0,7/21/2016,"The reason why I only have 3 stars listed, is because I don't have much room to judge. I strictly came here, on a mission, to try their famous croissants. I walked passed a very dark restaurant and I was pretty confused because I swear I was supposed to be there according to google maps. What I didn't know is that the is a restaurant and there is a bakery on the other side of the building (17th street entrance). Every where on instagram, I've been hearing about this ""birthday cake flavor"". Now they have a green tea one, which is their year round flavor. But their brithday cake one was a seasonal thing. NOTE: they sell out fast and they will mostly be gone by after you finish work (probably to girls like me on a mission for that instagram hype picture). So I got the green tea one. Yes the crisscross was as buttery and flakey as I could ask for. Not too crunchy and not too soggy. The only think I was a bit disappointed about was the filling. The filling is made of maybe a mascarpone cream. It was a bit on the citrus (or sour... I don't know their intentions) side that I didn't really taste much of the green tea. Don't get me wrong, I didn't need any help stuffing it in my mouth and making it disappear by myself. But I think I'll be back just to try the birthday cake one and then i start my diet....",5,6,1
131,Connie L.,"New York, NY",30,337,138,2.0,7/7/2016,"For all the hype around this place I was really expecting so much more. It has a nice ambiance (minus the fact that it was super hot inside). The hanging lights (which are really popular in a lot of NYC restaurants) stretch all the way to the back, and the back is really far-this place is way bigger than I expected. I ordered the hand rolled gargenelli ($25) and my friend ordered the Maine lobster fettuccine ($29). It came out right after we ordered it. Normally fast service is good, but not when it comes to cooking food. It was clearly cooked already and just heated up. How disappointing. The taste was sub par. Pasta did not taste fresh at all, parts of it were hard (not al dente). We also got the rose sangria, which was half ice. The fresh fruit was a nice touch though. They had empty tables and no line, so I didn't understand why the servers were rushing us. I didn't feel like I could enjoy my meal. There was still food on my plate and my fork was in hand... Why are you going to ask if I'm done with my food? The cafe seems more low key with a big variety. I would come back to try that.*don't confuse this place for their cafe next door.

This place hit all my expectations with a large and welcoming atmosphere, fantastic friendly staff, and a fine selection of booze and bites at a reasonable price. What more can you ask for? Oh the music was perfect too! Welcome to the neighborhood, Im sure we will be seeing a lot of eachother :).More specifically... A few coworkers and I stopped in on Tuesday when I realized the doors were finally open for business. This place is massive with high ceilings, an open floor plan, ambient lighting, and various specialty sections along the side (coffee, raw bar, desert, cocktails, craft beer). Our lovely waitress Mary greeted us with a smile and accommodated our large group with ease, moving tables around for our convenience and being very attentive and informative. We started off with their Union Fare branded vase of sparkling water served immediately and then ordered a variety of cocktails, charcuterie, and appetizers to share. On the butchers block comes their homemade ricotta with honey and chicken moose along side a tasty serving of meat and cheeses. The appetizers were a delight- we ordered the Eggs and Shrooms, Thai Ribs, Tuna Tartare Melt, and french fries to share. Everything was served beautifully adorned and came to our table fairly quickly. After we finished up and were leaving the waitress chased us down and told us we had to stay because management was gifting us with their crazy amazing chocolate desert. This was the icing on the cake!I raved with excitement to my boyfriend and we came back the next day to sit at the craft beer bar and ordered the salmon tartare. Another pleasant experience and got to know a few other lovely staff members, bartenders Bonnie and Rich!Since I rely on Yelp to guide me to the best spots in NYC and beyond, I felt compelled to write this 5 star review for this new market, Union Fare.

We tried it out for dinner on a Saturday night and really enjoyed it.The set up is beautiful and spacious. Lighting is great and tables aren't too close together, giving the restaurant and bar a wonderful atmosphere. Despite its recent opening, the restaurant was pretty full. It's worth making a reservation but there is bar seating too.There is a diverse menu, meaning you could can for some light bites or a three course meal or anything in between. We sampled quite a few things including pink beets (beets with goats cheese and pistachio pesto in a beautiful arrangement), salmon tartare toast, sweet chilli ribs, seared black bass, a side of brussel sprouts with ham and the strawberry creamsicle for dessert. All good but dessert was a stand out for me while my husband loved the ribs. Portions are generous by New York standards.Service was great and nicely polished, particularly for a new restaurant.Some people may take exception with the prices but for a nice meal out in a lovely setting, and with a couple of drinks each, I thought it was not particularly outrageous. Union Fare is off to a great start: I'd give them a solid 4.5 stars. I am looking forward to returning to try some more items. I highly recommend checking out the restaurant; I predict it will go on to be somewhat of a hotspot in the area.",2,,1
143,J S.,"New York, NY",9,56,1,2.0,12/4/2017,"From the decor and the size of this busy place I expected much more. It's trendy loft like space and quasi modern industrial meets shabby chic decor in low lighting made me feel that the menu and the service could meet good standards. Alas not.  Staff were very disinterested and vacant. Especially the servers. Ordered steak & fries which comes as a portion for two but portion size is way too small for the price, more like a bar snack for two. Requested steak to be served medium. Steak arrived already cut up and blood soaked this was beyond raw just seared. We spent a while looking for our waitress. First a staffer came by so we explained to them they just looked vacant (no apology no cheery reassurance) they found our waitress who was also just as disinterested and snatched the steak leaving us with fries.   It took forever to get this same re-cooked steak  back (now cooked to 'well done' even though we'd asked for medium) We'd finished the fries ages ago.  Never was there any staffer who smiled nor any that apologized for this mishap.  In a city with loads of options we aren't in a hurry to return here, not impressed at all. Lack luster serving and overpriced food with little culinary skill.",,,

The space is gorgeous, the bartenders are quick, efficient, and sweet, and the snacks they had were so good, and plentiful  (I'm still dreaming of the ricotta truffle toast.) If you're looking for a great event space near union square, this is it. (The coat check was a disaster area of 5 people in a small space looking confused, but I'm going to overlook that as a small detail since it didn't really affect my enjoyment of the night)",1,,

The manger with the dirty blond hair isn't too understanding regarding what good customer service looks like and it reflects on the staff. With a 6 yr old in tow and tons of confusion amongst the stuff, I have a very hangry little person. I will update my final review after the food comes.",,,
146,Katie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,194,317,4.0,7/7/2016,"I love the ambiance here - really energetic and modern. It's loud and the food is eclectic and delicious. A couple friends and I had a girl's night and we shared a bunch of plates - snap pea toast, crispy anchovy salad, salmon tartare toast, razor clam, duck egg and mushrooms and the lobster linguine. The stand outs were the snap pea toast - so creamy and fresh! And the crispy anchovy salad was crisp and fresh with little sardines that added a nice saltiness. To be honest, the service was alright - we waited a long time to place our food order. However, once we ordered the food came out pretty quickly and was tasty. I definitely want to come back here and try to food hall and also some more of the toasts. Those were the winning dishes that everyone agreed we would order again (snap pea, salmon).",1,,
147,Erik B.,"Bayonne, NJ",116,24,3,4.0,1/19/2018,"We went there for brunch. They had our table ready at the moment our reservation was for which was great. Place was busy but they still made sure they served those that had reservations first. We sat down but it did take a good bit, maybe 15 mins, for our server to begin to serve us. The avacado toast was delicious. The steak and eggs were amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked to my desire and so juicy and tender. Enjoyed every bit of my meal. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars because the service was slow.",,,

I finally was able to make it early enough to find a full house of flavors! The red velvet looked tempting but I went for birthday cake & cheddar. I am more a savory gal than sweet, hence, cheddar. I had the cheddar there & took bday cake home for later. Cheddar was good. Didn't blow my mind but it was good. Same for the birthday cake. I was actually gappy it was not overly sweet. I thought it was gonna be more like frosting but it was more cream cheesy. Good, but didn't blow me away. Next time I want to try the cookies & cream. I didn't see ot there today but again I was filled with shock and overwhelmedness that the table was completely full of croissants for once!",,,
149,Hannah S.,"New York, NY",15,61,0,5.0,6/6/2017,"This was an amazing brunch experience. Before you get overwhelmed with all of the intriguing sounding menu options (Breakfast Mac and Cheese. Smashes. Sunshine Burger. Pastries a plenty), you just have to know that absolutely everything is good. Starting with the pastry basket filled with warm cinnamon rolls, creme pat filled bomboloni, and home made pop tarts is a sure winner but may also prevent you from eating anything else you order. While the ultimate breakfast sandwich is a sure winner in terms of uniqueness and deliciousness, the overall best in show for us was the Chicken and Waffles. Unlike other places, the chicken did not outshine the waffles (or vice versa). The chicken was crispy and the waffles were fluffy. The service was also beyond reproach. Even though we were there on a busy Saturday afternoon for brunch, our waiter apologized profusely for our coffees being late and comped them. This was unnecessary, but it was a very nice gesture and added to our overall enjoyment of the meal. Go here, and try whatever sounds good on the menu. Then plan a return trip to try everything else.",,,
150,Lisa C.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",0,16,2,4.0,5/27/2018,"Went for  brunch with my out of town guest yesterday. While the food was delicious, the hospitality was much to be desired.  After walking miles in 90+ degrees, we walked into restaurant and checked in at hostess desk and confirmed out reservations. We asked to be seated, but were told we couldn't until our third party arrived. We were exhausted, dehydrated, and in extreme need for seating and water. We had planned to order drinks and apps right away. There were PLENTY of available tables and nobody waiting to be seated. We were begrudgingly allowed to use the restroom. Then we wanted to sit at the bar and order some drinks. We sat down and were immediately told we were not welcome to sit there had to sit at a bar in the back of the restaurant.  The bartender was not friendly and seemed as if she did us a favor and served us.  I REALLY wanted to walk out at that moment. But we were waiting for our friend who was a block away and we simply didn't have strength to leave and walk in that heat. All in all, food was very good. Ambiance is lovely. But staff needs an attitude adjustment.",,,
151,Victoria I.,"Troy, MI",134,8,15,3.0,11/13/2017,"Awesome location, great ambience. The interior was beautiful. Coat check is available which was nice. Perfect for date night. Not to loud even with the music playing. Food was great! Had the California rolls as a starter. Salmon for dinner and my boyfriend had the kale and quinoa salad with added chicken. The salad was cold and crisp and the chicken was moist and hot! Salmon was not over cooked which was very exciting. The vegetables and sauce compliment perfectly. We also had one beer and one cocktail. Would've had more except the server never came back to the table until we asked for the check. The food runner dropped off our dinners and we were never spoken to after that. Will definitely give this place another try because we loved the food and the setting so much. Overall decent experience. This review might change in the future.",,,

Lots of great flavors in that salad.  Would also be a good size to share.  I tried my friend's whole brook trout which was very fresh.  Came in whole form, but was deboned.  Beautiful presentation served with roasted potatoes.We didn't have enough room for dessert, but we shared two orders of french fries for the table as well.Will have to go to the other side and get some baked goods from their cafe.  Would recommend.  Great crowd, average prices.  Nice ambiance for Flatiron area.",,,

At $12, it's supposed to be a ""Harvest Salad"", do you see anything besides raw kale? There are a scant few cranberries, unseasoned walnuts, and overcooked Brussel Sprouts. The best thing about this salad is the dressing, which I wish I had more of to choke down this kale (which included a few large stems)!",,,
156,Albie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,28,31,1.0,2/14/2017,"Horrible service! Good food. The first time I was here I thought the slow service was due to the packed restaurant. Even after reading all the reviews I didn't want to believe it. I decided to give it a 2nd try today, Valentines Day. I booked a table for 8. We got seated fairly quickly. We did the Valentines Day 3 course meal. It supposedly gave free entry to the next door  ""Anti Vday Party"". The manager explained to us the party came with this 3 course meal but was TOO busy to explain what was included, what time it starts and ends. He said he has to run and our server will explain to us. A manager should ALWAYS take the time to explain to their guest. After 15 minutes, our server finally came by. When we asked her about the party, she barely had any idea. She told us it was not open bar and thinks it's only cupcakes. Each meal took FOREVER to come out. During our first appetizer, a waitress dropped a glass under our table. The glass cut my cousin on the leg. There were shards on the table. One of the shards was embedded into my friends arm. The waiters only cleaned up the glass on the floor. They never cleaned or checked to see if there was glass on the table UNTIL we complained and informed them it could be in our food. Reservation was at 630PM, we finished dinner at 1030pm - due to their super slow service. The bill came, nothing was accommodated to us due to the slow service and the broken glass. After dinner, we decided to head over next door to see what the party was all about. The waiter then stopped us and informed us the party is over. Ha!I would only recommend coming here to get seated at the bar for the atmosphere.I should have believed all the reviews I read on Yelp!!!When we left the other side of the restaurant (there are 2 entrances, 17th street and 18th street), we saw the party sigh. See attached photo. Turns out there was open bar... Official rating from our group:Food: 8/10Service: 1/10",1,,

Served with grilled lobster and chunky lobster meat mixed into dish. They did not skimp on the sauce, the sauce was so hearty and flavorful.  Pasta was al dente. Lobster was cooked perfectly.My husband had the skirt steak with watercress salad. I thought the portion was a little smaller but he was fine with it and wasn't too full to get dessert.  The pickled vegetables/ salad was a great accompaniment with the steak and chimchurri sauce.The opera cake for dessert was very dramatic. Comes with a candle with the presentation. Imagine a Ferrero Roche style cake :) We would come back again and eat everything on repeat. We used the Icon Parking garage on 16th St. for parking, a 3 minute walk. as we didn't have the patience to look for street parking.",,,

Its huge so you save half for later. 3. House-Made Fusilli. 4. Whole Lobster Salad. 5. El Papito Cocktail.If you work in the neighborhood, so easy to pop in here for at least one meal a day. Comfortable, spacious, can get work done and no one bothers you. If you sit at the bar at lunch time and some open bottles of wine are around, you'll probably be offered a free glass.

I had to ask twice about it and our waitress made me feel like I was being annoying. But the sides came after I finished my meal. Again ""Here you go.""

The same glass of wine at the table was 15$ even though it was happy hour they don't allow you to get it at the table. A super average burger goes for 26$.

Unfortunately tonight was very different. We had a reservation at 8pm. When checking in, the hostess was not very friendly or welcoming. We sat down at the table, immediately got served water, and the waited. I was so incredibly embarrassed that after ten minutes no one had come by. We had a family friend in town and we all wanted to order drinks and appetizers. When the waiter did come by, he didn't acknowledge the fact that we had been sitting there forever (approximately 10-12 minutes) and laughed it off saying he was ""chatting with the people at the other table."" We finally had the chance to order drinks and appetizers. Wine was just as great as I remembered it and the burrata was superb and the meat and cheese plate was solid. While working on our appetizers (haven't looked at menu yet for main dish), the female manager comes by, takes 2 of our 3 menus and tells us to share the one left. I was appalled. What kind of customer service is this? When the waiter came back by to get our order, we asked for more menus and he laughed saying they had run out of menus and that is why they borrowed ours. Is this a joke? I was so incredibly embarrassed we had brought our family friend here to experience this horrible service. We ordered the Thai steak salad and the burger. Both delicious. Thank goodness the chef is amazing because the service here genuinely is awful. I hope the manager takes time to train her staff and learns to lead by example. It will be a long time until we return back here again. Such a shame because the food is delicious.",1,,

I would definitely come back to eat dinner here. They also have another side of this place which is like a sports bar they have cool bar food to eat and they have big screens to watch games. All seats are benches which I LOVED! This place has a little of everything just depends what you're in the mood for. If the hummus was good i can't believe the actual food! I'll definitely be back for either dinner or to watch some games. The ambiance is also beautiful and elegant. I would definitely recommend it for a date night and/or birthday dinner.

Believe me, I love alot of salt, but not when you can barely taste the pasta and the salt is the only thing you can taste. My friend had the cod, and the portion size was ridiculously small. The cheesecake desert was not even real cheesecake. It tasted more like a cheesecake ice cream. Overall, the food was terrible. You pay, but you certainly do not receive. The service was very slow as well. They need more wait staff. Keep in mind, this review is only for dinner, but I won't step foot in this restaurant again. Avoid.",,,
186,Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",70,166,3,5.0,8/5/2017,"After a terrible experience at a restaurant nearby that we actually had a reservation at and left because of terrible service, we came here. I was at my wits end and this place was a beacon in the night. Literally. We are local and have kids and although we don't dine with our children that often our nanny was away for the weekend and we wanted a nice family night. Dinner and a movie. This place was incredible. The service, the food, the atmosphere saved our night. We loved it and will be back.",,,
187,Daniela S.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,77,14,4.0,1/3/2017,"Drop what you're doing and go have the passion fruit dessert before they take it off the menu. I MEAN IT. This was, hands down, the best dessert I had in nyc in 2016. And everything else was equally as delicious! snapper, ricotta toast and oysters. I CANNOT wait to go back here. I should also add that the prices are very reasonable! But that passion fruit dessert! Please oh please never ever ever ever take it off the menu!",,1,1
188,Prg P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,46,1,5.0,3/19/2018,"Croissants are the best - we had the birthday cake and creme brûlée, and they gave us the red velvet on the house - super delicious! Will definitely be back. Great service too.",,,
189,Su P.,"Palisades Park, NJ",0,13,7,3.0,6/9/2017,"the food and atmosphere are great.They really need to train their servers and designate them to their sections though, we were literally asked over ten times if they can clear the table by multiple staff. There was still a lot of food left, and it was really annoying because they kept bothering us while we were talking.. thanks for being attentive, but we don't need to be interrupted every 5 mins. it wasn't even peak hour and there were lots of tables open, and we felt like they kept trying to get rid of us. Not okay.",1,,
190,Mike L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,3.0,2/24/2018,Don't bother making a reservation it doesn't mean anything to this establishment. Had a 8:30 reservation and we did not get a table to 9:30!!!  Food was good but not sure it was worth the wait. Cody kept saying the table would be ready in 5min but it took an hour. Probably won't go back.,,,
191,Jillian H.,"New York, NY",461,79,0,5.0,1/27/2017,"A lovely spot to grab drinks and spend quality time with old friends. I really liked the vibe of Union Fare. I mean how could you go wrong with a block long bar and restaurant? So much room whether you want to sit down and eat, stand by the bar, or sit by the bar. Also, it looks pretty cool inside. Great decor. A little bit on the expensive side, but hey that's manhattan for ya. See you next time Union Fare!",,,
192,Maria C.,"Paris, France",0,5,3,4.0,12/31/2016,"Friendly service and excellent food.  We enjoyed the grilled octopus, duck egg & shrooms and fusilli with lamb ragu.  Wish had room for dessert.  Will have to go back to try them.",,,1
193,Merica K.,"Jersey City, NJ",230,119,203,5.0,10/12/2016,"Union Fare is such an awesome establishment. I went there with six other coworkers during happy hour for one of their birthdays. It was so much fun! The décor is super modern And chic. There is tons of space and seating. Because we were 7 the staff were kind enough to pull one of the large tables against the wall out and we sat around it. It was the perfect table and they were so kind to move around seating for us. There's a full cocktail, beer and wine bar. We started with drinks and the bar was a little backed up so it took a little while. We werent in a rush and the cocktails arrived tasty and strong! The wine is nothing too special. I would order one of their tequila drinks! We ordered the meat and cheese butcher board and everything on it was so good I would would recommend that as the best! The prices are a bit high but you're paying for the atmosphere and awesome service. I can't wait to go back.",2,,1
194,Rebecca N.,"Chicago, IL",103,200,338,4.0,1/16/2017,"Really great spot. Perfect for a light sharing meal with friends. You could go heavier but we did mostly apps and one entree. The charcuterie board stood out as did the lamb pasta, ricotta toast and octopus. They could have spaced out the meal better. It all came out at once. Inexpensive relatively speaking",,,
195,Dara B.,"New York, NY",4,5,0,2.0,12/4/2017,"I made a 2:00 PM brunch reservation for 10 people for my husband's birthday. We actually closed the restaurant at 4:30 PM... and not by choice. We waited for our food for over an hour. When we asked our server, she told us our food would be right out. That happened 45 minutes after we asked. When we finally got our food, it was luke warm at best and the burger that one of us ordered was way over cooked. We all thought the food was pretty good, but I'm not sure if that's because we were all so hungry that anything would have tasted good. Then if we weren't there long enough, it took forever to get the check. The wait staff was literally packing up while we were sitting there waiting. To their credit, management did take care of us. We were given a round of drinks and half off of our bill. But that was only after we complained for sitting there forever. This wasn't just offered to us. Also, we were not the only table this happened to. My friend overheard the table next to us saying that they waited forever for their food too. We were given the excuse that there was a glitch with the Open Table system which caused them to be overbooked and overwhelmed. But that sounds like a BS excuse since there was no wait and plenty of tables available. If we were warned of this ""glitch"" before, we could have either decided to stay, knowing that we would be there awhile, or make a decision to go elsewhere. Furthermore, I read deep into the reviews when we got back and found plenty of reviews with the same complaint. So that's another reason why I think their excuse is BS. I think the restaurant is just too big for the kitchen to handle all of the orders. Yes, we were taken care of and yes, the food was good. But this is not a restaurant I would give another chance.",1,,
196,Troy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,42,193,5.0,9/30/2016,The creme brulee and birthday cake croissant will definitely have you come back and again and again,2,,1
197,Kareem B.,"Morris Heights, NY",0,3,0,5.0,2/5/2017,"Great food, great service and nice atmosphere. I love the options. In the morning the bakery, in the afternoon several lunch options and dinner the short Ribs fell off the bone and the charred Brussels sprouts was amazing. Finally a place I could frequent with nice music as well.",,,
198,Lauren T.,"New York, NY",474,148,620,4.0,10/14/2016,"Food and staff were great. Really enjoyed the honey truffle risotto appetizer. They also have a casual bakery / grab and go style food court attached to the restaurant which is really convenient. Definitely a worthy place to check out for dinner, great ambiance with the hanging lights.",1,,
199,James M.,"Roslyn, NY",3,56,5,1.0,11/5/2016,"DO NOT EAT HERE! Worst staff in the history of the world. The level of rudeness cannot be described in words, but I'll try. We sat down for brunch with 4 people. They sat us in the back corner away from everyone like they were ashamed of us. The waitress didn't come over for 15 min. We finally ordered drinks with her, and the drinks did not show up at all. She finally came over 20 min later, with no drinks, and we tried to order food. We began to tell her our food order and in the middle of us telling her our order she rudely walked away stating she forgot she had to check something! Insane!! 10 min later she came back. We again tried to order food but they were out of everything on the menu. After 45 min and still no drinks and no food, we walked out. The place was not busy. Save your time and money and dine elsewhere. They don't value your time or you as a customer. It seems others have experienced this extreme rudeness so this was not an off night for them. I just wish I would have read others' Yelp reviews first!",1,,
