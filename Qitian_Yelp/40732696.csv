0,Cathy V.,"Miami, FL",0,2,2,5.0,8/25/2018,Sandwiches are ridiculously good and best deal in NYC!  Salads are unbelievable and the owner is charming!,,,
1,Estina R.,"Manhattan, NY",142,293,16,5.0,10/19/2017,"We love this place for great sandwiches - breakfast or lunch! The soups are also excellent - tomato basil is a favorite but really can't go wrong. I love the variety here, great place to stop if you have a few people since there's a little bit of everything. We stop here before every road trip and can get everything we need including drinks, snacks, etc. Everyone is also really nice here and very patient. There is also a huge selection of homemade desserts! Not too many places in the city where you can get food that looks and tastes like homemade!I'm looking forward to getting catering from here, will review again once we do!",,,1
2,Jill E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,2,5.0,10/9/2017,"We love this place. Best sandwiches in Manhattan and best coffee, according to our doorman. The Mexican gluten free brownie is also amazing even if you're not gluten free. We used to live across the street and this is one of a handful of places that we really miss!",1,,1
3,Vivian T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,5.0,5/20/2018,"I've made coming to Giacomo for a bagel a weekend tradition because the bagels are just so good! I've also tried a wide range of things from their menu, and I loved everything! Their kale slaw is delicious and will leave you craving more. Their soups and chili is the perfect comfort food. All of their muffins are perfectly moist. We also ordered prepared turkey and some sides from Giacomo this Thanksgiving and it was probably one of the best Thanksgivings ever! Thank you Giacomo for feeding our neighborhood well!",,,1
4,Joseph A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",231,3,0,5.0,12/12/2017,Giacomo's food is fresh and that is undeniable true. It's warm prepared foods taste like home cooking. It's staff is hilarious. Giacomo's price is not only cheap but also the best tasting in the upper west side,,,
5,C P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,5.0,8/20/2017,"Stepped in Sunday afternoon for a prosciutto, mozzarella, and basil sandwich on a hero and it was terrific. Ingredients were super fresh, the bread was crisp and delicious, and it was dressed very well with some light oil and vinegar. Staff was pleasant and quick. Hope to be back soon.",1,,1
6,Diana V.,"New York, NY",5,8,0,4.0,5/11/2017,"I've been meaning to come here for a while. Glad I finally did! It's a great sandwich shop! Super friendly staff. We ordered the #8 meatball sub and the S3 prosciutto sandwich to go. When I got home the sandwiches were so good! They had just the right amount of meat and cheese, and the bread was so fresh! I'll definitely be back.",,,
7,Crystine W.,"New York, NY",769,1213,283,4.0,3/17/2015,"I'm perplexed by the quality of the Chicken Cutlet Sandwich (on sesame roll) I got from Giacomo's because they used the microwave to heat up the chicken cutlet and melt the cheese.  $8 for a huge 10-inch sandwich had me smiling, and my colleagues experiencing lunch envy.  Loved every bite, & I will happily return for more.  Next time, I will make sure to try their hazelnut coffee.",,,
8,Dennis D.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",77,9,0,1.0,12/10/2015,The food is good.   But not worth being treated like your crazy when you ask their preferences about items they sell.  Much friendlier people and places in the area. Don't waste your time.,1,,
9,Steve G.,"New York, NY",1,22,0,5.0,8/12/2017,"Fresh,  innovative sandwiches served by a friendly staff. Why visit  a chain shop when the UWS boasts  a breakfast & lunch place like Giacomo?",,,
10,T B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,2.0,2/24/2017,"Bought sandwiches here today to eat in the park. The bread was not fresh which ruined the sandwiches. Tasted like it was frozen and defrosted which I'm sure it was. I have ordered from here before and the sandwiches were good, obviously they are trying to save money by using old bread but all they have accomplished is losing a customer. I won't go back.",1,,
11,Pamela P.,"Manhattan, NY",222,7,0,1.0,3/16/2016,"Don't go here if you have allergies - do go here if you want terrible service or the owner to go off on you and tell you he is not in the mood. As much as a appreciate, support and write about my experiences with great companies and brands I love (esp on UWS) is as disappointed and shocked I am when businesses (especially the owner) are terrible to customers. We all have bad days, but going off & being beyond rude to a long time customer when you made a mistake should be beyond embarrassing for a business owner.Giacomo Fine Foods is not the nice neighbor mom and pop shop you think it is Upper West Siders beware (72nd street near west end)! I noticed in the past the owner Joe had a temper and was mean to dogs even being near his store. I have lived in the neighborhood and have been customer here (supporting a small business instead of the 100 other coffee places on 72nd street) for last 8 years - talking breakfast, iced coffee everyday and lunch. Always noticed they kept milk in cups (instead of containers) and were a little sloppy and had subpar food prep practices but didn't think much of it. (Found a string in my ice coffee a few times and random clumpy stuff at the bottom of my iced coffee cup - thought it was a coincidence). Stopped in before a workout class last week to get iced coffee and they gave me hazelnut coffee (side noteevery time I go there I ask sure not hazelnut because of nut allergy). The lady never seemed to care and always just laughed at me. Didn't think much of it. I tasted flavor in this cup and was on the phone and didn't think much about it and brought coffee back. I went in today to get another ice coffee thinking that they would be at least slightly apologetic or kind since it was a BIG mistake and I asked what happened last week - lady shrugged it off and laughed and said she didn't know. I asked her what it was and she said she gave me hazelnut coffee - I said that is a big deal for people with severe allergies - I chugged Benadryl when I left and most stores care about this for liability reasons. I asked the owner Joe (who was always so nice and friendly) who was standing there ignoring the situation if he heard what happened. He said yeah and told me he wasn't in the mood for this today and said whatever under his breathe. Then he went OFF on me! Couldn't believe it! He said what do you want from me - and I said maybe to be a little nice to your customer who has been coming here for years and not be so flip and nasty/mean! I will be spreading the word on this horrible place - they rely on neighborhood for their customers and shouldn't be ungrateful and downright mean. You think they would want business since there are many places to get iced coffee on 72nd street including a deli right next to it - I was just trying to support local small businesses. They should shut down if they don't want to be there & be nice to neighborhood people. What a disappointment and shock. The department of health should be on top of this place - since it doesn't seem right. Much friendlier choices in the neighborhood.",,1,1
12,Kristin C.,"Manhattan, NY",366,159,80,5.0,1/7/2014,"Giacomo is my go-2 spot. I absolutely love their hazelnut coffee. I am definitely a coffee person and love making coffee, but having Giacomo below me has left my espresso maker, french press and single drip maker to gather dust. Huge fan of their sugar free, gluten free banana muffin (yes, I'm from California and am a vegetarian who enjoys yoga). My boyfriend loves their bagels. Cash only, unless you spend $10+, but the owner does ""IOUs"" - love.",2,1,2
13,Veronica C.,"Bronx, NY",22,111,228,5.0,5/13/2014,"All the way out in west end yuckBut I lovvvvve this spot for coffee and food!!! ;) egg sandwich with spinach and provolone cheese!! Yummy!!! Great people, great service!!! ;) Good coffee iced or hot!",,,
14,Natalie K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/16/2016,Peanut allergies are serious! And to the manager--at least pretend to care!!!! I'm sorry if YOU do not have time for my allergy but I do not have time to die from a peanut allergy. Rudeness to a customer is not acceptable.,,1,
15,Farah A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",9,61,31,3.0,4/20/2015,"I don't know why but i was left feeling rather meh about the whole place.  OK coffee, pretty decent muffin but service and friendliness almost non existent.  They're across the street from me but with Gigi's around the corner, I'll probably stick there.",,,
16,Lauren G.,"New York, NY",37,206,0,4.0,3/6/2012,"Moving to NY, I honestly think I was most excited by the idea of being able to walk everywhere. I love the fact that local spots where staff gets to know you and you share banter with fellow patrons actually exist!Giacomo is one of these small local spots. The staff are there daily, from morning to close and take a friendly interest in every patron. The daily fresh soups and bagels are legit and I love them. The prices are great and it's definitely become my go-to lunch spot.I just love that small spots like this thrive in such a huge metropolis, the atmosphere, the fresh foods and the people make this place one of the many great things about this city",2,,1
17,Karl A.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,0,5.0,3/1/2012,Great food! the soups and deserts  Are fantastic,2,,
18,brian b.,"New York, NY",12,18,16,5.0,3/10/2014,Giacomo's was my go to for my morning coffee (hazelnut!) and bagel along with mid-afternoon pastries and homemade dinner.  The staff is superb!  They're sweet and sincere and add a nice personal touch to this neighborhood.  I highly recommend everything here.,1,,1
19,Reagan B.,"New York, NY",31,25,3,5.0,8/8/2014,"Amazing sandwiches! Way better than Gigi's pre-made junk. Get the Italian Combo #S7. For $6.95 on the UWS, you can't beat it.",,,
20,Robert S.,"New York, NY",18,3,0,5.0,10/15/2012,Such wonderful food in a smaller shop in a residential neighborhood is a real treat in Manhattan. Their soups are what makes fall even nicer and their Lentil has them calling meMr. Lentil man            Bob S.,,,
21,Elaine K.,"New York, NY",0,23,6,4.0,6/24/2015,Food good and fresh.  Coffee excellent.  Service efficient and friendly.,,,
22,Robert W.,"New York, NY",2,30,0,4.0,10/6/2012,"Sweet little prepared food shop with lots of personality, on otherwise nearly all-residential West End. Small space, handwritten menu, extremely friendly staff, and outstanding food. The peppery minestrone soup is one of the best I've had and the turkey meatloaf is delicious.",2,,
23,Jonathan S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,28,0,5.0,1/27/2013,"Moved to the area a few months ago, and with all the choices around, this is the place that's most quickly become part of our regular routine.  We've been going virtually every weekend to get soup..they always have several choices and are always fantastic, and affordable.  They also have really good croissants and other baked goods/pastries.",1,,
24,Mariana L.,"New York, NY",360,601,186,4.0,10/30/2005,"Nice little store-front with very tasty salads and sandwiches.  The baked goods have more of a homey touch than what you can find at your average deli around the city.  Not the prettiest place, but very tasty, which is what counts.",2,,1
25,Sarah O.,"Cary, NC",79,145,3,3.0,10/8/2005,"This little take-out place has great coffee. I was getting my morning coffee at the deli next door, everyday walking by Giacomo's with their ""Best Coffee in the City"" sign,  so of course I just assumed their coffee sucked.  But their coffee is pretty good. Not the best in the city, but a good cup of joe. Their baked goods are always pretty good reliable too. I had a great cranberry scone the other day, and I tried a tea biscuit for the first time, which is like a cross between a scone and a muffin. They also have lunch and dinner catered items. Their presentation case with pre-made food leaves a bit to be desired, but they do have a special sauce for their Swedish meatballs that involves some worcestershire, and they are pretty tasty.",2,,
26,Stephanie C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,4/26/2013,"best local sandwich shop around, great heros, and a cute selection of sodas and other snacks. very mom-and-pop feeling. love it.",,,
