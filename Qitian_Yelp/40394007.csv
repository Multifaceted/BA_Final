0,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,4.0,10/14/2018,"At around 10 on a Saturday, my friends and I stumbled across Lovers, the perfect spot for a night cap.That is, if you can grab a seat. This spot was ""pleasantly packed,"" with no more sitting room and about as many people standing around doing some moderate hovering. It definitely maintains an intimate feel despite also being crowded.Lucky for us, it was a mild night, and we could hang in the outdoor space, which feels like a private alley (of which very few actually exist in the city).The cocktail menu is in a handy spot, under a dim light and in big font. At $13/each, the drinks are nicely priced. Among us, we got two gin drinks and one rum drink. Hard to choose a favorite, so you can't go wrong with Fan Mail, Astral Plane, or Hong Kong Garden.Check it out if you're in the area.",7,2,8
1,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",376,678,30533,4.0,9/23/2018,walk down. enjoy boozy drinks in the shadows within a charming intimate dark cocktail bar.several seats at the bar. a handful of tables. this place is really for a few small groups (3-4) and couples. large groups are going to be challenged here by the lack of space/seating.the bar is stylishly casual and low-key. the lighting is very low. it has even energy of chill cozy ambiance + music.i'd stick with the signature cocktails as most of them are boozy and well-conceived. i've only been here during happy hour (5-8 pm) and late night (2-4am) happy hour where you get the most bang--err insobriety--your buck.service? friendly. attention is spent on making your cocktail not on chit chat. hence why the cocktails are consistent. the bartenders are chill and keep it moving.definitely great for pre dinner drinks or closing out the night. i am a fan.drops mic cuz i don't drink and mici outzzz,11,9,12
2,Ashish G.,"Allston, MA",147,28,2,5.0,9/22/2018,"Oh wow. Lovers of today is amazing. Such an intimate space. Very NYC. The atmosphere, the drinks, the ambience....Happy hours drinks!!! 8 bucks for those cocktails! We tried every one on the menu. And they are great.Man I'm so happy I found this place. And its great to watch the bartender make the drinks, he's good.",,,
3,Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4699,2638,17919,3.0,9/21/2018,"Lovers of Today is a cute but very small bar in East Village. My friend and I popped in for a drink and were happy to secure the last - and very best in my opinion - table in the spot. There's a small tucked away area right by the front door that is super romantic & all that good stuff. You order up at the bar and plop yourself down where you can find a seat. It's kind of a speakeasy but you just walk right in so...it's somewhere between a dive bar, a lounge & a speakeasy. All the reviews I read prior to going said there was no sign outside which may play into the speakeasy feel. However when I went, they did have signs directing us downstairs and in.They do Happy Hour from 5-8pm so that is my suggested time to go! Cocktails are HALF price which is an excellent HH special. The drinks were alright, service was alright, but we only stayed for one cocktail. A cute place to experience but overall was just an alright time for us.  It would be great for a date night though, dim lighting and that name! I mean c'mon!",20,11,16
4,Yinglu W.,"New York, NY",1,213,198,2.0,9/3/2018,"I loved this place when my bf and I just got there. It's a tiny, cozy speakeasy bar. Drinks were really strong. I ordered Satellite of Love (Rye Whiskey) and Grey Goose w ginger beer. It's totally worth the money.However, the area behind this area is such a strange existence. There was actually a door in between the two area but it was closed last night (was left open the other day). So we used another door and walked to the bar in that area. After we got there, the bartender was so RUDE and trying to GRAB the beer from my bf's hands!!! WTF?! So we left and sat at the counch. A couple minutes later, the bartender rushed out and yelled to us ""Get out"". What's the fucking wrong w that weird voice guy?!We went back to the place we originally were but all my good mood was swiped away by that asshole.",1,,
5,Chrissy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,167,414,5.0,8/13/2018,"Great cocktails and great happy hour prices! Very vintage vibe and great selection of classic music. Very romantic and great date spot. My date did an awesome job on this one. Lots of different cocktails to chose from, but my favorite was the handsome devil. Super small and does get crowded in Friday-Saturday",1,1,1
6,Kate S.,"New York, NY",580,277,370,5.0,7/10/2018,"The name says it all. With a space so dark and intimate, it is perfect for any lovers of today (or the night). For a speakeasy, the place isn't too hard to find. There's a sign outside with a bright neon red heart. They have a pretty great cocktail menu. Full of really refreshing yet exotic mixes. I really enjoyed the Hong Kong Garden, which was a mix of gin, lemon, honey, cucumber, and yuzu peppers --- a great added kick. All cocktails are $13. I must say...the main place is small and very dark. Better for dates. But if you come in a group, they have a separate space next door (they separate it) that you can access outside.If that doesn't get you excited, their happy hours definitely will. From 5pm - 8pm every day, they have 1/2 price cocktails. Yes, I'm in love.",7,1,2
7,Lindsey S.,"New York, NY",317,231,155,3.0,10/15/2018,"My friend just moved to East Village and Lovers of Today was recommended by a lot of her neighbors. They offer $8 cocktails from 5-8pm, which is always a plus. Our bartender was good, no fuss and got the job done. I tried the Rampage (tequila, lime, tamarind, chipotle grenadine). It wasn't bad, but the ice watered it down. I switched over to Fan Mail (rum, lime, lavender honey, champagne), which I really enjoyed. I didn't see any food offered, just FYI. Good deal for Happy Hour, but I wasn't blown away. It's a cute spot though.",,,
8,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",427,651,2820,4.0,11/12/2017,"Looking to unwind after a long day of learning, one of my colleagues recommended we go to Lovers of Today for a few drinks. It looked like it offered a relaxing, cool atmosphere so I was excited to try. The bar is set on the basement level of a building; upon entry you walk past a gate down some stairs into the actual bar. I was loving the aesthetics before even going in - a small sign with a neon-lit heart signifying the entrance was simple yet effective. The interior is small, simply decorated, and dimly lit; besides some backlighting behind the bar and a few candles here and there, it's pretty much dark inside - this created a really intimate feel capped off with some funky oldies playing throughout.The bar opens at 5pm with happy hour for the first 4 hours. We decided to get there right at opening which was definitely a good choice - within 30 minutes or so of us arriving the place had almost filled up. The menu consists of ~10 cocktails; I decided to start with the Marquee Moon which had blackberry preserves, lemon juice, and vodka. I then moved on to the Hong Kong Garden which again had lemon juice but was paired with gin, pepper, and cucumber. Both cocktails were very good; the former was fruity but not too sweet and the latter was a tad spicy but also crisp and refreshing - I was a fan. One of my friends had the Waterloo Sunset - this contained apple spice syrup among other things; I took a sip and it was like Thanksgiving in a glass mmmmm pass the stuffing.Even with the crowd, the entire experience was pretty seamless. The bartender was working solo but he was on top of his game making sure we were taken care of - total props to him. Hot tip: there's no wait service so if you're sitting at a table just go up to the bar to order. Really cool place overall, I'm glad I came and would definitely come back.",8,2,4
9,Lena O.,"New York, NY",253,44,34,3.0,9/18/2018,"This bar is definitely cozy and romantic. The cocktail menu is created beautifully and the cocktail I had (another girl another planet) was delicious! However, this bar is so small as to be impractical most times of the day. It's probably a great place to be at 5 pm, but when I went on a Saturday at 11 there was absolutely no where to stand or sit. The outdoor area was used by smokers. This is how we accidentally ended up going to the connected bar (sister midnight) that I believe some reviewers thought was this bar. Sister Midnight was way more spacious and I don't think it has the aggressive bouncer mentioned in many of their reviews. Anyways, I wish I could've liked Lovers of Today more, but as someone with a traditional work schedule I doubt I'll ever make it there when it's not absolutely packed. I hate to say it because it's not the bar's fault. New York takes cool and cozy and makes it cramped and stressful.",,,
10,Laura C.,"Flushing, NY",104,237,457,5.0,11/23/2017,Love this little spot. Its cozy and super relaxed.Sometimes its hard to find a spot to sit down but its okay eventually something pops up.The drinks are super solid! $13.00 for any of the specialty cocktails.I love the Rumble. Sexy date spot.,2,,2
11,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,4.0,6/21/2018,"This is a very cute and intimate cocktail bar/lounge. It's very petite, so plan accordingly! The ambiance is very dim and romantic. There are plenty of drink options including hard spirits, cocktails, beers, and the likes. I loved the surprise cocktail the friendly bartender made for me. Our drinks were surprisingly cheap and their cocktail prices are fair for Manhattan. I would return. $20 minimum for cards",,1,1
12,Caitlyn C.,"New York, NY",298,199,318,5.0,6/20/2018,"A friend took me here recently and I am kind of obsessed! The sign outside is simply a lit up heart. It's so sweet and unassuming. You go down a few steps to this basement bar that has outdoor and indoor seating. It's not a ton of space but somehow they fit a good amount of booths, tables and chairs around and it doesn't feel crowded. It's all so cozy inside. The cocktail list is written up on this little chalkboard. They have a wide range of beautifully crafted drinks. I had the handsome devil which was good, but my friend had the rumble and I thought that was great! The rumble has a bit of a spicy kick and is served in a tall glass which is easier (for someone like me who spills things) to manage. Can't wait to come back and try some other drinks!",,,
13,Suji K.,"Manhattan, NY",6,33,58,5.0,6/2/2018,"Cute little dark bar right by Thomson square park. Awesome drinks and the dark lightings make this place romantic and mysterious All cocktails are 13 bucks. We stopped by while waiting for our dinner reservation on Saturday night around 8pm. Was able to score a seat in the corner. It's not too noisy so we were able to talk - wasn't too packed so didn't feel too claustrophobic as well. For drinks we got the one that ends with ""another planet"" and ""Waterloo sunset"" - both were delicious.",1,,
14,Martina C.,"Long Island City, NY",61,269,198,4.0,11/26/2017,"A really cool spot in Alphabet City. The atmosphere is really unique, and the special cocktails listed in the bar wall are delicious!I stumped upon here with a few friends on Saturday night; it was loud, and pretty packed. It was hard to talk, but we shuffle a bit between inside and outside and we manage to enjoy a few drinks. It's definitely a neat bar to impress dates or friends, but I would ""bar hopping"" here. There is not much space to enjoy a conversation.",,,1
15,Ariella G.,"Brooklyn, NY",222,82,9,5.0,3/8/2018,"Lovers of Today is in my top 3 favorite bars and one of my go-to's whenever I'm in need of a date spot. Perfectly situated in a basement area on the border of East Village & Alphabet City, Lovers of Today is a perfect spot for a third date or beyond - I say this because it is a very small space with very intimate, dim lighting and it would be a shame to waste it on someone you didn't like! If you're lucky you can grab one of two booths and cozy up to the person you're with, or a spot on one of the outdoor benches in the warmer months. Have always had solid service here, even when this is only one bartender on busier weekend nights. The space, which is essentially a basement lounge with a max capacity of 25 or so, manages to be divey and sexy at once. If this isn't your scene and you like your bars spacious and free of people, don't come here. Otherwise swing by for a great cocktail when you're in the area.",2,,
16,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,3.0,7/25/2017,"I picked this place because it was billed as being intimate and low key, and I arrived after work on a weekday. The bar is very small and very dark, and the music choice was excellent. But they were BLASTING the music. So much for intimate! I was cozying up with my partner but despite being right next to each other we still had to shout. Then a booth full of loud chicks start talking at full octane so the bartender raised the volume even more, I guess to drown them out. Cocktails were fine, skip the gin/lemon combos, their list has multiple variations of the same type of drink. There was a spicy tequila thing on there, go with that. But I think there are stronger choices both for cocktails and ambiance. The bartender also seemed a little too busy prepping the bar to linger long enough to have a little banter. I get it man, ya gotta cut those limes, but I tend to be of the mind that that stuff should be done before the after work rush hits so you're not spread so thin. I'd give them another shot.",3,1,2
17,Aly M.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,151,173,4.0,3/18/2018,Loved the location downstairs and the oldies music (although it was just slightly loud to be able to have a conversation but maybe it's to entice passerby to make heir way down the stairs). I ordered the Satellite of Love- I asked for it on the rocks. It was good but a little bitter- not as good as a simple old fashioned. Bartender seemed very competent but not overly friendly.,1,,
18,Tessie V.,"New York, NY",3,296,149,2.0,1/23/2018,"In two words: Pretentious and small.In more words: It's like drinking in your friend's mom's mad tiny apartment.The cocktails are reminiscent of juice. Which isn't just a hoity-toity cocktail lounge place: Weather, Brandy Library, and even Ward III have cocktails that taste like alcohol.If that's you thing then sure. The bartenders always seem to be a little bothered to be there. And honestly, the bouncer seems unnecessary 10/10Best for an intimate date at 5:45 M-W. Maybe a Saturday on a holiday weekend where there has been a snow storm. IT'S a huge hassle to get a seat here because they're like 5 seats. Come with max 3 people. Even 3 is pushing it.There's oddly one corner of seats where there is no lighting at all. I'm assuming it's the make out corner. Even if you get a table with your intimate date, and pay for overpriced capri sun. The music is so loud you'll just have to communicate via sign language or intense eye motions.Liz S is completely right. This place is a back up bar, not a destination. I suggest coming here while waiting for your reservation at PDT or Death and Co.",2,1,
19,Priti R.,"New York, NY",320,405,57,4.0,6/18/2018,"Cute place in a basement. Lighting is extremely dimly lit. The cocktails here are very well done - I'd suggest the tequila one (forgot the name!).

The music is so chill and the atmosphere is gorgeous and quaint.",,,
21,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",828,471,120,3.0,12/4/2017,"Cute, intimate cocktail bar that has a speakeasy vibe that's like whoa there's a bar down there?!Ok... it's a little too intimate. There might be room for like 20 people max, but of course the popularity exceeds that.Solid cocktails at a set price, but that being said, I'm pretty sure the ""vodka"" or ""tequila"" base isn't the finest choice but muddled with a fancy arrangement of mixers and sweet (or spicy in one case) flavors. Get here early and snag a seat and enjoy the music and vibe. Otherwise watch the free for all commence.",2,1,1
22,Katie S.,"New York, NY",252,257,382,5.0,4/10/2017,"Very intimate bar on 7th just off Avenue A in the East Village with friendly bartenders and $13 cocktails.Lovers of Today is small, with about 10 seats at the bar, a couple of u-shaped booths, and a couch. When we stopped in around 9pm on a Sunday night, we snagged two seats at the bar and ordered one Another Girl Another Planet and one Marquee Moon. The drinks were strong!We thought the music, though maybe a little too loud, was great. Fun, recognizable songs that added to the cozy vibe. I'll be back for happy hour -- their $7 cocktails until 8pm is hard to beat.",1,,2
23,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,637,4.0,1/30/2018,I love Lovers of Today! It's a great place to bring your friends or a date! It's dark and very intimate inside. This place gets very crowded on the weekends and since it's very small you're gambling with finding a seat or not. I'd recommend coming here during their off hours if you're going to be here with a big group but if it's just your and a friend it's a much better atmosphere. The place can get very loud as well with the music and small space so a lot of screaming is involved. They have a set cocktail list and you can't go wrong with anything! I usually bring friends here that are visiting NYC. It's a little hidden but you can't miss the neon heart outside. I was kind of putting of this review because I didn't want anybody to know about it but you should definitely stop by for a drink!,3,1,3
24,Mary Jo R.,"New York, NY",224,104,11,5.0,3/11/2018,"This cool speak easy has delicious drinks. Got there around 8 which was perfect so we could get a spot at the bar. It started to fill up shortly after we arrived, and it's a small place so it felt a little crammed. I got Another Girl, Another Planet and my boyfriend got Satellite of Love. They even have a late night happy hour from 2-4am!",1,,
25,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,705,1566,3.0,7/13/2017,"Lovers of Today is a backup bar, not a destination.Let me back up this review. It's a cute and divey spot, with low lights and beat up leather booths. I've only ever seen it sparsely occupied (8 pm on a weeknight) or totally packed (10 pm on a Saturday). Crowd is mid-to-late twenties. I could see this shining as a post-game. It fits the definition of ""low key East Village bar."" I wouldn't hesitate to use it if I were waiting on another bar in the area, but I wouldn't get excited to show this to someone either.Why? The cocktails, though more affordable than neighboring establishments at $13ish a pop, don't justify a visit for me. If you read the list twice, you realize that every drink is a variation on spirit, seltzer, sugar, and one basic flavor like lime or lavender. The drinks are usually decently mixed, though the last time I was here the alcohol tasted cheap.Nothing special for me.",3,,1
26,Lani W.,"Cambridge, MA",0,43,2,5.0,5/1/2018,"I love this spot, and I can't wait to come back! It's a cozy little speakeasy type of place with unique, without being too much, cocktails. Most ingredients are even house made! The bartender, JP? JR? (something with initials), is awesome. He's always patient and in control, which is hard in a place as tiny and packed as it is there. It has a cave-like atmosphere with lots of candles and low-lights. Music is questionable at times, but it's not a deal breaker and more likely my own personal taste-- it's never anything terrible or offensive. Sometimes it just doesn't fit the vibe the place gives off. [Like I would think either R&B or vintage rock, but I went and One Direction was playing.]All in all, its a great place.",,,
27,Ina M.,"Hackensack, NJ",357,456,998,5.0,12/6/2016,"What a cool hidden gem!This place is very small and intimate, but the drinks are truly amazing. I give it to the bartender, he was working by himself with a big crowd to cater to. It felt like a place to hide from all of life's circumstances and just enjoy the company of who you're with. Like a modern speakeasy. This is still a full bar, but don't be that person that gets a safe drink (like a beer). Try their specialty cocktails.",4,3,2
28,Mimi M.,"New York, NY",6,92,4,4.0,7/11/2018,Cute place... A nice start off point or a place to relax and unwind. I've been once and will pop in again for a low key drink.,,,
29,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,5.0,4/18/2017,"LOT is likely my favorite bar, ever. In an effort to please me (aka not have me feel as ""growsy aka groggy/drowsy"" as he said), tourguide @patch knew I would love this spot. However, I don't think he knew just how much LOT would be my spot. It is off the beaten path in East Village... not quite a speak easy, but not something you would ever walk into unless you know what it is. Down a dark alley/staircase, and can't see into it from the outside. Once inside, it has the dark, romantic, intimate, cozy, loungey feel that I love. It is very small, and can only seat about 6 at the bar, and maybe has 2-3 booths/tables. It has lots of candles, little lighting, but great ambience. We actually found a secret backroom (apparently it is normally hidden by a picture!), that was red, much brighter, with lots of books, but it was empty.... we will certainly have to discover at the next time. My absolute favorite part of this bar? Every song was a fun love song from the 60's-90's, and I just wanted to sing and dance along to all. Legit everysong, I was saying, ""This is my favorite song!!""The boys convinced me to get a whiskey drink (I don't drink whiskey), and it basically was love potion because after that I went from growsy, to ready to rumble. The drinks were creative, delicious, and potent. I can't quite put my finger on why, but this bar just hit me in all the right places and I am a little bit obsessed!",4,2,3
30,Rucha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",428,174,211,4.0,5/8/2017,"I'd say this place is more of a speakeasy-type bar than a lounge, and I'd also say I'm a pretty big fan. Lovers of Today is intimate and cozy, very dark, and offers a great choice of specialty cocktails for $13. It's a great place to chill and enjoy calmer music in a very small space with a friendly staff. The bartenders/mixologists can always make you a drink that's just for you if you let them know what you prefer. *They have a 2AM to 4 AM Happy Hour for the nights you really just want to have a drink in a low key setting away from the bustle of a larger bar! $9 for the cocktails, instead*They have small tables behind the bar stools and a booth off the the left of the entrance. This is not really a place I'd bring a large group of people, but a small group of friends or a date, instead. Check it out if you're in the East Village and definitely try any cocktail with lavender honey or blackberry preserves!",2,1,1

32,Amanda C.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",4,66,20,1.0,6/2/2018,I'm not sure why this bar got such good review... the cocktails were AWFUL-- I swear these are the worst cocktails I've had in NYC after living here for many years. The bartender was so overwhelmed; it took me up to 15 mins to get a drink each time -- she was clearly the only person working the bar and it just seemed severely under-staffed. The cocktails tasted like water and like they had no alcohol...I didn't even feel anything after a couple...the bartender SHOOK my old fashioned. There was a $20 cc minimum which they were strict about so we were forced to get more than one drink each even though we didn't want to (why is this legal?! Even my local bodega has a $4 cc min.) Ugh this was a terrible experience. AVOID.,1,,

About 10 drinks to pick from on the cocktail menu, but they were all pretty creative. I'm not much of a cocktail drinker, but i really enjoyed the (i'm gonna miss alot of these names lol) saturn-something and the hong kong-something LOL. Drinks are on the pricier side though if you're not on happy hour though, each are $13 for a tiny little glass. staff is friendly and helpful though, and checks are delivered in a cute little romance novel.",1,,1
34,Alex Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",631,471,2497,4.0,12/17/2016,Awesome little cocktail joint with a happy hour discount that is tough to beat. Cocktails priced at $7 until 8 pm. Atmosphere was pretty intimate with limited seating available. Signature cocktail selections were clearly listed on the glass board. Worked my way through 4 different ones and they were all pretty good. The one that left an impression was the Hong Kong Garden. It was sour and spicy in just the right way. I haven't had anything quite like it before. Would recommend giving this place a try if you're in the neighborhood.,4,1,3

36,Alex F.,"Norwood, MA",0,18,8,4.0,5/20/2018,Delicious cocktails on the menu. I disagree with a lot of the other reviews on this on how they are understaffed with 1 person at the bar. Yes there could probably be another person their especially on a packed Saturday but he knows what he's doing and sometimes you need a tiny break. 5 minutes was the longest I waited. I recommend the satellite of love. It's World War III for tables and chairs once you get there.,,,
37,Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",206,213,62,4.0,9/7/2017,"We had a wonderful time at Lovers of Today. The cocktails were delicious and well made. Each one is the same price ($13, I believe), and the Rumble is my favorite because who could pass up tamarind? We did notice a change in the cocktail quality between bartenders but to be honest, my drinks remained good throughout the evening. Contrary to others' experiences, we managed to get a booth when we arrived around 10 PM on a Saturday, so we had a comfy time! The ambiance was relaxing inside and we also enjoyed the patio area. The music was EXCELLENT. It seems like a nice bar for an intimate date night or drinks with friends if you don't have too many people with you.I'm not sure whether the bar in the back is related, connected, or entirely separate, but we snuck in there and it seemed cool, too! They ultimately closed it off, not sure if we caused that!",,,
38,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,4.0,12/29/2015,"So I'll start this review off by saying that I am obviously a huge fan of #hinge because that's where I had the pleasure of meeting hashtag Brian (who is the cutest boy in the world). If you or your friends are on any of the latest dating apps slash websites, this is a great first move. Dim lighting, cheapish-drinks, and a bartender with a hefty pour which is certainly helpful at easing the unavoidable tension. The ONLY issue with this as a first date is that you have to wander down a pretty creepy stairway / alley to get there which may cause your date to run before your even get to the bar. Cocktails are very reasonable at $12 - especially considering the speakeasy scene in the area. They have a wide selection of drinks that are ""love themed"". I particularly enjoyed the Handsome Devil. I watched our bartender make them, and he sure did not skimp out on the alcohol component. I definitely left significantly more tipsy than when I arrived. I enjoyed the old school music at the venue as well. There are only two booths and then there's one table tucked away in the back corner for a more intimate experience . . . .The space is very small, so I wouldn't recommend going with a large group - 4 people max.

Bartender wasn't very friendly (that might have to do with me stealing an orange from their bowl) but come on, it's a Saturday night and after a few drinks, I get a little silly. Even before that, it wasn't fun to watch a scowling bartender make our drinks. Angry vibes. Anyways, the place itself was pretty cool. Fun crowd, nice decor. I tried the Waterloo sunset and it tasted good but probably wouldn't order it again. The flavors were too confusing. I will perhaps come again to order another drink from another bartender.",1,5,2
41,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,4/21/2017,"I'm very into the speakeasy and speakeasy-style lounge circuit and try to get one at least once a month. I think they're some of the best date spots with their mysterious, exclusive nature and romantic, intimate ambiance.You have to go down a kind of creepy staircase and alley to get here which could be a turn-off to some and scare your date off a bit, but just reassure them that you know what you're doing. Compared to places like PDT (way overrated) and Dear Irving (my favorite), drinks are cheap here at around $12. There is a great cocktail menu and they make a mean spicy with tequila drink. The bartender (""mixologist"") is a bit of a performer as he (or she) assembles your drink and they definitely have a heavy hand when it comes to the liquor.There's some good background music playing. I can't tell you one specific song they played as it was seriously background noise, but I remember it adding to my experience. It's definitely not a large group place and is best set up for 2-4 people.You can probably get in here with minimal-to-no wait instead of the insane 2+ hours you'll need to stand by PDT to get into. This has inspired me to create a ""Best Speakeasies"" Yelp List that I'd suggest checking out as I've been to a lot and have some good tips.",4,1,1

The bartender, Alan, made for a wonderful experience here. He gave us a tutorial on old time cocktails from the Hemingway period, and proceeded to give us an array of specialty old-fashioned cocktails crafted with some of the most unique ingredients I had ever seen. He tailored each drink to my and my boyfriend's tastes, and we were very happy with all of them.I would recommend this place for a small gathering with friends, or an intimate date (just as long as it goes better than the one happening next to us..painful)We will most certainly be back!

Most of the special cocktails are delicious. The Astral Plane is a must for gin lovers (as I am). Friday nights are very tight here and I do not imagine that it would be a pleasant experience if you do not have a seat, especially if you are on a date. Lucky for us we were able to acquire a table after a few minutes. The two bartenders were very cool and energetic. However, due to the many of ingredients in the drinks, it can take a little while to get your drinks-especially if it is a weekend. I would just that you order doubles of your beverages.",,,
46,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3175,11030,5.0,4/4/2015,"I think I have a new favorite cocktail spot. Bonus points for also being a wondeful date spot. I came to Lovers of Today on the recommendation of a friend. It's downstairs in a random alley (I wouldn't agree that it's a speakeasy though...). It's dark inside with two big booths, two small tables, and a corner counter with some bar seating. Very quaint.All of their signature cocktails are written on the menu behind the bar. The ones I tried were:1) Hong Kong Garden - a cucumber-y, a little spicy, and very refreshing drink. So delicious.2) Rumble - made with tequila and tamarind chipotle grenadine3) Astral Plane - gin cocktail with herbs de provence and champagne. Super refreshing albeit a bit girly.4) Marquee Moon - made with blueberry preserves and vodka. On the sweet side, but well balanced.The bartenders are attentive and work really quickly for how in depth the cocktail recipes are.It's very non-pretentious (which is becoming more rare for NYC cocktail bars), but they don't skimp on quality or the thought they put into their recipes. A solid 5 stars!",3,,

Left and came back around 2:30 (they have late night happy hour from 2-4) Drinks could be a bit more diverse but they all seem like general crowd pleasers especially for the partying east village clientele. Service is great. Bartenders are accommodating despite being super busy. Super chill staff. Tip your bartenders well!",1,,
48,Jonathan M.,"New York, NY",15,15,6,4.0,5/18/2017,"So this is one speakeasy that I LOVE. It is a bit hard to find but once you do, you'll enjoy it. I'll explain...If you like small (there's a larger room in the back they open up once packed), intimate and decent priced, this is the place for you. The sitting areas are nice for groups with 2-3 booths in the main area with a seats off to the side. In the back area are tables with seating as well.Special cocktails are $12 but they have a special happy hour after 1AM or 2AM that are half off (there's a sign somewhere). Well drinks are cheaper than $12 (might be $8 but definitely cheaper). During the day there's a happy hour as well with mixed drinks being $4.Overall this is the place to go with a chill setting, chill crowd and not all that packed. Definitely a must go for speakeasies.",,,

It's around the corner from Niagra down the stairs.Once you find this place, it's very dimly lit with a few tables and cool bar setup. They had a bunch of signature cocktails written on the board, which is what we all went I with. I had two drinks. First, the Waterloo sunset. A bourbon based drink that was very good but I feel like it would be so much better during the fall. If you taste it, you'll get what I mean. The second drink was the marquee moon which was a vodka based drink and made me want to go back to the Caribbean.Both drinks were boozy and just fit the spot. I will return to this place if I'm ever in the area for some before dinner drinks.",,,

Truly enjoyed the drinks but the space became overly crowded and rowdier so we didn't stay after that first drink.  Would like to go back and try a different drink next time and will strive to be there for happy hour too.",,,

It's a very intimate, dimly-lit bar scene with variety of unique cocktails. Cocktails are priced at $13.00 but happy hour ranges from 4-8pm. My friend and I tried 4 different cocktails. They were all pretty decent, but my favorite was the teenage kicks since I like my cocktails more on the fruity side. The bartender/service was not the friendliest. Very unhelpful when asking for recommendations. Maybe it was because he was managing the bar by himself, but I also did approach him when the place was least busiest and there was no line.",,1,

57,Courtney W.,"Washington, DC",250,404,183,3.0,5/2/2017,"This place is pretty o-k. A divey / lounge style bar located down the stairs, semi-through an alley and in a basement location. The inside is dark, mysterious, and I suppose somewhat intimate based on the extremely limited space and seating. EXTREMELY limited. I believe a sign says the capacity is somewhere around 50 people... I would easily say that is false and should be restricted to 20. So take that to heart people in large groups or coming later! They do offer good happy hour prices on their cocktails, and they have quite a good list of specialty cocktails. Normal prices for cocktails are around $14, I believe on happy hour we got them for $8-9. There is one gender neutral bathroom , two tables / booths which could seat a semi-larger group, and at-the-bar seating. Come early or standing room only... although not much room to stand in. I only stopped in for one drink but it was delicious and strong.",1,,1

Santa Con had already happened earlier in the day and the sign outside read ""No Santas, Please."" That was pretty awesome. We walked down the stairs and found one of the small booths open and took it immediately. Ordered the Handsome Devil and the Another Girl, Another Planet. Both were pretty mild and sweet, but very good. We appreciated the use of more unique ingredients like lavender honey and jasmine flower extract. If you're gonna pay $12 for a cocktail, the ingredients better be quality and distinct.The music isn't too loud and they play a pretty eclectic mix of music. We actually had to leave after half an hour, because they were having a private party. However, the bartender was really nice about it and didn't try to whisk us out at all.Overall, Lovers of Today was pretty great and I'll definitely be back again. The drinks were well made, and the bartenders were very friendly. Pretty awesome low-key bar, if you're feeling a quality cocktail, but don't want to deal with needing a reservation or being placed on a waitlist.",6,1,1

The ratings below are for my personal preference, so make sure to take it with a grain of salt.VIBE:This place is packed, can get quite loud. But it is grungy in a cute way. However, because the entrance is through a basement-level alley, there are tons of smokers hanging out right outside, and you can definitely smell it inside. THE WAIT: Despite how small and packed it was, there was space for 5 of us at the bar (this was 11pm on a Saturday). After we ordered our drinks, a booth opened up. MUST-HAVES: HK Garden!* Hong Kong Garden (Gin, fresh lemon, honey, yuzu peppers, cucumber) - 4.5 starsSo interesting! This first hits you as a savory drink. Then you taste the cucumber and the refreshing bits. It doesn't seem spicy until the last few sips, when it more hits you at the back of your throat than on your tongue. I very much enjoyed this, especially how unique it was!* Fan Mail (aged rum, fresh lime, house made lavender honey, champagne) - 3.5 starsNot so much for me, as the champagne flavor dominated way too much. But if you like that, you will enjoy this drink (as my friend did).* Handsome Devil (silver tequila, fresh lime, house made lavender honey) - 3 starsMy boyfriend found this drink to be bland, not too interesting/memorable.",,1,

Although the company wasn't memorable, the bar left a lasting impression. Intimate, somewhat speakeasy-esq, but without the pretentious fussy vibes of some of the more well known establishments nearby. Cocktails are written on the wall next to the bar, but you'll be in good hands if you name a base spirit and chat up whoever is manning the bar as well (this is my preference).Go on an off night and get to know the staff.

There's a sign with a light up heart outside, but before dark, it's sort of hard to see. You walk down the stairs and then the door is to the right. It's super dark and takes a while for your eyes to adjust. They have the menu written on the wall behind the bar. Between my friend and I, we tried six different cocktails. They were all delicious. 100% would recommend. The wait time to order a drink was long, because for some unknown reason, they only have one bartender. By 8pm, the bar was really crowded, the tables were littered with empty glasses (there's no table service, you order from the bar), and the poor bartender seemed totally overwhelmed. I'm not taking off a star, because the bartender was very nice considering the situation, the drinks were great, and we still enjoyed ourselves, but I cannot imagine why a bar would be so understaffed on a Friday.",,,

Overall, I am glad I checked out Lovers of Today.  Will keep it in mind certainly for happy hour when walking around the village but in no rush to come back - likely because of the limited seating.  I imagine that this place gets quite busy late night on the weekends, so I'll probably be sticking to weekdays.",,,

You wouldn't know this place existed unless you had an unhealthy interest in walking down into someone's basement entrance. This is an underground bar with nothing more than christmas lights lining the entrance to the bar. After you make your way down to the bar, you notice the bouncer and the door to the bar (usually cranked wide open). Once you get in, there are a number of cocktails on a lit up sign behind the bartender that will pique your interest. Hong Kong Garden, Astral Plane and Waterloo Sunset are my faves. There are a few booth-like tables toward the back edge and bar seating as well. If you're in a big group, you might want to skip this place. However, if you're looking for a place to order a great drink, not deal with pretentious people and still impress the friend(s) you're with, check this place out.",1,1,

When I came it was a bit busy so unfortunately, the services weren't so great at all. There was a pretty rude bartender whom when I asked her what was the previous fruity looking drink she made, just told me ""Baby I am so busy here...blah blah.""

It's a small, dark bar in the cellar of a building but was the perfect escape from the oppressive humidity outside. My fiance and I each ordered two drinks during our visit. He went with gin-based drinks and I went with tequila. Both were excellent and refreshing and had a little something special to each of them.

It's a short walk down a flight of stairs between two buildings and the entrance will be on your right. Like one reviewer said, it's more a bar that serves than a cocktail bar. The good thing is you don't have to call in advance or wait in line like some speakeasys so it's a decent place to drop-in for a drink. The bad thing is the bartenders treat you like bartenders at clubs. They were rude and they made me a drink I really did not like. When I asked if I could get something else instead they seemed mortally offended and begrudgingly made me another and just thrust it at me.For me a large part of the speakeasy appeal is the service and the drinks and this place just didn't deliver.

117,Candice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,48,1,2.0,8/8/2015,"It was a relatively quiet Tuesday, and I stood at the bar for 10 minutes while the barkeep was chatting up his regulars. I'm fine with this, though slightly rude to ignore a new customer, I understand it's important to entertain your locals. After a while, I put in an order for their only two whiskey-based cocktails and ask if he could make them slightly less sweet, since they both contain either honey or grenadine. To my surprise, the bartender goes on a diatribe about how I shouldn't ask for alterations, frequently gesturing at his station and ranting, look at this place! Clearly, we know cocktails! I should trust the bartender to make a well-balanced drink. All the while I have this look on my face, eyes glazed over and looking through him, smiling and nodding and waiting for him to end his rant. His ego is clearly lilting dangerously on the edge, so I purr and say, I trust you bae, don't cry and shut the hole on your face. He does eventually, saunters off to talk to another customer for 5 minutes, then comes back to ask me for what I ordered again. Ok, broseph. I'm not even going to go into the fact that I've also bartended in NYC, and a simple request to make a sweet drink less sweet is not outrageous, and gesturing at your array of mediocre pseudo-artisanal syrups and bitters doesn't mean a thing, and your shitty tattoos don't negate the fact that you're a goddamn Neanderthal-bro in your heart of hearts, and that the East Village on the whole is inundated with bros who think a few tattoos will disguise them. So he makes the drinks, having to read the drink description on the wall because he hasn't committed the recipes to memory yet (niiiiice) and I also note that he doesn't use a Hawthorne strainer and leaves chunks of ice in the drinks that are supposed to be up and in coup glasses.

The cocktails were smooth, strong, and evenly poured. I liked the Fan Mail and especially appreciated how it was a consistent pour every time. The candlelit nook in the corner makes for a cozy spot to chat up a cutie.

I think if you're friendly and talkative with the bartenders they might make you a special something as I witnessed these two girls getting some interesting shot as we were paying our tab.    I got the Marquee Moon while the boyfriend got the teenage kicks.  His definitely had a stronger alcohol taste while mine tasted like sweet muddled berries which I like.  I definitely want to try more of these places as I don't venture into alphabet city much , but I think i would come back.",,1,1

140,Eric C.,"New York, NY",120,124,0,2.0,2/20/2013,It's the kind of place where they say they have cocktails but the bartenders are only there to execute on recipes.  I feel like anyone can do that.  My friend asked she could get another kind of drink/swap some stuff out from their menu but they don't do any of that stuff.  I get bar policy but there was also something about the bar staff attitude here.  As if they were just going through the paces.  Didn't seem like they were having any fun.I can't blame the establishment for it but people were just glued to the bar and not letting anyone pass.  It's a tough space to navigate in general so it didn't help.  I suppose it's the kind of place that attracts people who lack bar etiquette.I don't know.  There are just better places in the neighborhood.  Although I did like the fact they had their drink menu in big letters on a sign above the bar.  That was nice.,2,,

Not.The bar is pretty small but it feels cozy once you get acquainted.  The bartender, Reynolds, is pretty awesome to chat with.  He created the drink menu at the bar and I've heard at other bars around the village as well.  If you don't know what you want, tell him what you like and don't like and wam bam thank you maym you'll have a drink sitting in front of you in about 5 minutes.It was a bit loud the night I was here (band playing upstairs) but normally it's pretty quiet which is prefect for a date spot or catching up with family/friends.The drinks run around $13 each but if you become a regular and get to know the bartender...*wink wink cough cough clap clap snap snap.

Finding it was a little anti-climactic. The place itself was small,  dark and sexy filled with mysterious corners for a romantic tryst. It looks like a smaller version of Little Branch. The drinks had amusing namesof course as every speakseasy usually does. They were ok tasting, nothing special really. It felt like they didnt really put that much effort into the drinks. It got really loud after awhile, it may just be the crowd that one particular night. The speakeasy next door did not help as there were a bunch of hipster looking kids hanging right outside smoking.

149,Sara B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,1,4.0,2/23/2013,"This place became an EV staple for me - I've been on numerous dates and friendly outings here and this place works for both. It's tiny, so I wouldn't recommend rolling with a huge crew, unless you arrive earlier in the evening and can secure one of the much-coveted leather booths. I would also recommend it as a post-first-date spot since it can get really loud...probably not conducive to already awkward first date conversations. Also, I prefer this spot during the week (less packed). I've yet to have a bad cocktail, nor a weak cocktail, here! If you like an Old Fashioned, try their version - I can't quite put my finger on the exact ingredient or preparation that makes it different, but it's quite delicious! They also have a lot of wonderful light, bright drinks that hit the spot in warmer weather. I will say that one or two of the bartenders I have encountered here can be a bit short, or seemingly apathetic, but I usually chalk it up to how many customers they have to serve. The male bartender with long-ish curly hair, though, is always in a good mood and he is the one you should ask if you want something off-menu. He has the skills to make something delicious if you give him the type of liquor and flavors that you enjoy in a drink.",1,1,

No signs, black metal gating, a man that checked IDs, and some dark stairs.Then on the first right, a small candle lit bar. It only has about 5 tables and seats 25 at most. It is simple and unpretentious compared to the other cocktail stalwarts, Death and Co/Mayahuel/Cienfuegos. There is no long wait or need to give your phone number so they could call when you when a table opens up (which feels a lot like Outback Steakhouse giving you a plastic buzzer). There is no elaborate 10 page menu. The cocktails are posted above the bar, about 15 drinks with their 4-5 components that are named after songs at $12 each. Beers go for $5-6.While I do not remember the names, the drinks are absolutely top notch and very comparable to the other expensive cocktail speak easies.

We stopped in on a Sunday evening and let the bartender make us whatever he thought was good. He asked us what flavors we tend to like most. I said sweet and sour and my husband said spicy and smokey. He came back with two of the most delicious off-menu cocktails, he got it perfect! We were so impressed we stayed for two more rounds. All of them were excellent! You can tell mixology is the bartender's passion. He took tremendous pride in each cocktail like it was a piece of art. We were impressed. They make their own Limoncello in house too. 4 stars because there is no kitchen and only one bathroom and a tad pricey for the neighborhood. Truly a nice place though, worth a visit!",2,,

Fortunately my expert on NYC secret drinking had a lovely alternative in mind.Nestled below some sort of brick and mortar store lies this gem of a cocktail bar. Lovers of Today is not just some hipster, speakeasy-esque watering hole. They take their cocktails VERY seriously and create some of the most delicious drinks I have ever had. Like a lot of other places in the East Village, there isn't a whole lot of space in here. It's dark, dingy, and dramatic with punk music you've probably never heard of blasting loudly through the iPhone-fed speakers. The end of the bar had about 10 plastic containers that looked as if they were filled with pickled eggs, but the bartender informed me that it was house made grenadine.The bar also specializes in a number of other housemade concoctions. The Waterloo Sunset, my favorite drink of the night, contained chamomile infused bourbon, honey and bitters. The presentation was rather utilitarian, but the flavor was all there. I would go as far and say that this was quite possibly one of the greatest things that has ever graced my stress filled, alcohol deprived lips. The second drink I went with was the macadamia manhattan. I was expecting something a bit on the sweet side, but this was just a very well made manhattan with the slightest hint of macadamia bitters added for complexity. It was a nice little twist on this location-appropriate drink.And of course, one of the other things that really sets Lovers of Today apart from the rest of the secret-drinking scene in NYC is the lack of a douchey attitude. The bartender was extremely friendly, very proud of the work he was doing, and genuinely interested in teaching others about his craft. 5 stars all around.",4,1,1

This happens about 50% of the time, but most likely it's due to the fact that, in my old age, I'm going to bars earlier and earlier.  I'm perfectly happy to go here for just one drink, and enjoy it slowly in a corner booth.  Unfortunately, it's not possible to do that when this tiny joint is teeming with other sweaty east villagers, who are also in on the secret.  The drinks are really fun, and super tastily crafted by very cool mixologists in costumes, who use floral and herbaceous infusions.  For this reason, you really need a seat to enjoy this place.  So if there are no available seats, you should probably leave and come back later (or earlier).",7,5,6

Although reviews keep saying its in a hidden alley but it's actually wrapped around the corner behind Niagara bar. Please don't go the wrong way and end up in an actual alley like we did !2) NameSomething is with this place because for some reason I can't seem to get the name right.I keep confusing it with "" Friends of Today "" or "" Lovers of Friends.""3) They got a drink named after my hometownWhere the ""Friends"" came from, I don't actually know. What I do know is that they serve a drink called Hong Kong Garden. I love my hometown, but I have never imagined it as a place exotic enough to be named after a fancy cocktail, Examples of exotic places to me:  Fiji or Bora Bora. Or they could have took it further and named it "" pearl orient of the east"" or "" crouching tiger hidden phoenix"" instead. All things aside, the drinks were satisfactory..cucumber was very refreshing and I'm sure it had Ginger or some Asian ingredient in it hence the name.4) Tiny spacePacked like sardines. Don't bring large groups. Maybe I'll come here earlier in the week with a small group and give it another shot.",1,1,

Updated review","So I still love the vibe of this place and they have some great unique drinks. That said...The main problem with this place is the skinny bearded guy who's behind the bar most of the time. As in, he actually has no idea how to make a cocktail other than the formula that's been laid out by whoever crafted the menu. And he's kind of a douche. Overall I've had good times here with friends. But I just keep seeing this guy rudely refuse to make any simple changes to drinks, like cutting simple syrup for someone who's a diabetic and acting indignant about it. This is not him having a bad day, but something I've seen over several visits. He actually told a friend of mine ""I make them how I make them"". And don't ask for something off menu, because he'll act like a broken robot. Again, he is not really a cocktail bartender. Honestly I'm being nice still affording this place 3 stars. Luckily I'm not someone who automatically downgrades to 1 star on service alone. Still on the list but you could also find a better option here....yelp.com/list/best-cockt…",7,6,5

Suddenly she remembered a place she'd been once before, and when she started to lead the way I asked ""are you sure we're not going to Niagara?"" No, you turn the corner, descend a set of stairs into an alleyway, and make a right turn into the coolest, New Yorkiest, sexiest little bar I've ever been to. It's cozy, just dark enough, and feels alluringly hidden away. The drinks are all named after songs; being a Kinks fan I opted for a Waterloo Sunset. My friend and I whiled away the evening at the bar, talking and drinking and silently feeling thrilled that we were in the perfect bar.My only regret: that I didn't go here with a gentleman friend before I moved out of New York last week-- the space is quite conducive to a romantic evening with someone you're fond of.Tip: get here before 9PM and you won't have trouble getting a table or a seat at the bar.",,,1

185,Andre F.,"Charlotte, NC",103,36,6,5.0,1/11/2014,Waterloo sunset is the best on the cocktail menu.  Order on Saturday and get a free cocktail coin!,,,
186,David W.,"New York, NY",167,834,0,4.0,6/23/2010,"A real cool place that just opened up a few months ago that replaced what used to be Tiki Room.  It's a pretty small space, maybe 5 tables or so, and another 10 seats at the bar if that.The reason to come here is for the cocktails.  The bartender Reynolds is awesome, really friendly, and really good at coming up with some creative drinks.  All of the listed cocktails are named after songs from old New York bands (including the name of the place) which makes it even more interesting.  If for some reason none of the listed drinks interest you, the bartender will make something especially for you, just give him a little direction and he'll whip up something good.The place doesn't get too loud during the week, so it's a great spot to sip on a $12 cocktail while chatting with a friend or the bartender.",4,,2
187,Kat W.,"New York, NY",20,138,5,3.0,9/26/2013,Another cocktail bar on a long list of cocktail bars springing up in the city. This place is super low-key and great for a date! For those with claustrophobia - it's a tiny place and can get crowded easily but it comes in waves.,,,
188,Amie R.,"Manhattan, NY",299,103,62,4.0,7/2/2012,"i absolutely love the site of random bouncers standing outside of unassuming, inconspicuous doors. if you look for it, you will see it more often than you think. personally i enjoy the mystery.. what is behind that door? a secret dinner club? a brothel? a drug ring? underground music? gambling? the options are limitless, and i am game.i had never heard of this place before Saturday night when my friends and i were stumbling around the East Village figuring out our next move. it is found a few doors down from Niagara. when walking down the stairs, 'Lovers of Today' is the first bar on the right. if you walk to the back you will find 'Cabin Down Below' (another speakeasy). how random that you walk down the stairs into an alley!? so nyc. lovers of today gets 3 stars for the name alone! such a great name for a bar. on top of that, the space is just awesome. it's a lot more low key than other speakeasies and while it has cocktails, it also has many beers. basically a bar/speakeasy mutation. it's small, dark and fun. perfect spot to start the night, or end it. lover of today, and lover of lovers of today!",3,1,2
189,Brianne S.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,210,0,5.0,12/16/2010,"Holy shit these cocktails are good. Pricey, but good. My only question is whether this place is open when the gate is closed? Went over the summer and it was half open so we snuck in. I got whatever cocktail is infused with lavender and honey... mmmmm.I love the basement, and the decor is so chic. The little booths give a vintage feel and I love any place that uses mirrors efficiently. 4 stars for the drink, a fifth for the awesome decor. So romantic. You will get laid if you bring your date here.",1,1,
190,Monica T.,"New York, NY",88,635,574,4.0,4/30/2011,"Very nice little place, we came here for a drink and lucky us we got a table ;) I got the hong kong garden,Hah another nice little place in the LES.. we were lucky to get a table right when we get in around 11or so on Friday. Got up to the bar and ordered HongKong Garden, and 2 other drinks. I had no clue what we ordered but it was very good. I liked the HK garden because it has a little cucumber in it, very refreshing... would come back to chill after i try all over speakeasys!! =)",,,
191,Jason W.,"New York, NY",1,7,0,2.0,11/22/2011,"Cool bar.  Great vibe.  Easy to get into.  Subpar drinks.  You can definitely do better at almost any other cocktail joint in the village.I've been twice, and the first time was OK, but nothing memorable.  The most recent visit I had the Tequila drink with fresh lime, and honey.  I wasn't expecting greatness, but what I got was barely drinkable.  Way too much lime, which led to a quite bitter drink.  Just not balanced at all.  It also wasn't nearly cold enough.I would definitely recommend Death & Co, Mayahuel, or Sumitt Bar over this one.",,,
192,Kristina C.,"New York, NY",49,192,2,5.0,8/5/2012,"Came here on a date after dinner nearby. I had tried to find it a few weeks earlier but failed miserably due being on the wrong block (oops!). This time we easily walked through the black gate and down the stairs into this hidden gem. Atmosphere was laid-back, no doorman, plenty of seats. It is tiny though so not ideal for groups bigger than 4 ppl. Cocktails were excellent and at $12, around that of their fellow speakeasy prices. Definitely will be back!!",1,,1
193,Jeff D.,"New York, NY",11,22,0,2.0,5/8/2011,"Been here before on a weeknight and thought it was great.  It's one of the few speakeasies in the city you can expect to just walk into without a wait or name on a list.I went last night (Saturday) and although the rock vibe is cool, I found one thing in particularly lacking: the cocktails.For a speakeasy, the #1 thing I grade them on is the quality of their mixed drinks. In this case, the gin-based lime slushy I had with a cucumber on top just tasted like lime juice. acidy, harsh, not gonna get you drunk lime juice.  maybe it was just the night, or the bartender (who was annoying too), but it didn't make me want to come back.",,,
194,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",36,53,3,3.0,3/15/2012,"Great drinks but smells like ass....literally. I went there with two friends and it smelled like a dirty diaper.  The drinks were really good but we left as soon as we could gulp them down because we couldn't bear the smell.  Not sure if they had a sewer problem or a really stinky patron, but either way it drove us out of there. Sorry, Lovers...I am not sure I would return.",1,2,1
195,Rainer F.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,34,0,4.0,7/18/2013,"Lovers of Today is a great place to grab a few cocktails at the end of a date. Be careful though because it's pretty expensive. There is seating available inside, but it's very limited. Make sure that you show up early to beat the rush. Another complaint would be that the music was just a little too loud - it was kind of counterproductive to the intimate environment.",,,
196,Tom T.,"South Windsor, CT",88,136,166,4.0,12/3/2012,"Fantastic drinks, chill atmosphere but limited space. Good in between joint.",,,
197,Bryan G.,"Manhattan, NY",384,51,2,4.0,4/23/2012,"Great cocktail bar. Kind of small, so come on an off night for a perfect end to a date. Its very dark and cozy. The cocktails are amazing. They cook down their own aromatics for a very authentic experience. Do not go here and order a vodka tonic. You will look stupid.",1,1,
198,Bekah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,83,4,3.0,5/13/2012,"My friend lives down the street from here and had seen people lining up outside a strange, signless gate several times late in the evening. Unsure of what it was, we decided to check it out one night and were pleasantly surprised to find the small, darkly lit speakeasy that is Lovers of Today.I can't remember which cocktail he tried, but I went for the vodka blueberry flavored drink and was pleasantly surprised by how light and refreshing it was. I would rather spend $3 more for the blueberry cobbler from Apotheke, but the atmosphere here is a little more relaxed and youthful. Unfortunately we weren't able to snag a table, but we got a spot standing in the corner and only had to worry about someone swinging the bathroom door opening and clipping my date on the back of the head.Given that the location is also not as far off the beaten path as Apotheke, I'm definitely returning to try the rest of the menu!",1,,
