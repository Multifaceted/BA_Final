0,Aly M.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,148,167,5.0,11/12/2018,"Came here for a drink with friends on a Friday around 5pm. Was able to get a seat at the bar but I think it was because it had only recently opened (it got busy fast). I had a delicious craft IPA that I cannot remember the name of and the polenta corn bread with honey butter. This is not your average cornbread! Delicious and savory, almost like a pastry. The real draw of this place is the location and historic charm of the interior. The location is in a somewhat desolate area in the tiny neighborhood of Vinegar Hall on a quiet, pretty block. Finding it, you feel like you are in on a well kept secret. I couldn't help but imagine myself a worn and weary soldier of the Revolution stumbling upon this place...  the warm glow of the Vinegar Hill House feels like a beacon of light, especially on a cold night. Inside, make sure to check out the backyard, and basement tables- I was quite surprised to find extra seating down there! Bathrooms are on both floors.",,1,1
1,Krystal P.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,35,0,5.0,10/7/2018,"Brilliant execution.I've been for brunch, and had the pear sourdough pancake, omelette, and potatoes. The cook on everything was impressive, and flavors scrumptious. While not the most accessible location, this is somewhere I'd trek it to every once in a while to treat myself to a reliably great meal.",,,
2,Eva Z.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,9/30/2018,"I came here for dinner tonight with a couple of friends hoping to enjoy a ""farm-to-table"" type experience. Upon our arrival, we were asked to wait 10 minutes to be seated at a table that had already been open, set, AND reserved for us. Once we were finally seated, our waitress poured us a half-empty glass of water and proceeded to tell us which items on the menu were no longer available this evening, which just so happened to be all of the ones my friends and I were interested in trying. The waitress took off and didn't return for another 30 minutes to take our order from the remaining half of the menu. Of course, by the time she had arrived, yet another one of my selections was no longer available. I wonder why...Alas, I was left to order the  ""cheeseboard,"" Field Greens Salad, and cornbread for the table to share, and the Market Fish as an entree. The food was brought to the table another 30 minutes later, exactly at the point when all of us were starving. The ""cheeseboard"" was nothing to write home about and the cornbread was halfway decent--a bit too bitter for my taste. However, three bites into the field greens salad was when I realized that the main ingredient (the ham) was nowhere to be found. I brought this to the waitress' attention who then called the manager over and apologized to us for the waitress' inability to communicate that they had yet again run out of another item on the menu. At this point, I was left to wonder--how does one have enough salad, but not enough ham? Hmmm?Our entrees arrived 15-20 minutes after our appetizers. At last, we've made good time! I took a few bites of my fish which came with a calamari ragout and my mouth was parched from how salty it was. It tasted as though the fish was captured in the Dead Sea and then broiled in the tears of a chef who had just failed out of culinary school. Finally, the bill came and the manager was courteous enough not to include the half-assed salad we had ordered as our starter. Overall, this may have been one of the worst dining experiences of the hundreds I've had in New York. I came for ""farm to table"" and instead, I got a bull in a china shop.",2,4,
3,Kana K.,"Philadelphia, PA",100,242,191,2.0,10/6/2018,"I went for breakfast and sat at the counter. I don't know why the couple with their baby sitting next to me were at the counter and not occupying one of the open tables, but they were palpably upset because they had been waiting over 45 minutes for their food. The bartender serving the counter seemed agitated over their situation. He definitely was distracted. But, you know, he remembered to smile when it was time to pay.My pancake arrived quickly, but was cold. The coffee was also not so fresh.",,,
4,Luna L.,"Parker, CO",20,18,4,5.0,11/10/2018,"At first I wasn't sold on the snooty attitudes and (I'm a very picky eater) lack of menu options. However, our server was really sweet and I ordered the sourdough apple pancake and WOW!!!!! Let me just tell you, that's one of the best breakfast items I've ever had! It was one of my favorite places I went to in New York and highly recommend going. It's very charming.",2,,1
5,Lisa A.,"San Francisco, CA",11,1,0,3.0,11/14/2018,"These 3 stars are for the chicken liver mousse and ambiance which I crave all winter long.  I've been coming to here since 2012 and have never had a negative experience until last week.  But alas, it was truly disappointing, especially since it's always a special trip from the city to be there. The hostess was unfriendly, our server was unknowledgeable and the food was subpar.  I honestly couldn't believe it.  We kept ordering more dishes thinking that the last was a fluke!  I've never written a yelp review but I was so disheartened and bothered by everything that I felt it was warranted.  Hope you get it back together VHH- I still love your mousse!",,,
6,Alia G.,"Henderson, NV",206,448,500,3.0,9/21/2018,"Quaint, Cute, Rustic in what I imagine is an up-and-coming-redevelopment-area.We arrived about 15 minutes before the door opened so we decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. It was quiet with a feel of ""please come and take me over and make be beautiful"" vibe to it.  I don't know... it's just a feeling.Anyways... when we walked back to the restaurant right when they opened, there were 6 other people standing in line out front.  Darn... guess we should have just waited, we would have been the first ones in.  Ha!  We were seated immediately upon walking in, so no worries. The building was a home, so that when you walk in ... what I imagine was the parlor is now home to several 2-tops and 4-tops that can be arranged depending on your party size.  We opted for the garden seating out back since the weather was so nice. The tables and chairs are what you might find in... surprise, surprise... a garden.  The ground is a little uneven.. cuz you are in a back yard setting ... so the table and chairs may wobble a bit.  Use your core and stabilize your chair. It's not that hard.Service was cordial, but a couple times we had to flag someone down to get more water.  The food was ok.... my BIL and I had the eggs benedict which were a little lackluster in presentation IMO.  No small slices of fruit or a couple little berries or greenery to jazz up the plate... just the eggs benedict.  I should have taken a picture but I was super hungry and just dug in as soon as it arrived.  The eggs and prosciutto were fantastic tho!  It was served on an English muffin so ... not anything out of the ordinary. Hubby had the shrimp and grits which I got a small bite of and it was super creamy.  The BIL's GF had a green salad and a side of bacon.   The salad was nothing special but the bacon was tasty since she shared a piece with me. Portions were average.  So, if you are starving and are thinking that Brunch here is going to be your only meal of the day... I'd say order a couple dishes.  On the flip side, they don't give you huge portions so that you overstuff yourselves to a glutinous mass. Which in reality, we really should be more mindful of our portion sizes.  Anyways... This place is cute and a great place to come that is OUT of the hustle and bustle of the city, so if you are looking for a place that is quiet... this is the place.  If you are looking to get your BRUNCH ON with hearty portions and a lively atmosphere, you may want to try somewhere else.",2,,
7,David C.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,7,2,3.0,8/28/2018,"Back when my wife and I could still pretend that we were cool, we lived in Downtown Brooklyn in an area near Vinegar Hill, and could walk to this restaurant from our apartment. We did so once for brunch and again for dinner. The short review is that my wife thinks the place is great and cozy. I think the place charges too much given the size of its portions, and the quality (while perfectly good) is not sufficient to make up the difference. When we visited for brunch, my wife ordered some kind of fruit pancake and I ordered sausages and an omelette. When the food arrived, however, it felt like it was one portion too small. I encourage you to look at the pictures other folks have provided. The little kitschy dishes and plates featured in the pictures are actually not as large as you think they are; they simply photograph well and the real size is apparent when you compare the pictures to something that can't be easily miniaturized, like a fork or a bag of potato chips.  The same thing happened when we visited for dinner.  All of this could be forgiven if the taste of both meals was something particularly unique or amazing, but I think you can get equally good food at a number of other places (without having to walk to Vinegar Hill). The really distinguishing feature of the restaurant is its atmosphere. It feels tucked away (because it is), and happening upon Vinegar Hill (the neighborhood) while wandering around Brooklyn feels like you traipsed through the looking glass into something special and untouched. This restaurant distills that feeling into a meal by presenting you with food while nestling you in rustic scenery in a small space in the middle of that neighborhood.Put simply, I think this is a place where you bring a date or an acquaintance (assuming your partner is willing to make the trek).  It is not a place to go eat. But, again, I was not a cool person back then. And I am not one now. I just wanted food.",2,1,
8,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",169,571,866,5.0,5/26/2018,"4 stars for great food: squid ink pasta, kale panzanella salad and the beet dish were all very delicious, fresh and light!5 stars for superb atmosphere. The backyard is so lovely, shady, and enjoyable. Absolutely worth the trip to Vinegar Hill to score a table in this yard.",2,1,2
9,Esther S.,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",114,38,232,4.0,5/9/2018,"Delicious food! I ordered the asparagus, beets and Brussels sprouts for the table and had the Pan roasted chicken as my main entree. Everything was perfectly seasoned and very flavorful. The chicken was tender and moist with a wonderful thin crispy skin. The caramelized onions and sprig of thyme were the perfect touch..Served right in the pan! I tried the homemade sodas and they were absolutely refreshing! For dessert I had a cup of coffee and the olive oil cake which was the perfect finish to a well rounded meal. Good service,Fresh food and a cozy ambience. Parking was very easy to find so it's def worth giving this place a try if you're in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn!",4,,
10,Yuli M.,"New York, NY",0,7,2,5.0,6/27/2018,"This place is perfect for date night. The food was exceptional -- everything we had was on point. We ordered: charred octopus, roasted beets, market fish (Bronzino), and the squid ink tajarin. They have an outdoor space as well so perfectfor summer. Enjoy!!",,,
11,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,4.0,8/23/2017,"Made a reservation for dinner Monday night for a quiet meal in a new area. Restaurant is tucked away in what looks like a normal home, including a quaint outdoor area optimal for summer nights.After spraying ourselves down with insect repellent (free of charge), ordered the Roasted Shishito Peppers ($12) and a couple glasses of red ($12 each) to start. Peppers are marinated and covered in a tangy spice; easy to eat and more than enough to get the appetite going for two people. Wine is strong, as we tried not to finish the glass while waiting for the food (about 25 minutes). For the main course, decided on the Cast Iron Chicken ($29) - a large half chicken marinating in a supremely lemony broth and a few heirloom potatoes. The chicken is tender, with crispy skin to give a nice balance. I found the lemon taste to be a tad overwhelming halfway into the meal, but didn't want to mess the dish up with hot sauce.To finish off, had some Alpage Sbrinz cheese ($7) and a coffee ($3.50). Cheese is very similar to parmesan, a fine pairing with the jam and select crackers. La Colombe coffee is always amazing.Considering the amount of food ingested, the price wasn't as bad I thought it would be. Service takes its time, but came often to check on us and the food was definitely well-prepared (not thrown in an oven). Would like to sit indoors next time if not too crowded.",2,,2
12,William J.,"New York, NY",276,112,78,3.0,5/20/2018,"Vinegar Hill House was named as having some of the best pancakes in NYC by Eater NYC, although only ranking 10 out of the top 15. Their sourdough starter is allegedly 60 years old. I'm on a bit of a quest to find the best pancakes in NYC and found these rather disappointing. The sourdough had a nice tang to offset the sweetness of the maple syrup and there was a very healthy dollop of butter on top for good measure, but presentation was decidedly lacking and the pancake was immediately made soggy by the syrup bath. It seemed like pretty average diner pancake fare.Aside from the disappointing pancakes, the place had a nice vibe to it, reminiscent of something out of the historic part of Boston. It's got a certain rustic charm. There's no signage visible from the street so it's easy to miss, my taxi driver actually couldn't find it at first, and perhaps that's why I really hadn't needed to make that reservation. Either that or 11am on a Saturday is before the brunch rush, although that's certainly not been my experience at other places in my pancake quest.",,,
13,James Z.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",50,2,0,1.0,9/29/2018,We came here with reservations it took ten minutes to seat us. We got seated with a couple who just walked in. Then the waitress takes their order ignores us for ten minutes mean while the couple next to us got their food finished and paid for their meal before a single plate touched our table. This is in a 1 hour timeline from the moment we were seated. The only consolation was that the food was great. My wife was so excited to finally try this place but I have to say we were thoroughly disappointed. I would have given 0 stars but the food gave some redemption.,,1,
14,Roger W.,"Manhattan, NY",49,1,0,1.0,9/21/2018,"Bad service! Was there for my birthday with 18 friends and it was awful.  Overpriced, charged me 75$ a person family style and there was not enough food. Few to no vegetarian options, broken chairs. They had us in the garden sitting at makeshift tables and made some of the guests sit on the edge of a planter with low bad rickety tables. One guest who is tall couldn't even get his legs under the table because he was sitting on edge of high planter. A truly awful experience!",,2,
15,Dessert Correspondents O.,"New York, NY",10,94,0,4.0,10/1/2018,"Trek past the dense tourist crowds loitering at the foot of DUMBO, past cobblestone streets into a sleepy little street and you shall stumble across a quaintly rustic hideaway. One pancake swallowing the diameter of the plate upon which it is served, flat and dense in texture, crispy edges softened by caramelized bananas embedded within, this is the homely pancake that you could cook...if only you could bother turning on that stove at home. Aye, why bother when someone else can do it for you?",,,
16,Martina C.,"Long Island City, NY",61,269,198,5.0,7/2/2017,"Magic. I had dinner with two friends here last night and we were over the moon by the time we taste the first few plates we ordered. We decided to share lots of small plates because we weren't sure what to eat, and I think we won, because we were able to taste more than an usual dinner. Every single choice was incredibly tasty between the acid vinegar salad, the grilled smoky octopus, the delicate asparagus with ricotta, fresh prosciutto and sweet warm cornbread. We all got glasses of different roses and they were all good as well. To end, we shared a slice of chocolate Guinness cake with a top layer of cream cheese frosting, which was surprisingly really light! Not sweet at all, just cacao. Amazing. Can't wait to come back!",1,,1
17,Sam K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",134,190,351,3.0,2/20/2018,"Vinegar Hill house is in a pretty remote location unless you live in Dumbo. It's been on my list of places to try, but always fell off at decision making time for its small menu. What's crazy though is that in my recent travels on two separate occasions, someone has recommended that I go as soon as I mentioned I lived in Brooklyn- so back to the top of my list it went.I arrived at 10:45 on a Sunday (they open at 10:30) so there were still plenty of 2 tops available and no wait. I beat the person I was meeting, so I sat that the bar for a drink, and read through the NYTimes style section that they had sitting out to flip through. When we sat, the waiter suggested that the top ordered item was their pancake so we ordered that, eggs Benedict and a side of potatoes since the eggs came solo. The pancake was for sure delicious, smothered in a big scoop of butter with apples baked in. Eggs were yummy but nothing to rave about at their $17 price tag. We enjoyed our meal, but I wouldn't be running back unless I found myself in the area at brunch time.",,,

20,Kyle B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,12,1,3.0,9/1/2018,"I'll start by saying that the service and backyard were excellent. I've read so many good reviews about this place, but not worth the hype.

21,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,4.0,3/30/2017,"I've been here twice for brunch, and both times were amazing. The place felt very homey, but a little small because depending on where you sit, you could be pretty close to your neighbor.  Both times we got the sourdough pancake and pork and grits. Sourdough pancake here could arguably be the best pancake I've ever had. Pulled pork in pork and grits was tender, juicy, and flavorful, and perfectly complimented by the grits and tomato sauce. Both times those dishes were sooo good that I don't think I'd want to try other dished from them.  One note tho, the first time we came, it was a male server and he was VERY slow on everything, I had to wave him down multiple times to get coffee and water refilled, and order our stuff. The second time we were seated on the other side of the restaurant and a lovely lady was our waitress, and she was on point, quick, and very nice. The inconsistency in service is the reason I trimmed on star off them. Maybe train the male server a bit more?",12,13,12
22,Shambavi K.,"Chicago, IL",280,566,851,4.0,10/5/2017,Over all 3.7 stars. Take F train to york ave stop. Cozy rustic spot to gather small group of friends for dinner. The menu is limited but all pretty good. Our group of 5 probably shared half the menu. I can't say anything was sooo awesome that would entice me to order again but most items were done well and satisfying. The prices are higher than expected and the location feels remote and easy to miss.The skillet corn bread topped with butter is large enough to share (I would not get this if I was sharing with just 1 person).The roasted chicken was tender and the onions were good. The pork loin was super tender and served medium well with large slices and side of beans.  The chicken liver mousse was pretty good with caramelized onions on toasted bread. The manicotti was personally my least liked. Everyone else loved it. It wasn't bad at all but I'm just not a huge pasta fan. The tomato salad was refreshing and light. The octopus was good but forgettable...i think it had corn and chickpeas that lightened the dish. We tired the Guinness chocolate cake with was rather very good. The other panacotta with smoked strawberry had actually more savory notes.I didn't care for the cocktail menu so I opted for wine..i got a voigner but I didn't like it. The staff was attentive and friendly. Certainly pleasantly  surprising experience given the location.,3,1,3
23,Maria L.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,6,2,5.0,4/22/2018,Great food. Apple pancakes were SO DELICIOUS! My family had to catch a flight and we were pressed  for time and they were so attentive to the time sensitivity.PLUS FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!,1,,1

27,Yiannis C.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,7/14/2018,"We came for a dinner on Saturday night. The place is small and extremely loud. We ordered the octopus as an appetizer and it proved to be good. I ordered the pork chops and it turned out to be severely undercooked. The chef had obviously no clue about hygiene standards when it comes to cooking pork. I asked them to cook that well done, as it was pork, and not beef. They returned the dish to me slightly better cooked, but still undercooked. Finally, the prices did not correspond to what we got, as it was clearly overpriced. We will not come back.",,1,
28,Daniel S.,"Brooklyn, NY",211,89,10,2.0,3/9/2018,"The only thing that was good here was the cornbread. Now that they took it off the menu, this place isn't really worth the trip. Everything is extremely overpriced. The chicken tastes good, but is not worth $30. We also tried their market fish- it was nicely seasoned but the price to portion ratio will leave you wondering why you ordered the fish.In conclusion, if you have dinner here, you'll be leaving this place broke and hungry.",,,

Updated review","Went here a couple of years ago and loved it so much that we were so excited to enjoy another uniquely exquisite brunch this Sunday.  We did check out some newer reviews that were critical of the service...but as long as the food quality was the same then we could endure a somewhat-justified attitude.  Alas, it had not been.  They are completely resting upon their once-earned laurels and the awards posted by the front door.  Nothing was beyond mediocre:  shakshukah,  pancakes, omelette - even the toast was average and not worth the travel time or price.Like a once good wine...it's turned to vinegar (and yes - that just came to me).",3,,

33,Hector H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,18,4,4.0,4/21/2018,"This restaurant made me feel very beautiful to sit in. My girlfriend and arrived when all of New York decided to eat at 7pm on a Wednesday (the nerve of all of them, right?). One of the servers was so sweet and did this priestly (like man of the cloth and not man of 90210) thing where he clasped his hands when he had tentative news like ""your table's not ready yet."" But, he always had a ""but"" (like man who uses conjunctions and not man who uses his rear) and was ready to accommodate with an option that would make us feel comfortable. We had wine, Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Cannellini Bean Panzanella, and Roasted Beets. I recommend all of them. When Father Waiter came and asked if we had allergies I told him but also added that I'm allergic to horses. It's true and he laughed which he didn't need to but it helped me digest. Later my girlfriend told me that horses and camels aren't species-related so I could probably take a camel ride in my future. There was that to look forward to when we got the bill and moved out of the restaurant and back into the camel-trotting world.",1,1,1

Probably would have been better if the honey and butter were in the side.Overall, the service was friendly and food came out fast.  A little disappointed in the food.  On the pricey side for the quality of food you are receiving.",1,,

55,Suzanne C.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,23,8,3.0,7/11/2017,"Yikes!  I generally only write stellar reviews, but I was a bit disappointed after the experience I had last night.  I debated writing about it, but then I came to read some recent reviews and I realized that others were having some not so good experiences, so I figured, why not?My friend and I had a 6pm reservation for dinner.  It's possible that I was unaware that the restaurant did not open until 6pm, but I always arrive early, so we got there at 5:50pm.  We went to the front door (no Open/Closed sign) and I pushed on the door to enter but it was locked.  OK.  The staff was about 50 feet away and could see me through the glass of the door, but they completely ignored that we were standing there.  I, now, understand that you open at 6, but when you see your customers arriving for their reservations maybe just let them come in?  As we waited, we both got mauled by mosquitoes, receiving over 5 bites each. We were swatting them away and moving all around!  It came to the point where I was just so uncomfortable and had so many itchy bites, that, at 5:58pm, I began knocking on the door.  A woman came to the door, completely ignored us, took the menu sign and walked away.  Eh, maybe a few mosquito bites isn't terrible to some people but I'm insanely allergic and was desperate to escape them, so I continued to knock on the door.  She continued to ignore me.  At 6:01pm, she finally walked over and let us in.  Ashamed that I was knocking, I said ""I'm sorry, but we were just being eaten alive by mosquitoes out there!"" to which she had zero physical response, did not say a word and asked if we had reservations.  A little sympathy can go a long way.Otherwise, our server was pleasant and helpful and the food was OK.  The cheese plate was pretty small, and the manicotti is served in a cast iron pan, which seemed a little odd to me since it was pretty burnt on the bottom. My friend absolutely loved her scallops which were the market fish of the day.The same woman that was pretty rude and wouldn't let us in, was very welcoming to a few of the customers who arrived while we were eating. I'm assuming they were friends of hers or regulars. I've worked in DUMBO for 6 years, and I've always wanted to go to the VHH.  I'm pretty disappointed by the experience, but would try it again doused in bug spray and not arriving a second before 6pm!",3,2,
56,Rylie W.,"Portland, OR",0,64,3,4.0,4/9/2017,"Food here was fantastic. I had the pancakes. I can understand why they were written up as one of the top places for pancakes in NYC. Service here was alright. It was as if they are all told they are in charge of taking care of tables but no one is given a clear roll. For over 20 minutes I watched as customers, including myself, sat with empty coffee cups. When someone finally came around, the whole restaurant was asking for coffee. From what I could tell, there was 1 host, 3or 4 servers, 2 bussers/food runners, a bartender and a manager. Maybe they had an emergency meeting and no one was on the floor? Anyway, everything turned out alright. Go for the food, remember that brunch is the hardest shift in the restaurant industry, and eat the pancakes. Oh one last thing... They abrieveate the menu. ie. LTO(lettuce, tomato, onion) We did not know that the pork and grits had roasted peppers. Either it wasn't listed or it was not mentioned.

The waiter gave us attitude when we asked what was taking so long, and did not offer an explanation. He literally held up his palm to us and barked, ""Hold on a second."" We had already been waiting thousands of seconds. They did comp a couple drinks and gave us cornbread, but the waiter's attitude was unacceptable.

67,Nick D.,"Red Bank, NJ",794,42,81,4.0,12/13/2015,"If you're walking around starving in this neighborhood, you'll likely pass Vinegar Hill with its unrecognizable speak-easy'esque storefront. Upon entry to the quaint and cozy restaurant, the copper topped bar is turning out both classic manhattans and signature cocktails. The Pink Moon is a Vinegar Hill stand out as a spicy twist on a margarita with cucumber and hints of chili pepper.I tasted the Tagliatelle with a pork ragu. Hints of creme, fresh pasta, and a beautifully done pulled pork seal the deal on this dish although the saltiness is a bit overpowering. The fennel salad is absolutely flawless and the shaved pears will make grown men weep with tears of joy.After asking about how the steak was prepared and requesting the au jus on the side, I was a bit disappointed in the presentation of the steak. This was not because it wasn't cooked and presented nicely, but because it wasn't as described and the portion size of 5-6oz's simply doesn't do much to satisfy a grown mans appetite.I will surely visit Vinegar Hill house again, but will stick to the cast iron chicken next time as this really was the best of the bunch of entree's we had on the table.If you're looking to escape the beard bar restaurants of Williamsburg and want to take a walk on the river front of DUMBO, make Vinegar Hill the final stop on your night on the town.",1,1,

It's prepared and served in a cast iron pan, with a random fruit mixed in weekly. So far I had pear, peach, strawberry, and blueberry. If you have any fruit allergy, I would suggest to call ahead to see what fruit will be used that day, their online menu isn't updated timely. The pancakes are very tasty!I've also had their roasted potatoes, and maple bacon (their cuts of bacon has a lot of fat, if you are into that). Food is very yummy.

We made a reservation the day before and left with plenty of time in order to find parking. We were both amazed that the restaurant was in an extremely quiet area of Brooklyn with tons of parking all over the place. The host was great about us being early and let us sit outside right away.The patio in back was absolutely beautiful. There was lots of room in the shade and plenty of tables to choose from. There are tons of plants all over which really made us feel like we were at home. Our waitress was great and our food came out very quickly. I got the pulled pork and my girlfriend got the pancake with peaches. Both were absolutely amazing. The portions were perfect and we both left satisfied. As soon as we left, I was already thinking about the next time we'd be back. Even the prices were reasonable compared to some of the brunch places I've been to in the past.If you're in the area, or if you're in the mood to explore like we were, try this place out.

We noted on the reservation that it was our anniversary, yet no one mentioned it to us the whole night. Our waitress was very cold, never smiled, and due to the noise in the restaurant (no music- just overcrowding), we could barely hear her.  We were seated at a two top between two other tables with less than a foot between each table and could hear every detail of the others' conversation. NOT very romantic.  The visual ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and warm, but the way they pack people in ruins the atmosphere. Food was just okay. Pork chop was tiny.

77,J B.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,15,0,4.0,6/4/2016,"I had dinner here last night with friends. The cornbread was so good we ordered it at the start and end of our meal. But that's not why I'm writing this review. I'm writing about the gnocchi.We asked our waitress what the difference was between the appetizer and entree gnocchi dish. Apart from saying one was bigger than the other (duh) she couldn't tell us. I think if you work in a restaurant you should know everything about your product. You should completely know the menu, because how the heck should I, the customer, know? I've never been here before.So we ordered a appetizer gnocchi and a entree gnocchi and I can report the following:appetizer gnocchi = 13 gnocchi's at a cost of $18 = $1.38 per gnocchientree gnocchi = 18 gnocchi at a cost of $25 = $1.39 per gnocchi  This sort of information would have been invaluable for our dining party prior to ordering.Against my better judgement and at the corralling of my friends I sought to outline our discovery regarding the gnocchi to our diligent waitress. As I proceeded to breakdown the gnocchi calculations my so-called-good friends buried themselves in their cell phones. I think they could sense that after a long shift, and fielding multiple questions from newbies and having to cancel one order and make it vegetarian (completely our table's fault) the waitress was starting to crack. She did not seem too enamored with my calculations, retorting with a stiff ""Well, that's good to know"" and swiftly spinning away on her heels. I was only trying to help.Still, that cornbread...",5,4,1

The octopus had a very distinct flavor that was not palatable to me but my partner liked it even though he said it was very chewy like it was overlooked.

Ask the residents of next door Dumbo in their multi-million dollar apartments how ""dangerous"" it is. So you cheapskate wannabe critics want lower prices. How come 3 Star Michelin restaurants can charge an arm and a leg and be located in small remote town in France or Spain but this lovely gem can't have fair pricing in this location?  It has to be cheap because it's not in the UES?And for the pampered wannabe critics who must have their every whim catered to with white glove service. Seriously. What? No complaints about the mismatched rustic furniture or decor? What else do you not like? The waitstaff don't wear uniforms? We've been coming here for years. And we just finished a fantastic brunch - my first brunch here. Everything was superb. The food was just wonderful. The pork and grits- great. The pear sourdough pancake - sublime and possibly the best pancake in Brooklyn.  The lamb shoulder special - so good. We had a lovely stroll through the neighborhood. We were able to take our time to talk and catch up over a meal like real friends. And got to do it all in a non-pretentious restaurant that was great for a small group to just enjoy each other's company on a Saturday afternoon.

Updated review","As soon as I posted this review I was immediately reached out to by the general manager to make it right. It was made completely clear to me that this is not the experience they accept as normal at Vinegar Hill House. They were extremely apologetic and asked for details, offering me their cell phone number to call, and asked for my mailing address. It was sincere, especially after today when I received a hand-written note from them in the mail encouraging me to come back. Which totally worked, because now I'm excited to give it a try again, because even though it's all I remember from the dining experience, I cannot wait to get back to that corn bread. And thank goodness too because I felt like a real d*ck for posting my (first) one star review.",1,,

89,Diana R.,"Manhattan, NY",19,111,5,1.0,9/7/2017,"I was very excited to try Vinegar Hill House after hearing really great things from friends. I live and work in Brooklyn and have been to tons of restaurants as I love exploring the neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, this is the worst dining experience I've had in Brooklyn, and possibly New York City.  Inside, the decorations and ambiance are very nice.  My party of 3 sat in the backyard, which was a lovely setting.  The menu is quite short, but we figured, there are so few items the chef must prepare each of them well!  We were wrong. We ordered wine (served in tumblers although other tables had stemmed glasses) and a martini (very small), and 3 appetizers to start - the cornbread ($10), shishito peppers, and prosciutto/melon.  The cornbread was completely tasteless - I've had better from a box mix or any BBQ restaurant - we sent it back and they did comp us that appetizer which was appreciated.  The peppers were OK, and the prosciutto/melon was a very odd presentation mixed in a bowl and not very good.  We asked for bread and got 4 teeny tiny pieces of bread - no butter or olive oil on the side.  For the main course, 2 of us got the manicotti with pork ragu which was absolutely tasteless.  I left 3/4 of it because it had no taste at all and just was not appetizing.  The pork was OK but also bland.  We let the waitress know that we were pretty disappointed with all of our meals, after hearing such good things.  10 minutes later, the manager came out and put 2 desserts on the table and said she sent our message to the chef.  The desserts were AWFUL!!  I appreciate the gesture, but after complaining about the taste of the food, why would we want MORE food from the kitchen?  We left them both on the table barely touched and were really disappointed that the manager did not try to learn more about our experience or make it right.  This was an expensive meal and we did not feel the staff cared about us as patrons at all. I hardly ever give 1-star reviews, but this was one of the most disappointing experiences I've had at a restaurant and I sincerely hope they take feedback into consideration, as I've heard it used to be a great spot, and seems to have gone downhill.",1,,

91,Daniel M.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",142,123,421,5.0,8/21/2015,"Had a really lovely dinner last night in the back garden. Arrived around 9:45 or 10 o clock I believe.. Considering it was the first thing I ate all day, this was an even more incredible meal than perhaps it really was.. But, delicious none the less..  I.TOMATO AND CUCUMBER SALAD: We started with the heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, peanut and maple ponzu  buttermilk dressing. It definitely reminded me of something Asian. Actually more so Chinese.. The maple ponzu, came across almost like Chinese Vinegar with the cucumbers and peanuts.. But, either way, it was good.. The basil added a really nice freshness as well.  We decided we would not have been upset if there was cilantro to.   ii.CORN AND EGGPLANT RISOTTO WITH EPAZOTE: The corn and eggplant risotto was our favorite thing of the night.  This was spectacular. I am very picky when it comes to my eggplant. It has to be exceptional for me to like it. This was exceptional.  The risotto was perfectly cooked, in addition to butter, they added creme fraiche at the end.. The ""sourness"" of the creme fraiche played well with the epazote in the dish.. Very happy there was no indication that parm was added.  It was sweet and creamy and just delicious.. To me, it tasted like they added marscapone cheese and epazote. But, they said it was creme fraiche.. Anyway, the dish is freaking beautiful.    iii.BROCCOLI THREE WAY. there was a lot going on here.. I didn't really know what all the flavors were but, i ""liked it a lot""  There was some creaminess going on, texture from waterchestnuts perhaps and the peanuts.. Whatever it was, i want more of it.   IV.RED WATTLE PORK CHOP Another really lovely dish.  I am very proud of them for serving this pork chop, rare essentially.  There were parts by the rib that were black and blue essentially.. But the outside still had a crispiness that reminds one of breakfast sausage or something really savory.. Just little hints of a crispy outside.   Served with a delicous potato salad and pickled blue berries..   Of high quality pork, roasted in there beautiful oven.  It was really nice. Something i use to take for granted when I would cook at home but, now a rare treat to get meat cooked this well and of this high quality.  The portion size was big enough for two.. In fact there was leftover food if you can believe it.  We ordered a really nice bottle of wine and sat by ourselves in this gorgeous garden.. Almost reminded me of an English Country garden.. We were secluded and just in a really beautiful space.. Waitstaff was awesome..",,,

93,Olga F.,"New York, NY",99,49,3,2.0,2/13/2016,"Now you've done it, Vinegar Hill. I've come here for brunch at least twice a month for the past two years since it's one of the only restaurants within walking distance. Due to location it's overpriced af, but again and again my indolence prevailed over my common sense. Today's brunch was the last straw - my ""seasonal"" pancake (seasonal-my-tuches, it hasn't changed in over a year!) was drowned in cheap sugary maple syrup, and the trout egg benedict was fishy and mediocre. Can someone finally open a decent restaurant in the area, or nah?",2,5,1

95,Gaina N.,"Boonton Township, NJ",8,25,0,3.0,11/24/2017,"So what happened? Made reservation based on the reviews. I must have read every yelp review for every Dumbo restaurant at least twice before picking Vinegar Hill House. It is a cozy inviting place. The service is decent. We enjoyed the liver appetizer and my husband enjoyed his pork chops. And that is the only reason for 3 stars. My pasta dish with eggplant was pretty small and below average. The pasta was chewy not in a good way. The 3 eggplant cubes tasted almost raw.  The kids ordered the cast iron chicken. The same chicken that everyone raved about. It came out looking pale and sick in that jus that tasted like a bunch of squeezed lemons. My wine was served in a ""rustic"" short stemless glass. If we are paying $12 for a small dish of Brussels sprouts, I want at least a decent wine glass. Hey listen, every chef can have an off day. It was a day after Thanksgiving and the kitchen crew could have been recovering from their own ""home cooking"". Will I come back? Not likely. There are tons of other ""modern american"" restaurants to chose from. Unfortunately, this one did not stand out for me.",,,
96,Sofia S.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,107,195,4.0,7/8/2015,"I love this place, not sure why it only has 3 stars but I think it's great. The food is simple but very well prepared so the natural flavors of your meal can shine through. They have a gorgeous backyard garden that's great for date night and I saw Jonah hill and Alia Shawkat when I was there last time! Food:- cornbread: a must get, it's sweet and moist with a pat of butter on top that's just the right amount of salty. The jalapeño adds a great tang- burrata: SO creamy! I wanted a second order. The onions with it were very well cooked as well- tequila cured fluke: not a very large portion but deeeelicious. The fluke was tender, not too fishy and zesty from the tequila lime. The yucca chips were very crunchy, which was a good texture mix up and cucumbers were nice and refreshing, great to eat with a small piece of jalapeño - tagliatelle: my boyfriend ordered and I had a bite. The ricotta was unreal. The ragu was with pork and I don't eat it so I can't attest to that but he said it was pretty good",,,
97,Brian S.,"New York, NY",2,23,0,5.0,2/25/2017,"If Vinegar Hill House was in Manhattan I'm afraid it would be impossible to get a table.  Even in this unique, off the beaten path neighborhood of Brooklyn, it gets fairly crowded by 11 AM on a weekend.  There is substance to the popularity. This place serves one of the best brunches in New York City.  Their eggs Benedict is so delicious, with a perfectly cooked organic poached egg on a muffin with a delicious taste and texture.  I also tried their pear sourdough pancakes with maple syrup.  Yum!  Just the right balance of syrup, butter, and wonderful sourdough pancake.  And to top it off they serve great coffee in a delightful vintage atmosphere.",,1,

Their entrees are perfectly cooked and the drinks are delicious.You might encounter a wait, but if you do, take some time to go toward the waterfront and watch the sun set against the bridge backdrop. It's beautiful.Once you return, have a cocktail here. They're all fabulously made and well-balanced.They have a wood-fire oven, an amenity lacking in most restaurants nowadays. The Red Wattle Chop (pork chop) is their signature dish. It's carefully sourced meat served medium rare to rare. I never thought I would like pork served any less than well-done but they pull it off.I've also had the chicken which is juicy, butter-basted goodness. The sauce is made from a red sherry jus that's part butter, part chicken. The only bad part is that the entree can be quite small (two small legs) for someone with a ravenous appetite. There are also no sides besides two halves of a shallot.",3,,1

We (two girls) ordered the cheese board, chicken liver mousse, tequila cured fluke, cavatelli and cast iron chicken. It was a bit too much food tbh lol My favorites were the chicken liver, fluke and the chicken. Fluke was spicy and the dressing was very refreshing, prob highlight of the meal. I didn't really enjoy their selection of cheese. Very stinky but my girl liked it. The server coursed our meal so the whole meal came out in a slow pace which we had no problem with since we were chatting it up. But if you're in a rush, you should def let the server know. It started sprinkling so we asked to be moved inside and they were very nice about it.Oh Jonah hill was leaving the restaurant when we moved into the dining area.",,,
101,Rachel K.,"Queens, NY",152,248,13,2.0,11/12/2015,"I came to this place with such high expectations and maybe that was my first mistake.  First of all, like some of the other reviewers state, this place is really in the middle of nowhere.  I don't often feel unsafe in NYC, but walking to this place, there are no other people are and it's totally desolate.  I kept thinking to myself, I could get mugged out here and no one would know...anyway once I got that out of my mind, we found the place and it is cozy and cute.It's highly rated on foursquare (and maybe that was a red flag too...) so we went in and were excited that we could get a seat at the bar without a wait.  The bartender seemed overwhelmed even though the bar wasn't that busy, and it took her a while to make our drinks and take our orders.  We weren't in a hurry and this only bothered me a little, but what came next is what I can't overlook.We ordered the corn bread, a salad, a pasta and the cast iron chicken.  It took FOREVER.  Almost 30 minutes from when we ordered for our salad to come out.  It was over dressed and soggy.  SO disappointing.  The flavors made sense together, but whatever dressing was on it was so over powering.  We didn't say anything though, since we were STARVING.  Another 15 minutes later, the  corn bread came out and it was completely BURNT.  So burnt that we couldn't even get them out of the pan.  So burnt that the bottom was hard and difficult to bite through.  We had to send it back because it was inedible.  Wanna know the response we got?  They couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't come out burnt again.  Um...ok?  What am I supposed to do with that information?  Are you telling me that we shouldn't have ordered it?  We were totally confused.We waited very PATIENTLY for them to come out again and the second time around, they were able to get it right.  The corn bread was good.  Not great, but good.The pasta dish was the ravioli and the flavors were a little strange and the portion was small.  The chicken?  Forget it.  It was so basic and came with basically nothing else except for a couple of oven cooked onions.  It was nothing special and frankly, despite all the sauce in the pan, it was kind of dry.  AND it was expensive!  $26 for two little pieces of undressed chicken in a cast iron pan...So, all in all, this place is out of the way, overpriced, the service leaves a lot of be desired and the food is nothing new.  I won't be back.",11,2,
102,Joe B.,"New York, NY",0,15,1,4.0,8/20/2016,"I debated about leaving a review for fear that this little gem of a restaurant will be to difficult to get a resi for in the future.Let me just say if you haven't gone to Vinegar Hill House, GO, go now.I'll roll right to the food and how delicious it was! I had thee, and I mean thee best Pork Chop I've had in my entire half century on this planet. When it's described as ""off the chain"", it is off the chain and then some! I didn't order it, my friend did but was kind enough to give me two generous helpings of this crazy delicious ""Red Wattle Chop"", a term I'd never heard of before, just order this dish you won't be sorry, trust.At the risk of sounding like I had order envy, I did, until I tasted my dish, the Tagliatelle Pork Ragu!!!!! Stop the presses, it was as good a pasta dish I've ever had as a native New Yorker anywhere in the five boroughs.Order this and you'll be more than happy hat you did. Just the right amount of deliciousness so you don't go into a food coma.Which brings me to dessert. I had the Chocolate Guinness cake with cream cheese frosting.....if you like chocolate cake. This was as good as it gets. Was it the best I've ever tasted? No, but damn close. The cream cheese frosting really sets it apart from plain chocolate frosting. Really good!Only improvement would be the server. Hey I was a hip NY city kid once and thought I was the coolest while hanging out at 54, mudd club, cbgb's etc(humble brag, sorry).......our server was/is suffering from extreme hipsterism, but I can look past all that because the ambience food and cocktails were just that good!!!",,,
103,andrew B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/16/2018,"This was a cute restaurant, furnished with old/antique not fancy furniture, but very nicely done. Dim lighting, moody-but a very pleasant vibe. Staff were lovely. But - the food was terrible. We had 6 course between the 3 of us (and 2 were simple spaghetti and cheese plates for my young son). Of the 4 other courses, 3 were bad and 1 ok. Two courses - a chicken dish and a salad were so drenched in vinegar it was impossible to taste the food (I guess the name should have given this away). The chicken was ever so marginally under-cooked. The pasta dish turned up too cold. The mussel toast dish (the best of the four) was a bit burned, chewy and hard to cut. When we mentioned the vinegar infused salad to the staff we felt a little as if were treading on eggshells. It didn't seem like they understood the point-maybe the vinegar taste was what the chef was looking for....We're real foodies and eat in new places whenever we can. The place was not cheap, but if the food was very good it was appropriately priced. Given the awful quality of the food, it's not one I would return to.",,,

If anything, the walk to Vinegar Hill House reminded me of walking around Red Hook - it has that off the beaten path, tiny fishing village feel. That ambience carries over into the dining experience - it's a fairly small, tavern-type restaurant with a beautiful backyard replete with twinkling lights, ivy-covered walls, the works. Neither of us were starving so we split an order of the corn bread and then I went with burrata panzanella salad and my friend got a small order of the gnocchi. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was delicious, in particular the corn bread, which is served warm with honey butter. We also got the chocolate Guinness cake for dessert which was delicious, though could have used more frosting (but I eat cake for the frosting, so keep that in mind.

We waited, a couple heavy hitter celebrities arrived, but place was still pretty open. We plead our case again and were seated. Our server was superb. Just the right amount of hovering but not intrusive. No one made a move to said celebs which I personally appreciAted. Our perry ordered the chicken, the pork, the two pasta dishes, and the trout. We also had the apple salad and the fennel. And you cannot miss the cornbread which taste like a perfectly turned out light dessert. And of course we shared!! Oh and the butternut squash was exquisite. Charred to perfection and sitting on a bed of delish hummus.There was nothing other that pure delight with every bite. The food was presented and prepared to perfection. And we are some pretty well traveled and well fed folks.The setting intimate. I was sorry the garden was closed for the season and I have enjoyed that ambiance as well.This was Halloween night and the servers were appropriately attired so it was laid back festive, with a warm and inviting ambiance.I also loved that dirty dishes do not sit.

Three stars for the decent quality of the food, the cozy ambience, a great playlist, and the personable servers. The missing stars represent the sparseness of the menu, at least on a Sunday brunch day, some small portions, and inflated prices. Don't charge me $4.00 for a ""bottomless"" cup of coffee. Just give me a full cup of coffee in a normal-sized cup, rather than filling it up two-thirds of the way and putting it in a little cup. Charge me $2.00 for it, and we're good to go. An omelet with a few vegetables and ricotta, served with dressed greens on the side, should not cost $16.

They served it with a hefty helping of butter, which I recommend you remove quickly or your pancake will taste VERY buttery very fast, not that I really minded but you might. We also indulged in a side of bacon to split. This is real bacon, not that store bought crap. This is the stuff my dad used to have hanging in the garage all winter, which totally grossed me out during my 7 year stint as a vegetarian. Great service, very organized,  and we didn't wait terribly long for our food. The only thing I can say disappointed me was the fact that they only had drip coffee and I love my americano in the morning. But hey, everything else was great and I know how much time it saves them not fussing with an espresso machine, so in the end I'm cool with it. Cannot wait to come back for dinner and cocktails!",,,

The side of creamed veggies was served as a slop - running all over the plate - and hideously salty. Just simple stuff - with short cuts and the ""we're cool and  don't need to take care like we used to"". A shame. $141 for one app, one entree and cornbread (with a huge dollop of butter drenching it) plus a decent bottle of Greek red wine. Will NOT be back.",1,,

But, last night, that didn't stop our waitress from rudely reaching all the way over my friends' plates to shake my glasses and tip my plates. After the 14th (of course I counted! )time of her doing this, I asked her to please stop, because I find it invasive and disturbing, and also unsanitary. She was literally extending her entire head & neck & torso (hair, nose, mouth, armpits, elbows, hands, abdomen!) over our entire four-top table, picking up all of our glasses and shaking them to see if they were empty! She was, again, literally, tipping our plates on their sides to see if there was still any food left on them! How horrendous! How intrusive, how invasive, and how annoying is that! She had no concerns for our boundaries or space or privacy or conversations. Although I was initially the only one to complain, my friends all admitted to feeling a bit violated. It was my Birthday, and although I didn't expect it to be perfect, this was just unacceptable. In her defense, she said ""I'm sorry, I just can't see anything"" but that's really no excuse, because if SHE can't see anything, why should WE customers be made ill at ease?Additionally, our Pappardelle appetizer was slimy and disgusting. And the Cornbread side dish had a big piece of plastic in it. And the Arctic Char was overcooked. And the Steak Tartar was flavorless. And the Wild Mushrooms were bland. And the Brownie was really dry. So why 2 stars rather than 1? Because the cocktails were great (though expensive). Because the Red Wattle Chop (beautifully brined like ham-steak, beautifully medium-rare like I asked, beautifully charred, beautifully rendered fat) was absolutely incredible, as were the accompanying Adzuki Bean Puree & Shredded Sautéed Leeks. And because the Brussels Sprouts & Baby Carrots were some of the best vegetable side dishes I've had in a very long time. It's a very cute restaurant, tiny and intimate, located on a sublime side street, but there are LOTS of problems to fix.",8,4,4

144,Melissa L.,"New York, NY",19,51,7,4.0,11/16/2014,"I came across Vinegar Hill House after escaping from the overcrowded NY Festival of Lights in DUMBO. It's about a 15 min walk from the waterfront.  Since this review is a long one here are the key points:- great food and cocktails (get the napa cabbage, corn bread, and brussel sprouts)- good service - rustic decor, perfect for the winter- cozy atmosphere (upstairs louder, downstairs quieter)Upon arriving, I was disappointed to learn that the wait was 45 mins. The place is small - some table and bar seating upstairs and a few more tables in the cellar.While waiting to be seated, my friend and I had cocktails at the bar.  I had the pins and needles and he had the headless horseman.  I would get the pins and needles again - bourbon, pineapple juice and rosemary is a good concoction.  I'd like to try some others as well.After about 30 mins, we were seated downstairs.  Yay!!  Patience is not my virtue. The environment downstairs is quieter and more intimate than upstairs.  Decor all around is rustic - lots of wood.  I love it for the winter!Having looked at the menu while waiting at the bar, we were all set to order.  We split the napa cabbage and brussel sprouts for appetizers, the country chop and artic char for entrees, and a bottle of wine to drink.  Everything was delicious. Most notable was the napa cabbage appetizer cooked in a creamy black tea yogurt sauce with cashews.  The dish doesn't sound like much on paper, but I highly recommend it.  The brussel sprouts with peanuts and maple ponzu were also really tasty.  The entrees were very good but nothing extraordinary - simple, honest, homey food.  We didn't order any, but as an FYI the pasta dishes didn't look like anything special so I'd recommended avoiding them here.The kitchen had forgotten our entrees.  We didn't complain since we were not in a rush, but to make amends they gave us a complimentary cornbread with honey butter. Amazing! If you come here, you must get it!  I want some now!Anyway, I left happily stuffed.",2,1,1

However I was very chilly on the lower level despite being in a room with a fireplace.  The food was honestly just ok. Nothing wowed me in the least.  The apple salad was just a plate full of sliced apples with a yogurt dressing.  The Cocoa fettuccine featured a delicious short rib ragu but I could barely enjoy it because the pasta was stuck together in a huge ball. And unfortunate, the tri-tip steak was chewy and a little cold. We had the prix fix Valentines Day menu so maybe the regular menu is better. It was a truly disappointing meal,",1,,
147,Michelle N.,"Austin, TX",6,137,0,4.0,4/28/2016,"Pork chop. Everything is delicious and you will want to order two salads and a side in addition to the pork chop, but be warned that the pork chop, at a hefty $32, can feed three people. So if you are on a date, I suggest one salad and the pork chop and if you are really hungry, a side; Unless you want be rolled home. The fennel salad is all fennel so if you love that vegetable, then you should definitely order it. I enjoyed the special pea salad more because of the variety of peas (snap, english, and some other pea) and because creme fraiche and I think tahini was involved. MMM, fancy sour cream. Brussel sprouts were ok and again, tahini made an appearance. VHH is an adorable restaurant and a perfect way to end a day if one walked the Brooklyn Bridge and toodled around DUMBO.

Maybe ever!   I will start with saying that the reservation was kept and we were greeted properly and seated right away. That was the best part of the experience.  My wife and I had heard and read so many great things about this restaurant we were very excited to eat there. So next,  the very rude waitress  laughed at my hearing impairment when my wife asked about the kind of water we were going to order and I thought she was asking about the wine.  We were seated at a table so small there was hardly room for the food. A candle was knocked over to the floor when the bread basket was put down. Then, I had ordered the scallops for an entree. They  were without a doubt the tiniest scallops I had ever seen. Really, I am not exaggerating this just to make point and, they were cold. The hostess who I will say was very astute and recognized that we were having a problem,  quickly took my dish back to the kitchen to heat it. Well, nice try. The only thing that was hot when it came back was the plate!  By the way this was a very skimpy dish that cost $31!!!  This was at best an appetizer portion.

Only problem is you get very little of it and it's extremely overpriced for the portions. Be prepared to leave hungry!I went here with my boyfriend and a group of friends last night and ordered the carrots, the heirloom tomato salad and the pasta with goat cheese, sans the lamb as I don't heat meat. Everything was TINY. 5 carrots, literally. Even coming out on the ceramic plate with all the garnish, it looked pathetically small. The portion of the pasta was laughably small. It would have been sufficient for a 2 year old. I am not exaggerating. Not to mention that when we received our bill, they charged us full price for the pasta even though it was not smothered in lamb! I think that is highway robbery and plainly unfair. When my boyfriend asked the waiter about that, he stated, in a not particularly nice way that they don't lower the price. Was not gracious or even slightly accomodating.I will not be going back.",3,1,

These thoughtful wines give a broad sampling of international flavors that match range of worldly influence appearing on the food menu.Service was consistently attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, having zero hiccups all evening.Each dish is deliberately executed with innovative flavors and techniques. The house specialty, a fatty Pork Chop cut with green garbanzo, pickled blueberry and rustic potato salad sounds like it could be overly complicated, yet was surprisingly well balanced. The tagliatelle with ragu was a textural dream with rich flavors that satisfy any pasta craving.Our evening ended with a play on smores with a chocolate mousse topped with brûlée marshmallow.It's worth the money for a special evening.

156,Niomi M.,"East Bronx, NY",54,51,7,2.0,6/15/2014,"Came here last night with a vegetarian friend of mine--I guess I can thank Vinegar Hill for reminding me of the valuable lesson to always check the menu before going to a new place (they offer virtually no vegetarian options). Aside from that, not much to speak of here. Snobby, pretentious crowd despite a warm and intimate ambiance. The only thing waitstaff seems to care less about than your dining experience is their manners. I have to admit though, the asparagus with what tasted like basil and pine nuts was yummy--as well as the pistachio ice cream, which had a syrupy aftertaste and a velvety, homemade texture. Wine selection is great. I've had much better and way worse, but overall if you're looking for a date/dinner spot, go to Superfine a few blocks away or take a 15 min walk to Brooklyn Heights and explore the eateries in that area. This is one of those places that gives you a meal at a price tag much higher than what your dining experience was actually worth.",3,2,

We're very sentimental about VHH for obvious reasons, so we were hopeful that we have as lovely a time as we did on the first visit.Thankfully, the restaurant is still as charming as we remembered. It has a rustic farmhouse feel to it, with a fully stocked bar on one side and a backyard garden in the back. We enjoyed our dinner outside and were attentively served by a friendly waitress who checked on us at periodic intervals throughout the evening. Mozzies and awkward wooden picnic chairs aside, it was a peaceful environment to enjoy our food.We opted to start with the chicken liver mousse, which was served on a wooden board with a mason jar of the mousse, accompanied with caramelized onions, frisee, and thickly cut rustic bread grilled with olive oil. Our waitress was kind enough to request additional toast on our behalf, knowing we were sharing the app.As for entrees, my partner had the country pork chop with tender fingerling potatoes, which was heaven. My arctic char was perfectly cooked and flaky, and I loved the fennel yogurt that was drizzled on the side. Both mains were excellent and I appreciated the presentation put into each dish.All in all, with the two drinks we had with our meal, we escaped without putting too much damage on the wallet.

I normally do not order chicken when eating out as many restaurants, even very famous ones, tend to overcook chicken. However, their cast iron chicken was perfectly tender, and the sauce had just the right hint of vinegar and shallot. The endive salad was good (also had a vinegar/mustard themed dressing), but the chicken was the highlight.

Probably trying to push drinks on us, but drinks on a Sunday night don't go well with a Monday 8 am meeting!Came with two others, and we split the food family style. By the time we were ready to order, the waitress informed us they were they were out of a few things - among which were two we wanted to get: sea scallop appetizer and spicy greens. The waitress recommended the duck liver mousse with onions, which I found so-so. Also had the lamb ragu pasta, which I found rather tasteless, and the lamb neck, which was decently prepared. I preferred the octopus risotto out of the dishes we got. The risotto was kind of mushy, but the octopus was good.The food was decent, but the portions were definitely on the smaller side, so we ordered three desserts. The lemon tart was hands down the best. The yogurt cheesecake was ho-hum, and we could barely taste the bitters. The Mexican chocolate bar definitely surprised to the upside with a nice spicy kickIf you're in the area, worth it to check out, but it's hard to justify the trip out of Manhattan.",2,,1
162,John D.,"San Francisco, CA",125,217,34,4.0,6/27/2014,"WDD - We did damage at Vinegar Hill House last night.  Came here with 3 other guys and some big appetites.  For a Thursday night, it wasn't crowded at 9pm and we were able to sit right away.  We ordered some drinks which took a half hour to come after multiple apologies from the wait staff.  This was my only major complaint about the meal and they comp'd the dessert to make up for it.  No harm, no foul there.We ordered 4 different appetizers with the standouts being the House Bacon and the Chicken Liver Mousse.  We couldn't get enough of these and wish we ordered two orders of the bacon.  It's thick cut like in the steakhouses and not overdone like it can be there.  It was cooked perfectly and served over some sort of pickled celery root.  I could have eaten a whole serving myself so if you come with MEN, order two.  The chicken liver mousse was just as good, if not better.  Just like most trendy restaurants do these days, it was served in a jar with some toast and caramelized onions on the side.  The sweet onions paired wonderfully with the light, meaty liver and set a great tone for the meal.  All but one of us ordered the chop with the lone man ordering the chicken.  We were all very satisfied with our meals as evidenced by the silence that fell over the table when the entrees came out and the clean plates that was the aftermath.  The 3 chops were all cooked to a different temperature which was disappointing to see but it didn't stop us from going to town on them.  There was so much meat, almost too much, but I didn't hear anyone complaining about that.  For sides, we ordered the cornbread and mushrooms.  The mushrooms were good but the cornbread was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  By far, the best cornbread I've ever had and that's saying a lot.  It was served in a skillet and came out with a tablespoon of melting butter on top.  The kicker was the jalapeno honey.  It added another layer of sweetness to the already sweet cornbread.  Every one at the table couldn't get enough of it.  A great complement to the protein heavy dishes we ordered.Overall a great experience at VHH.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to get here but I certainly wont let it go that long again.  I will be back sooner than later.",2,1,

Updated review","That was a bummer.  A double whami, just tonight:We had ordered an $85 ""special"" lamb for two:  lamb neck or shank.And We got the strong eye-browed hipster waiter, again.  I thought to ask that we not be put at his tables, again.  But thought surely the place is quiet tonight, we won't end up on his side of the room...sure enough, we did end up there.So we got the waiter that does not serve, and sure enough, he didn't ask, but brought us out the neck.   For $85.  Which was slightly dry and so I asked for more jus and yogurt sauce.  He finally, asked how we were and I commented that he did not ask shank or neck, but just brought what the kitchen had.  And that it was dry.  For $85.  He gave us $10 worth of dessert ""on the house.""It was far, far from $85 worth of braised lamb.  Sad to see the love leave a beloved spot. ;(",5,,1

Roasted chicken is bone dry, octopus appetizer is 2 tentacles, salad portion is a joke, expect to constantly ask for 'more bread' even if you order a dish which requires bread, double the times you'll have to ask if there's more than 2 ppl at your table. Brunch; service is horrible and the food isn't any better than a Diner food.Attitude and Service; as many times as I've been there, the waitstaff, GM, no one has ever greeted me with a friendly smile. If there's something wrong with the food, I'm told, ""it's how we do it here"" or an eyeroll, these guys should work at The Palm or Peter Luger's so they'll understand how to treat paying customers. Another time, I brought in a party of 10+ppl (all visiting from other countries) and our waiter kept rolling his eyes and trying to squeeze us in a corner, I heard him complain about it and laugh at us; but that seems to be the typical attitude here; I was so embarrassed for my colleagues, actually I was mortified. I will never take out-of -town guests here again. Flavor; it's hit or miss. Come w/ serious $$, appetizers are like h'orderves and main entrees are appetizer sizes, bread portions ridiculous.I live in Dumbo, and this place just isn't an option anymore... I don't think it's old-fashion of me to say, I want to feel like I'm an appreciated customer, that these guys welcome people with a smile or handshake, especially if it's a regular but nope; i get a blank stare and a couple of blinks.",6,,

169,Lauren P.,"Manhattan, NY",9,32,1,4.0,10/19/2014,"This place is a hidden gem, off on a quiet cobblestone street in Brooklyn but worth the hike if you don't live in the area. The atmosphere is very quaint and the crowd unpretentious and sprinkled with many ages and even different nationalities. I ate here with my sister and friend for dinner last night. They had several goat dishes which we all found very interesting since none of us had ever eaten goat. We started with the goat crostini which was served on a wooden board with a mustard and a jam. My sister had beer since there were no vodka cocktails and I had the bourbon cocktail which was delicious. They even made a mocktail for my friend who is expecting. For our mains we were slightly boring and all got the cast iron chicken. I NEVER order chicken in a restaurant but this was delightful. We also got a side of the cornbread which had a lovely honey flavor and was served just like my mom makes it, in a cast iron skillet. For dessert we had a brownie with mint ice cream so it had a bit of a mint chocolate chip vibe. Overall the place was a hit and we will definitely go back! Only reason not to get 5 stars was that our server was a young guy and was a bit of a jerk even to 3 nice young ladies.",1,,

Updated review","I love the Vinegar Hill House of about 5 years ago. Right now it is always spotty. They have definitely upped their Instagram game and show awesome specials - but rarely do we see those on the menu or does a server let us know. Last time we visited we sat at the bar with , sadly, really poor service on a Sunday night where the restaurant was maybe 20% full. Bar tender spoke to someone at bar entire time and we almost begged to get check and head out. Would love to see more inventive and seasonal dishes vs the staples that seem to have creeped back on - As a neighborhood place, sometimes you want a coffee and light breakfast, but they have pretty heavy meals and we always end up ordering just the sides. Always rooting for VHH as the space is just so inviting, but the food needs to change it up a bit more often and surprise their locals.",2,1,
171,Kelsey J.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",70,4,3,5.0,7/21/2014,"One of my favorite meals so far in the city. From top to bottom this place is perfection. Do not leave without getting the chicken liver mousse, the country chop, and the corn bread. I'm still dreaming about this meal!",1,,1
172,K M.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,35,3,1.0,1/15/2014,"The service at this place is an absolute abomination. Run by apathetic hipsters who begrudgingly offer service pretty much only when asked, the wait staff hangs out by the bar socializing rather than tending to their tables. We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch and it was fairly busy but you couldn't tell by watching the waitstaff. The hostess was actually more helpful than our male server for some reason. Our food came after the people who arrived after us and as noted by other reviewers, the  portions were small. But that part was fine. The menu was uninspired, the food over-salted and over-priced. My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict and the egg whites weren't even fully cooked. Our decaf coffee took a long time to arrive and when it did, it had grounds floating in it.The place is hip, earthy, and has an old thyme aesthetic and the bathroom has a fun old feel to it. Were it not for the horrible service and mediocre food, I would have enjoyed the space.In closing, this was the worst service I've received in NYC. I work in retail so I know how easy it is to act nice to customers - after all, it's a primary part of the job description. Here they are failing that part miserably; My experience would have been more acceptable if the waitstaff at least flaked off with a smile, but the attitude was downright unfriendly and entitled. I'll never go back.",8,1,
173,Tara K.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,267,1,2.0,5/1/2014,"This was a bit of a disappointment for us. We made the pleasant trek/walk  from Brooklyn Heights, however I think the walk was the best part of our evening.  The place is not ""twin peaks"" but just has a simple farmhouse cottage look. The decor is not the issue, the food is, and frankly it was not very memorable especially for the price.  I had the Risotto which was fairly bland.  My husband had the pork chop dish which was good, but nothing he would want to return for. My biggest gripe is this place is small ad LOUD; we were hoping for a more serene atmosphere, but were surprised by all the chatter and left not understanding why this place was popular.. EXCEPT for the fact that DUMBO seriously lacks in Dining establishments.  Service was decent but nothing to write home about.",2,,

177,Martin H.,"Bronx, NY",16,47,20,5.0,12/30/2013,"Bwahahahahahaaaaa... 5 stars to counter the complaints about service. It's a solid 4 star place based on my night there- maybe I got lucky service wise.So many reviews about the pork chop and bitching about fat...Let me clue you into something...Pork IS about FAT.Now, here's the story... I had dialed it up to 900 watts and rode 50 miles the day I went to Vinegar Hill House.I had gotten home from my ride, relaxed a bit, hydrated, etcetera, etcetera...That's when the FAMISH set in. A light-bulb fizzle-flashed in my brain and the overwhelming URGE to eat a SLAB OF MEAT burned through my cerebrum.Pork. Pork Chop...to be exact.So, I went feverishly reading about to find a pork chop in Brooklyn, 'cause I was dropping off my daughter in the area for a party, and up popped Vinegar Hill House.I drive to the joint with the lady in tow after dropping off my girly, we were immediately taken in by the décor...soft, warm, cozy, nice ambiance. Beautiful copper top bar. We were seated right away by a pleasantly charming and easy on the eyes hostess. Not much later our laid back, yet attentive, waiter showed up and went through the basics- water, vino selection.We started with a Georgian bottle of red called ""Pheasant's Tears,"" which proved to be the ideal match throughout the meal. Tannic, juicy, fruity, and funky with earth. lmao. I never had a Georgian wine so it was kind of a must do.For appetizers we started with the Arugula salad and the Roasted Octopus. Great salad, dressed to perfection, nothing overwhelmed anything, a lovely parmesan, some nuts whose pedigree I do not recall, etc..The octopus was excellent, perfectly roasted, nice and crusted on the edges and not a bit of game, perfectly tender. Octopus is a bit of an obsession for me, when it's done right it's incredible, otherwise I frikkin' hate it...nothing worse than when it's chewy and fishy like so many places do it. It's the violin of cephalopods. Anyhow, killah 'pus...My only complaint... NOT ENOUGH OF IT!!! Three wee bits of tentacle. Throw 8 on the plate...OCTO...not a TRIPLEPUS...Anyhow... for the main courses I already knew what I wanted, the SO went for the Bone Marrow and Saffron Risotto...Off the hook good, you can't go wrong with sautéed marrow, saffron is just rocking, and they must of snuck a killer smoked gouda or some Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese in there...it had this great nutty-sweet crunchy quality and it was dusted with parmesan on top as well. The rice...Perfect. Not a split grain, I make a mean risotto and I know restaurants have to take shortcuts and split grains is the usual result...it completely screws up the mouth feel. I'd like to know their method for curiosity's sake; well done.Now....The Pork Chop. The ""Red Wattle Country Chop.""That pig was sublime... it told me a story with every chew, ""I ate these nuts & fruits, I rolled in this grass, took a loverly mud-bath then CRACK!!!! I'm on your plate...""The pork was sweet, juicy, full of depth, a perfectly micro-thin crust on the outside, I loved the grits- just enough cheesiness without overwhelming the pork and a wee bit o'kick from the jalapeno. Nicely sliced and presented thusly; I wish they had plated it with the entire bone, I like to gnaw on them at the end, sates the carnivore I am.We finished off with a cheese, fruit, and homemade cracker selection. The cheese was a French triple cream of forgotten origin.Anyhow, in short, I found the service to be welcoming and attentive, and the food was well executed. The octopus appetizer could have been a little larger, especially when you consider the price but, other than that....a thoroughly enjoyed meal.I'll be back.",2,1,1

This was frustrating, because I would have liked to reschedule2. The hostess would not seat my husband ON HIS BIRTHDAY because I was running 10 minutes late.  This is *with* about 10 empty tables3. The portions are ridiculously tiny, and I'm a lean woman who is used to eating at haute cuisine restaurants.  I filled up on grapes once I got home, even after a cocktail, splitting an app, eating an entree, splitting a side dish, and splitting a dessert.4. Our waiter was inattentive to us, and when he should clear our dishes or take our order, I saw him like four feet away DRINKING WINE and chatting with the other staff behind the bar.5.

180,Nancy S.,"Middletown, CT",0,1,0,2.0,6/6/2016,I went to vinegar hill house to celebrate my birthday with my two daughters in spite of the negative reviews I had read on Yelp    I was hoping some of the reviews were exaggerated but unfortunately they were spot on.  From the terrible service to the burnt yet soggy cornbread to the grossly undercooked wattle chop   I will never distrust Yelp again.   I also would add the rude attitude of the host and hostess .  And when they say salvaged decor they mean from someone's garbage    On a positive note the drinks were good even if we had to wait a long time for them   My daughter actually had to ask the bus boy THREE times to please get our waitress.   Save you money for someplace that actually appreciated your business,2,1,

The biscuit was spot on too.  Cocktails were pretty decent, and the service was fine despite the general exhaustion of the staff bought on by an unexpectedly busy day.  If they'd have had real coffee (espresso) I'd give them 4 stars.  But they don't.

I truly enjoyed the Chicken Liver Mousse, Mushroom with eggs, Pappardelle and Pork Ribs. I am not a pork person, because I don't like the ""pork meat smell/taste"" However, theirs was really good. Suggestions I have are 1) use appropriate wine glasses.  2) Train the waitstaff to be less disturbing and more professional. Our waiter literally decided to pour us water when we had a bottle on our table each 15 minutes after we were done with our meal and were finishing our drinks and chatting. We were his last table, so there was not a point in rushing us, really. Otherwise, I loved the cooking and would recommend this restaurant.",1,,

My waiter was really friendly and sweet and made sure to come by and check on us often. The food was slow to arrive but I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind.

184,Noelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,10,0,3.0,7/21/2013,"Vinegar Hill House is a charming carriage house on a block of Brooklyn that feels like a set from a period movie. Having recently moved to Dumbo, and never been that far north I was positively delighted and astounded. The food was flawless: The heritage pork chop one of the most delicious pieces of meat I've ever had, resting on a bed of creamy and spicy grits that were the perfect complement. The grilled octopus, just the way I like it (similar to the preparation at another fave joint, Speedy Romeo in Bed-Stuy. The spicy greens starter was generously portioned and delicious. The desserts: goat cheese panna cotta, home made mint ice cream, and sweet corn tart were equally amazing.Now, about the staff: for starters, on this night it was 96 degrees and humid outside and my date got to the restaurant before me (at 5:59 for a 6PM reservation). As he opened the door a young staffer rushed over and gestured to him to get out because ""we open at 6PM""). Overall the servers were the polar opposite of welcoming. Perhaps this is their ""schtick"" ... as we're not the first people to point this out about Vinegar Hill House. Next time I'm bring my foodiest friend from LA who will give them a hard time.I mean, come on: I can be a food snob, too. But at least I'm nice about it. 5 stars for the food and timing of the service. 2 stars for the feeling I had while I was there. So that's an average of a ""3.5""",5,,

186,Rachel T.,"New York, NY",1,52,0,5.0,2/24/2014,"Ok, to start--reviews that give 1 and 2 star reviews for mess-ups in their reservations, service that isn't actually the worst ever or high prices (when the prices have been clearly publicized beforehand) are remarkably unhelpful. This was why I was approaching this restaurant with very very moderate expectations.My date was able to get a 9pm reservation on Saturday night for my birthday, though they were able to seat us at 8:30pm and didn't give us a huge hassle. The kitchen seemed a bit overwhelmed, but most issues seemed to disappear soon after we were seated. In the meantime, we started with cocktails at their bar (and the tab was easily transferred to our table). My date had a rye-based cocktail, while I had one of the bourbon cocktails. Both were delicious and a great way to whet our appetites. The dinner menu is fairly simple (and probably all delicious), so my date and I settled on the charred beets for an appetizer with saffron yogurt. Oh my goodness, these beets were amazing--incredibly flavorful and tender, yet with a decent char formed on the outside (possibly from boiling then grilling in their wood oven?). The saffron yogurt sauce was delighfully tangy and mixed well with the sweetness of the beets and the other pesto-type sauce drizzled in.For the main course, I ordered the skillet chicken with shallots and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop with farro. Since the chicken was a la carte, we also ordered a side of the brussels sprouts with maple and pickled chilis (which narrowly beat out the parsnip choice). The chicken was incredibly flavorful, buttery and tender, with crisped skin, and the roasted shallots paired very well. The pork chop...oh my God, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The pork cop was perfectly tender and juicy and was full of flavor. Seriously, I couldn't stop stealing pieces from my boyfriend's plate (it was my birthday!). The Brussels sprouts were also amazing...a really nice balance of savory from the roasted Brussels, sweetness from the maple syrup and spicy from the pickled chilis. I'm not sure what other people are referring to about the portions...my boyfriend and I could not make room for dessert and left very sated. All in all, a great dining experience and great for a romantic, intimate date night!The service was fine...our water glasses remained full, our entrees came out in a timely manner and we were offered a second round of cocktails.",1,,

The good:* Quirky interior - reminded me of Twin Peaks.* Great bartender - fabulous mixologist. Wow, well that's it for the ""good stuff""!The bad:* I ordered a bottle of red from Aquitaine - a place I know the wine quite well. The bottle tasted OFF. I passed the glass to my dining companion and said, ""Maybe it's corked?"" The waiter chimed in with: ""It's not corked!"" though he didn't try it and he proceeded to pour. Well, the vote was unanimous. The wine was just wrong. It tasted bad. $47 for a bad French red? Nope. We sent it back.* Four of our entrees came out....and then the two of us that ordered the ""chop"" waited close to 10 minutes for our dinners. No explanation. No apologies. Our dining companions finished their meals well ahead of us.* Our side of bacon never showed up during our meal. I asked my companion if he still wanted it and he said, ""Sure why not?"" So it came after we had ALL finished our meals, and again, our waiter did not apologize for forgetting. And it wasn't comped either.  * Our waiter said that they would not make any substitutions on the menu ... even when ordering an entree. Really? My chop comes with grits but I'm on a low carb diet per my doctor and so I have to spend an extra $9 on asparagus? Really? I could see if there wasn't anything you COULD substitute with, but this was inexcusable. If there are no substitutions, it should be on the menu (and I do not recall having seen any such notation on the menu).* OK, but that $9 for was 8 or 9 very meager spears of asparagus. Very unsatisfying.* The chop was incredibly FATTY - not the best cut of meat. :( I choked mine down. My dining companion called for a doggy bag and said his Italian Greyhound could eat it instead. (Now that's saying something folks).* As we were a party of six, our neglectful waiter still got a full tip (20%?). Very unfortunate for us that he treated us so badly yet he got paid.$450 for the six of us including tip, and not including our drinks at the bar.I am so not impressed and neither were my dining companions.I am stunned by all the 5 stars here. You folks have NO CLUE what good service is like. I'll bet you're more fascinated with the fact that the Olson twins and Marisa Tomei have dined here than the quality of the food or service.*shakes head*-------------------PS, our waiter:Male, dark hair, side burns, glasses, working the front of the restaurant (and then Gloria took over at the end).

I am begging the chefs to start putting more accessible items on the menu. You are alienating your core customers. I don't want lamb neck. Or a whole fish WITH bones to eat around. And then you leave me with only two other options. One of them always being the pork chop- which I never want as its like having a mouth full of fat. The dinner menu has become way too specialized. Or at the very least, you need to find a way to be commercial and also make amazing food. I used to go to VHH two times a month. Their menu choices have me going once every six months at this point.

The restaurant itself isn't huge, but has that typical Brooklyn flare and decor that we have all grown to love. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Cheddar Grits and Poached Pear Sourdough Pancakes.

Zagat rated it highly and Michelin recommends it, so we thought it would be a safe bet. I'll echo the other comments about the service being patchy at best. The seemed pretty disengaged and disinterested, and the overall service experience seemed to be a product of disorganization and general apathy. We were sat at a booth along the front window. I'm all about rustic charm, but this place is bordering on dirty. The food was definitely below average. My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich ($16), which was cold and under-seasoned on a dry bun with a bag of potato chips (Lays?) plopped on the plate next to it. I ordered the braised red wattle pork and grits with a poached egg ($17). The pork was identical to the cold heap of pork on my husband's sandwich, so no differentiation there from what I could tell.

We were super apprehensive about getting actually getting in (walked in on a sunday night 10 pm). I give them an extra star just for accomodating us, without a fuss, 30mn before closing hours.  Very nice and warm ambiance. Loooove the rustic decor. They had some nice antique pieces on the walls .On to food. No apps or drinks. Only entrees & dessert. While the details on the dishes seemed appealing, the number of items to chose were limited. Our waiters was helpful though in pointing what was good. I settled for the twice cooked veal breast while my fiance had the lamb dish. My veal came in huge portions. Enough to have a good lunch the next day. Yet, it lacked flavor to call it an excellent dish. My companion raved about the lamb, which i barely remember now. For dessert, had the Guyiness chocolate cake. Very good. Perfect end to our meal.

I went with a group of 4 people ready to spend some money on a great Brooklyn meal. And indeed the food was everything you've come to expect from new American Brooklyn dining: the cheese and meat plate was perfect, offering 3 delicious cheeses from Vermont, some fine meats and roulades and it didn't hurt that we supplemented it with the chicken liver mousse (also delicious). My lamb neck was savory and filling.and no one had complaints about their orders. It was our server who left us with a bad taste though. We had to repeat every order for every course. We had to flag her down multiple times not to complain but to order more. It simply wasn't very enjoyable. So if I could give 3.5 stars I would. But I can't. And I""m not feeling generous.
