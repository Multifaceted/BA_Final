1,Kristel L.,"Daly City, CA",305,29,31,1.0,6/11/2018,"Do not come here if you are a tourist for sure. I'm all about local bars tending to their regulars, but the customer service here by this specific bartender was the rudest little Fish minus the F, add a capital B (hater pictured below), I've ever experienced especially being sober. We came in obviously trying to get shwasted, and immediately the bartender started rolling her eyes. Stand up at the bar, trying to order: 1. She ignores us repeatedly, 2. She the takes our order and doesn't abide by the $5 shots ""happy hour"" on the board, 3. Then continued to take a picture of us as we were just hanging out in the corner, and 4. tried to short us on giving back change from a hundred acting like we don't know math; The haterade was real. All shenanigans aside, we stayed and gave them a chance wanting to join in the karaoke and fun. The fun stopped once another tourist was singing and one of the workers tore the mic out of his hand. Straight shut him up (let's be real my guy had the voice of Ice JJ fish and William Hung combined) BUT this being a karaoke night at least give the dude some kudos for getting up there. There's no coming back from that, super rude. If you're looking for a bad time, look no further! They do not keep it lit for you, enjoy.",1,2,
2,Taylor B.,"Miami, FL",218,88,26,4.0,6/9/2018,Had a great time at this spot. Went a bit late so it was kind of empty BUT the Music was GREAT so I was happy to have so much space to dance. Drink prices were just right too. Wish there was a bit more of a crowed though. Go with a group of friends like to dance and I guarantee a good time.,1,,1
3,Rita L.,"Manhattan, NY",71,273,701,3.0,1/10/2018,"I've been here three times and today, marks the fourth time. I got there with my friend a little before 5 and placed our order of buffalo wings, sweet chili wings, the skinny burger, and chili cheese fries. Around 5:25, we were notified that the chef left the bar to do whatever he needed to do and we weren't sure what. This was 25 minutes AFTER we placed the order to be informed of this when we placed the order exactly at 5pm. After all, we were starving and was looking forward to having the wings on the table by 5:25--shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes since we were the only people there. The bartender told us that her friends were going to do the favor for us because they felt bad that we placed the order and no one was going to make it. Then, we were notified that there was no chili for the fries, so we decided to get cheese fries.  My friend got the skinny burger and I asked her how it was because the bun looked really squishy. It was cooked the way she wanted it, medium temperature and she said it was juicy. OK, acceptable. Moving onto the wings, the buffalo wings were dry and not juicy enough even with dabs of blue cheese. However, the sweet chili wings were juicy and flavorful unlike the buffalo wings. The carrots and celery that came with it were fresh. The cheese fries didn't really have much taste. The cheese was slapped on top of the fries and after a few minutes it became cold. I never had a problem with the fries-it has the right amount of crispness and taste. I was disappointed that they didn't have the truffle fries because I wanted my friends to taste it. I was very disappointed today because we waited 25 minutes to find out that the chef was not available to cook our food. While the bartender's friends were generous enough to cook our food, it is the chef's duty to be in the kitchen at the time the bar is open, NO? I even asked the bartender if the food would come out okay, and she mentioned that he works at another restaurant. I took her word for it. The food wasn't bad. BUT the service was downright NOT acceptable. And I'm still furious. This is no way to manage a restaurant and throughout the two hours we were there, only one customer walked in and the rest seemed to be friends with the bartender. I really want to give this place another try because with 25 cent wings on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, its the best around the area, but I don't know. But they really need to do something with the management and service. As a customer, I'm paying more than 18% gratuity, the least you can do is spare me the time and good experience. 3.5 stars for the food (because the buffalo wings were dry)1 for the service because it was just an off day today (or so I hope)",2,,
4,Diamond G.,"New York, NY",336,143,2032,2.0,9/24/2017,Make sure to not visit this place during the week. They are all out of liquor and do not make any of the actual cocktails on there menu.

The drinks are strong and cheap from what I can remember, fireball shots were like $5 each. The music was popping but thats because my friend got a few djs on her own to play, not sure how it is on other nights. It got very packed as the night progressed so it got very hot. Thankfully this wasnt a problem for the bar since bartenders continued to move pretty fast. I loved the decor and the fact that they have a photobooth.

8,Nancy R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,3,5.0,2/9/2018,"My friend and I had a joint birthday party in the loft space at The Skinny. We wanted a luau theme and we wanted it to be extra. Djinn and his team deliver! We brought decorations in the day before and arrived to a tropical oasis in the middle of winter. Djinn made special cocktails with fun names, made sure the decorations were perfectly placed around the space, and was continuously in touch with any questions or even fun ideas to add to the night.We felt so special and the space could not have been more perfect. We did not want a roped off area, but we also didn't want to feel secluded from the rest of the bar. The loft up the stairs has its own bar and bathroom (amazing!), but also felt like part of the larger space with the open layout.We had gotten rates from a few bars for the event and not only were they more expensive, but they were cold and some straight up rude given that we were the clients. After a brief conversation with Djinn, we knew we would have everything we wanted. I can't wait to have another event there! And am so grateful to the team for making our birthdays one for the books. Thanks again!",1,,

Presentation wise, they looked amazing, taste wise, they were terrible. The chicken was incredibly dry, to the point where I legit just couldn't eat it. The waffle was a bit soggy  and not as it should be. Others at my table ordered lunch foods - burgers and buffalo chicken sandwich. They didn't have as big of a problem as I did, but I would not recommend ordering the chicken and waffles to anyone! Not sure what the night scene is, but this is a brunch review.",3,,1
11,Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",92,253,398,2.0,8/24/2017,"The rating is a 2.5 but I'm not rounding up because it really isn't a 3. Me and my friend came by on a rainy day. She brought me here saying that it's a good place. No. It. Is. Not. If a bar is empty on the Lower East Side on a Friday night, then that should give you massive hints that it's not really a place to stop by. We sat by the bar and she tells me Happy Hour is till 8. Cool. That's great. There's like 3 bartenders behind the bar. Why the fuck did it take over 15 mins to get our order when it's empty??? We finally order and she gives us menus. I was starving and was willing to eat anything. I order tacos and chicken skewers. She gets nachos. Let me tell you something, when you're a foodie in the making, your palate starts to change. You can notice the difference between really low quality food and food that really is made with quality ingredients. Her nachos was disgusting. It's like they opened a slice of the craft cheese (those thin square crap you used to eat as a child) dropped it on top, stuck it in the microwave and melted it. It was nasty. Nothing about the nachos felt authentic or even decent. But I didn't say anything, I just told her I was content with my stuff.My tacos were just mediocre. The steak was saturated with salt. Who eats food like that? I never got the skewers. So when the bill came around I had to make sure to tell the bartender to take it off because it never came. At that point, I didn't care. Food sucked, service is ridiculously slow and it seems like no one really cares. That's my two cents. Next time I'm picking the place.",4,2,2

Updated review","UPDATE:After my updated review on 4/30/2017, the owner messaged me apologizing and stated that he has followed up with the employee and requested her to write an apology letter and will formally apologize to me. I replied not long after, it's been a month and yet STILL no reply from the owner anymore and the so called letter is no where to be seen. It's not much of the letter than matters, its the gesture of offering it and ending up not fulfilling the gesture that makes this whole apology seem very insincere and unapologetic.",6,,

I credit it ALL to the DJ, whoever he was, that happened to be here one Saturday night. The music was seriously awesomeee and we were totally tearing up the dance floor (whatever open floor area we were able to find.)

So we order and pay and then get a shot of bourbon (not whiskey) and a shot of orange juice not pickle juice. We tell the bartender it's not pickle juice and she very matter of factly says, ""yeah I know. We're out of pickle juice but I gave you nicer bourbon so it makes up for it."" We had already paid at this point, rolled our eyes, did the gross shot and chaser combo, walked out and told the guy in the tent to remove the pickle backs from their board. I've never in my life been served something different than what I ordered without being told first. I would never go back to this place and advise the management to really up their customer service.",3,1,

Updated review",Just an update - Love going to this spot for brunch. Last time I went the waitress asked me for the address on file for my credit card. She says theres something wrong with their system so she needs that info. I found that to be quite sketchy since I never have issues with the cc I provided plus this was the first instance I've ever heard of being asked for an address.... We gave her another cc and she swiped that one instead.,2,1,

20,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",484,663,591,3.0,4/9/2016,"I came here for brunch today. My friend got a deal for the Skinny: $29 bottomless brunch for two (includes 2 entrees and 4 drinks each). We arrived when it opened, but they clearly weren't ready to have us. They were still working on setting up the bar and menus. No one came up to greet us when we walked in, we had to ask to be seated. It took them about 10 minutes to get us a menu. We're already off to a bad start.I ended up getting the Classic Eggs Benedict. They were pretty good. This was the first time I've had eggs benedict, so I don't have much to compare to, but I really enjoyed the dish. The classic also includes ham, just in case you don't eat meat. I had their mimosas, which were pretty good as well. They weren't too strong, but I only had about 2. Overall, it was good. If they had better service, this would easily be 4 stars.",2,1,3
21,Fatima K.,"Teaneck, NJ",11,68,64,2.0,10/4/2017,"I went here with a coworker on a Friday for my going away from work. The bouncer was nice but the bartenders couldn't careless. There was sitting and a lot of people were sitting at the tables, I guess they don't have waiters, it would have been nice if one of the 4 bartenders who were walking around said that or even the busboy. After like 20mins we realized we had to go to the bar. It took us another 15mins to place a drink and food order. The bartenders were very dismissive, and the place wasn't busy at all. The food took about 30mins to come out and I had to go get it from the bar too. I got a burger, I don't remember the exact name but it was alright. To be honest, if that was how it was when the place isn't busy I don't want to see it when it does get busy. Although my experience wasn't the worst thing in the world, I wouldn't go back.",,,
22,Joe Z.,"New York, NY",28,10,1,1.0,12/11/2017,"My friend reserved the upstairs area for a private party on Saturday. The head bartender crashed it and started carelessly pushing people out of the way so he could dance. He fell on my ankle and injured it. I caught him as he was falling, and didn't think too much of it. Moments later he pushed people out of the way to form another dance circle, once again not being too careful of where he was swinging his arms and legs.When he tried this move a third time, I held my ground and danced in place instead. He responded by picking me up and throwing me, and calling me the N word. (This guy isn't even black)I told the bartender to get rid of him and they didn't seem too surprised by his antics, indicating to me that he has a history of this sort of thing.The bartender told me to go downstairs to alert security about what happened. When I did, all I had to do was say ""a tall guy that I think works here is being aggressive"" and he said ""I know who you're talking about""They eventually got rid of him, and the rest of the night went on without a hitch.I texted one of the owners the next day to explain how unacceptable this is, and to say that I won't be returning if he can't guarantee that the employee will be fired. He offered no such guarantee or even an apology. He instead just focused on the fact that the employee was removed from the party. This doesn't even count as doing the bare minimum, because we were going to be forced to call the cops if he wasn't removed.Note to the owner: I've been advised by a lawyer to block your cellphone number. If you want to get in touch, you may send me a message via Yelp, which will get forwarded to her.",4,5,

24,Roberto C.,"Brooklyn, NY",220,3,67,4.0,10/31/2017,"I thought the quality of the food was great for the price.  I went for brunch on a Sunday, and they had lots of screens with NFL games but they have music playing instead of the game audio so that's great cause you can watch the games (if that's your thing) or just ignore it and enjoy your food with the music (if you're not a football person)  I ordered the steak and eggs and my partner ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict.  The steak was juicy, tasty and cooked perfectly (medium rare just as I requested).  The pulled pork was very flavorful and succulent, with a great consistency (not dry but not too saucy either, just right).  The potatoes were well seasoned and both our eggs (benedict and over-easy) were well executed.  The hollandaise on the benedicts was ok, pretty standard so not bad, but nothing special either.  The Bloody Mary's we got however were a bit watery yet had a decent amount of alcohol in it.  They weren't very good to be honest but they were not the worst either.  I wouldn't recommend them or order them again because of the watery, flavorless Bloody Mary mix they use. The service was unfortunately subpar.  There was one waitress for every table which I know can be overwhelming but there were not a lot of tables there and she was pretty slow and inattentive.  We had to remind her like 3 times to get our water so had to eat 80% of our meal without anything to drink.  So not the best service but not terrible either (she got our orders and bill right).  I gave this place 4 stars because despite the lackadaisical service and insipid Bloody Mary's I thought the food was for the most part perfectly executed and very well priced.  I go to eat somewhere primarily for the food, so I can totally live with low grade service and ""ehh"" drinks if the food delivers (which it did)  I also like the space in itself.  It is very roomy, with a  decent amount of space for seated patrons as well as a long and substantial bar for people who just want to have a drink and enjoy the football games.  They also have lots of artwork on the wall and a photo booth which give the place a fun, laid-back, casual, divey bar feel to it, which I personally enjoy.",,,

Also I will remember now! :-)Anyways, I like this place. If you get a spot at the bar it is very enjoyable and you can order drinks all night while having a great time. This is what I did. The bartenders area all super nice and SUPER cool. I would just have to look at them to let them know I wanted another drink and they would provide it to me within a minute. Talk about good service well there it is right here in this bar. My friend ordered the truffle fries. Wow they are delicious. Perfectly fried, crunchy yet soft, and had the perfect amount of truffle flavor. It was not overpowering. They were so addicting. You pick up one and the next time you look at the basket it has one left!! Get them!! The music was good the night I went, they did everything from old school to new.

They had been raving about the unlimited mimosa options When I arrived, I immediately thought- where the heck are whey serving or cooking food at? I meant this is a bar-bar with beer pong tables and all. Not exactly fine dining. However, I even learned that try had taken a reservation for our large group of approximately 10 people (unexpected at a bar). The mimosas were a bit over iced. Uhmmm actually can we skip the ice? The thought of that in mimosa kinda grosses me out. Nonetheless, they also offer a screwdriver option (I really like when establishments do that- they call it Sunday fun day for a reason) and they didn't skimp on refills. #winningThe food arrive a bit in phases, but I imagine that they have a small kitchen and cooking for 10 at once is not an easy feat. Onto the food. I really like my meal. I basically had a breakfast sandwich. So good...except the bun/toast was really burnt and I knew a request for new bread may not go so well. I was already the last of the bunch to get my food.

My girlfriend and I checked this place out on a Saturday night, it started off fairly quiet, but got packed within an hour or so. This place has two levels, although the upstairs was closed. There's plenty of space to lounge around. Did I mention there's a full bar w/ high top chairs/stools? Full bar? OMG, YES, I can get my Pinot Grigio fix! Would I return? Absolutely. I Found a new spot to pregame and lounge around before the night gets real haha...Shout out to the Dj cause his playlist is off the charts!",3,,1
45,Jasmine G.,"Corona, NY",0,1,7,5.0,2/9/2018,"I love, love, loveee this place !!! I came here and hosted a Girl Power Brunch of about 15 females myself included on a Saturday and the service was amazing. The waiters were very nice and made sure we got everything we needed. The food was great ! I had the steak and eggs & my party had a variety of things and we loved it! The food is also reasonably priced! We even got to meet Jaquae from Love & Hip Hop!! (for those who watch it on VH1). We got the 15 dollar pitchers for each of us which was way more than enough. The head boss Jin treated us with so much respect and threw in complimentary shots for my party (being that the food came out a little sporadically) and gave me a shot personally to take with the waiters! We ate and drank downstairs for a couple of hrs and then went to the upstairs room for our own privacy to discuss Women Empowerment. He let us decorate upstairs how we wanted & even offered to have a bartender make drinks for us if we needed. We were originally supposed to stay up there till 4pm but he let us stay pass the time, I believe it was 6:30. (Thank God! Being that I was a little late to my Brunch) We were well taken care of & I would recommend anyone to come here !!!",,,

47,Shea C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,12,1.0,1/24/2017,"Went there for brunch. There were only about 10 people in the joint. The bartender informed us that there was no waitress there at the time. I dont know why you would have any credible food menu without someone to serve the food. But I guess everyone is cutting corners these days. I ordered an shrimp benny. I got two pieces of shrimp. I wasn't happy about that. My eggs and muffin were a decent temp but not as hot as I would have preferred. My friend ordered french toast. On the menu it indicates the plate comes with blueberry maple butter. Well, don't be surprised here people- it didn't. Not only was it missing that, the syrup bottle wouldn't open and we had to get a dude to use his gym training to open it (took about 75 secs for him). The bacon was missing (extreme no no). The most egregious act was the fact that she had to send her food back to be warmed. When it came back to her, the alaska temperature regular (not blueberry) ass butter wouldn't even melt on the french toast. The bartender while nice enough, seemed bothered that we had to 1)order through him and 2) send back disastrously prepared food. I give it a whole star because of the combination of the DJ, the 4 drinks that come with the brunch and the cute bartender-Jared. Nice to look at when you're eating subpar food. In the words of my antagonist Donald Trump, ""It was sad"".",2,3,
48,Michelle W.,"New York, NY",520,1155,48,3.0,7/7/2015,"Came to celebrate a friends birthday and they gave him an awesome open bar deal. Keep in mind, this was on July 4th and the City was much more quiet than usual.The place remained basically empty the entire night, but we still had an alright time. The music is okay, but the bar itself is fairly spacious, with a nice sitting area in the back and a row of tables on the other wall. There's also a mezzanine, but it was never busy enough for us to make our way up there. If you got the open bar, you had a great deal. For $40 (or $50) you got yourself 2 hours of open bar (or premium open bar). All in all, it was an okay experience. I wouldn't completely write this bar off, simply because it was a holiday weekend, but it wouldn't be my bar of choice either. No dress code, simply a place to come if you're looking to get some drinks.",1,,

I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the buffalo sandwich with fries. The chicken is like out of some frozen breaded tyson or perdue package that they just heated up. The waffle was nasty, dry like an expired donut. The waitress Norhina was really nice, she's the only reason why I didn't give a 1 star or possibly even a negative. yelp said they are opened 11:30 am, so we got there 11:30 am, then found out on website it opened at 12 pm, so we wait. And then 12 pm it was still closed and we called and they said open 12:30 pm. If it wasn't because I wasted money on a groupon deal and paid for it, I wouldn't have gone.",1,,

The food was very very good!!! I had the shrimp eggs Benedict which was very filling and tasty. My boyfriend ordered the brunch burger which was so big he could not figure out how to eat it.

BUT.....I am all about service, and that is what differentiates one place from another.And just because you have cute girls as bartenders doesn't get you an extra Star! Service does! And both of your cute bartenders SUCK! The one downstairs was friendly only after I HAD to engage her......however with a bar that has maybe....hmmmm....I dunno...7 people at the bar, 4 people are with me....and she's chatting or texting away on her phone, while people in my group are waiting to order? I just don't get that! I really don't! If I were a bartender on a not so busy night (ANY night), I'd make DAMN sure that any customer that I do have, knows my name and I know theirs! I'd make sure they were all good and I would even engage with them in, that old fashioned form or communication, called CONVERSATION! Oh....No, please....I'm so sorry, that I interrupted your text, because I wanted to spend my hard earned money to buy a fuckin drink in the place you work!But...I was there for a larger event that moved to the upstairs bar. Very cool venue...nice size for parties. The upstairs is small and cozy. Very cool to take a date, if the place isn't crowded. The Bartender up there was no better....At first it was a guy, and he was really cool and nice...pleasant to order from. I guess he was covering for another bartender who hadn't showed up yet...Too bad! I wish she hadn't showed up at all!What a nasty rude bitch! That all I have to say! Yes! I am a very nice person to serve...I'm not rude or pushy and I'm a really good fuckin' tipper! I used to be a waiter and bartender...I know what it's like to be on the other side! So, I'm not this jerk-off, trying to be a dick....and what do I get in return? A NASTY BITCH! Who looked like she'd rather be somewhere else!I gave this place 3 stars.....One for Templeton Rye, One for the Venue and One cause it's the holiday season and I'm trying to be nice!Recommendation to the owner: Make sure your bartenders are happy to work there! Make sure they like their jobs! Hire friendly, ENGAGING people!

I had an empty Starbucks cup as part of a costume and he just took it out of my hand and threw it on the street. I was annoyed so I picked it up to bring it back and he did it again with even more aggression. I completely understand if you're worried about people being idiots and putting their own booze in cups before or at the bar but be polite about it.

I had not been here in a few years, not since they renovated and expanded.I was looking for a place for my coworker's going away drinks, and we needed a place with reasonable priced selection of drinks, good transportation in the area, and space for our larger group of 10-15 people.Although we did not make a reservation, due to my party being so undependable and not wanting to be responsible for the minimum tab for a reservation, we took our chances.What luck! Yasmin, who I had spoken with about a possible reservation, happened to get us two tables in a booth--at 10pm on a Saturday! She checked back on our party multiple times through the evening, and everyone commented how great the service was. We had a wonderful evening: the music was ON POINT, the noise level remained decent, and even when it was crowded, service was fast and courteous!We all left happy and will definitely be back!",3,,

Though somewhere between the ordering and kitchen communication was lost. I order scrambled eggs that came back over easy. The waitress told me that's how they scramble eggs ?!?!? My plate was also missing bacon. Of course this can happen, but my friends we're also missing parts of their meal. Additionally I had to get up and get condiments for my table ?!?! All in all, I had to bring my plate back.

62,Yaya P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,1,1.0,6/28/2017,"I have a real love and hate relationship with this place. Love the food, location, atmosphere and hours. The service...meh. Take tonight. I tell BT I want sugar on my sidecar. She stares. ""We don't have it"" I kind of wish I knew that before because the sugared rim is a big deal for me. I tell her my drink tastes less like it has cognac and more like a lemon juice base. She insists it's almost mostly Hennessy. ""Really?"" I ask, ""is it watered down Hennessy?"" To which she just stares at me. I can't seem to enjoy my 15 dollar lemony tasting ""shit-car"" and I resent her attitude about it. I miss Rich from Hair of the Dog and wonder once again why I always expect better service here when I never get it. Later I ask for a Diet Coke. It tastes like seltzer and as I go up to let her know. Another bartender comes close, I guess to listen in or maybe because she thinks I want to deck the other one (I kinda did because every time I talk to her she looks at me with this expressionless ""what do you want me to do about it?""Look). I found it annoying because I pay money and tip well and NOTHING in the way she treats me makes me feel like a valued customer. So guess what? The cola machine doesn't work (she tasted it herself to confirm my complaint) and she doesn't have anything to offer in comparison. I leave resentful. I couldn't manage not to tip her however because I just can't be that tacky but tonight left a sour taste in my mouth and it wasn't just my lemony Sidecar. Came back the next day for a work thing and BT #2 (the one who was backing BT 1 last night) is world's second crappiest BT. Ask her one question she says no and walk away before I can ask her second question and order a drink. I ask for margarita and truffle fries--no truffle oil again! And no salt on my margarita and not even the option?!? Now I want to leave because it takes forever to get a drink with salt and the quesadilla she said I couldn't cancel is taking FOREVER! So now I want to leave because my other friends walked in and saw the one struggling  bartender behind the bar and walked out to go to Hair of the Dog. I left without my quesadilla because I didn't want to be missing out on what should be a celebratory last day of teaching! Still got charged for it.

Burger was very good, fries were decent, drinks were strong. I have to dock them for a RIDICULOUSLY long wait for such a simple meal. We waited no exaggeration 1 hour from the time we ordered until the burgers arrived. The host/waiter was apologetic so I feel bad even mentioning it but if not for the drinks I would have been very upset.

HOTD is a bit more loud and frat boy - ish, more of a party scene. While being my cup of tea, it isn't everyone's, which is where The Skinny comes in. Free outlets, reasonably priced food, a pool table, and a cool photo booth, along with a chill bartender and decent music. Definitely a var I will go to more often. I highly recommend it.

My Favorite is the Big Cheese.  It is a delicious beef patty hugged on each side by a perfect grilled cheese sandwich.  Included are amazingly delicious fries, which you can get coated with Salt and Pepper, Old Bay or Cajun seaoning, or for an additional charge, Truffle Oil.  All this and it is only 7 dollars with fries.  The kitchen hours can be erratic, but generally the food is available from 6pm to Midnight.  The regular burger is great too.",3,,
68,Daniel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,64,91,5.0,7/25/2015,"Well this bar was an interesting time. It's one of those very well put together bars that have all the essentials, solid prices, relaxing vibe, spacious layout, simple pool table and great staff. This particular night it seemed like a slower night but for a Thursday in NYC and in this area you would assume a bar like this would be slammed. I don't know if that's a reflection on the area or on this bar in particular but I know for sure it's not because of the staff. The bartender Sean did a great job keeping us that bar and made some great drinks and recommendations. I asked him for a Gin and Tonic with his recommendation and he offered me Brockman's Gin which first of all is hard to find but also one of my favorites. The bartender is also one of the buyer's for the alcohol so he cares about his inventory and care's about his drinks and that's a great change of pace from the hundreds of bartenders that plague New York with over spilling Whiskey Sours and poorly made Long Islands. This is a great bar but honestly it's really only as great as the experience you have their so bring some friends and start your night off well here before going into those cramped dive bars around the corner...you won't regret it.",1,,

All he said he would do was add more soda water to this nasty drink...which did not make much of a difference.

When we went to close out our tab, she told us that it was up to us to settle our tab and that everything would be charged to one card.

More appropriately these should have been named lowball. After mentioning this to the bartender he was adamant it was fireball and went on to prove this by showing us the bottle - while also refusing to drink or smell it. He might consider quitting his bartending job and becoming a lawyer. Another friend ordered a rum and coke for the guy who's birthday it was. Despite him being ten sheets to the wind, he spat half it out as it was closer to rum and tequila. Again, not sure if this was from the ""rum""bottle or the bartender messed it up.

Get over the divey-ness of this place, and focus on the extremely sweet staff, strong drinks, moderate prices, and awesome upstairs section that you can reserve for a birthday at no extra cost (pool table and all). My friend had her birthday party here on a Friday night and it was a blast. Plenty of space to socialize, dance and move around, no hustlin' or fuss for any of the guests, strong drinks (one Jameson and ginger had me feeling good), and a fun pay-to-play pool table. Plenty of seating around the upstairs area too, and the bathrooms were tolerable. Mostly, I loved the sweet bartender who gingerly placed a band-aid on my finger when I clumsily cut it open. (Thanks man!) Better yet, this place is around the corner from the meatball shop, so you can go put your name down, continue your festivities when they quote you a 2-hour wait, and then mosey on back when it's your turn to eat. But seriously, stop into The Skinny for a quick drink to get your buzz on or to celebrate your 7th 25th birthday--they'll treat you well and you won't remember it the next day.",3,4,4

91,Jared R.,"Sloatsburg, NY",0,4,3,5.0,3/10/2012,"I had done a bit of searching prior to coming here for a venue that would be good for my birthday celebration. I ended up stumbling upon The Skinny and read great reviews about the atmosphere. So I decided to call and see if they would be able to reserve a space for me and my 15 friends (about 2 days before my birthday). The woman who takes reservations was nice and was able to accommodate the last minute reservation. Once a few friends and I arrived at the lounge we informed the staff that we had reservations. They immediately went to our space to clear out people who were occupying it. The process took about 5 mins and my guests and I sat. We had a cocktail waitress show up and she took my guests' orders the entire time we were there. Because it was my birthday and I brought people they gave me a wrist band to drink for FREE the entire night and I could have ANY drink I wanted ( minus shots). They were very true to their word and were extremely nice when I ordered drinks that I didn't know the name of.  Their entire staff really made my birthday a memorable event and I thanked them for it at the end (I told them I would write this review). Some cautions: the area around the bar that leads to the back is very narrow  (maybe why it is called The Skinny =P). So be prepared to squeeze between people.When reserving a space like I did they will charge you if you do not keep your reservation. If you keep it then there will be no charge.Overall, I would definitely suggest that people go here. It was an awesome time for me, and my guests all said they had a great time. I will be returning here for other future celebrations and telling people about my memorable experience at The Skinny!",4,,

Got there at 7pm and it was pretty empty. Granted, this was on Labor Day weekend so maybe that's why it wasn't crowded.

The music was great, the drinks were good (and inexpensive as I'm told from those who had to pay.)  The only downside is that is very, very crowded up by the bar, but it's called ""The Skinny"" for a reason.  We didn't have a problem in the back room, but when we were ready to leave, it took quite a bit of force to squeeze through, and I got a few drinks spilled on me on the walk out.But I had an awesome birthday party and I would definitely come back here again.",2,1,1

Little did I expect them to slap an orange wristband on my arm that opened the gateway to free drinks and, thus, infinite possible manifestations of chaos. Happy birthday.Five of us arrived at the scheduled time, the owner gave us a round of shots, and my first drink was free. Wait, nevermind that last part! The Skinny is true to its name and strikes a balance between hipster bar and swank establishment (a wide range, I admit) that I was pretty keen on. My friends come in all shapes size psychoses and sensibilities of fun. The staff was agreeable, easy to order from. I managed to fall in like with a bartender for the second time in less than two months. I swear it was his hair and the fact that he refused to make me a mojito. Alcoholic masochism: who knew? Two point 5 hrs and seven or eight (or nine?) drinks in, I was finally drunk. But let that not deter you: I went from sober and a little hungry to drunk in two and half hours, and then I went from drunk to black-out in about 40 minutes. Next things my friends knew, I was far more inclined to dance, sitting on the bar, and chatting up that cute bartender. Gutsy when gone. Ballsy when blasted. The alliteration goes on.On the inebriation scale, The Skinny rates a rapid but moderately tame black out at about three drinks to the hour, or if you average the two accelerations from sober to drunk to functionally dark, 1.615The Skinny's a place for kids of the 80s who are keen on forgettable generic 80s songs.

111,Elizabeth T.,"Staten Island, NY",135,227,0,4.0,4/13/2011,"So my 25th Birthday was all set. I was going to go to Carnival at Bowlmor Lanes. I'm pretty sure my friends were even more excited for my birthday than I was. I was so ready for games and snow cone flavored alcohols. But alas, it didn't work out that way. A week before my birthday I find out that Carnival is no longer open to the public. I was ready to just throw in the towel. I wasn't particularly happy about turning a quarter-of-a-century and took the closing of Carnival as a bad sign. (I'll admit, I can be highly dramatic like that.)When I finally stopped sulking and throwing myself a party pity, I tried one last time to look for a place to celebrate my bday. I no longer wanted an over the top place. I wanted somewhere cheap and chill. A place where I can reserve a spot for my friends and I without having to get a bottle. I finally stumbled upon The Skinny. I wasn't expecting much at all and I think that's why I liked it so much. This is a nice little bar (emphasis on the little but I'll get to that in a minute.) This is a no-fuss kind of place and that's what I like. Also, the drinks are dirt cheap which I always love!Now I know this has probably been mentioned again but the second you walk into this place, you'll know how they got their name. The space between the bar and wall is basically a hallway. A narrow one at that. This place gets sooooo crowded to the point where it's almost impossible to move at all. And the bathroom is all the way in the back so the crowd is unavoidable. I probably wouldn't come here again on a random weekend cause of the crowd. But since I was here for my birthday and had my own couch and table it didn't bother me that much. I definitely want to try this place again one day for happy hour.",,,2

He's a very low-maintenance guy, but there was one stipulation that had to be met before the clock struck 4: Dance at some point. ENTER The Skinny.Here's the thang: It was a Sunday evening after the first snowy weekend in New York. It was cold, it was snowy, people still had to work the next day. Yadda, yadda, yadda. In other words, nightlife was dead, at least by New York's standards. But I was already on holiday vacay, so CHOO-CHOO, bring on the party train.Luckily, The Skinny was just as empty as the rest of New York, so we took over. I walked in and saw my calling. Went to the bar, ordered a whiskey ginger*, took out a crisp dollar bill, and played Erotic Photo Hunt for two rousing rounds. Half a drink later and some mismatched hunks behind me, I was ready to dance. We shouted to the DJ, ""It's his birthday!"" and here's where the magic happened: The DJ knew exactly the crowd he was playing for. Gays and gals who want to dance. It was Beysus, Gaga, ""Party in the USA,"" ""Evacuate the Dancefloor,"" Justice, JT . . . what a playlist!Lord, help me, I thought. The last time I danced this hard I dislocated my knee.Even though we had an amazing night that's unlikely to occur again due to circumstances, I will definitely be back.

There were very shapely young ladies go-go dancing.  Not sure I'd refer to them as ""skinny"" (that's not to say they were fat - they were not), but who wants to watch a stick-figure shake their groove thing anyway? It didn't hurt that they were friendly and scantily clad either. 2. They were playing cool videos on the wall, and the music was eclectic.3. The have an interesting trivia thing going on.4. There was a weird cast of characters moving though. I'd write with my usual of level of detail about this bar, but I'm suffering from a week-long continuous hangover that The Skinny contributed to mid-week, so you'll have to forgive me.I'd go back, definitely.

Also, if you don't mind ""accidentally"" rubbing up against some fine LES specimens to get the conversation going, this is the place for you!

174,Ty M.,"Chicago, IL",149,9,0,2.0,4/12/2011,The vibe and atmosphere are fine but I can't believe they don't have any tap beer.  Unforgivable.,,,
175,Darren G.,"Boston, MA",24,78,2,3.0,10/5/2008,"I think this place might only be okay for groups - otherwise I can't see what the appeal to it would be. Dark, divey, corporate hipster crowd - all good ways to describe it. I think everyone was wasted there.Try the pineapple upside down cake drink - really good.We had a great waitress. When i spilled my friends drink she decided I had been bad so took out her order book wrote ""Bad"" on it and pinned it to my shirt. Even though I really tried to flirt with her I didn't get a free drink, oh well.The music was horrible and repeated often.",,,
176,Steve W.,"New York, NY",95,235,0,4.0,4/3/2010,"another les bar.  i only go here on thursdays where they have old school hip hop music and all drinks for $5 or under. got a super strong long island cause the waitress didn't seem to know how to mix it properly for $4.  that got me pretty buzzed by itself.  i ordered a few more jack and gingers and was thoroughly smashed the rest of the night.  the music, pure classic old school hip hop and some r&b mixed in.  i miss those days, pre-southern rap, pre soulja boy, pre-birdman crap they have out now.  seems like everyone back then had a flow.  the dj starts around 830-9 and he plays classics, even some joints i haven't heard of.  i was just a small kid back in the 80's so sue me for not knowing everything.  but i play it off pretty well.  everytime a song comes on that i don't know, i just yell ""OHHHH SHIT THATS MY JOINT"".  then i listen to the chorus the first time and sing it along the second time it comes on.  and when the song ends, i act all disappointed.  they have music videos on the big screen and it mixes with the music.  pretty cool concept.the bar is....skinny.  they have some couches in the front and back and a pool table upstairs.  lotta old fogies come here, but its good for a group of friends, not as a pickup spot.  unless you like old grandmas with their wrinkly faces.  go in, enjoy the music, drink the cheap drinks and pretend you know the lyrics to all the songs.",,2,1
177,Jillian T.,"Boston, MA",104,25,0,5.0,4/9/2010,I am going to give this bar 5 stars evennnnn though my purse got stolen while I was there (jerk)..... that must mean it was pretty great. I highly recommend it for birthday parties... everyone I dealt with was so friendly and accomodating even though I booked it last minute. They had great drink specials for me and my friends and the music was awesome too. Great place all around!,1,,

180,Lex B.,"Astoria, NY",8,70,8,3.0,8/8/2010,"A fun, dancey, divey makeout spot to go to with friends or to meet someone for the hell of it. Good music, reasonable prices. I gave this place three stars because the bathroom cleanliness seemed kinda frightening. But it's a fun place.",,,
181,Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,619,238,4.0,12/8/2007,"Irene F., Glenn L. and I came here after the Ritz kicked us out at 4 AM last night (or is that this morning?), so The Skinny gets extra points for being open past 4 AM. It also loses extra points for all the heteroness. However, it regains a few points as Glenn managed to meet a gay man in line waiting for the loo, and then getting distracted in the bathroom and forgetting pee altogether. But it's back to neutral ground because I didn't approve of drunken Glenn's choices. Also, apparently, half of Irene's friends from high school work here now. The bouncer is a true gentleman as he walked Irene to the ATM, put her in a cab and sent her home. Also, I have rarely ever met so many aggressive and forward women, at least three introduced themselves and went to some rather un-subtle flirting. This place would make for one of the merriest of times  for hetero and the gang.",15,17,15

184,Shacazia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,5.0,8/31/2010,I just wanted to thank the entire staff at The Skinny. I would like to personally thank Alex who went above and beyond on Saturday 8/28. The saved the day by accomodating my friends 35th birthday. The service was absolutly amazing and they made us feel like we were apart of the Skinny family. I will always refer people to Skinny because of the outstanding service. THANK YOU Skinny for an amazing birthday night. YOU GUYS ROCK LIKE ROCK STARS...-SHAQ-,,,

187,Caitlin K.,"Yonkers, NY",63,6,0,4.0,1/5/2009,"had a great time there last friday night for my 23rd birthday.  i was looking for a recession-friendly sitch for my party, and this was one of the few places in the area that had a dj, private party space, cheap drinks and no cover on the LES. they were very prompt about calling me back with more info about reserving the upstairs loft (for free!), and when i went to check the place out one chilly night, they gave me a free shot for the road!it wasn't as packed as i would expect for a friday night (prob because everyone was still so hungover from new years), which was great because a lot more people came for  than i expected - we had about 50 for the party and the space worked out really well. the music started out slow but picked up once people got there and we had a sweet dance party going after awhile. i got free birthday drinks all night, and the staff were super nice and fun. thanks, skinny!",2,,1
188,Natalia K.,"Oakland, CA",35,720,56,5.0,11/8/2009,Thank you to The Skinny for letting me have my birthday party there. I called only hours in advance but the whole front section was reserved for my friends and me (about 15-20 people). Initially we were at Barramundi but that place was way too tiny for my group. Definitely recommend throwing a bday party at The Skinny especially if you're stressing about where to take a big group of people. Birthday person gets to drink for free all night.,,,
189,Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",688,1833,7,4.0,11/11/2007,"Having come here a million times, I only last Friday learned the name of this place! It was always our late night retreat, I guess something about the darkness and the dimness and the absolute inebriation of the patrons makes it the best way to end a solid night of out and about. Additional surprise this past visit, aside from learning the real name as opposed to ""That place we go on Orchard and Stanton when it's late"" was that an old high school buddy was bartending, and apparently another also works there. Good stuff. Now don't go making it obscenely crowded, you got it? Good.",1,3,2
190,ashley j.,"Queens, NY",0,1,0,5.0,9/26/2009,"It seems whenever I'm out on the LES, I end up at The Skinny. The bartenders Hillary and Jackie are always so nice. The drinks are just right for my pocket. Five dollar PBRs and shots!!! I'ts divey, but like someone said, ""nice divey."" I'd recommend it.",,1,
191,Christina M.,"New York, NY",302,483,52,3.0,1/3/2009,"Total dive bar on the Lower East Side which is perfect for a change of scenery after you've spent too much money and fought through too many crowds at some other place in the area like Pianos, The Living Room or Bob Bar (really Bob is where I'm coming from).  It's great and low key though you do get your occasional tranny dancing with wings and a leopard thong on a subtle soap box type thing in the corner.  (This I found out the other night).  So yeah, go there trashed when you just absolutely need another three beers before you head home.  Afterwards you can hit up Rosario's pizza across the street to curb your hangover in the a.m.",1,2,1

194,Mike T.,"New York, NY",72,261,0,4.0,4/21/2008,"Called the ""the skinny"" for a reason, this place is hipster paradise with its $1.50 PBRS and eccentric playlist. But honestly, who doesn't love them some crazy hipsters? Like others have said, this place is great in the regard that its one of the few bars open past 4 am. Oh and it doesn't hurt that their drinks are borderline lethal. So check the skinny out for some late night debauchery",2,,1
195,Tiffany T.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,46,0,1.0,9/17/2007,"Not one of my favorite places.  The Skinny takes on a very literal meaning when you're crammed into a tiny hallway of a bar lit in dark red lighting and wierd voodooesq decor.  Yeah cheap drinks, but is it really worth not being able to breathe, nevermind about walk around the bar comfortably.  No thanks, the party of 8 i was with quickly left...",1,1,1
