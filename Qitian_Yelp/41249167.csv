The bartender Brian was SUPER friendly and super cute. Perhaps they've changed staff?As the front bar started to fill up, everyone we encounted was friendly.",2,,1

Updated review","I haven't been back in several months, because the owner told the pianist not to play any songs I requested until I ordered a drink.Excuse me! I'll order a drink when I'm thirsty! If you're establishing a minimum or a cover charge, then be upfront about it!Although the ambiance is otherwise nice, I don't want to have to deal with owners shaking down their customers for $4.",1,,
2,A P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/24/2018,"A classic example of when a place gets a renovation but everything else is as stale as week-old cold pizza. They have a patio now and hence deserve awards for trying. Other than being blatantly transphobic - I mean, when the staff is a close-knit kitty party of 40yr old Broadway rejects with nothing but dusty pipes trying to one-up each other, that should be a given; but still - they pry too much into the patrons' private lives. Don't be surprised if your gf/bf gets a screenshot from one of the bartenders outing your game. Or if one of the piano players comes swinging at you on the street warranting a 911 call because their boyfriend, the career bartender, stuffed his hands down your pants in an effort to get himself some attention from said piano player. The cherry is when your drinking buddies concernedly empathize because the narrative when you're taking some time off from there trying to make sense of everything that happened, was very convenient to paint someone out of the bar because they can never let their BF now what actually happened. Have a company party there. If you're as lucky as I am, someone will come up to you and announce that you're no longer welcome in front of your co-workers. This can keep going on, but my capacity to care is rather reasonable. I wish the bar well. It's a great time when no bartender is handing you a knife to slit your throat (I wish I was making all of this up) or the people from the local shelter are not harassing you for a drink (which they all seem to exchange pretty easily for sexual favors from the staff between their moments to shine at the mic). If you're someone with any self-respect that isn't looking to roll around with closeted white people that can't get it up anymore but egos for years, you'd rather choose to get a handle and alone by the trash on the corner. Because, yea... you get it. Peace! Keyword: cocaine.",,,
3,Patrick C.,"Sunnyside, NY",0,3,0,2.0,10/24/2018,"Wish I could give a better review but the front bartender was extremely rude and unprofessional. I called inquiring about a lost credit card and was told they had it secured and waiting for me at the bar. When I went in to retrieve the card, the bartender angrily said he didn't have it and told me better luck next time. Hence, I had to cancel the missing card. I will say the bartender in the back is super friendly and always remembered me. If you head to Uncle Charlie's, head to the back and get a drink there.",,,
4,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1509,3603,16292,1.0,10/8/2017,"Uncle Charlie's is a gay piano but actually with more of an emphasis on karaoke off key drunks with gravely sounding barroom tenor voices than a piano bar. It's also a bar which I can assure you I will never return nor recommend except to congenitally tone deaf drunks. My visit here was just one horrible nightmare. I had thought any New York piano bar, especially a gay one, would be top of the line in musical abilities and talent. But in this case, just the opposite. Some over the top in your face drunk queen got up to sing Hey Jude almost entirely off key, super loud, and just would not stop. It went on and on. Myself and others at the bar were plugging out ears, but it continued. Finally, after howling complaints from everyone seated at the bar, somebody finally got up and grabbed the microphone from him. Amen-Hallelujah! I thought I had been saved, but not so, as the next several singers were just a bad. When you enter, you have to climb to the second floor. There are two bars in the place, which makes getting their cheaply made weak to near alcohol free overpriced drinks easy. It also has an outdoor patio that somewhat lacks in décor, luster and is about the size of an average men's room. I've been to a lot of piano bars, particularly gay piano bars at various places all over the world. By comparison I can say without any equivocation that Uncle Charlie's is the worst I've experienced.",7,8,6
5,John S.,"Manhattan, NY",48,184,108,3.0,4/26/2018,"It's great that Uncle Charlie's is here. Without it, there wouldn't be a gay bar for blocks and blocks around.It's a tricky kind of neighborhood around Grand Central Station. Very workday, not very charming. Uncle Charlie's seems to serve an itinerant crowd of afterwork locals & commuters. It's friendly, and not too relaxed. The piano entertainment is a distinctive touch. Though the patio is mostly a smoking spot, it's nice to have a chance to get outdoors and enjoy a unique view of the beloved Chrysler Building.Sit in the tables in back for excellent waiter service, and say hi to Gil!",,,
6,Ed W.,"Manhattan, NY",177,354,19,3.0,4/13/2017,"Been coming here for years.  I type this lovingly: the place has had more facelifts than Morgan Fairchild -- if you don't know the name, you can Google it (darn kids, get off my lawn).It's great spot.  They have a good happy hour and the staff is always friendly.  The patio has a unique view of the Chrysler Building, but you have to be at the way back to see it.There is a piano, which I love.Someone once told me that this place is an homage to the Uncle Charlie's that was once in Greenwich Village -- what is now Keifer Sutherland's hangout, Fiddlesticks.  I did not live in the City back then, so I will have to take their word for it.I also love the proximity to Grand Central.  This makes it a great place to meet up with friends who commute into the City.",3,2,2
7,Steve H.,"Nottingham, MD",1,26,0,1.0,9/15/2017,"Sweet Jesus.   RUN. RUN AS FAST AS YIOU CAN. For some reason, someone thinks that people with zero vocal talent screaming off key is entertaining.  There isn't enough alcohol in all of Manhattan to make this place worth 10 minutes of your time.  If you're looking for one of those quaint, fun piano bars where everyone sings, it's not here.  There's a modestly decent piano player who is a good singer.  It's the other employees and customers who can't sing.  It's not fun. It's not cute. It's awful. Painful.  This place lost the balance between a bad singer making things seem fun and simply obnoxious destruction of an atmosphere. RUN. FAST.",1,2,1

9,Ashley L.,"Hialeah, FL",36,6,0,4.0,2/2/2018,"If you're looking for a calm laid back environment for drinks this is the spot for that. This is the first piano-bar I've been to (so I have nothing to compare it to). It is small and simple. There is happy hour that ends at 10pm, which is a decent time. There's a pianist and you may volunteer to sing. The staff and manager were very nice and welcoming. The manager came over to us and introduced himself to us and welcomed us (I think because we were a large group of about 13, for most of us it was our first time there, we were a diverse group varying in gender/race/ethnic/and lgbtq+ backgrounds). Over all I liked it.",,,
10,Andy C.,"Irving, TX",1,23,6,4.0,12/16/2017,"Our server, Leo, was friendly, the drinks good and the piano player alright. Vodka and soda $9.00. Offered pretzels or peanuts with each round.

11,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,4.0,7/13/2015,"""Who's you uncle?""This review may be slightly biased because I typically come to this bar 3-4 times a year and most times I am pretty drunk (after 10-11pm). But, this is a standard gay bar with no frills which can be nice every now and then. Plus, sometimes it is a good experience to explore LGBT nightlife above 14th street.  The bar is kind of broken up into 3 sections - the main bar, a piano bar and a patio. If you plan to sing at the piano, just have your piano-based song down cold. I think that the patio stays open till 10:30 and it is mainly a reserve for the smokers of the establishment. So, if you are allergic to smoke or do not like it then you probably should not go back there. The drinks are pretty standard and reasonably priced. Manny is a nice and standup bartender. I do not think that the weird Bulgarian waiter, who also moonlights as a prostitute, does not work there any longer. He actually asked to show my friends (two females) and me his ""Bulgarian sausage.""  All in this is a very simple bar, which is perfect if you are looking for a simple night out or want to do something near Grand Central.",1,4,

There's live music and recorded music and it's an atmosphere of fun, without any problems. There's a little patio garden, outside, in the back, with gorgeous views of the Chrysler Building and other tall buildings all around.Be careful, because there have been other locations that have been closed and this one may have been temporarily closed for renovations, but now it's open. Also if it says ""closed now"" when you look online, it just means it doesn't open until 4pm every day. It stays open until 3am and 4am. It's not a brunch place. This one is in midtown.

18,Christian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,116,0,3.0,6/22/2016,"This bar, in many ways, is the gay bar for gays who don't like ""gay"" bars.  There is a one glaring exception to this, which I'll get to later.  As others have noted, the bar is divided into three distinct areas:The first area upon entering is comprised of a decent-sized bar with a few tables.  Here, the music is always at an appropriate level (at least for happy hour), and wafts between today's pop music and classic pop tunes.  I find it a relief from all the loud ""beats"" found in other establishments.The second area, as you proceed to the back of the venue, is dedicated to those who enjoy piano music.  It has a few more tables in addition to a much smaller bar.  Show tunes are not in my wheelhouse, though I have to admit this area tends to have a livelier/friendlier atmosphere than the front bar.The outside patio area is small, but so comfortable.  It is basically reserved for those who smoke, so if you don't enjoy second-hand smoke, this is not for you.  I'm a social smoker, so I don't mind sitting here on days when it's not too hot/cold.Overall, I think this spot gets a nice array of people, and the patrons are typically friendly and willing to engage in substantive conversation.  The spirits selection is adequate, but from what I've experienced, the wine and beer offerings could be revisited by management.  One of the things that I'm most fond of is their commitment to keeping a clean bathroom area - pissy loos will always prevent me from returning to your establishment - Yuck!  While they don't serve food, I have seen folks bring in vittles from the outside; don't know what their official policy is on this.All of the above are reasons I'd recommend this place.  The only thing I've encountered that gives me reason to pause, at times, is the unreasonable and oft-bitchy bartender who mans the first bar.  I am the type of patron who doesn't ask for much - give me my cocktail, and I'll entertain myself.  I'm certainly capable of striking up a conversation with my brethren, and kind enough to acknowledge others.  That said, I recognize that others actually seek conversation with the bartenders of watering holes.  This bartender (believe his name is Tyler) is probably the crankiest young man I've ever encountered behind a bar - certainly not one for a conversation where mutuality can be expected. His seemingly disdain for life is most annoying and almost akin to that of a psychopath.  At a HAPPY HOUR, the last thing you want to hear is an employee constantly speaking of his colleagues and patrons in disparaging tones.  I've thought about the reasons an establishment would keep someone like him around, and I've deduced to either he's sleeping with the owner, or there simply aren't an abundance or folks applying for a job to work here.  Whatever it is, I hope they seriously consider doing something with him.  Anyhoo, should you go, just head to the back area where the bartender is much more professional.",2,,1
19,Andrew M.,"Manhattan, NY",90,10,5,2.0,1/21/2017,"Place is not closed , it was closed for renovations. So for starts I work right down the block and was planning on making this spot a nice regular spot to go to with my employees, after a long day at work I decide to patron here on a Saturday night. I came here with some employees bragging about the good time I had a week prior, (different bartender) he was very nice made me want to come back,  now the bartender I experienced tonight he was white with glasses, did not care to give us a name, and gave us problems all around, I order a shot and beer my friend buys a mixed drink and we decide to leave bar to sit in the patio (very nice btw) , but before we leave bar I decide to get another drink before we left so I did not have to get up to get another, the bartender then states ""don't you want to finish that first"" like excuse me , made me look like someone's alcoholic in a bar.so we proceed to the patio where they state there is a waiter, unfortunately no waiter ever came to us so my friend goes to bar to buy drink and the bartender tells her no to take a seat and the waiter will be with us, like what type of crap is that  even when we had a sever take care of us the same bartender made waiter come to us to check id's yet you already served us.  due to his lack of customer service  I really don't want to return the only salvation of the evening was the friendly waiters and they are the only reason you get 2 stars.",2,2,

I need to sing at Uncle Charlie's Piano Bar.Seriously- it's this good. You walk down the block that's very close to Grand Central Station and all the things I loathe about going above 14th Street. You pass a slew of B graded restaurants and odd 1987 looking Korean shops. All of a sudden a cadet blue awning compels you to walk up to the second floor and you are thrust into the stereotypical midtown Manhattan gay bar, but this gay bar not only has a twist to it, it also has a shout: piano cabaret singing in the back.As you walk in you are greeted by the most handsome and friendly latino men (who know how to sing, for that matter). The drinks are not cheap, but if you wanna splurge and get shwasted while singing along to some faghag and her man's version of ""Take me or Leave me,"" THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU.The best part: there is a patio that has a beautiful view of the Chrysler building.

22,Toan N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",130,319,362,2.0,7/17/2012,"I met my friends here on an early Saturday afternoon. I have to say I didn't know about this place until it popped up on my google search for ""gay midtown bars"". Walking into the AC-on-full-blast bar was a pleasant surprise from being out in the summer heat. A full bar awaits you as you enter the front door. Towards the back is a smaller bar, seating area, a piano room, and a small patio. I asked for water. The bartender asked if I wanted Poland Spring or Perrier. I said Poland Spring. For one bottle of Poland Spring, it was $5. Another customer came in a few minutes later...apparently a regular...he asked for water and was given a glass of tap water with no options for Poland Spring or Perrier. Did the bartender really think I wanted to come into a bar and just have tap water? I wanted to hydrate myself with water before moving onto well drinks. My friends arrived and I ordered a couple drafts for them. I walked away by paying $24 ($20 plus $4 tip) for two drafts and two water (domestic) bottles.Advice for the bartender: Next time, give the customer tap water like every other bar in the city when he asks for water instead of asking ""poland spring or perrier"". If bottled water is the only option, don't charge as much as a drink. That's just lame.",11,5,

It's a pity too. The piano bar is really fun and the singers, for the most part, are really good. Many probably just got off their shows as you can tell from their perfectly-set Broadway hair. It's a nice intimate setting with friendly banter all around. If you are shy, you probably should find a corner as you might be encouraged to sing but it's an entertaining experience regardless. Unfortunately the thumpa thumpa from the main hall is a major distraction and horribly out of place. It's a weird combination. They do however have a great, tranquil lil' patio out back with a view of the Chrysler building. If and when Uncle Charlie decides to do away with the ""oomps oomps"" music, it will be a great chill spot to relax, enjoy a drink, gaze at the stars, and enjoy some fancy singing.",5,7,2

43,Patrick D.,"Manhattan/Upper West Side, New York, NY",43,21,9,4.0,9/20/2007,"You remember the last time you cruised Craigslist for sex?  You finally agree to go to the guy's apartment, hop in a cab, get to his building and looking at the outside you start getting your regrets?  You buzz the buzzer, and walking into the building, the only thought passing through your head is, ""What a freaking dump!  This guy must be a total loser!""Yet, when you knock on his door, you are incredibly surprised to see just how nice his apartment is, not the mention that he is really hot.Do you remember that moment?  Yeah...me neither, but that's exactly what it's like walking into Uncle Charlie's bar.  The place is...well...nice.  Granted, walking in the door, I felt as if I had been transported back to the late 60's when gay bars were illegal.  Red cellophane on the windows, and the bar being a freaking flight of stairs up on the second floor of the building (warning...those things are a bitch if you had too much to drink!), they really made the place look nice.Post work happy hour consisted of the bartender, a 50 something year old DJ working the multiple IPOD machine throwing back tunes of the 80's (Did they just play Sade?) and as soon as I sat down, they offered me a nice bowl of peanuts.The front bar is your traditional wood grained bar, complete with the regulars sitting in their particular stools, yet even they were friendly and welcoming, with one offering me a bite of his sandwich he got from down the street.Seeing that I was meeting a date here, I chose to not take a bite of his onion loaded sandwich, and instead had some peanuts while sipping my vodka tonic.  Not as strong as the townhouse, but strong enough to be sipped.  This was a first date...I wanted to be somewhat sober.My date arrived 14 minutes late...and I found myself more impressed with the bar and less with him.  This is what happens when you get asked out while at a bar.  You say yes without really thinking and regret it later.  I would sincerely regret this guy.The middle area of the bar is a piano lounge, where a performer was warming up for his show later.  ""Yo!  Sparkles....shut the hell up so I can hear this date speak to me"", I thought, and ironically, the bartender shut the glass doors so he could no longer be heard.  Sadly, I was then able to hear my date...and just how stupid he was.  I would have rather heard the performer warming up again.Seeing that this guy and I had NOTHING in common, I ditched him and went to the back patio.  Yes...a back patio...with real growing plants!!!!  I honestly didn't think plants grew in New York City!From outside, I saw my date leave.  In fact I saw several people leave all at the same time.  Sitting next to another patron I asked him about this.  ""They're all on the train to Connecticut"" he explained.  It made sense, seeing how close the bar is to Grand Central Terminal.  This bar would be a fabulous place to meet a man for that train ride home.Except I already am home.And I think that was the problem.  Uncle Charlie's for me was just like a Craigslist hookup  (Oh shut up...you've all done it.).  It's fun at the time, but about 30 minutes after you leave, you're really not interested in going back.  In fact...you kind of forget it happened in the first place.  It ended up being just a one time thing.  I'm going back to the West side.",24,42,13
44,George M.,"San Diego, CA",84,93,67,5.0,10/20/2013,Nice bar for a quiet drink and to relax in the early evening. Great view of the Chrysler Building from the outside patio. Drinks were strong and tasty and the prices average for Manhattan. All in all an enjoyable experience.,,,
45,Wayne S.,"Manhattan, NY",139,4,0,4.0,12/9/2013,"I very much enjoyed Uncle Charlie's on a Wednesday night and Porno Bingo with Will Clark.  He was supposed to be joined that evening by Levi Carter, but Levi failed to show up.  But the bar was enjoyable, and the bartenders and almost everyone very friendly.",,,
46,Mike B.,"WALL STREET, NY",14,10,0,4.0,12/24/2012,"This place is right by my work and right near Grand Central.  I've been coming here for years and is my favorite after work hang out.  Full bar, welcoming people, nice place.  The bartenders are friendly and funny. I like that the bathrooms are always super clean, not a common occurrence for a bar. Top shelf cocktails are $10, but and they do buybacks.  Highly recommend giving this place a try, especially if you have some time to kill before catching your train at Grand Central, or wanting a drink before/after dinner in Midtown.",2,,
47,Andre H.,"Washington, DC",507,34,0,5.0,7/4/2012,Sorry yelpers but I loved this place. Why? because  I am a piano bar queen. The pianist and singers where great and for my friends that smoke there is a beautiful little patio so you don't have to go to the street.,3,1,2
48,Michael B.,"San Rafael, CA",16,20,0,1.0,3/10/2015,"As I expected, Monday night sucked here. Unmotivated bartender (the only one), and a loud, untalented piano player who was trying to sing. He was trying to sing a song when he didn't know the words to it. Very amateurish. I was amazed that this kind of low talent was able to survive in a high-talent city like NYC.",,,
49,RN W.,"Seattle, WA",2,27,4,5.0,1/6/2015,"Had a great time at this bar. Loved hanging out with friends, old and new, singing our favorite songs. Went on a Monday night, great piano player! If I lived in NY, I would be at this bar all the time! Can't wait to come back and visit.",,,
50,Ali C.,"Nashville, TN",230,345,4,4.0,6/25/2012,"Aw, poor Uncle Charlie. He only has a few stars on Yelp. Well, I happen to disagree. I was not treated unkindly because I am a woman, my martini was delicious, and I enjoyed the mini-patio out back.",,,
51,Sandy C.,"New York, NY",366,544,1523,3.0,11/28/2010,"I work with a lot of gay men and this is the place that is close by to work that they like to hit up for happy hour drinking. It's always fun with the gays, especially at the back room where the piano is at. The singing and dancing is always just so much more fun with them. They have happy hour drink specials and what not, but they do not serve any food. Which is a bummer, but still a great place to chill at. I have to admit some guys are really cute, but this is not the place for me, afterall this is a gay bar. Don't get me wrong I love the gay men that's in my life. I mean they call me Grace for a reason lol.",7,3,7
52,Eric P.,"New York, NY",379,260,24,4.0,9/30/2008,"Where the hell did this place come from?I've been wanting to try this place out for a while, but every time I walk by, I've always chickened out. Maybe it's the name: ""Uncle Charlie's"" -- right up there with ""Chester the Molester.""A great alternative to Townhouse and OW bar complete with friendly bar staff, low-key but clean neighborhood bar atmosphere, great happy hour specials, and a nice outdoor patio. It was on the Next Magazine gay bar map, so it HAD to be legitimate.",3,5,3
53,Share W.,"New York, NY",71,410,635,3.0,7/6/2008,"I'm a fag bar hag at times.  What's wrong with wanting to get a drink and not have a sleazy guy breaking the vibe.The owner is SUPER DUPER nice.  They allow you to order or bring food in to eat while enjoying your drink.  I usually go downstairs or order (menu available at the bar) at the Chinese restaurant and order up the Chinese version of buffalo wings.  YUMMY Chinese chilli wings ARRGGG!!!  It wasn't what I expected when I was going up the stairs.  It's a very loungey, relaxed feel.  They have a nice outdoor deck and and enclosed area with a piano area.  They're usually playing showtunes or wonderful jazz or classical music.",2,1,1
54,Ryan D.,"Nashua, NH",264,358,64,2.0,6/11/2009,"As a frequent purveyor of HX magazine and it's website, I jumped on the opportunity to win a free $25.00 bar tab by writing in and giving the name of my favorite uncle. I mean, really come on. That's a cute contest. So I did, and they gave me some booze moola. One Wednesday, I found myself bored and not too far from Times Square (there was Midtown Comics business that needed to be done!), so I decided to saunter in, cash in my tab, and check the place out.That's when I realized- I've totally been there before. My first few months in New York even. My very first HX mixer. Which was way too overcrowded in what really is a modestly sized midtown bar. One of the regulars who chatted me up and made me feel more attractive than I am, described it as his ""neighborhood bar."" I don't know if I agree with that. With it's proximity to Grand Central, it's not really in a neighborhood. Uncle Charlie's is oddly out of place. It really belongs in Chelsea where it would have it's built in audience, or way uptown where it could carve a niche for itself. It's sort of in the middle of everything, making it kind in the middle of gay nowhere.So... HX brought me there twice. And I drank cheap both times. And I might go back in 6 months and forget I was ever there again. The staff was nice. It was pretty much dead when I was there, which was around 8:00 PM on a Wednesday in June. For midtown, I mean... yeesh. I guess people really hate that place. Didn't check out the piano bar section or the outdoor patio, but would have been into exploring both my next time there. I mean, it's worth checking out, but go when it's cheap, people.",,1,1
55,Anthony K.,"Manhattan, NY",7,6,0,1.0,8/12/2012,"This could well be the very LAST time I am ever setting foot in this place.  It has gone downhill, significantly.  However, one thing remains unchanged - the ULTRA BAD CRAPPY attitude of one particular bartender.  I do not understand why this one harbors such a foul attitude every time I go SINCE the time the bar came into existence.  I don't understand what the sneer is for.  There is NEVER a welcome; lack of acknowledgement; no nothing.  That ""why are you here""  look.  How did I offend you?????????  What is that ""i am superior than thou attitude""?  Very strange.  Just unfathomable.  Is it an inferiority complex that I inspire or a threat of a lack of superiority when I am around?  Very very sad psychology.  Of course, there is a particular TYPE of clientele that this particular one welcomes.  I would rather not say, since it borders on offensiveness.  They / this one welcomes his REGULARS.  Like another reviewer here noted about free tap water for REGULARS.  For the rest us, the new visitors and the NOT SO REGULAR, why bother going???  From what used to PEGASUS, this place is nothing like it; it lacks a soul.  It may have a nice decor but doesn't help if the welcome is staggered and for only a select few.  Very unprofessional; impossible for a service oriented business.  NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS!!!  Bring back the older crop of bartenders who know deeply about genuine customer service and basic UNBIASED INDISCRIMINATORY bartendering manners.  We do not need those who think they are the KING of the bar/better than thou.NO, NOT GOING BACK.....",2,2,
56,Evan E.,"Long Island City, NY",39,162,11,3.0,10/18/2010,"I have to admit I was nervous about going here, but It was pretty cool.  The music wasn't so loud you couldn't each other.  They're drinks were pretty good--2 for 1.  The server was really cool and a girl kept passing out free shots and gave us shirts.  Even though it was a gay bar, it wasn't over the top and it was very mixed.",2,,

58,Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,619,238,3.0,7/10/2008,"One of the newer additions to the NYC gay bar entourage, this Midtown East site, like its brothers, is meant to cater to the mature crowd, but all are always welcome. The bartenders and servers are nice, the drinks are reasonably priced and their happy hour specials are pretty good! The music was okay, though I'm sure it gets better later at night since it is, after all, a piano bar. I really enjoyed it for happy hour because it wasn't too loud or crowded, so Yosh H., his coworker and another friend of mine sat at a booth and caught up. They have a tiny patio but it was too hot to be out there. There were two people there but I think they were smokers.",8,,7
