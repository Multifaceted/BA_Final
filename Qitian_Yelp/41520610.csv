0,Sushma K.,"Manhattan, NY",556,23,19,5.0,8/21/2018,"From the first bite, I knew I was in burger heaven! The interior is very unique to their brand and it is decorated wonderfully. They have an outdoor area which has these cute yellow chairs and lights that definitely add artsy points!The menu has so many options with all different types of burgers. I have tried pretty much every burger on the menu (except for the standard) and each has its own twist with meats, toppings and condiments. I recommend the El matador with sweet potato fries on the side. They have a selection of milkshakes as well which are worth trying. If you're vegetarian/vegan, they have delicious choices as well! The vegan burger is not as filling of course, but doesn't fall short of delicious.",,,
1,Kevin S.,"Brunswick, OH",178,3,0,1.0,10/20/2018,"Lmao. Say you want a nice burger, one made with high-quality meat that makes you feel a little bit better about not being a vegetarian, so you decide to go to Bareburger. You've been there before so you're not too worried. Plus, you've got a pug with you -- a cute pug, who doesn't love a cute pug? -- so you're looking for a place with some outdoor seating. Which is how you ended up at the Barebuger in Greenwich Village. Jokes on you. At this Bareburger at least, that's not possible. The service here was horrible. Other people had dogs, yet somehow employees -- especially the hostess -- seemed so upset with my party's request for pug-friendly accommodations and it took us almost 20 minutes to get sat outside despite there being able ample open tables. Then once we got sat, the service was standoffish, prickly -- not all what you expect. I mean, you just wanted a nice meal with friends. You didn't people to make you feel like you're being a nuisance. The manager brought us our food, and even then they hardly said anything when they brought it over, making us all feel like we weren't welcome. Who is paying who? Look, the food was fine. Typical Bareburger fare. The service? Horrible. This isn't to say all Bareburger's are bad, just this one. Like how airports aren't all bad, just LaGuardia.",,,
2,L C.,"Norwalk, CT",0,9,0,3.0,7/10/2018,"Went with a large party on Saturday eve. that arrived at different times. They let us wait inside on an extremely hot evening.  When all our party arrived, after 10 minutes, I had to get up, flag down a wait person and tell them we were finally ready to order. Other than that, the wait staff  was very good & did not pressure us to leave at exactly at closing time.  That was nice. My impossible burger arrived well done, not medium rare as requested and it arrived cold, but it still was really VERY good.   The coleslaw side was as unremarkable ---tasted like standard diner fare and it was runny.  Standard Unsweetened ice tea was nice as it was -but I probably would have used some stevia if it was offered. No packets of sweetener in view anywhere. So service and atmosphere really good. Food average.",1,,1
3,Jessica H.,"Edison, NJ",0,36,48,5.0,8/11/2018,"New favorite burger place hands down. The impossible burger has won me over - meat tastes exactly like beef just slightly stringy in texture. The juice, smell and tenderness is all there. I got it with the sprout bun, vegan american (which was also delicious), carmelized onions and thai ketchup. The costs of customizing your own burger racks up easily with toppings but it was certainly worth it. Any vegetarian must try this!The place is also meat friendly - my friend got the supreme burger (beef patty with onion rings) and enjoyed it. We split a hudson salad (no bacon) and that was a great starter too - the runny sunny side egg goes great with the spinach and goat cheese.",1,,
4,Misty W.,"Queens, NY",156,51,419,5.0,5/27/2018,"This is like an American burger except so much better than regular burgers !! DUHHH! it's pretty affordable. Each burger is like around 13bucks. And apparently you could also make your own combination of what you want in your burger. We ordered supreme burger and buckaroo burger,both of which is super yummy and the beef was cooked to medium. However, they don't offer regular coke as a option for drinks but instead they have a drink similar to coke but it's way Wayy sweeter than regular coke and tasted kinda funny, kinda minty and cherry favor. If you're the type of person who likes to try to new things, you could give it a try.",1,,
5,Yasir A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",156,57,79,5.0,3/16/2018,"Bison and Elk? Yeah, this place has it. The burgers are amazing. I never realized how good other meats could be. My burger had a ton of things, from duck bacon to mushrooms and boy was it delicious.The drinks (non-alcoholic) were not so good, probably because they don't have a pounds of sugar. The drinks tasted stale; I would've definitely taken water.But despite that, the food was very very good. Top 3 burger spots in New York City in my honest opinion.Note: in the summer if you're sitting outside, you will see rats.",1,,

Not sure what's going on in the kitchen considering we spent a ridiculous amount on their mediocre ""organic"" burgers. The food took forever to come out as well. The service left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't go back but if you would like to be sick to your stomach for an entire day and not be able to leave your bed I highly recommend.",,,

9,Shawn D.,"New Bedford, MA",49,176,293,5.0,4/21/2018,(Vegan review) WOW! The ultimate burger is amazing! Best vegan burger I have ever had. The sauce is good too. (Thai ketchup) the wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.,2,,

11,Leslie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,186,247,5.0,7/31/2018,"I've had Bareburger once before, but I forgot how amazing it was until I had it again recently! I had the standard burger which comes with American cheese, caramelized onions, special sauce,and dill pickles on a brioche bun. The burger patty was juicy even though I ordered it well done. The brioche bun was soft and fresh. Their special sauce is similar to most ""special sauces"" at burger spots, but had more hints of mustard. Overall, the burger was delicious! I also had their fries which came out hot and fresh. Loved all of the food at Bareburger!",1,,

I got the supreme this time bc I wanted onion rings but didn't want an entire side. You'd think burgers never travel well but it's packaged pretty tight. A plus, there was an onion ring in the burger and two on the side. PerfectttttThe burger itself isn't the most flavorful. Mostly bc it's packed on with so many ingredients and can be a bit overpowering. Tasty regardless and definitely worth $12. Like I said, I'm not a burger person but I'd come back for a sit down just for the onion rings alone. And a shake.",1,,2
14,Anna V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,13,15,5.0,5/7/2018,"""Impossible is nothing""... or something of the sort. Thanks for the motivation, though, 'Ham. The great Ali & I are on a nickname basis, general FYI. Deciding between the Beyond & Impossible burger was probably one of the toughest food decisions I've had to make in a while. It stood down to the true test of time - the eenie meenie song & dance (note: not the god-awful Sean Kingston & Justin Bieber duo) - where my finger landed on The Impossible Burger. I subbed the cheese for its cruelty free counterpart & dug in. Not a burger fan, but I'll be damned if this doesn't convince my omni parents to sell their souls to the Vegan devil & move to Hades, Hell... too far? Perhaps, but my taste buds didn't have to travel to get to the Delicious destination they were searching for. Meat flavored, juicy... texture, presentation, even down to the smell. They've done it all, folks. Plant based engineers that can make a burger bleed without causing the suffering of others in your wake, I salute you. Impossible this was not, apparently. 5 stars satisfaction guaranteed.",,1,
15,Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",922,1221,5101,3.0,8/20/2017,"This place was just fine. While I appreciated the large and creative menu, I found our burger to be less exciting than I expected. My bigger problem was dealing with my mom's frustrations. We'd been doing quite a bit of walking that day and arrive not just hungry, but thirsty. The waitress immediately brought a bottle of water to the table. Well, we finished that by the time we were only a bite or two into our meal. Then our waitress seemed to disappear. We eventually managed to get someone else's attention and asked her for more water. She was friendly and assured us she'd bring one. Nope. We eventually saw our waitress, but couldn't manage to catch her attention. Again, more waiting. Another five minutes, no sign of our waitress. So we went up to the bar and asked. Our bar tender immediately took care of it. I'm just not sure that only decent food and really lacking service are worth the prices they charge. Maybe another location is better?",8,3,5
16,Annie Y.,"New York, NY",591,113,157,4.0,9/24/2017,"Cool burger place near NYU in Greenwich Village. The menu has your traditional American burger to your exotic Blue Elk burger. It's definitely a cool place to check out if you're looking to eat outside of your comfort zone. The burgers will run you around $10-$15, but it's not bad since the burger patty is of higher quality and cooked to your preference e.g. well done, medium rare, etc.I've tried their Great Plains and their Blue Elk burgers, and each one offered something different. I love a good runny egg so the Great Plains was the better of the two for me personally. Service is good, and the place is pretty chill so come with your friends. They also offer vegan and low carb options!",1,,
17,Moshe H.,"New York, NY",66,121,99,4.0,3/27/2018,"I think that this specific location is my favorite of all barenurgers in NYC. It is big, very spacious, comfortable and welcoming.Here I also tasted for the first time the beyond burger, which was delicious!!!!! We actually tasted the 2 vegan options, and both were great, but the beyond was more juicy and rich than the impossible! However I loved the caramelized onions on the impossible, so I guess that combining the two will make the best vegan burger they have!I just wish they were just a little bit bigger....",,,
18,Joi B.,"Long Island, NY",3906,1736,1274,4.0,6/29/2017,"I visited NYC. I had the Impossible Burger. Jesus wept.I get it. The geniuses behind the Impossible Burger didn't have to think too hard about a name.  I could just hear the conversation in the boardroom: ""This shall be a very elusive find. It can be called only one thing..."" If you're on a quest to find the eponymous burger, you apparently can't get it at just any Bareburger location. You must get it down by my alma mater in Greenwich Village. I almost had a moment of panic when my Uber driver was about to drop me off at the one in Midtown, because we were coming from 52nd and 5th. ""Sorry, I'm going to the MUCH FURTHER AWAY location where bliss awaits."" Half an hour later (seriously. I forget how long it takes to get anywhere by cab in Manhattan) we pulled up and I was hangry but in a good way.And this Impossible Burger? It's so worth the damn trek. Hell, I'd be compelled to move closer to the Village if I were still living in NYC. You're even able to order a temperature on it, which reminds me of days long ago (childhood) when I would order my burgers ""very well done."" It arrived with virtual pomp & circumstance and is the burger of a vegan's dreams. The crunchy char. The chewy texture. The piles of toppings and condiments. I picked it up and pretended I was in a Carl's Junior commercial (or is it Hardee's?), albeit the short tattooed vegan girl version. Note: You have to ask ""make it vegan"" or the bun contains dairy and I think they might slather on mayo too.Being that this review is for Bareburger and not the Impossible Burger alone, I should mention how cool it is that they are so environmentally conscious. The menu is loaded with options for allkinds-avores and I was even able to enjoy my burger and fries with a glass of bubbly. I appreciate the spacious environs and it's nice to get seated in a huge booth in Manhattan.",23,13,14
19,Dana D.,"Seattle, WA",7,22,1,3.0,6/26/2018,"I think there is always a fine line between quality, taste and price. This is a line most of the time isn't met. This is one of those cases. The food was good (3.5 stars) service (2.5 stars) and price (1.0 stars). Nice concept, but if you are charging those prices, 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks +$50.00. ( this included 18% tip) You need to really be on your game and they were not  the server was super friendly and recommended well, but once food was dropped, never returned until I asked for the check.

I've never been to any of the locations in manhattan as I usually eat at Bareburger forest hills. When my friends and I happened to walk passed this location we noticed they had outdoor seating so we decided to stop by and enjoy a burger and the nice weather. The menu seamed to have changed since the last time I ate Bareburger (about a year ago) so I thought I'd try some new items. To share we got the crispy Brussels sprouts and fundido fries, both of which were delicious. For myself I ordered the El matador burger and the American burger. I'm writing this review to compliment the service as Bareburger is usually consistent with their food. I had a few questions that the server didn't know the answer to since he was a new hire, so he said he would bring the manager over to assist me. A young man named Nathanael cane over and introduced himself and was very helpful and seemed to really be interested in making sure we had the best experience possible. It's always a plus when you're treated like a welcomed guest instead of just another customer. Would definitely return to this location solely based on the fact that the service was exceptional. Also extra points for outdoor seating ;)",,,

This time for Laguardia Pl, which is the ONLY NYC location serving the amazing ""Impossible Burger"". To my fellow vegans, vegetarians, peeps who are in between and peeps who are curious: The ""Impossible Burger"" is the answer. Forget about every veggie burger you've tried. Go to therapy and forget about it. This. Is. IT.I have to be honest, when the server handed me the menu, I scoffed in disbelief but I ordered it anyway because I'm a snob and I envisioned myself trashing it. 100% plant based burger supposed to taste like anything but? Let me be judge Bareburger...One bite and BOOMSHAKALAKA.... I was dead wrong. Boy...was I dead wrong. Not only wrong- but I was AWAKENED. To be fair, it doesn't taste like 100% beef because at the end of the day: it's not meat. Only meat can taste like meat no matter how hard you try to manipulate the system BUT... it's pretty darn close. What's even better is that it has a subtle, but very distinct taste of it's own. I can't describe it. I want to say it taste like a beef burger...but with some kinda secret seasoning? I dunno. Just go. Try. Experience. Be AWAKENED my vegan and vegetation peeps. I really hope they start selling it at other locations. Because really, NYU, ya'll have already too many options for solid eats.",9,9,6
24,Solange F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",333,51,140,4.0,3/9/2018,"Tried the Impossible Burger while at Bareburger and have to say it did not disappoint. I got it the recommended way to try it out for the first time. It was good; however, the vegan cheese I didn't quite like. It was pretty slippery, causing the bun to slide and shift out of place. When I go back, I'll be sure to switch up the cheese. Overall, this was the best burger imitation I've had! Definitely appreciate it when I'm craving a burger, but don't want to eat beef. The service was great. Server joked around with us and kept saying 'cool beans'--gotta love it.",,,

They have a lovely patio setup on lovely laguardia place which is not super congested and fairly removed from the hustle and bustle of the people and car traffic. Our waitress came and took our drinks and food order but we never got utensils or napkins. The food came relatively quickly. Even when our food came we didn't have utensils and napkins. We had to flag her down and ask for it. I had the regular American burger. The bun is bigger than the burger itself. It was average. Not bad but nothing to write home about either. I'd give the place another try but they will need to step it up. Little things like utensils and napkins are important and if the food comes and tour patrons don't have utensils to start eating, that could be an issue.",,,

The Chicken burger was great, it came with onions rings and cut up french fries, it was too much for me to finish.

We dined together (well, technically she just dined and I stole bites of her food and sips of her chocolate milk) before heading to the park. If she could write, or type or communicate in any way using fine motor skills, she'd let you all know how good their grilled cheese and milkshakes are. She's one of the pickiest, I mean most particular, eaters I've met, and ate more here than I've ever seen her eat before. Thumbs up for the kids meals. Thumbs up for the fry portion too. Enough fries for adults to steal without the kid noticing. We ate there before the morning rush and I'm not sure they quite knew what to do with us. I needed a place to park the stroller and they sent me to the back, but ended up moving it outside. I also was very confused who our waiter was because multiple people kept visiting our table and trying to take our order.

I'm not sure if it's because I had ot to-go and so it got a little soggy during transit but they were alright. They offer outdoor and indoor seating and the menu has a wide variety of meats and combinations to choose from.

Management not giving staff the tools they need to do their job? Understaffed? Nobody gives a fuck? Who knows.

40,M S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,26,5.0,12/3/2017,"They are very helpful when ordering Impossible Burgers. The only vegan bun choices are the sprouted grain or collard green, lol. They will remind you that there is one vegan cheese option. There are some sauces to choose from, but no aioli/creamy ones. Personally, I add avocado (not guacamole) to v burgers- but not this bc it really is like meat, and I didn't want to complicate the experience. Which is pretty wild and can lead to self discovery as far as what one looks for in meat alternatives. I found I like ""fake"" meats, that are clearly NOT meat, and not this type of fare!This medium rare (order preparation as you would with meat) impossible burger really bleeds. I had it on a sprouted grain bun with Vegan American Cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and ketchup. Fries and a beer! The first half was a little squished so a lot of bun. The second half was a lot of burger and yes, it tastes like the real thing. I was with an omnivore that agreed. I had to take a break from it bc the second half is very beefy!If you don't like meat- you might want to try the Farmers Quinoa burger, which is excellent.

It's a weird balance of sweet and somehow sour? Big disappointment from a place I regularly frequent.,,1,

Waiting 5 minutes for an extra napkin after food is served? Waiting 5 minutes for first order of drinks? Someone is not staffing properly or bartender is not assisting. Of course, maybe there should be 2 staffers at the bar? My hit was the bar was about NYU students beer-in up and the rest of us at the tables, we could....you know, get with the devil hats. I prefer my kitty hat :-)  -- that the minus star.Finally -- Not the fault of the joint but watch out: this is a ""training"" restaurant for NYU faculty with precious 2 year old squealing geniuses. We've been here many times and, a few times, we have to move our table to escape preciousness. Ask to be seated AWAY from the 1 to 2 year olds.

The veggie wrap was tasteless, which is surprising considering it had sweet potato inside and yet no flavor whatsoever. The impossible burger is more interesting, but definitely overhyped. It's a good idea, but there ""juice"" in the""meat"" was no evenly distributed, therefore those spots tasted like beans. Not a negative point, but something to consider is that the patty has texture of pulled pork.Lastly the disappointment of the evening was so-called tabouli salad.

I was surprised that this location also does brunch so I took a chance and ordered a side of sausage. The sausage was smoky with that slight sweetness that makes breakfast sausage amazing.

Updated review","Updated Review - No more Elk, Ostrich or lamb. I've been coming to Bareburger for years now. I formerly gave Bareburger 5 stars but I must now take 2 stars away as ownership has decided to remove all the ""exotic"" meats like elk, lamb and ostrich, from menu. The option of enjoying exotic meats was the main reason I consistently chose Bareburger over other burger places and what set them apart.

Wait, do you believe in ghosts?Like ghosts?Yeah, but I mean not spooky. I mean, I believe that after we die our bodies return to the earth.You mean like your physical body.Yeah.But what about like, your soul, or whatever it is?I think our bodies just recycle back to where we came from and it's this never-ending process.

Just sometimes there might be like, energy leftover and it manifests in ways we can't even imagine.OK.Why--where do you think we go when we die?I don't know, like back into the soil.Of the tree?Yeah, like we die and the cycle continues and it's way bigger than any one person.I just got a text saying that our food will be here in 15-20 minutes.Sick.I'm so hungry.Same.",2,2,1

Updated review","Update: I have been ordering Bareburger at least once every other week and they have been forgetting my toppings.  For a $20+ burger and fries they should put the toppings on the burger.  Today I received a burger with just tomato, none of the greens or anything I requested to have put on. So beyond disappointed with this location. I have been to most of bareburger's locations and they have yet to really disappoint me.  I get delivery from this location and they always arrive quicker than the Seamless estimated delivery time.  I get the turkey burger on the gluten free tapioca bun with various toppings and it is definitely satisfying; I can't see how it could be any better.  I believe they must have updated their tapioca bun recipe because I remember it being fairly crumbly- you can't tell the difference between the gluten free and  the non gluten free bun now; it stays in tact until the very end.The burgers can be expensive, especially if you add the toppings they charge for.  Mine is typically around $12 because I get the average, no charge toppings.  They also charge extra, about $4, for the fries.  But let me tell you, the fries are spectacular! They're hand cut and very addicting, especially with their organic ketchup.. I typically cannot stop myself from finishing them all.  Of course they're not to their highest standards when you bust them out of the delivery container but what can you expect really, fries are always best eaten at the restaurant.",1,,

85,Claudine S.,"New York, NY",0,12,3,2.0,5/28/2017,"My friends and I went here, already having been Bareburger fans, and while the food is consistently good, the service at this location was really terrible. We went towards the end of the night and it was not that busy. We were seated quickly and were brought menus. When one of us went to the bathroom, another customer warned us that there was no toilet paper and that when the staff was told, they said they are completely out. We found this unacceptable. This restaurant is in a busy part of town, stores all over the place, someone could have run out and replaced the toilet paper or at the very least could have offered costumers some paper towels or napkins. None of us felt comfortable using the restrooms which was unfortunate.One of the most irritating things here was that it was so hard to get the attention of anyone working at the restaurant. On numerous occasions we needed to ask for something and nobody was paying attention, checking in, or even available to talk to without having to get up from our table. In fact, all people who were working that night were constantly huddled together in the back corner by the bar talking to each other. They were not available to customers at all. We also were never brought any water for the table even after we received our meal. We tried multiple times to get the attention of anyone working, but had to eventually get up and ask for it. When we ran out of water quickly, it was not replenished, nobody checked in, and we had trouble flagging someone down to ask for more. My friend ordered a burger medium rare and it came out very rare, and it took her almost 20 mins to get someone's attention to tell them, let alone get the burger cooked more. Similarly, when we wanted the check, we were waving our hands around trying to ask for it, but everyone was in the back corner only paying attention to each other, and it took an extremely long time to finally get the attention of someone to get the check. We were curious if this was just happening to us, but as we looked around the restaurant we saw almost every other customer looking around for the waiter, trying to get their attention, looking confused as to why it was taking so long to be attended to. The atmosphere is nice in the restaurant, but I can't see myself going back if the service doesn't improve.",,,

Maybe I added too many toppings (I believe I only added Kimchi and mushrooms, though...) but my burger was a salt bomb. The fries were good--there's an appetizer that has a variety of fries available, and I highly recommend it if you're the type to eat anything fried like me. However, to offset the saltiness of my burger...THEY HAVE FROZEN DRINKS! I had an alcoholic Pina Colada, with Kelvin's slushie, which was a huge reason why I even tried it in the first place. Kelvin's slushies are super delicious without having too much of an overbearing ""THIS IS SEVERELY COLORED CORN SYRUP"" taste. Also the coconut rum helped a lot.

92,Kelly P.,"Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA",241,85,60,4.0,4/24/2016,"As a longtime veg pledge, I've come to see veggie burgers as a necessary evil.  They're the ""accommodating"" thing on every sup-par chain restaurant's menu, and I've spent many a younger sibling's birthday halfheartedly picking at a bland mystery vegetable patty at Chili's.  It's impressive when a restaurant can make you change your mind about an entire category of food.  Bareburger turned me on to the art of the veggie burger and I need. More. Bareburger.  I dream of the sweet potato and wild rice patty with guacamole, pickles, and red onions.  Try the hot honey milkshake, too - it's a surprisingly delicious combination of sweet and spicy.I've been to this location twice and the one in Philadelphia once, and found the quality consistent.  Service could be more attentive at this location, and the food takes longer than I'd expect from a burger place.  It's worth the wait, but this isn't a place to stop if you have somewhere to be afterwards.",1,1,1

Updated review","Not the best burger I ever had, but it's edible!   They're a little greasy & they consistently get your order wrong no matter which of their restaurants you visit.  I understand that these burgers aren't for those looking for a healthy meal,  but is anything healthy here ?",,,
96,Jon B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",167,408,3,4.0,5/1/2016,"I had a solid meal here today with a group of 4. The beer selection is outstanding, they have a bunch of locally brewed selections. I tried the Buckaroo burger and it was a solid combo of beef and brisket. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were decent as well, and a nice portion for 4 hungry guys. The Buffalo chicken bites while tasty were a touch hot for my standards.Minus one star for the service. It wasn't bad by any means, and the bartender who was filling in and waiting our table was hillarious. The issue was, after he left no other waiter really came to check on us, so we had to flag them down a few times to get the check settled. But the food came promptly and the quality made it worth the slight hassle. I would return.",1,,
97,Tanner R.,"New York, NY",81,3,0,5.0,12/13/2017,"This place is delicious. All of their burgers are creatively made with the flavor being the most important factor. I have eaten nearly every burger, and they have all been exceptional. I've had some of their cocktails too, and they're definitely delicious, especially for a burger place! The only downside is that everything is just a few dollars more than you'd like to spend. Plus, fries don't come with your burger, you have to pay extra to have fries as your side.... what up with that? BUT this place is still amazing, and definitely worth treating yourself to.",,,

99,Liz S.,"Seattle, WA",26,290,90,4.0,6/17/2016,"High-quality, healthy ingredients and tasty food. I did the build your own burger option and ordered a sweet potato rice patty with a sprouted bun, queso fresco, pickled onion, pickled jalapeño, pico de gallo and guac (which was MIA). I really appreciate how they have 3 different vegetarian patty options. I was expecting the sweet potato rice patty to have more sweet potato and less rice but it ended up being the other way around. It was still good though. The bun was nice and fresh and all the ingredients were flavorful but I didn't detect any guac. The guacamole really would have rounded out the burger and contrasted the heat of the jalapeños and onions. I was hungry and didn't bother mentioning the guac, but our waiter was very helpful and I'm sure he would have brought some out right away. It's nice sitting outside in the sun!",,,

At least that did not take 10 minutes, but at least 5 minutes.The burger and the chicken sandwich was really, really good, as were the salads.The staff are all 20 or younger which is terrific as long as management can train.Unfortunately, the way everyone was running around and not getting anything done efficiently was like watching a pitiful SNL skit.Come for the food, just come off, off peak.Oh by the way, the manager was too busy to come to our table, but they discounted the check by If I remember correctly was 11% for a ""neighbors discount"".That was the right thing to do, and it went a long way.

With a big table, the lady was very impatient I'm assuming because of the busy dinner crowd. Definitely don't recommend coming during a busy time. On the other hand, I thought the burgers were pretty good. I still prefer Umami but it's an alternative option being slightly cheaper and more casual setting. Children would love this place. I did not take advantage of the Bison and other unique meat options available which I probably would try next time because I thought the burgers were just alright.

A bunch of my vegetarian friends recommended this place to me because of the flexibility Bareburger offers in terms of customizing vegetarian burgers. Sounds promising. I tried the Prairie and Guadalupe on 2 separate occasions but found them both to be really dry. The patty itself was dry and the dressing, sauce wasn't enough to make it a juicy burger. The best thing on the menu was the banana foster shake, though. At 850 calories, it still seemed super worth it!",,,

I knew we we're going to have to wait since it was a last minute decision but BareBurger was great to have us seated within 30 mins. My friends and I hung out at the bar where we enjoyed a few drinks until they were able to seat us. I had the standard burger (basic, I know) but it was extremely juicy! Had a side of rings and sweet potato fries and they were fried to perfection. My friend had the chicken tenders and oh man!!! The seasoning on it was tasty! There was a bit of old bay seasoning. Quick bite and it was quite satisfying for us all! I would definitely go again.",,,
106,David K.,"San Jose, CA",108,182,417,4.0,4/20/2015,"The first thing you'll notice at Bare Burger is that all of the items on their menu is organic; even their shakes are organic. My friend and I were in a bit of a hurry when we went, so we grabbed a couple of seats by the bar and ordered right away. Otherwise the wait for a table was about 20 min, as the place was full (it was around 7pm on a Thursday night). They do have traditional beef burgers, but I think if Bare Burger is a place you don't come to frequently you have to try some of their more unique options, like the burgers that are made from either elk, bison, duck, or boar. They have an option for building your own burger but we just picked two of the combinations that were already available, the Hog Wild and the Grindhouse. The Hog Wild was my preferred choice. The boar was a little more tender, and the burger came with a fried egg and onion strings. The Grindhouse came with a sauce in it that was interesting, probably not one I would choose again though. The elk was tougher than your typical beef. It also came with duck bacon. To be honest, the bacon wasn't that good, it tasted more like an overcooked slice of thick ham. I definitely prefer pork bacon. Surprisingly the options at Bare Burger are not that expensive compared to other burger joints, especially considering they have so many unique options in meat.",,,

I ordered a burger with pepperjack cheese, spinach, & red onions with a side of onion rings & a salad. Everything I got was absolutely perfect, no complaints at all. The onion rings in particular were claimed by my waiter to be awesome and he was not joking -- they were the best rings I ever had.Speaking about my waiter, he was absolutely one of the best waiters I ever had. He was super nice and he was always on top of things even after I was completely flustered from a day touring the city. Bonus points for if you order water, they actually give you a glass bottle which you can refill from during the meal which is sweet.It's not the cheapest burger in the world with my meal taking me to around $20 but heck, you're in NYC and it is all organic.

Organic ingredients for eccentric burgers.I'm not going to blame them for charging the price they do for these burgers, for everyone knows Organic is more expensive. However the taste itself is slightly disappointing. I ordered a Wiki-wIKI burger. The meat itself was cooked well, but I was left wanting for a little more flavor in my burger, the pineapple relish barely doing anything for it. The fries were also decent, but nothing special.Bareburger seems to be your typical gourmet hamburger chain, albeit with an organic twist. While I applaud it's determination to revolutionize what a burger can be, I still believe that flavor is king. Unfortunately this keeps bareburger from being anything more than just average.",1,,

After asking if our table had a server, someone finally came over to get our order.  We ordered the shareable rings and fries, brussel sprouts, and 2 Impossible Burgers. We requested the brussel sprouts as an appetizer, as I was starving. Instead, the rings and fries came as an appetizer, with no appetizer plates. My husband had to get up and find small plates. Both the onion rings and french fries were cold and we didn't like any of the 4 sauces. The rest of the food came and the brussel sprouts still had the stalks on them and were hard to eat. The Impossible Burger was good, really surprising how close it was to mimicking beef! (Note that Bareburger doesn't make this burger, they purchase from Impossible Foods...)Getting the check at the end of the night was another ordeal, as we hadn't seen our server since she took our order. We finally were able to flag down another server to get our check and then after another unacceptable wait, we flagged down the host to run our card. We noticed several tables around us having similar experiences. The couple next to us waited at least 15 minutes before getting greeted. We were shocked they didn't walk out. Another couple waited 10 minutes with their CC on the table waiting for someone to run it. Another table never got water until finally asking when the food came. At first we thought the place was just short staffed that night (I know this happens), but every time we looked around for help, the entire restaurant staff was laughing and chatting with each other. Literally nonstop. This would have been fine if the tables were taken care of, but it was very obvious that almost every table needed something.

141,Rohit K.,"New York, NY",37,21,19,4.0,11/11/2016,The Great:The selection and deliciousness of burgers is incredible. I don't know of any places in the city that offer elk and bison. Additionally its easy to get lost in the hipstery combinations strewn around the cities pricey new burger joints but bareburger finds a way to make it fresh and new without feeling like you need a cool hat. The Good:Sauces! they could be better but great to have a nice selection here. The atmosphere is fun as well and a good place to get a burger and a beer with a small group. The Not so Great:The value for size. Burgers are definitely smaller here and without a side I am left pretty hungry. For the cost of the burgers you would expect a couple more ounces or toppings or heartiness to fill you up. I have been here a few times and everything has been tasty so try your tastes!,,,

158,Michelle W.,"Brooklyn, NY",549,223,89,2.0,10/17/2014,"Bareburger inspires me to write fiction. The menu reads a lot like pretty prose: too long, very detailed, and is loosely based on the truth of what you'll get for the stiff price.  For instance, the last of the few times I was here, I ordered the sliders, which were supposed to come with grilled onions (and a small list of other great stuff). I got a too-little-to-notice amount on each burger. The sauce, the most important part of a sandwich IMHO, was also lacking in amount and flavor. The buns were all burnt and crunchy inside and honestly I kept reaching for the ketchup, something I almost never do (I love condiments but ketchup is not my fave.). But at Bareburger, ketchup all of a sudden became my best friend, an indication that the sliders weren't seasoned enough. Or maybe I just couldn't get over how bare my sliders really were and not in a good way.The service seemed friendly but his eyes did glaze over a bit for the less than one minute that it took me to order. My toddler's attention span is longer than that. I ordered a glass of drinkable riesling but it was poured to only a quarter of the glass, and perhaps the right amount but I felt cheated. Especially when I saw the party sitting next to me (4 thirty something business casually dressed men) happily ooo and ahhh upon their huge ass beers arrival. They seemed to appreciate the place, especially the sweet potato fries, until the burgers/sandwiches came, then it was a wrap (pun intended).  Is it bad to say that I was happy I wasn't alone when I overheard them complaining amongst themselves? ""I asked for medium and I got rare."" ""I asked for bacon and I got no bacon."" Apparently these are the times at bare burger. It's not burger king so... you know the rest.",2,4,1

Not complaining, organic is cool. They have a vast variety of meats of not your typical burger kind. Bison, elk, wild boar, ostrich, if it's ""exotic"", they've probably got it. I was craving a classic burger. Mr. M, would always prefer a fried egg option to add to his burger. Bareburger had both. I obviously, went for the Classic Burger. Beef patty (med-rare), topped with cheese, lettuce (shredded, bonus for that!), tomatoes, thinly sliced red onions, and special sauce on a god forsaken brioche bun. Burger patty, over cooked and under seasoned. If I have to add salt to jazz it up.... The god forsaken brioche bun was surprisingly nice. Squishier that majority of brioche buns out there it reminder more of an egg bun brioche. Mr. M's burger was also over cooked and under seasoned. His fried egg was fried well. But, his bacon was fantastic. Service served their purpose but nothing more. Split down the middle, including tax and tip it was about $14. Not bad. I dug the outside deck dining, especially nearing dusk. The inside looked inviting and open. I'd probably give them another shot hoping that the over cooked and under seasoned was just a fluke.",6,2,4

Who the hell charge four bucks extra for one bacon strip... The whole burger came out to seventeen bucks...nuts huh... Needed something to wash down all the food I was consuming... So I got the vanilla spicy honey milkshake...that was the best thing I had all night...seven bucks for a 16 ounce milkshake... It's creamy but still have that zinging spice in every sipe... A must purchase! The service is the worst... I would of gave this place three or three point five stars ...but the service was so crummy that I had to give this place two stars...

The also have elk, ostrich, traditional beef, lamb, and a variety of sandwiches and salad aligned with the core burger menu. The fries were really good, as were onion rings, though it wouldn't hurt them to include fries in the rather expensive price of the burger ($10-15 depending on exotic meat markup and other add-ins). This is an annoying trend among fancy burger chains.Beers on tap include Victory Prima Pils, Ommegang, and a couple of IPAs and largers that are quite respectable.

175,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,4.0,5/4/2012,"Bareburger works with local artisans and farmers and only uses organic and all-natural ingredients. Thus you have high quality burgers made from lamb, wild boar, elk, bison, and ostrich along side with less adventurous meats. The burgers are moist, lean, and deliciously paired with various toppings and your choice of buns. You can pick and choose as you please from their menu but the suggested pairings are a sure hit. Try the Big Blue Bacon with ostrich meat or Maui Wowie with wild boar. Wash it down with a pint of local brew or if you feel a little indulgent then order one of their organic milkshakes.Bareburger's restaurants feel more like a casual eatery than a fancy fast food spot. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is quite friendly. They make you feel that they'd like it if you lingered over your food while conversing with friends.

Maybe even a veggie burger but I can't remember!! They even offer vegan cheese! Which I wouldn't eat but for all the dairy free people out there!! I decided to go with a regular beef burger on the GF bun with bacon, avocado, and habanero chipotle mayo. I also order a fried egg and cheese but it didn't make in on my burger unfortunately. I also got a side of some of the best fries I've had in a while!!! So yummy! And although the egg and cheese weren't on there the burger was so good! I couldn't even finish it which is very unlike me, I have a bottomless stomach! And the staff was so attentive and friendly!!

I came during lunch with a large group (8-10 people) and no one had a single nice thing to say...until the food finally came that is.We were seated pretty quickly, but that's about the only thing that happened quickly. After about 20 minutes no one came over to our table to see if we were ready to order or even if we wanted drinks. With a table of 8 to 10 you'd think someone would notice us right? Finally when someone came over to take our order we asked for a pitcher, but weren't ready to order our meals. Now that pitcher came about 20 minutes later and was finished before everyone was able to fill their glasses. How long did it take for them to come back with another and to take out food order? FOREVER! We placed our orders and didn't put up a big stink about the lack of service and patiently waited...and waited...and then we put up a big stink. When we told the manager how disappointed we were his only excuse was ""we're busy I'm sorry"" and then our waiter came over to tell us ""I'm not your waiter so be glad I'm waiting on you."" Oh...I feel so honored. We called the manager back to tell him how incredibly rude our server was and he mentioned he would be giving us 50% off of our check. A lunch we thought would take an hour and a half tops lasted closer to two and a half hours (no exaggerations) and even with the 50% off it put us all in an awful mood.

186,Dave S.,"Newport News, VA",1,46,1,5.0,6/30/2017,The impossible burger is amazing!!!! Never had anything like it before. Thanks for creating food that made my wildest taste bud dreams come true! Keep up the great work.,,,
187,Marilyn F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,1/22/2017,"We had eaten at Bearburger on 71st street and 1st avenue in the summer.  The beef burger tasted fresh and the fries and onion rings were great.  This is the first time returning since then, and the burger was tasteless and chewy, the fries were soggy and the onion rings were refried several times in what tasted like old oil.  Very dissapointing.  I am wondering if they changed management?  I will not be going back which is a pity as the concept was a good one.",,,
188,Sevon B.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,31,51,4.0,7/8/2015,"I've heard of bareburger for some time now so I decided I would try it out. I wasn't in the mood for any kind of meat today and they offer elk, bison, turkey burgers etc. I went with a black bean burger with red onions guacamole tomato and alfalfa. The burger was on a oat and sesame bun which was delicious. I got a side order of fries which could have been a little less well done. However on the brighter side I paired this with Docs hard apple cider which was also pretty good. Price is decent around 14/15 for the entire meal. The Bareburger in this area is pretty low key and service was fast.",1,,1

191,Ryan K.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,24,4,4.0,12/27/2015,"Pretty nice spot to grab a bite in the West Village. Nice decor, a rustic kind of feeling that I like. I ordered the Classic Bareburger, asked for a Medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! Super juicy burger.They offer A LOT of choices for protein. I think the customization (build your own burger) feature brings in a lot of folks for them.One con: We were told of one of the specials were the Macho Fries, proceeded to ask what was in it, asked for the price where we were told $8, and ordered it. Anyways, we went on with the night, received the bill, and we saw it was $12. Bit of a letdown - It was alright, I feel as if it was just microwaved.",,,
192,Timothy R.,"Plymouth, MI",0,2,0,5.0,6/16/2017,Very gluten free friendly.  Excellent food with lots of choices! They accommodate vegan and dairy free too. I had an excellent shake made with coconut milk.,,,
193,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,353,5.0,7/21/2011,"This place gets infinite goodwill from me for their excellent selection of meats--all grass-fed or even pasture raised.  I like knowing the meat I'm eating has been raised rather than manufactured through elaborate feats of engineering.  Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think the production of beef should be where mankind shows off its industrial ingenuity.I tried the lamb, elk, and bison sliders, and they were good, but seeing the full-sized burgers pass by, I got the feeling that getting a plain old cheeseburger is the way to go.They have a great little beer/wine selection, perfect milkshakes, friendly service, and they play good music.  But be warned that the sides are huge--the fries and the pickles each are enough for three or four.** Update ** Came back and tried a classic cheeseburger.  In a word: great.** Update #2 ** Came back again and tried the veggie ""California"" burger.  Sad to say, it wasn't great.  I tend to like veggie burgers, so I was disappointed.  But the 5-star rating stands.  This place is swell.** Update #3 ** Came back and had the bison with turkey bacon burger.  It was pretty good, through the turkey bacon was flaccid, when I expected it to be crispy?  So, if you're ordering, keep the bison, but maybe skip the turkey bacon.  Followed this all up with a vanilla-raspberry shake--divine.** Update #4 ** Had an ostrich burger with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.  I've had ostrich steak before but never a burger.  I recall thinking the steak was so beef-like that I thought they'd given me beef by accident.  The burger is similar: it's like a leaner beef patty.  Like if a cow had feather and stuck its head in the sand.  That's ostrich.  The lettuce wrap is... surprisingly not crappy.  It's not as satisfying as a bun, and the thing you get does not qualify as a sandwich or a burger--more like a salad you eat with your hands.  But as far as salads you eat with hands go, this one was aight.  Service, as always, was super friendly.",5,1,
194,Vineet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1847,971,1636,2.0,7/5/2013,"So I don't understand what is the fuss about this burger place. I love organic food, but my team lunch the other day left a lot to be desired.So for almost 20 of my co workers decided that we would have out lunch ordered from here. We practically had every type of burger ordered from here with onion rings or fries. First of all I don't think BB understands the importance of corporate account. They completely screwed our orders , they did deliver the food minus any kind of sauce but it wasn't delivered they way it should have been.A person who ordered veggie burger had turkey burger, we had this problem for most of out orders.Coming to taste I had the veggie one, I did not like it at all. It was very dry , wasn't flavorful and the patty did not taste fresh.My onion rings were OK.Also a lot of my co workers also had the same complain about thier food.Very disappointed with my while BB experience!",11,4,3
195,Alex M.,"Portland, OR",7,23,0,2.0,7/28/2016,"Overrated, overpriced, & underfeeds. My burger was good but small . 2 burgers & a small milkshake for $40. Small annoyances like paying extra for guacamole that wasnt on the burger & light on the lettuce if you know what i mean. Nothing to write home about & will never eat there again.",,1,
196,Leah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,13,6,1.0,4/14/2015,"I have decent past experiences here, but today, it was a comedy of errors, only not at all funny. I went in alone and asked if I could sit on the patio, which was fully set up with condiments set on the tables. There was a group sitting at one of the tables. The hostess told me they were not serving outside, but that I could bring takeout outside, which I chose to do. I went to the bar, ordered, and went outside. This made little sense from the get-go.5 minutes later and two bites into my burger, a different employee came out and said I couldn't eat takeout outside because it would lead everyone to believe they can bring their takeout onto their patio from outside the restaurant. I don't see the logic there; that makes absolutely no sense. Once I told him what the hostess instructed me to do, he said she's new and doesn't know, and that he had no idea they weren't serving outside. It seems no one knew what was going on, regardless of whether they were new or not. Your lack of communication and coordination is not the customer's problem.Good customer service would have been to apologize for the confusion, allow me to finish my meal and go back inside. Another option would have been to offer to plate my food so it didn't look like I was eating takeout. Instead, I was asked to leave halfway through my meal, certain that I will never be going back. Get your stuff together, this really isn't rocket science. It makes paying $19 for a burger and fries altogether not worth it. You have lost a customer.",2,1,
197,Juan A.,"Randolph, NJ",12,4,0,5.0,11/18/2016,"Relatively short menu but absolutely gorgeous in variety, flavor, freshness and texture.Enjoyed each bite of my vegetarian burger and the Cococado Shake what's a taste dream. Thanks!",,,
198,Grace Y.,"Los Gatos, CA",311,39,27,4.0,5/8/2013,"Let me just start off by saying that I'm from California...aka the land of In-N-Out.  My standards for a ""good burger"" are pretty high. Haha!I came to this place for the first time today, and it was pretty darn amazing! I went with the Maui Burger but replaced the ranch sauce with the smokehouse sauce since I'm a huge BBQ sauce fan.  My roommate ordered the same thing but kept the ranch, and she also got the banana shake.  I honestly do not know if it was because we were starving, but my roommate and I completely demolished our big burgers within minutes.  It was SOOOO good! She let me have a taste of her banana shake and that was pretty darn amazing also.  Butttttt now comes the bad part. LE BILL.$35 for two burgers and shake....can I get a YAOOOWZA? (That's not including tax and tip by the way). Not going to lie, the bill kind of shocked me, but at the same time, that burger was way too good.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to come here often since its pretty expensive, but when I want to splurge a little, this will definitely be the place.",4,1,1
199,Cynthia L.,"Manhattan, NY",201,745,1300,4.0,9/11/2015,"Ordered the Cali-Fresh salad and it was really tasty, for sure! Cost = $12.40 for a small and $16.40 for a large. The presentation of this dish is quite exquisite and memorable - it's also vegan, organic, and super healthy for you (it's a win win!)! My Cali-Fresh salad consisted of baby kale, red quinoa, grape tomato, watermelon radish, raw red onions, alfalfa, cauliflower hummus and lemon tahini dressing. I'd give this dish a 5/5 for the great taste and beautiful presentation. My friend ordered the Roman Hearts salad that consisted of little Gems Romaine, manchego, watermelon radish, croutons and Caesar dressing ($11.75) and she added fried quinoa (I highly suggest this as an add on and I regretted not ordering it; it tastes amazinggggg!) 5/5 for the Roman Hearts salad! The pink lemonade had a tad of alcohol in it.",,,
