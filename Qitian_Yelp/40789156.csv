4,Bree C.,"Manhattan, NY",373,88,90,4.0,8/14/2017,"My fiance and I went here last week for Bloomfield Restaurant Week and we were met with a super pleasant waitress, Kat, and a nice specialty menu for restaurant week. My fiance ordered the shrimp arrabiatta and I had the caprese salad for our appetizers. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, with a nice spice to it. We enjoyed dipping some of the free bread on the table in the sauce. The caprese salad was a bit watery due to the tomatoes, but edible enough. The balsamic dressing on the salad was perfect and not overwhelming. For our entrees, my fiance ordered the BTK Salmon Bowl and I had the Osso Bucco. I am not a fan of seafood, but my fiance said his dish was very fresh and filling. The osso bucco was presented beautifully and served atop sundried tomato rissotto. I was very impressed with how tender the meat was. I would have enjoyed if there was more of a sauce or extra broth to go with it as it was a little bland in flavor, but again, the meal did not disappoint. I look forward to going back and trying more of Brookdale's menu options as prices seem very good for the area.",2,,1

7,Kris C.,"New York, NY",7,55,15,3.0,4/15/2017,"Mushroom soup is yummy. Crab cakes, not so much. I also had the cheese ravioli in vodka sauce. Nice twist on ravioli and I enjoyed it. Cheesecake and cannolis for dessert. They were both ok.",2,,1
8,Donna O.,"Livingston, NJ",4,12,20,1.0,6/9/2017,"Had dinner here before a Plant Nite event. The mushroom soup is killer-but could have been warmer. My husband had the steak sandwich and liked it. I ordered the burger medium; looked great when it was brought out, but it was over cooked and dry as a bone. The roll was dry also, as others have mentioned so overall, a disappointment. My daughter and her friend were at another table and their service was horrible. I actually had to bring ketchup from our table over after they asked for it twice and never got it. So in spite of the soup, I couldn't recommend this place and wouldn't go back.",1,,
9,Faith T.,"Riverview, FL",0,2,2,5.0,5/1/2018,Phenomenal customer service! Greeted with a smile and seated quickly. Meatball app is to die for!! If you haven't been you are truly missing out!!,1,,
10,Jose C.,"Bloomfield, NJ",80,8,11,5.0,4/11/2017,"After a long day of Adventures, my friends and I needed some good food and what better place to go then here. The weather is nice out so once again we decided to do the outdoor seating. We were served by an awesome waitress Cassandra. We all ordered the BKT burger. I got mine rare, my friend got hers medium rare and my last friend got his well done. All the burgers came out delicious and the fries or just as good. Fairly priced and so close to home, it a must go back for me.",1,,

12,Samantha C.,"Bloomfield, NJ",3,4,4,4.0,12/30/2016,"We came to Brookdale Tavern because we received a gift certificate from a friend. We're glad we stopped in! We came for lunch on a week day. There were a few patrons and we were given a choice of where to sit. We decided to sit in a high top near the back. We ordered buffalo wings, a cheese burger, Mac and cheese with grilled chicken, and two Shock Tops. The service was excellent, the place was spotless, and the food came quick. It was all delicious!  The waitress suggested I throw some grilled chicken on the Mac and cheese since I was indecisive. I'm definitely coming back for that mac and cheese!!  We gave four stars because we need to come back and try some more food!",3,1,

Such great food, ambiance, and company to make it a wonderful eveningI HIGHLY recommend this place if you're near Bloomfield, worth the drive if not to far either!!! Oh you MUST try the Beef Brisket Meatball, we ordered one for appetizer and I got one with my cavatelli and broccoli and the girls took one Togo too!!! Lol YES IT IS THAT DAMN GOOD!!! Angelica our Bartender was pretty cool as were the fellow patrons who suggested one of our apps, the fried potatoes, long peppers, sharp provolone and broccoli rabe.

14,Michelle P.,"Manhasset, NY",360,265,312,4.0,10/24/2016,I came to Brookdale Tavern for a family event yesterday. I had a salad & salmon with potatoes and broccoli. Both dishes were seasoned nicely and the salmon tasted fresh! I don't live around here so I may not be coming back anytime soon... but I thought it was delicious!,2,1,1

16,Janene G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",35,51,42,4.0,6/2/2017,"Sat at the bar. Had some appetizers and a few drinks. The sangria was great and a generous portion. Wings were delicious. The bar pizza was awful, however. Bartenders were friendly and made us feel comfortable. Will be back.",1,,
17,Katherine M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,6/4/2018,"We recently had a party here for my son because he's leaving to enter the Coast Guard. The owner, Bill, was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was super accommodating (even when I was changing the total number of guests at the last minute). We had full use of both rooms for 4 hours. The staff was really friendly & helpful. And the food is REALLY good. I consider myself a chicken francaise expert & theirs is one of the best I've ever had. The pastas are excellent too. We went with the afternoon buffet, which included a salad, 2 pastas, & 3 entrees. For $3 more per person, they added beer & wine. I love to bake & wanted to bring my own desserts. Bill took a dollar off per person & allowed me to bring in everything I wanted. The staff even helped me set up the dessert table when the time came. Bill also allowed us to come in 2 hours ahead of time to decorate. We had about 65 people & everyone raved about the food & the place itself. What an awesome place to have a party!",1,,
18,Cody M.,"New York, NY",0,60,186,4.0,4/22/2017,"Spent Friday Night with Elvis and had a blast! Sangria was very good, pizza not bad at all, very very clean place. Not sure I'll be back for dinner, but wouldn't hesitate going back for another show.",1,,
19,Barbara S.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,0,3.0,7/28/2017,"A friend recommended this place. The food was good, not great and expensive. I ordered the special fettuccine with pesto and shrimp. Generous portion of pasta but only 4 medium sized shrimp. $16 is a lot to pay for 4 shrimp. My friend was happy with her meal. The service was attentive but not intrusive. However, I cringed every time the server called us ""girls"". Also one of my pet peeves is a server asking if you want change when you pay the check. Nice new local place that just needs to get their act together. Hopefully they will. I will go back.",,,
20,Fernando D.,"New York, NY",58,10,0,1.0,5/7/2016,"Disappointing is one of the key words for this review. Tasteless is another. Overpriced comes to mind as well.Went here for a lunch date on a Saturday - quiet maybe 5 people in the premises. We ordered the BTK burger and the veggie burger along w the Thai chili calamari.Calamari was soggy and under seasoned with some chopped up tomatoes, romaine and scallions for ""decoration"" totally inconsistent as some parts were dressed and others looked and tasted like they came out of a frozen bag.Burger was charred with the meat having no taste, bun was stale and portion was pathetic for $10Veggie burger was lackluster at best and again portion was pathetic.Only plus is their service - our waitress was very attentive and nice.Wouldn't come back and I would not recommend it to anyone. Friday's serves better food and that's saying something",3,4,2
21,Sobbie L.,"Bloomfield, NJ",13,93,5,2.0,2/15/2017,"I want this place to win so badly but it keeps falling short. Within the last 10 years this location has been 3 different, but the same, restaurants. Great ambiance, decent service and decent food. And in all fairness if the food was cheaply priced I would be less critical, you know the old adage you get what you pay for. but at the $20 price mark I expect at the very least good but all I get is decent. The staff tries. For instance on our last (and probably final) visit we sat at the bar. our bartender was super nice and accommodating but she was clearly overwhelmed and needed help. This is the same story for the waiters.",2,1,
22,Nicole D.,"Chester Township, NJ",8,4,0,4.0,5/21/2017,"So, I generally like BTK. The food is decent, though the drinks are a bit on the high side for the area. We went on a Sunday night though and they had on waitress for a pretty busy evening. She was clearly working her ass off, but she was just unable to handle the number of customers the restaurant had. I would never go on a Sunday again.",,,
23,David R.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,6/26/2017,"I had my son's graduation party there. The food was outstanding, the service excellent and the overall atmosphere was wonderful. I cannot thank them enough for how the treated my family and guests. It was a night to remember!!",,,
24,Kiri A.,"Bloomfield, NJ",113,22,18,4.0,5/6/2017,"Went here for my birthday dinner back in February. It was surprisingly not crowded for a Saturday night. There were 3 of us. We shared the buffalo calarmari. Delicious. The calamari was nice and tender. Not at all chewy. My friends ordered the filet mignon and the salmon special. Both said it was delicious. I wanted to order the lobster ravioli special, but they were already out (it's was only like 7:30, hence the 4 stars) I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi. It was very good. My friends had them being out a chocolate cake. It was pretty good as well. There was live music. He was playing some oldies, we danced a little before leaving. I don't know how this place isn't packed on a saturday. Go check it out!",,,
25,Dickie D.,"Burlington, WA",14,20,12,2.0,6/3/2016,"First visit this last week and hoped for the best. Mushroom soup excellant but a heart stopper with all the cream- like mushroom fondue. Ahi tuna appetizer perfect, Cubano sandwich good. Mushroom and sausage pan pizza quite possibly the worst pizza I have ever had. The canned mushrooms used released their water and the center 10"" of the pie were soggy. Not just a little soggy but my pic shows puddles of water. Wanted to send back but waiters call back was 10 minutes later. Chef Ricci, some nice fresh mushrooms, or even pan roasted would solve the soggy issue and add flavor. Anyways, it's close, lots of parking, just good enough, to maybe see me again.",1,,
26,Winnie L.,"North Caldwell, NJ",0,16,4,5.0,10/5/2017,Great find by chance! My friend and I had been in the park with our little ones and had been to a few places but none were terribly baby friendly. It was a beautiful day and so we decided to sit outside because we had two strollers. The server was very friendly and helpful. We had lunch specials which were delicious and affordable. Even let us swap out the soup/salad for fries so the young kid didn't have to order separately. They don't have a changing table but showed us to the private room so I could change my little one. Definitely recommended and will be back to try the rest of the menu. Five stars.,,,1
27,David D.,"Hoboken, NJ",29,6,2,4.0,5/4/2016,"I live right down the street, so it is nice to have a local place to grab a beer after work. Decent food. Standard tavern/pub fair. Chicken sandwich was very good. Nicolo's roll and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Be nice to expand the beer menu some. Fairly standard stuff. Add a couple additional craft beers. I'll definitely go back. Decent food. Good beer, close by. The trifecta!",1,,
28,BRang W.,"Green Township, NJ",0,24,1,1.0,4/25/2016,Won't be going back. Service was slow. Soda was flat. My beer was served with dried up wrinkled piece of orange rind. Burgers were plain and unseasoned. Couldn't get a bacon cheeseburger because they don't have bacon! Bread was idk...stale or heated hours before and served cold but crunchy on the outside. Macaroni and cheese was tasteless blob of mush. So disappointing,1,,
29,Julie S.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",0,9,3,5.0,2/25/2017,"Service was excellent, mushroom soup was delicious, crabcakes were ok, I didn't like horseradish sauce,  it overwhelmed the dish, house salad was huge and chock full of goodies like beets and celery. Tasted my husband's Chicken Savoy and it was flavorful although a bit overcooked.  Cannolis were fresh and delicious. Will be back again to try a burger.",,,
30,Annette D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",106,5,1,4.0,3/30/2017,This was our first visit to BTK...our server Anthony was very pleasant and informed us of the specials. We had the mushrooms soup and it was amazing!! We had a hamburger which was perfect and a steak sandwich that was good! Definitely will go back for dinner!!,,,
31,Deshi G.,"Bergenfield, NJ",19,5,0,1.0,7/28/2017,"Horrible food horrible service.  We ordered drinks and it was never brought to the table.  Once we were half way through our meal I went up to the server and said to forget about the drinks since it had still not been brought to the table.  The server had forgotten, but later came to the table and blamed it all on the bartender.  The server never even offered anything else, or bothered to come check on the food.  We will NOT be going back to this place.  Very disappointing",,,
32,Phon H.,"Bloomfield, NJ",47,71,3,2.0,5/14/2017,"This place could be so much more. It's sort of an elegant sports bar but trying to also be down with the community. Decor is top notch. Food is decent, some things really good; pizza needs work. They don't make their own French Fries which IMO is weak. Potatoes are the cheapest item and you can get a electric slicer so you can't use the labor excuse. Dining staff is very nice but not attentive enough in the dining room. I saw the bar brought my beer to the server area and watched it sit for 10 minutes. Needed water and had to ask the bus boy. The bus boy helped us on a few occasions. Kitchen closes too early on the weekend as well. One of the bartenders is a biznatch. Don't expect a good pour or a buy-back. They don't treat you like a local here. Their beer selection is pretty bleh considering all the amazing beers out there in this day and age. I want to give them a better review, I want them to succeed. They just need to up their game.",1,1,
33,Christine B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,6,0,4.0,5/14/2016,"Very excited to have a good local place to have a tasty lunch or dinner. Went for lunch on a Saturday. There was a decent crowd (all the outdoor tables were full as well as half the bar) but the service was still great. I ordered the calamari which I didn't find soggy at all despite some other reviews. I had the sauce on the side and thought it was delicious. My husband ordered the meatball to start and really liked it. He too enjoyed the sauce. I had the vegetable primavera which was a very generous portion that I couldn't finish. Lots of veggies and not to sound redundant but.. great sauce! My husband had the chicken savoy which he said was ""tasty, juicy and a lot of food for the price."" The service was great - food and drinks came out very quickly and our server Kat checked on us many times. We ordered cocktails which were well made but small. However at $5 and $7 I can't complain too much. Overall we were pleased. We will return to try more of the menu.",,,
34,Preeti K.,"Secaucus, NJ",4,6,0,5.0,11/22/2016,We just had our daughters first birthday at BTK and the food and service was absolutely amazing. Bill and his staff made sure we got everything we wanted and really took great care of us. We had a face painter come and they set up a space for us where she could work. The food was delicious. Everything was fresh and hot and seasoned well. We had over 70 people there - a lot were children and Bill came up with a great menu for the kids. Also the restaurant is very convenient due to the parking in the back and spacious - it did not feel cramped. I can only highly recommend BTK for anyone looking to host a party!,1,,
35,Wendy M.,"Millburn, NJ",31,18,5,1.0,5/27/2016,Wanted to give this place a try and was truly disappointed.  The burger was charred (they seriously don't let you add anything else to it like some bacon) and it had no flavor.  The ketchup didn't help it at this point! The pasta was ok.  The soda was flat.  The waitress never checked in on us.  Should have read the reviews.  SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!! Could have gotten a lot more with dessert and paid less somewhere else.  I don't see ourselves going back.  It's a shame cause we like to support our local establishments,4,1,1
36,Maija D.,"Centerport, NY",0,11,0,5.0,4/29/2016,"Great neighborhood place with delicious food and gentle prices. My cousin was in town and we just wanted something quick and local, and I remembered that Brookdale Tavern was supposed to open this month. We ambled in around 7:30 on a Wednesday to find a cozy and lively scene in both the dining room and bar: groups, singles, families, dates. The servers were quick, friendly, helpful and knew the menu well. Drinks were brought and refilled promptly. We both ordered burgers, which were incredibly flavorful and juicy, and so big that I wound up taking half of mine home. The burger came with a huge fat slice of tomato and a bun made of real, delicious bread vs the usual sad white sponge that most burgers are served on. AND we could order our burgers as rare as we wanted, because they grind their own meat onsite! The shoestring fries were OK but could have used another minute or two in the fryer. My cousin's sweet potato fries were impeccable and we devoured them all.That burger was the most delicious $10 I have spent in a very long time. And yet: every time a server walked by with an order for another table, whether tacos, a personal pizza, a big chunky steak sandwich, a pasta, a colorful and sparkling fresh salad, I wanted to see that on my plate too. Every single thing looked delicious and bountiful and I will just need to keep coming back to work my way through the menu.A note about the bad reviews. I notice there are numerous very poor reviews from early April, which is absurd. These ""discerning connoisseurs"" visited the restaurant literally on the first day/week that the doors opened, and then rushed to instantly trash the place on Yelp. C'mon, people. Brookdale Tavern had JUST opened its doors, there were bound to be some kinks to work out and cooks and servers to train, and every new place needs some time to find its rhythm. A month later, based on my recent experience, the place is running smoothly and is full of happy diners and delicious food. The night we were there both the owner and GM were onsite keeping a close eye on everything and soliciting feedback, which we gladly gave. I plan to come back very, very soon, and I encourage others to try this very welcome addition to the neighborhood.",3,,
37,Sherri H.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,383,147,4.0,4/1/2016,"BTK is a welcome addition to the neighborhood! I went once for a light lunch on a weekday when it was super empty but welcoming, then again for dinner on a Thursday night when it was packed but my hubby and I were able to snag one of the last tables in the bar area. Having moved to the area just last summer, we had only been to Yellow Plum once and have only heard of previous establishments seeming doomed in this location. Service at BTK is friendly, drink prices are quite reasonable, and the food is on point. A mix of Italian (pasta and meat dishes) and upscale bar food, I'd say. The buffalo calamari was very spicy and delicious, and the stuffed meatball app was so yummy with perfect marinara. Hopefully BTK has finally figured out the secret to success in this location and will stick around!",8,,1
38,Tom K.,"Bloomfield, NJ",1,12,16,4.0,4/18/2016,"I was surprised to see the mixed reviews but the place is still new, so some kinks may need work. My experience with my wife was great. Our server Alex was excellent and the food was delicious. We had the tuna app and shared a burger and steak sandwich, all recommended. I will be back and I'm happy to see prices that are very reasonable, unlike its predecessor who tried to charge NYC prices in a suburban town. Kudos!",3,,
39,Frank P.,"Rahway, NJ",4,38,12,2.0,8/3/2016,"Nothing to write home about so I'll make it quick...Atmosphere seemed bright and kind of bland. The dining room reminded me of a VFW. My wife and a friend had a house martini called a ""Pear Pressure""...they didn't finish them. Other basic drinks were Ok. The service was friendly and very good. The food - portions were large and the quality was OK at best. I had the ""Rack of Kobe Pork""...I've heard of Kobe Beef, but I never heard of Kobe Pork, so I'm a little skeptical if it was Kobe, especially for only $20. In short, An Ok neighbor place if you're local and want to run out and have a beer and a bit to eat. But I don't feel the need to hurry back.",1,,
40,Becca D.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",0,1,0,3.0,6/9/2017,"Besides the unfortunate acronym (BTK), the food and drinks were good. The service needs some work. We waited 25 minutes for drinks while the table next to us (who arrived after us) were served promptly. Once we received drinks and ordered our food, the service was better. Although, our waters were not refilled. They seemed stretched to service both the inside and outside tables.  There was a band that was a bit loud if you wanted to have a conversation but otherwise pretty good. With improvements to service, this is a really nice place.",,,

42,Matt N.,"Verona, NJ",0,10,1,1.0,5/20/2016,"Place was a little disappointing. Very sweet bartender but the menu was generic and atmosphere, mah. Had the Cuban sandwich and it was dry on a reverse  toasted bun. I appreciate creativity but that seemed unnecessary. Also came with about 4lbs of french fries to compensate do the boring sandwich. On a positive note the wings were really good and meaty. Guess I have to go back a try something different on the menu at a different time of day or night.",1,2,
43,Tracey N.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",9,9,0,1.0,4/2/2016,The service was horrible and the food was not good at all. The sauce tasted like it came out of a jar.

44,Ken P.,"Maplewood, NJ",12,19,5,4.0,5/14/2016,"Our first visit here. We started with fried calamari with balsamic vinegar and chili sauce. Surprisingly tasty although I was expecting crispier. She has the chicken tacos as a main course which were authentic rather than ""On the Border""-like. I had the chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe, mozzarella and roasted peppers. It should have been served with balsamic vinegar but our waitress, Nicole, accommodated my request with a smile. Over all a good eating experience and I look forward to coming back.",1,,
45,Matt T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,29,2,4.0,5/17/2016,"Went here a week or so ago on a weekday with my girlfriend.  She got some pasta which was very good, and I got the kobe pork, which was a fried breaded pork chop.  I am not a huge fan of pork chops, but this was delicious and not oily at all.  We were also given some olives, cheeses, and a cut up hamburger.  Not sure if they were free because of happy hour or what, regardless they were good.  The burger was better than I expected to be, very juicy and flavorful.  They had New Belgium Fat Tire on tap which makes me so happy.  Seeing anything from that brewery, which is a Colorado based craft brew and one of my all time favorites is just awesome.The inside doesn't look much different from how the Yellow Plum was setup, though BTK added 2 or 3 more TVs.  The bar tender was very friendly.  The prices seemed fair, a little cheaper would have been great, but I won't get too mad at that.  I'll definitely be back though.",1,,
46,Jane R.,"Belleville, NJ",32,10,0,1.0,7/5/2016,Not happy with this place at all. My chicken was undercooked and now I'm feeling sick. I felt bad saying anything to the server as she was very sweet. Overpriced and not worth it!,,1,
47,Tony R.,"North Arlington, NJ",0,9,0,2.0,7/5/2016,"Very disappointing!  I was looking forward to a new restaurant in bloomfield.  This is not what I had been looking for.  Menu is very plain.  Nothing on it made me want to eat it.  Ended up just ordering the basics.  Cheese burger - over cooked and dry, chicken wings - soggy and over sauced, seared tuna - ok but not worth ordering again, cuban sandwich - basic but not special, Hoegaarden draft beer - flat and not cold.  Service was good but it was 4:30 on a Tursday.  So to sum it up.......there are much better places to eat in the area.  I suggest you try something else",,1,

We had to ask what they offered for dessert cause they didn't ask or offer (table of 7). After they told us what they had and ordered, they came back to say they didn't have that anymore. After asking several times for water, we finally got a round BUT no refills at all the whole night. I'm parched. Not worth going to.",1,,
50,Nazlo N.,"Millburn, NJ",0,35,1,2.0,8/30/2016,"Over the years, I've eaten at three different restaurants in this same location. The quality seems to diminish with each new incarnation.Decor - dated; Food - so-so; service OK. Our friends wanted to eat outdoors, but unfortunately so did some hipster wannabes who wanted to grab a noisy smoke. In addition, the restaurant thinks all customers want to listen to loud canned music. We asked our waiter to turn off the music, but a few minutes later a manager[?] came out and turned the music back on. So much for pleasant meal on a Saturday evening... (Update: the Mgr reached out to me & said he would address some of the issues)",,,

53,Annmarie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",1,3,0,1.0,4/3/2016,"So bad. After waiting 50 minutes for our meal, it was terrible. Sauce tasted like they just poured it out of the can and put it on the dish. They also ran out of almost everything on the menu - including beer. Will not go back.",,,
54,Tony B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",3,2,0,1.0,4/2/2016,"Just tried calling to place a to go order.  Someone picked up, said they were busy, and hung up without saying anything else. For a new business with what looks like a decent menu, that is a huge disappointment.",,,
55,Sarah D.,"Orlando, FL",0,13,4,4.0,8/20/2016,We had lunch with our children and they were very welcoming. The food was really good. The service was a little slow. We got there just after noon and it took an hour and a half. It seemed like this was due to the waitstaff (not the kitchen) who took a lot of time to come over to the table and get our order. Other than the gaps in service the waitstaff were very accommodating.  The steak quesadilla was excellent. For $9.95 it came with half a salad or soup and a soda. I had the Italian Chop salad which was really good for being part of a special. My husband had the mushroom soup and loved it.  We'd go again for lunch.,2,,
56,Vivian M.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",0,3,0,2.0,6/6/2016,"I really wanted to love this restaurant. It's within walking distance to my home, has reasonable prices, a varied menu, and, most of all, excellent food. But the big problem - a real deal-breaker in my book - is the service, or lack thereof. Twice we sat at our tables watching as others were being waited on while our inexperienced servers were nowhere to be found. After taking our orders, they simply never came back to check on us. We had to ask the people busing the tables or servers for other tables for simple things like ketchup for our burgers and fries or drink refills. Getting the check wasn't easy, either! All this seemed to be happening while the manager stood by and did nothing. Way too stressful!",2,,
57,Mark H.,"Montclair, NJ",0,16,0,4.0,4/11/2016,Worth a visit.   Stopped in for a few drinks and some appetizers.    We ordered the meatball and the potato / long hot dish.    I thought both were pretty good.   I do recommend that they replace the long hots with something a bit milder (or seed/devein the peppers).   I enjoyed the dish but my wife was not up to the heat of the unseeded long hot.    Shishito peppers would be a nice replacement.     Drinks were reasonably priced and the wine and beer choices were good.  The place is very big and is a good bet to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday when smaller establishments are booked solid.   It's as good or better than other places in it's price / atmosphere range.   I'll be back,2,,
58,Kaitlyn R.,"City of Orange, NJ",0,31,6,5.0,9/4/2016,I enjoyed a nice meal outside for dinner. The chicken sandwich and burger were both great! Nice wine and beer list. Friendly servers. I will for sure return to Brookdale Tavern & Kitchen.,,,
59,Tara Q.,"Bloomfield, NJ",97,2,0,2.0,10/22/2016,"I want to see this place do well so badly! This is my 2nd time here, and I figured the first time was just a fluke. I live right down the street and I have heard good things. Service was beyond horrible both times I was here (although our waiter was extremely friendly). We ordered several meals and appetizers, and food had zero flavor and the presentation was awful. No condiments were served with our meals, and we were not told about half of the beers they offered (I had to find out myself through untapped). The wait staff was running around the whole time as if the place was on fire, making for unpleasant dinning experience. I wondered the whole time what was going on, since it wasn't packed on a Friday night. It was almost comical, but certainty ruined the meal. My husband and I both finished our drinks long before dinner came out and were never offered a 2nd.I would love to see this place stay around. They need to expand their beer menu with some craft beers and up their service. I would be hesitant go to back, but hope to see the place do well. I would like to receive a response on this as I am a local who truly wants this place to do well.",,,
60,Karen R.,"Roseland, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,4/14/2016,We have been here twice already to eat dinner with friends. What a great find!!  The food was ample and delicious and the wine was reasonable and also very good. I had the pork and it was to die for!!! Also you must order the mushroom soup - sooo good.  Be sure to stop by when you are looking for a really good place to eat and enjoy!!  You won't be disappointed!!',1,,
61,Chris C.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,0,4.0,7/16/2016,"Recently opened, my family and I have eaten here several times, the food has been good and the service even better. Excellent beer selection, I have fallen for Fat Tire....I recommend the burgers or tacos..",,,
62,Betty S.,"Montclair, NJ",127,7,3,5.0,8/21/2016,I absolutely love Brookdale Tavern. We happened to  stumble upon it a few months ago and we left very Pleasantly surprised. I read that the burger was great so I tried it and it did not disappoint !  My husband had the chicken parm and loved it. I also like the extensive children's menu.  Since then we have been back may times. The meatball was also recommended so we had to try that and wow!! Delish. The mushroom soup is fantastic. The calamari is always fresh. The only thing I was slightly disappointed by were the mussels. I won't order them again.  I am slowly working my way down the menu but sometimes they add a special (ribeye or ribs) that i have to try.  Generous portions too.,,,
63,Garrett M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,1,0,5.0,4/20/2016,"First time in this new restaurant. It was exactly what my wife and I were looking for. A relaxed and casual atmosphere with an interesting menu at a reasonable price. The staff was professional and courteous. My wife ordered the crab cake appetizer with a side of fries and I had the penne in pepper sauce with chicken and shrimp. Both were excellent. This will be our place to go when we don't feel like cooking, don't want a diner, but don't want fancy.",1,,
64,Jeff W.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,20,5,4.0,7/13/2016,"Went there on a Tuesday night. Wanted to sit outside, but it was full, so decided to eat inside (which was empty). We split 3 appetizers/sides between two of us and it was just the right amount of food. We had the buffalo wings with medium sauce (very tasty and meaty), the giant meatball stuffed with ricotta (again, very tasty and great sauce on it), and finally the macaroni and cheese which everyone raves about (didn't disappoint either). Everyone else in our party were also very happy with their meals. Good service and decent prices as well.",,,
65,Katie F.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,10,0,5.0,5/2/2016,Great place for the neighborhood... Far better than anything else that was in that building before. Have gone about 5 times and will be going again soon.,,,
66,Damien C.,"Montclair, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,4/9/2016,Menu lacks options. Food came out wrong. Food was below avg at best. Unsweetened ice tea came out of the gun.,,,
