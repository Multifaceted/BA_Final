1,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1113,19764,4.0,4/29/2016,The private collection of books in the library is amazing. I can't explain the historic significance of the works compiled by Mr. Morgan. The value in dollars is beyond belief. Anyone that loves the feel of a book in their hands will appreciate visiting the library. You can't touch but at least you would be able to envy the collection. Mr. Morgan definitely had good taste in authors. The comfort of having a library in your home would give any book lover a reason to be jealous. Floor to ceiling books. Beautiful wooden historic bookshelves. When you visit the museum you must see the library. Sorry no photos allowed in the library.,25,14,21
