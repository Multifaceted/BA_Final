0,Tracy H.,"New York, NY",663,12,7,5.0,6/25/2018,"Sat down with: cold brew with almond milk. Came at 4pm on a Monday and there was a lot of space available. Good space to do work or chat with friends, with free WiFi & restroom. The staff was friendly and the music was enjoyable.Lighting was a bit dark if you are looking to do work.",,,
1,Wendy S.,"Philadelphia, PA",349,74,70,4.0,8/13/2018,"Came on a Sunday afternoon and there was plenty of space. Good coffee, good avocado toast. It was a bit pricey but within expectation of coffee shop prices. It's a bit dark outside and I personally prefer coffee shop with a lot of natural lighting. That being said, I got a lot of work done in the 4 hours I was there and was not distracted at all.",1,,1
2,Sonya W.,"Manhattan, NY",146,59,71,5.0,10/30/2018,"I ordered a chai latte and a butter scone and it tastes really good, especially the chai latte. I've been trying out chai lattes here and there and what I like about this one is that even though it is foamy, it is very aromatic and I can still taste it through the foam which is interesting. In most places, the foam would have the least flavor, or no flavor in most cases. It tastes really good and even the employees are amazing! Watching them work and compensate for any mistakes they've done is very fulfilling because it just means that they really care about customer satisfaction. Just know that this place will be one of the friendliest places (probably) and also a nice place to do work in.",1,,2
3,Anna L.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",2305,212,646,3.0,10/4/2017,"This is a nice interior coffee shop! I felt the customer service was a 3 because the server seemed really hasty to take order and not really communicate with the customer.She asked me what I would like twice when I was trying to decide and when she made my drink, there was no latte art. Beside that it's nice there is WiFi and bathroom. There is some space/seating to do work and meet with friend.My matcha hot latte was 5.40$ ish and that's pretty $$ but it did give me a lot of energy.It is near battery park and Nyack college so convenient. The mood is definitely rustic and it's above UPS store so it's easy to miss it! Their ice chai tea is great but also 4.90$ for such a small cup. #NYC haha I would come back for their pastries, and to work there.",1,,
4,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",92,155,93,4.0,7/20/2017,Their brew is on the strong side. I find their selection of various organic skim/soy/half and half amusing but this is Manhattan after all so that's expected. A small coffee is $2.50. Pastries are around $3-4. Plenty of cute tables and seating inside. A bit dim but I like the rustic feel for when Starbucks gets to feel too corporate. The location is easily overlooked but seems like the place always has a decent crowd. Not too loud either:)I highly recommend coffee with a generous serving of the soy milk:) Yum.,,,2
5,Keemy U.,"Manhattan, NY",122,103,197,4.0,3/20/2018,I've been working next door to this place for over a year and today is the first time I've ever been in. This place is just like Starbucks but with fewer drink options and varieties. It's expensive like Starbucks too. There are seats which is great. The workers were quick. They do have more pastries than Starbucks. Overall it's nice that it's pretty close.,2,2,3
6,Katelyn B.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",2,58,14,5.0,5/16/2018,"Super cute place! I stopped here to get a quick bite after missing my subway stop, and it was the perfect place to get a pastry + coffee. My only gripe is that it is definitely overpriced, but I find that this is true for most coffee shops here. Anyway, the interior is very chill and relaxing, and the service is good. I ordered the chia seed pudding and honey latte, both of which were good!",,,2
7,Jasmine L.,"New York, NY",41,84,252,3.0,3/8/2017,"FREE WIFI!Around $5 for a medium iced honey latte, which was fine in my books (considering how it's NYC and everything). But, the coffee itself wasn't anything special. For a coffee shop that boasts about its organic nature and all that fanciness, I honestly did notice anything more robust or different about their coffee. Interior-wise, the industrial-like interior felt quite cold and uninviting. But on the plus side, I stayed for around 3 hours just to do some work and wasn't kicked out or anything. So that was nice!",1,,1

Updated review","I continue to love Bean & Bean, so I'm updating this to 5 stars! I stay in the 71 Broadway building when I'm in town for work, and it's so great to have a coffee shop in the building. I've tried a variety of their coffee beverages at this point, and all are solid to great. I had the honey latte for the first time recently and it was a pleasant change. The little cups of  cold oatmeal (with milk) and berries they have is amazing. And the employees are wonderful. If you haven't BEAN here, stop on by! ;)",,3,
9,Bony M.,"New York, NY",178,57,55,3.0,8/14/2017,"Contrary to what other yelpers said I found the espresso to be not on the strong side. Ordered a Soy Cappuccino here and expected it to be have a strong coffee flavor like other shops in the area...i was a bit disappointed. To be honest, i'm not sure if it was something to do with the ground they used, but i really wanted to like this place as it's got a lot of other pro's (Plenty of seating, great baristas, free wifi, moody lighting) maybe I will come by another day and see how it is. But so far not so happy with the coffee. If you guys like all the other menu items this place offers, feel free to check it out.. better luck next time for me!(CUPS friendly coffee shop btw)",,,
10,Egemen Ö.,"Burlingame, CA",7,10,1,5.0,2/25/2018,"Downstairs from my apartment so probably the most convenient for me. Good prices for food and coffee. Limited food selection, only bagels and some pastries. In the weekday morning it can get very crowded, resulting in long ish (10 min) wait times and sometimes people forgetting your order. But that happens rare enough that I won't deduct a point. Pet friendly, good seating, good outlets, friendly crowd.",,,

12,Janet M.,"Uniondale, NY",0,8,6,1.0,7/20/2018,I work in the building next door so I frequently go in for a Chai latte iced with Oat milk & I always say light ice because for $7 bucks I'm paying for the Latte not ice & I stress this all the time & I still get a cup full of ice.

13,Lily C.,"Manhattan, NY",165,83,222,4.0,5/25/2017,"I was around the area when it started to rain so I wanted to find a nearby cafe to sit down. This cafe was relatively easy to find near the Trinity church and Wall Street 4/5 train exit. There are about 10 small sitting tables and 2 standing ones. Surprisingly, we were able to get seats right away even though it was raining. The music was old school RnB and the decor is modern. The staff was very friendly. I ordered iced latte with low fat marble cake, both of which was decently made.",1,,
14,Dawn P.,"Bronx, NY",19,32,2,4.0,4/24/2018,"Great service, I will definitely return. I went in this morning and I impressed by how the quickly takes order and served each item hot and tasty. A place is a bit packed, but the service is quick. Will highly recommend.",2,,
15,Billy Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",255,107,39,4.0,5/30/2017,"Fast service, no frills coffee shop. It's somewhat dimly lit, but plenty of seating available, whether you're staying for hours or just a bit.I thought my latte was going to have a design in the froth, but sadly did not. The person ahead of me had a different server who did do it though.Otherwise, my matcha latte was well made and not overly sweet.Price is expensive, but it's the city so you'd better expect that.Standard coffee shop overall. Clean with upbeat music. Bathroom was clean, but they could use a baby changing station for those rare instances it would be useful.",,,
16,Liyi T.,"New York, NY",72,90,58,5.0,6/13/2018,"They have good matcha lattes. It's my new favorite place to study after work. I love sitting at the high table in front of the bar. Dim lighting, chill atmosphere, friendly staff.",,,

18,Ai J.,"Port Washington, NY",76,34,204,5.0,12/3/2017,Great coffee and services. The manager here is really nice that she provided a complimentary replacement after I had accidentally spilt my coffee.,,,
19,Ibrahim S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,35,2,5.0,4/17/2018,Away from the hustle and bustle of Starbucks when you need some peace and quiet. Better (more flavorful) coffee too. Comfortable and open atmosphere. Extremely friendly service. Clean and available bathroom.,1,,
20,Nick P.,"Dayville, CT",6,17,2,5.0,8/28/2016,Incredibly perfect coffee. I can't drink dairy and the mocha inhad was complimented by the almond taste. I almost ordered a second cup but my partner stopped me. The atmosphere is really chill and this is a great place to recharge your batteries after walking around nyc all day.,,1,
21,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,3.0,12/21/2015,"3.5 starsI discovered this place via the cups app and figured it was worth a try since it's near my work office. Small little coffee shop, but great service. If you have any questions, the baristas are glad to explain the different coffees and how they are made to you. Pricey ($6-$8 for a large), but if you use the cups app, you can get a large latte for less than $3!",1,1,1
22,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,4.0,10/6/2015,"If you are all about the organic foods and environmental sustainability, this is the place for you. Sort of out of place in the financial district, I'd think, but a nice addition nonetheless.My friend and I shared two muffins: the chocolate chip and the non-fat 3 berry, I got a regular coffee, and he got a small iced coffee. All of this rang up to $12 and change, which wasn't bad. The chocolate chip muffin was a bit dry, and the berry muffin was a tad bit too tangy for me. Otherwise, they brew a mean cup of joe! Tbh, the muffins all sounded way too healthy for me. When I go for a muffin, I go for the one that is chock full of chocolate chips and glistening with a slight sheen of oil (who knows what kind). So, as I was going through the different choices in the display case, I remember being super excited about one muffin that I though was non-fat free...well it actually read non-fat THree...berry..but I got it anyway. The seating area was quite spacious. We were able to get a whole long table to ourselves, which was great because my friend had a carry-on bag that would have gotten in everyone's way if we had to share a table with others.I work just a little ways down the street, so I will definitely be back if I'm in need of a mid-workday pick-me-up!",2,1,2
23,Rumit P.,"Washington, DC",523,754,4131,4.0,10/17/2016,Good-quality beverages and fast but smile-less service. Does it hurt to smile?Very limited baked goods selection and extremely bare-bones industrial feel to the interior. No art. No warmth. Connected to an office building and has entrances from the street and from the lobby.,2,,
24,Tonni B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9,29,7,4.0,8/25/2017,Great atmosphere. Good green iced tea. The pastry could be a little better and fresher as the pie thing was a little stale.,,,
25,Cee L.,"Boston, MA",145,57,41,5.0,8/26/2016,"I LOVE Bean & Bean. I walked by it every day for 5 months, and finally ventured in once I realized they served matcha lattes. It's in a discreet little building right by the 4/5 Wall St station, and there's usually a sign outside for cold brew. The baristas are incredibly friendly, and so efficient. Even during rush hour, I can place my order and be out of the door within 5 minutes. For those who like to stay and hang out, there are a few tables and I've seen people taking advantage of the wifi and working there. The menu is pretty extensive, but admittedly, I don't drink much coffee. I'm more of a macchiato / latte / tea kind of girl. I do have to say that this may be the best matcha latte I've found in NYC so far. The flavor is always consistent, and they have perfected the matcha powder - milk - simple syrup ratio. I might be slightly addicted so it's my go to drink whenever I'm at Bean & Bean. I've also tried the honey latte, which is pretty darn good. They have almond and soy milk options, which is perfect since I'm lactose intolerant.Bean & Bean participates in CUPS, so I'd highly recommend downloading the CUPS app if you consistently drink coffee.",2,1,1
26,Shane W.,"Kansas City, MO",160,316,54,4.0,7/20/2016,"Man, I remember when the financial district had nothing. It was basically open for 12 hours from 6:30am to 6:30pm. What a great change to see it come alive. Now, just like the rest of Manhattan, it has coffee shops that aren't Starbucks or Irish bars. Bean & Bean is a big place with lots of two-person tables and a couple long family-style tables too. Coffee was decent, bagel was ok.",2,1,4
27,Giselle S.,"Williamsburg, NY",216,18,2,4.0,7/10/2017,Good food and super strong coffee. A bit pricey but worth it if you come for wifi and sitting down.,,,
28,Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",558,257,3437,4.0,6/16/2015,"Bean and Bean has become my afternoon pick me up coffee spot. Small cozy little coffee spot in FIDI with great customer service. The staff are always super sweet when I come in. My new addiction is there ice coffee with vanilla syrup and soy milk. Yummy! With so many coffee spots in FIDI, this place is one of my favorites along side Starbucks of course. On the plus side there coffee is organic. I feel there prices are cheap which is great!!! When you drink as much coffee as I do and being able to paying under $4 for a large ice coffee makes me a very happy camper. The only con to this place is the lighting it's really dull would be nice if it was brighter inside. All in all I will continue to return here and enjoy there yummy coffee and great customer service.",2,1,2

31,Mehmet M. A.,"Edmonton, Canada",13,20,23,4.0,3/20/2017,"This place is like a hidden treasure in financial district. The entrance and the outer look doesn't attract people but inside is amazing. I tried hot matcha latte, it was better than I had before in other coffee shops. It was thick and creamy, just like the way I love it. The place has plenty of space and very clean bathroom too. I spent hours early in the morning and it was worth it. They have unique tastes that I want to try next time I go there. The staff was very nice, but when they give you your coffee they don't put the lid which is both good and bad depends on the people. I didn't care much but was afraid to spill when I try to put the lid on since the cup was brimful.",1,,
32,Lauren S.,"Burbank, CA",0,57,17,5.0,3/10/2017,Cute little coffee shop. Looks kind of like a Starbucks but perhaps a bit more pleasant and cozy!The honey latte was delicious! Service was decently fast.,1,,

38,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",187,359,460,4.0,11/22/2015,"I stopped in for a couple hours to get some work done. There is not much seating, but it seems to be the work crowd that weaves in and out so seats open up quickly. The honey latte on the menu caught my eye as I've never seen it in other coffee shops. I used my CUPS app to order a large honey latte. I waited awhile and noticed that my drink still wasn't ready, so I went up to the barista. Apparently, he said someone else took my drink so he made another for me. The drink was nicely sweetened. Other than the mixup over my drink, I enjoyed the drink and was able to get work done in a fairly quiet setting.",1,1,2

Just finished it and I'm left wishing I ordered a larger size :) This is kind of of coffee that would go well with dark chocolate.The decor is rustic old style kind of feel, but the cleanliness is so-so. There was a fly entertaining itself near the cream/sugar/napkin area, not very appealing. 4 stars for the great coffee, but I'd give it 3 stars for the lack of cleanliness.",2,,

First off, the atmosphere here is welcoming. You walk in and its like you've escaped the hectic city life. The baristas are friendly and knowledgeable about the coffee they're making.The espresso drinks are made to perfection every time and the brewed coffee is always hot and delicious. All in all this place is a great spot to get an awesome cup of coffee and chill out for a while.",2,1,1

However, I stopped coming due to the poor quality of service. After a few months, I decided to try Bean & Bean again and I was pleasantly surprised. There were three baristas that all seemed very engaged in their coffee, like they care about the quality of the drinks, and they were all very friendly. The one person who really stood out to me was a young bearded fellow. He seems to really take his job to heart as he was overseeing that everything was up to par, and that every customer was happy. I stayed a while and enjoyed a cappuccino (which was made perfectly) and plan to start coming to Bean & Bean again.",2,,1
69,Alice L.,"New York, NY",668,80,93,4.0,9/8/2014,"As a coffee addict & former barista, I give this place four stars. This location is somewhat hidden so the lines are never too long and move very quickly. Baristas are efficient and friendly. I usually get either an iced tea or espresso over ice. The green iced is strong, which I like. They have fruity flavors such as mango, strawberry and lemon you can add as well. Yummmm! The espresso here is much stronger than Starbucks. I would say one shot here is comparable for two shots at Starbucks. The quality of the espresso also better. They also have amaretto syrup which is my fave. Definitely a plus!Overall, this place is very reliable and consistent, which is exactly what you need in a coffee shop.",1,,2

My only complaint is the sloppiness of the help and the way the shop looksNo reason to look gross inside just seems counter culture to serve organic coffee and ran by slobs it kind of just makes you wonder if it's really is organic.,,1,
72,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,3.0,1/6/2010,"This cafe boasts its organic origins, and it makes a big point to mention its organic nature throughout the store. Some great things I noticed: 1) It was well heated!2) The door is a revolving door, meaning that the cafe does not get chilly with each new customer.3) Quick service.4) Variation of seating choices (e.g., wooden chairs plus more comfy chairs).I got a large tea for $2.35. I kind of wish they had had more decaffeinated choices.I read here for an hour. The music here was all over the place: r&b, pop, folky... Maybe I just noticed because I was reading, but it was almost as if two people were fighting over the radio. It was a little odd.",2,,

The small is about $2.50, but the large is nearly $6, so it's not cheap but the small is definitely worth it. Iced coffee has a very authentic roasted coffee taste; none of that burnt bean Starbucks commodity drinks. Also, fast and friendly service even during peak, bustling hours. I like to consider myself an ""efficient"" aka curt customer, and the attendants are still very patient and kind. Good for them; definitely 5 stars.",2,,

I got a small latte for no more than $4, good quality coffee with really smooth froth (and all their stuff is organic!)... compare that to Starbucks' burnt coffee and bubbly milk... I'd come here regularly if I worked out here. Their cold oatmeal is really filling and delicious as well. Haven't tried their pastries yet...Atmosphere-wise, I came here after the rush crowd in the morning so it was pretty quiet during the day. A great spot to study and just relax. I do wish they had more bathrooms but let's be honest... it's not easy to come across many eateries or cafes in the city that offer a bathroom to begin with. Overall, great coffee for decent prices. :)",5,,2
77,Scott S.,"Short Hills, NJ",4732,707,1335,3.0,4/8/2013,Convenient location right near 4/5 subway stop when I am downtown in FIDI.  Nice alternative to Starbucks burnt coffee (Yes I drink Starbucks but I can bitch about it).  Good strong dark roasts.  I do agree with Rebecca A.  who did not like the bathroom.  Really a one holer in a coffee joint.  A frequent purchase card would get it to 4 stars.,4,3,3
78,Jessica K.,"Manhattan, NY",163,13,7,4.0,12/16/2013,"Free wifi, moderate seating and outlets, baked goods, organic coffee roasted in-house, very friendly staff, slightly expensive for even organic coffee, but it probably contributes to friendly staff and them staying independent--decor similar to Starbucks, but much better in every way. I'm pretty sure their coffee is fair trade, but it seems they care more about their drinks being organic as that's clearly posted everywhere. I had the honey latte since I'd never heard of that before. I asked about it and was told honey granules are mixed into a latte. It doesn't taste like honey so I'm guessing they offer it simply as a healthier sweetener to lattes. Came here around noon and there was plenty of seating for me to study and do work as a college student in finals season. Not sure what its like at other times during the day/weekends.Glad I found this through a Yelp search and will be returning whenever I need a cafe at which to do work.",1,,
79,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1269,914,4.0,2/1/2011,"Heading downtown for a birthday dinner, I saw Bean and Bean and decided to continue my quest for a tasty Chai Latte.  The signs outside the store make huge claims as to their oganic nature, which is a nice touch, but I was mostly attracted by the comfortable looking wood interior and the promise of trying some place new.Inside is a small seating area, and a contraption to allow you to pour coffee beans of various flavors for purchase.  I was greeted by a very pleasant young woman who took my order quickly.  The latte was made nice and fast and I was out the door in no time.I have to confess that right now, The Nutbox has my favorite Chai Tea Latte, but Bean and Bean came very very close to matching them.  Out of many coffee shops in the city, they did a great job of creating a latte with creaminess and sweetness that doesn't overwhelm the spicy flavor of the actual tea.High marks to Bean and Bean.  Next time I look forward to sampling their coffee!",4,2,8
80,Araceli S.,"Larkspur, CA",1,23,8,3.0,5/21/2015,"The coffee was Amazing. It's my first time in New York and someone recommended this place to my boyfriend and I. I love that it's organic. The only thing that ruined my visit was Vanessa, the was the one at the register taking orders. We asked her how the honey latte was and she rudely answered "" it's alright"". When she saw I wasn't ready to order she asked the person behind me for their order.  When I went back to actually order she was very short. Just took my order and didn't say anything when I have her the money. She gave me back my change I said thank you and got no response. The other two people working had a completely different attitude and looked more approachable. It's unfortunate they have people with such negative attitude working at such an amazing location. I am definitely a fan of the chai tea latte that I ordered. I love that it's organic.",1,,

Oh and the oatmeal here is great. Very filling and healthy. I try to make the same at home but it's never as great as the ones I get here. Also, I really like how they renovated the place.

The coffee is pretty good (so I hear, I'm not a real coffee drinker so I'm a terrible judge) but what really draws me are their mochas. I LOVE mochas - I try to have about one a week in whatever form is suitable for the season - iced or frappe in the summer, steamy hot in the winter. The ones at Bean and Bean are the best I've had in the neighborhood - a decadent balance of sweet and bitter and the perfect morning or afternoon pick-me-up.

96,Spicy P.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",16,119,91,3.0,11/29/2015,"Excellent coffee - strong, dark and deep flavors. Roasting beans in-house goes a long way for wonderful tastes and smell. The coffee is priced very well, but some other items are a bit steep. A pretty straight forward menu with a good mix of specialty products such as the gelati, macarons, and vegan cookies. A seriously busy people-watching, macbook-loving, and cafe-socializing crowd - this place is almost always packed but oddly enough - a seat isn't impossible. The service is average and they could really work on adding just a bit of something as far as personality. Not all employees are knowledgeable about its products and menu, sometimes even outright puzzled at questions and lacking familiarity overall. But all-in-all, never bad service or a bad experience, just a bit slow and subdued at times. Everything is pretty consistent with the original location in downtown Manhattan as far as their product and culture. Just way (way!) more Asian-Americans at this Bayside outpost.

Bah to all the reviews complaining about watered-down coffee.  I think what they mean is that the coffee isn't bitter and overwhelming.  So yes, if you drink your coffee with half a pint of milk and bags of sugar, it might not taste as strong as other coffees.  But I drink my coffee black, and this stuff is excellent.",2,,1

Still, I decided to give it a try. I saw that their small iced chai lattes are $3.50, which got me excited because most places charge between $4 and $4.50. Ugh. I knew $3.50 was too good to be true for an iced chai latte. The cup was the smallest ""small"" I've ever gotten. No wonder it's cheap.I also got a pumpkin cranberry loaf, which was decent but I feel like I could probably get that at Starbucks. I think Bean & Bean tries really hard to be like Starbucks. If it didn't say ""Bean & Bean"" all over the store and the workers were wearing a green apron, I definitely would've thought that I walked into a Starbucks.

Why ? -cause THIS is the setup they USED to closely resemble...but actually BETTER! I was waiting for somebody to get off work around 5 and after leaving Trinity church & its somberness needed something cozy with some feeling of soul if even a tiny bit in an area that's known for the least amount of soul in the entire city almost. Well, i found it, cozy fall into love seats & wood glazed tables line the walls with regular seating chairs & tables in the middle. Theirs not much to say actually...its got all the regular cooperate coffee shop fare you'd expect BUT i found and of all the places to be, pleasantly surprisingly actually very fair prices! the girl Batista unfortunately wasn't taking much interest n my compliments to the place, she probably makes min wage or had a long day but still it'd be nice to take some pride in your job identity, the dude however in the back seemed fine, but that's me just being pissy. they both did their jobs fine. I just wanted some convo i guess. Anyways i really loved this place at least during its off hours & especially for its Lil nook it literally cut itself out in a cramped corporate space...you'll see what i mean when u see it first hand",1,,3
