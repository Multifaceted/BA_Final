0,Notorious P.A.P.I _.,"East Bronx, NY",1,48,16,4.0,10/13/2018,I had dinner with a few friends and my girl friend. It was a better experience that I thought it would be.Pros: The empanadas were great. I would go there back just for that. That plus I would advise anyone to do the same. I have a Hispanic background and I felt I was back home being they were that good. Also the price was very much so reasonable. The drink plus food were almost nothing. You cant beat the price. Cons: The drinks were strong. Now that something I dont mind but unfortunately I was with some females that thought they were way to strong and I can understand that coming from a female. Some drinks should be taken under consideration. That plus it get a little jammed packed and again that doesn't bother me but sometimes you don't want that many people around and want some quiet  time. So if you looking for that you might not get that here.But overall I had a great time and would recommend this place to anyone. It may not be high end or super fancy place but after work it's an ok place to grab some drinks with some co workers after work.,,,
1,Dimitrios D.,"Queens, NY",71,372,407,4.0,4/22/2018,"Subway Inn is a bar serving food.  It's not a fancy bar, it's just a bar.  But they serve surprisingly good chicken wings, which is to me the draw here. During a random lunch hour, the bartender was efficient, as was the kitchen.And, their boneless chicken wings are, as hinted at earlier, actually pretty great.  The meat wasn't gristly (other than one small bite- I'm just picky) and their BBQ sauce was tasty.  The waffle fries were also a joy to behold.Definitely recommended for some beer and wings.",,1,
2,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4581,2941,8893,5.0,12/15/2017,"Ah, the Subway Inn. A classic dive that, much like many of us, was forced to move because the landlord raised the rent. They've reopened here (just down the avenue from the original location) and essentially recreated the exact same bar, a bar that is good for:1. Strong drinks, late on a weeknight.2. Showing up in anything from a tank top to a three piece suit.3. Decent wings,* and fish sticks if you're feeling nostalgic.4. Dropping wings onto your three piece suit.**5. Sending video messages to shame friends into coming out.***6. Chasing the other patrons out with your jukebox trolling. A lot of Jewel, Baha Men, and repeated playing of Mariah Carey's Christmas classic should do it. If for some reason you are one of those people who likes other people, you should probably head over on the weekend, and play good music on the jukebox. That's not really our style, though._____________*You can get the order of 50, but you only need the order of 20. I know you can eat 50, but you only need the order of 20. **I deserved this, just for wearing a suit. ***To the bar, not out of the closet.",16,15,8
3,Martina D.,"Manhattan, NY",519,223,422,2.0,2/2/2018,"Someone suggested to meet here and I knew nothing about the place. I looked up the location on google maps, and that was about it. I was meeting the person for the first time and let him pick a place in his neighborhood, so even if I had done research I wouldn't have been rude enough to then say I wanted to go somewhere else. Turns out he's not a drinker and doesn't frequent bars that often.It's a weird mix between a dive bar and a dingy diner. It has the bar on one side, but then instead of tables against the opposite wall, it has booths. Not a complaint, just an observation. I definitely wouldn't take someone here as a place to meet up the first time. I only got one glass of wine, which was $6 and that was it. There are way nicer places where perhaps a glass costs an extra $2. The bartender was nice, so I guess that's the 2 stars as opposed to just 1. But I won't be going here again.",10,4,6
4,Gregg P.,"Austin, TX",107,21,0,3.0,10/7/2018,"Decent drinks and prices, but beware on the chow front. So, I know from hot wings. And if there's one thing I hate it's bullshit wing joints that think of hot wings as some sort of endurance test, rather than a specific cuisine. And on that count, the wings at this place are a friggin' crime. Aggressively, overly hot with no flavor. Gross. Pretty sure the bartender told the cook to try to kill me with heat for fun after I dropped my order from""OMG Hot"" to just ""Flaming Hot"" because he couldn't tell me how they amped up the heat (hint: if you just add capsaicin, you have no friggin' clue).So a) screw you, I win, I ate em all and b) shame on you.",,1,

6,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,4.0,4/16/2018,"The OTHER Subway Inn...lol. While the original Subway Inn which was on 59th and Lexington will always be a staple of the bar spot that me and former co-workers used to attend in the area before it shut down a few years ago, this Subway Inn is more accommodating as far as room and serving food...good food at that. I almost enjoy their mozzarella sticks and onion rings more than the drinks. Always appreciate the service here as the bartenders/waiters are cool and welcoming and don't hold back with good portions of the servings of food and drinks. This has become a hang out spot with some of my former co-workers even though it isn't as lively as the previous Subway Inn used to be, but it doesn't really need to be. The fact it serves food and I can usually get a seat quick is good enough for me lol.",,1,
7,Cecelia S.,"Dyker Heights, NY",35,12,26,5.0,4/14/2018,Steve the bartender is the best and usually there Mondays and some Saturdays. He's Super friendly and has a great music selection. His drinks are delicious and come with a smile.  The food is on point. I love all of the specials. There's always something new to choose from. Definitely great for casual drinks or group parties.,,,2
8,Paul D.,"Astoria, NY",1,26,0,3.0,7/8/2018,Not a big fan prices are above par. The bartender Johnny is super fun that's the only good aspect of this dive bar. Not particularly clean and food is super fried. Worth a visit.,1,,
9,Eric L.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,18,0,3.0,2/27/2018,This was my first time visiting the new location. Just a normal bar. Median age of patrons is prob 30  at least half are regulars. I got the garlic parm wings and the sauce was great- the actual wings were kind of small. One thing that blew my mind is they had 100 wings for $100 on the menu. That's supposed to be a deal? If someone comes in willing to spend $100 on chicken wings they should be getting more than that.I heard Black Hole Sun twice while sitting here for an hour. Yuck.,1,1,
10,Giovanni D.,"New York, NY",0,8,2,3.0,1/14/2018,"This review will only cover the nachos offered by this bar. The size is average, neither big nor too small. The Guacamole is industrial made, no taste really. The Cheese is cheap, industrial made.The Chips are very thin, also there is definitely a lack of chips in the portion. The ingredients completely covered the chips and when I asked for more chips, the barman almost laughed at me. Too much chili, not enough tomatoes with onion. Price: $12, average price for a good portion of good nachos..not the case, however.I would grade the nachos: 2/5 (mediocre).",2,,
11,Robert M.,"Cornelius, NC",0,21,0,4.0,7/29/2018,It's not the old Subway Inn..but it's good. Good prices for beers. The bartender was good. Took my family that was visiting NYC for the first time. So I wanted to take them to a good bar!!,,,

I did see that they proudly display an A rating from the department of health, so i figure what da hell. Let me  check it out.I order a cheese burger with fries and extra pickles. Washed down my dinner with 2 blue moons.Fast and courteous service. Pretty descent burger and no frills.",1,1,1
15,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,3.0,7/19/2016,If you're looking for a dive bar and a lonesome experience this is the place for you. It's actually relatively clean in comparison to their neighbor down the street. Probably because no one is here on this Saturday night I chose to finally go inside. They do have a decent selection of beers. Not a bad spot if you want some privacy or alone time. Probably great if you don't want anyone to know you're saucin it up.,1,2,1

19,Maribel D.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,14,12,5.0,9/25/2017,"Loved this place - last night was a lot of fun. Easygoing and friendly bartender, great pints of Guinness, football games on the TVs if you wanted to check the scores and cool music playing on the speakers. Plus, we sat next to a nice guy named Marvin at the bar and had a friendly chat.  Just aces all around. This will be my go-to spot when I'm back up in the neighborhood! Cheers.",,,1
20,James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2729,1914,8247,2.0,12/20/2015,"This is definitely a dive bar. I live around here and never stepped in here because the outside looked a little tattered. Inside, it's interesting. The crowd was not necessarily refined, but it's a dive bar right? There is a bar on the left when you walk in, booths on the right, and a slightly open area in the back. Lots of neon signs, flat screen TVs, and other lighting make this an unattractively bright place to spend a late night. Honestly, no one wants to see faces clearly at 1am. You only want an outline because no one is at their best at this time. It's not for me, but if what I described sounds like a fun place to go to, you should check it out...",5,4,5

22,Candice C.,"Manhattan, NY",11,7,3,5.0,12/29/2015,"Subway Inn is my favorite local,  midtown east bar. The drinks are poured heavy and all the staff are cool.  As for food, they have the best Jerk Chicken in the city. NOT FRIED, SMOKED AND BAKED...MEAT FALLING OFF THE BONE GOODNESS. There are also plenty other options like the mac and cheese, oh and the catfish strips are impressive. It's a dive bar where all games are played, the drinks are cold and the food is hot. Go for lunch or right after work if you don't like big crouds...it gets busy after 8pm",2,1,3
23,Twyla Y.,"Calgary, Canada",121,267,508,4.0,11/10/2015,"Stopped in for a beer after riding the Roosevelt Island Tram. (which was awesome, by the way!)Best bartender that I've ever had, such a nice guy - Irish maybe? So good. I was hoping for more of a dive, but I guess I missed those days. Still, I'd stop by here again, not because there was anything special about the bar, but just because the service was so good! (beer was cheap, whisky was cheap, bathroom was clean, and I'm pretty positive Amanda Bynes was sitting beside me.)",2,,4
24,Alan K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4,19,22,5.0,7/4/2017,"Five stars because it's the quintessential dive bar. In other words, it's a five star dive bar, but probably a one star bar compared to some high end cocktail watering holes. Used to be by the subway entrance on 60th and Lexington.",,,1
25,Leonard P.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,189,310,4.0,3/24/2015,"Subway Inn has reopened. The classic sign still adorns the front and looks restored to its glory. Inside   looks nice, but a bit smaller. As they just opened Friday, the place still has that new car smell, no spoiled, stale beer smell yet. Hey! Atomic Wings is in the back, no more phoning in your order and waiting for that dude to run back your order.The place looks the same, but cleaner, albeit a bit sterile, kinda like the new Yankee Stadium. The only thing that hasn't changed is the regulars, that group of blue collar sweat, smeared lipstick, and tight skirts with too small blouses straining under large pushed up boobage as to populate a David Goodis novel. Welcome back Subway Inn, at least you have survived the guillotine for now, and New York still has one of its dives to call home.",9,6,6

They close at 4am on the weekends. There were people inside and the rude bouncer gave no reason why he was turning away people; just an arrogant ""have a good night gentlemen"". Actually, he should have said have a good morning, gentlemen. Fine, if they were trying close the bar early that is cool but management and the bouncer could have been a little more professional. Bring back the Blue Room because even though the place was a dump at least you were treated with respect.  Even though it will not return, I KNOW that I will never spend a hot cent at Subway Inn again.",3,2,
27,Jeff O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",481,1388,217,5.0,6/14/2016,"Can't expect much from a bar around here. I actually never went to the old Subway Inn, so I can't compare about nostalgia for the business but for my own dive bar days I can. And it seemed like a cleaned up version of that. Some seedy characters and drunk dudes trying to impress their dates, rock not played on the radio, cheap enough drinks, and no one actually gives a fuck about you. I was just thinking about how I don't care to venture into dive bars anymore; how I don't really care about any challenges or the scene or the unknown.... and then I came back here and had a taste of the scene without it being nasty. I feel like such a lightweight now, but this was just enough edge to satisfy me - and I'm good. I'd go back.",,2,2

Crowd is still the same, loose women, karaoke douchebags, louzy sing along wannabe rappers ...The reason why I go there, is because the really nice bartenders know me and  give me the nod with my drinks ready, when I come in.

30,Catfish H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,229,107,3.0,4/7/2015,"I am with the reviewer who thought old Subway Inn was lousy, and not with the guy who thought it was a ""classic.""   Despite being a total S-hole, it was pricey and essentially without a redeeming quality outside of misplaced nostalgia.   I did, however, like Blue Room, which was a S-hole but wholly redeeming on a number of levels including prices, staff, pool table, TVs, late-night action and shady regulars.   This incarnation of Subway Inn is a big improvement: Drinks were fairly priced, brand new TVs, friendly staff, working washrooms and seats that you don't stick to.  I am a bit worried that they can't survive though - the times I have been there it has been very slow and I am sure the rent is astronomical.  Hopefully word spreads that this is a decent place to grab a beer and watch the game.  Keep in mind pretty bland taps but that is to be expected.",,,
31,Andres S.,"Great Neck, NY",1,5,15,1.0,7/17/2015,"I had planned to meet with a potential client here,  yet i was discriminated against by a very unscrupulous bouncer.  Not only did he have a very limited vocabulary,  he was extremely temperamental when we aproached him.  It appears he is instructed to turn down potential patrons under the false guise of ""intoxicated""... I personally can't understand why anyone would give such an important position to such an undeserving individual.  He was present at 9PM on a Friday, July 17th.  I would advise against this establishment.  Especially if you appear Hispanic.  I wanted to visit this establishment.  Now, I wish nothing to do with it.  I feel insulted and offended.",2,5,1

Unfortunately, it was not the NYC transit, nor the infamous sandwich chain with heavenly bread and sauces. I found another delicious sauce, however: their wide selection of fine scotches.

My first gripe: its dark. They boarded off the windows that provided light into this place.Second gripe: What's with the 'torture' booths and weird/akward table legs. I'm not tall and I had to contortion myself and even then couldn't find a comfortable position for more than five minutes.I will definitely give them some time to settle in. Perhaps, this bar will grow on me as it gives another option to the Jeffrey Bar that's down the block. We shall see...",3,3,
35,Armando E.,"New York, NY",240,20,0,3.0,3/20/2015,"Closing down and reopening in a different location may be the best thing to ever happen to this place.I really disliked the previous Subway Inn. No real glasses for drinks (only disposable plastic cups were used), place was in shambles, and the seat cushions were coming off of booths. Yeah, I know it's a dive bar, but I thought that was even too much. The drinks weren't that cheap either and everything was falling apart.Fast forward to now. They moved into this new location and built everything from scratch again, except for the neon sign they saved from the original location. Since it's a new location, everything seems nice and neat, but the low light and red glow still remains from the last location. I'm really glad the booths aren't falling apart like last time (for now), but let's wait and see about a month later if this all holds. I'm not thrilled with the decor anyway.The food is average (it's from Atomic Wings) and a bit pricey. I had the Thai Chili Dawg and I was done in about 6-7 bites. It was pretty bland, flavorless and forgettable. I definitely wouldn't come here for the food, especially considering that it's $7.50 when a street hot dog may actually taste slightly better and the dog is the size of 2 regular dogs.Only time will tell how well this place will ""age,"" but it seems like the same thing.

Atomic wings is still tasty, but prices went up, and you can't get combo deals after 4pm anymore. But, they make up for that with $5 beer, which is hard to find.The service was decent and friendly. I'm taking two stars for the booths that force you to contort your legs to maneuver around the long, metal brace that protrudes from the edge of the table. I am six feet tall, and this was a complete pain in the ass. I hit my knee pretty hard on it trying to leave.I'll come back because I live close by and like cheap beer, but only if I can sit at the bar.",3,,1
