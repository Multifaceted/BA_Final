0,Zach O.,"Belle Vernon, PA",0,23,3,3.0,10/22/2018,"We stopped at 830-9 on a Sunday night after visiting empire State building. Just looking for a place to stop.  Menu had a wide variety, but the burgers looked great.  Our 1st waiter was a little intimidating, the guy getting our drinks was kind of quiet, and the bartender seemed with it since he did our refills.  Food was GREAT. Wife got a pastrami burger that I was envious of. But the Queens burger was awesome, cheese was melted perfectly over burger and red pepper.  And the fresh cut fries were not overly salted, which if you read my other reviews I don't like a lot of salt. Service was pretty bad, as mentioned 3 people and none of which were busy.  But the food was great, just don't be in a hurry.  Also they auto add 20% tip to the bill, beware.",,,

He trusted my words, I wonder why did he....Anywayz! Sooo....  What ! Happy Hour after 10PM??Im staying here for the rest of the night!Sex on the beach $6Draft beer $6Nachos and Guac. I've Had better, but The Sex on the beach was better than others Ive had! The Manager was really nice, seemed like a great spot for lunch. Its also good for groups. The bar section is a bit small, but who cares if the drinks are this good and this affordable its cool!",,,1
2,Doreen G.,"Staten Island, NY",44,57,206,5.0,9/25/2018,"I stumbled across this place and I love the decor. It isn't big but someone put thought into the interior. My waitress was Maddi. She was so attentive. I had the shrimp quesadilla and it by far the best quesadilla I've ever had. For 14$ it came with sour cream, guacamole, and tomatoes on the side with 4 large cuts of quesadilla. Each slice had a great amount of shrimp, green and red peppers and onions. Each slice was  season to perfection. Amazing food",,,
3,Rachel E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,0,4.0,11/17/2018,"Totally surprised. Desperate to eat we picked a place that is clearly aimed at tourists, which we are not. The place is totally over priced, but the food and service were good.",,,

5,Ana M.,"Willington, CT",66,77,96,3.0,12/5/2017,"Was looking for somewhere to eat lunch and came across 5 Boro Burger. There were 3 adults and 2 children all together in our party. We were seated upstairs and the decor seemed to be newly renovated or painted. We placed our order and everything seemed to move slowly. From getting our drinks to placing our order and then getting the check we were here for double the time that we expected.Food was pretty good but I was also starving. I had the steak and cheese with fries, boyfriend had a burger his mom had a chicken parm sub and we ordered 2 kids meals. What surprised me was when we got the bill I was charged $4 for fries when I swear the menu said it was included, if it wasn't I wouldn't have ordered the sandwich. The other thing is that a children's meal is $14 WTH. That's the same price as a normal adult sized meal!!! I think the children's menu needs to be cut down in price the portions were too big, give smaller portions and then charge less money!!! I felt bad for the waiter he seemed stressed but was nice that's why I gave this place 3 stars.",,,

7,Jonas H.,"Vallentuna, Sweden",0,36,20,1.0,10/8/2018,"The veggie burgers we had here were the worst we've ever been served. Anywhere. Anytime. Tasteless och with a bread that was as tasteless and thin, and everything felt like it had been in a microwave. Out of two ordered drinks they managed to serve one correct. Could have been worse... Overpriced tourist trap, I'm sorry to say. McDonald's next door would be a better alternative. And way cheaper.",,,
8,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1508,175,3.0,11/18/2017,"Best I can give this place is three stars and that is being generous. I thought that the burger was just passable; must have been pre-cooked most of the way and reheated so it came out very dry.  Price is cheap; $8.95 for a plain burger, a dollar more for cheese, Good size portion.  A Goose IPA draft was $8.00.Service was friendly, food came out quickly.",4,,
9,Natalie W.,"South Plainfield, NJ",389,79,565,3.0,4/30/2017,"Went earlier today for lunch before heading back to NJ. Hadn't heard of it kinda randomly chose to walk in because it looked simple... The Margaritas are $6 so we had one (was skeptical once I saw it was pre made in a jug) . But it was actually pretty good . A group of 5 . 3 ordered Quesadillas , 1 wings and Fries and the Other just Fries. Took us 45 MINUTES to get our food. Way too long for appetizer food. Though the wait was long, the food was tasty the Shrimp Quesedilla I ate had a good taste and the shrimp taste like Real shrimp. The service was descent though the waiter could have checked in more especially to explain the long wait.Also they definitely added 18% gratuity to the bill automatically .Wouldn't go out of my way to return but it will work if you are in the area and have time to burn.",3,2,3
10,Ian M.,"Owings Mills, MD",2,74,16,1.0,10/20/2018,"Food was high quality, price reasonable.  However, I'm marking this place down severely for our waiter Rania.  Clearly impatient, he didn't want to wait more than 10 seconds for you to order.  I saw him do this with other tables.  He then actively avoided eye contact every time he passed us when we signaled (just wanted a napkin/refill).  His colleague came immediately and did Rania's job.  Rania was then caustic when we paid.  We gave a decent tip ON TOP OF THE AUTOMATIC 20% THAT THEY ADDED AND WE DIDN'T NOTICE but Rania didn't deserve it for his terrible attitude and service.",,,

12,Keegan Z.,"Richmond, VA",98,248,711,2.0,1/23/2017,"5 Boro Burger is a classic ""siren song"" of a restaurant: draws you in with pleasing exterior aesthetics, then dashes you on the rocks. Only here, instead of dashing you onto rocks, you just have a really crummy dining experience.Came here desperate for something to eat after pouring out of Times Square shortly after midnight on NYE. The outside looked nice enough, though the inside was extremely generic and claustrophobic. Our tiny table was in front of one of the TVs and crammed into a corner, as if they had been wondering whether to put in a fire extinguisher or an additional table there and opted for the table.The service was atrocious. The servers seemed to have some system where they ""helped one another"", though we apparently were not on the receiving end of any of this help. They did not communicate with one another and we found ourselves asking multiple times to get our needs taken care of. The worst part of all is: THEY AUTOMATICALLY ADD GRATUITY TO EVERY PARTY, seemingly knowing that the only way they'll earn tips is to extort it from customers.With all of this, you would hope that they would have good food at an affordable price. Your hopes would be dashed on the rocks as well. The fare here is decent, though strictly average, and served at ridiculously high prices considering it is no better than what you will get at a food cart.It was an awful idea to come here. Avoid my fate, steer clear of this place!Overall: 1.5 stars-------------Pros:- Food is decent, though not by any means memorable.- Outside looks nice, just nice enough to ensnare you at least.Cons:- Awful service with AUTOMATIC GRATUITIES? What nonsense is that?- Prices are ridiculously high for what is essentially food cart quality cuisine.- Interior is poorly designed and claustrophobic.",1,2,1
13,Ashlee S.,"Brooklyn, NY",773,371,28,1.0,1/16/2018,"I was staying at nearby hotel and got a craving for a turkey burger. As it was pretty frigid outside, I decided to order from my trusty faithful, Seamless. I reviewed about 10 restaurants before ultimately abandoning my usuals, Bareburger, Schindler's and Five Napkin Burger to try something new. Well now I'm regretting this decision as my turkey burger tasted like beef and has my stomach feeling awful. I do not eat beef so receiving a beef burger or turkey cooked near beef is a big problem. I contacted Seamless who then contacted the restaurant and they pretty much said oh well so I won't be ordering here again!",2,1,2
14,Rosalie W.,"Vernon, Canada",38,14,1,1.0,6/9/2018,"Worst meal on my trip to NYC. Turkey burger served dry. Service was terrible and mandatory 20% tip - didn't deserve a 5%tip, let alone 20%. 2 burgers and sodas was a 50 Dollar meal. Come here if you like being ripped off and ignored.",2,,
15,Christine P.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,10,2,5.0,10/14/2017,Listen this place has literally the best affordable burger in nyc. The fries are seasoned well and the burgers come out juicy.

16,John R.,"Warren, NJ",174,1219,345,3.0,12/5/2016,"I cannot say I have been here on a ""normal"" day. This is one of a few places you can buy a ticket to see the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from and from this event is what I am going to base my review on.You need to get here at 8:00 AM as noted as the entire area is in chaos with security, etc. Getting here this early means getting a reserved seat inside is the way to go. You can sit, relax, have breakfast, and later some hot food brunch served buffet style upstairs as the morning ticks onward.Unless you hit the lottery with a seat next to a window upstairs the only real way to see the parade is to go outside just about when it is coming close to 5 Boro. Since you need to have a wrist band from the restaurant to even be outside in front this at least limits the chaos and for us, not claiming a front row viewing point first thing, we still managed to rotate ourselves in before Santa came down the street.Yes, it is a quiet zone for the parade -- meaning no one will be performing at this point in the street -- but the vantage point is still great and everyone in the restaurant helped make a great day out of it form the people inside to the doorkeeper outside it all worked out really well.",3,1,1
17,Ben W.,"Montgomery, AL",40,96,147,5.0,7/3/2018,"Look ..... I'm not a guy that hands out a Five Star Rating to just any business. I subscribe to the theory that there is always room for improvement. But once in a while I get surprised by a place that goes out of the way to provide what we all want when we go out for a meal and drinks..... that's right..... to be treated special and to be catered to. Something out of the ordinary! This lil' burger joint on the corner of Ave of the America's and 36th Street. Not far from Time Square. 5 Boro Burgers is more than just burgers! They have an ample bar and an interesting menu full of super delicious fun food! Maddie took care of us as well as a room full of other customers! She never missed a step! I have absolutely no complaints! Food was fantastic, beer was cold and Maddie was a sweetheart! Very impressed! This place is a model for what other pubs, taverns and restaurants should operate like! I'll end this review by saying.... if your in New York City near Time Square, pay this place a visit. You have my word as a very judgmental restaurant patron.... you'll leave full happy and maybe even buzzed! Fantastic experience!",,,
18,Bill F.,"Lake Mary, FL",29,46,33,1.0,6/19/2018,"As the other yelpers said , come here if you want to get ripped off !  14.00 for a chewy Reuben, and $17.00 for a dish we didn't even order .. no one came back to check on us until we called them over , at that point it was too late ( we ran out of lunch hour ) and THEN , force me to pay 20% for CRAPPY service .... we didn't pay the 52.95 which included the 20% ... we threw  down the amount with tip that we felt appropriate considering the level of service .  Both my wife and myself have been servers and are the best tippers out there ( usually around 30% for expected service and 40-50% for great service ) BULL charging us 20% and give us 5% service !!

It had guacamole, mozzarella cheese, bacon, spicy mayo, and pico de gallo. The French fries were seasoned great as well!The service was excellent. The waiter was very friendly. For a specialty burger $14.95 on NYC is reasonable.I would definitely go back and try another one of their specialty burgers!",1,1,3
21,Richard J.,"Vista, CA",75,253,331,3.0,3/12/2017,"Came here for dinner since it was close to the hotel and within walking distance. The place is a little small, but not too bad. The service is pretty friendly here and they have some decent basic choices. I ended up going with the Brooklyn Burger and fries. The burger comes with grilled onions, Cajun seasoning, steak sauce, crispy bacon and cheddar cheese. There was hardly any sauce on the burger and not that much onions either. It was a decent burger, but nothing i would rush back to have.",,,

Appetizers we tried the wings , Buffalo , Regular & Garlic Parm. Wings were decent enough a bit on the small side decent buffalo & regular. Buffalo were covered in sauce nice way to clear your sinuses Lolll Garlic Parm not bad need more garlic taste, also covered in sauce but did lack garlic flavor. Great fries , nice tasting good seasoning on them. We also an order of the Calamari not bad a bit over fried which made it kinda hard. Main dishes the Shrimp po boy was good decent size sandwich w fries not bad. The Bronx Burger was also good. As for the place itself small but with enough seating , nice decor nothing too crazy service was good , prices are ok the place served its purpose for a quick decent meal.",10,2,2

24,J C.,"Newport News, VA",13,2,0,2.0,3/27/2018,What not to do when your CC/debit connection fails..... ignore your customer when he requests the bill. Somewhat passive acknowledgement from direct eye contact and hand waiving with the server. I feel trapped and definitely will not come back.,,,
25,Scott B.,"Corona, NY",2,4,0,1.0,6/29/2018,Food was OK however they added a 20% tip for a party of two. I should decide the gratuity - not the restaurant manager. They justified it by saying tourists don't tip because they don't understand the practice. Highly unlikely I'll return.,,,
26,Arshiya S.,"Woodside, NY",82,145,135,3.0,11/13/2016,"We were looking for a place to eat dinner and walked by here. Decided to stop by since it looked decent.Servers were nice and quick. Appetizers were good. Nachos and fried plantains with a garlic sauce. I was deciding between a vege wrap or salmon burger...but ended up getting both since my Cousin and I ended up splitting both. To me the food was ok. I didn't like the wrap because the grilled vegetables looked like the came frozen and Warmed n threw into the wrap. It was not good.  Burger was ok too. Everyone else seemed to be enjoying their good so can't say much about the other items. Overall, I probably won't be back.",,,
27,Kenya H.,"Durham, NC",0,2,4,5.0,8/22/2017,I ate here twice while visiting NY & the food was great! The food was fresh & steaming hot each time it came out. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area! FYI: They do automatically add a 18% gratuity to your bill.,,,
28,Alex R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,13,5,2.0,8/21/2017,"After walking around the area and realizing the places I had wanted to go for dinner had 40+ minute waits we decided to come here. The exterior looked nice and the menu was filled with lots of choices. But then the issues arose... We ordered and the servers were inattentive but the food came out quickly. We only ordered a French onion soup and the lamb burger which was a special of the night. The food was extremely basic but it was fine. We sat for about an hour and only encountered our server three times, to Bring us water after we sat down, to take our order and take the check. When the check came we noticed that 18% gratuity was already added on a $20.00 meal with very average service. I don't mind leaving a good tip when it is deserved but clearly these waiters and waitresses know they don't need to work for their tip because it's already added. For that reason alone I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. There are lots of restaurants in this same area and this place isn't anything special so take a pass and find something better.",,,
29,Princeton J.,"San Diego, CA",25,413,1204,5.0,6/7/2015,"This place is quick and convenient sit down food. Located right on a busy corner side...

The food was good, came out quick, the waitress friendly, hip music playing and a clean bathroom. Not fine dining by no means, but I needed a secluded booth to guzzle beer, eat, send emails and make phone calls... Left with a full belly, a little buzzed and caught up on my biznass!",3,3,2
30,Lauren P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",308,6,0,2.0,6/14/2018,"I stopped in here for lunch, and walking in the was kind of confusing as to whether or not there was a host or if you seat yourself. After I finally got seated, the waitress took a bit to come over to me, and I ordered a turkey burger and mashed potatoes. The burger was really dry, and the mashed potatoes we bland (and they tasted instant), and the pickle just tasted like a cucumber dipped in vinegar. After asking for the check the waitress just kind of tossed the check on the table, which I didn't think was very professional. I paid, filled out the receipt, and then realized there was a 20% auto gratuity added. I crossed out the extra gratuity I almost left, and as soon as I put it down the waitress came by and grabbed it away from me, which also left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I'm a server in the area, and I work really hard to get the tips I receive, and I know that I'm a really nice, easy customer. You need to be kind, attentive, and polite to be a good server- ESPECIALLY if there's going to be an automatic gratuity. And the food just wasn't worth it, particularly because there's so much fantastic food in the area.",,,

32,Cheryl L.,"Wantagh, NY",0,7,0,2.0,12/18/2017,"Started with arriving there and waiting about 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Probably should have walked out after 5 minutes and found someplace better. Service wasn't great at all. Food was eh, fries were soggy and didn't have much flavor. Only thing that was good was my beer. Waitress took our order and never saw her again until we flagged her down for the check. Never came back to make sure everything was ok, or to see if we needed anything. Plus what I didn't notice is they tack on a 20% gratuity to every bill, we were two people so I didn't catch it or think to look for it. As far as I was concerned a 20% tip (plus what I added) wasn't deserved for bad service and food that wasn't that good!!!!! Definitely recommend skipping 5 Boro Burger and finding someplace else.",,,
33,Nicole J.,"San Marcos, CA",22,70,12,3.0,3/14/2017,"I came here after a long day exploring the city, we just needed to eat and this was close with no wait... now I know why. Seating is very close together so we had to shuffle our chairs every time the waiter needed to get to the next table... not relaxing. I ordered the Cobb Salad and was disappointed... I did not ask for any changes on it and it came out with bacon and chicken only. I felt like a brat asking for more toppings that were supposed to be on it already. The dressing it came with was weird so I asked for Ranch and it wasn't much better. Overall I would say this place is plain, bland and not worth your time.",,,
34,Emily P.,"Hillsdale, NJ",104,3,1,1.0,11/29/2017,"Misleading menu. Overcharged for fries that we were under the impression came along with the burger. Made a point to the waiter that we DID NOT want cheese on our burger, yet he brought it with cheese anyway. Mistakes happen, but all they did was scrape the cheese off and give it back to us. He then charged us for the cheese we specifically said we did not want. Will not be back here again.",,,
35,Anjelica S.,"Manhattan, NY",20,25,8,3.0,12/13/2016,"I came here with my friend on a Monday night to grab dinner. She had seen it for a while and figured it wouldn't hurt to try it together. We decided to share an appetizer, the calamari, and split the Queens burger. We both also got a drink each and waited for our food. While the food came out fairly quick, the calamari was a little rubbery, but otherwise okay. We had ordered the burger medium rare but it came out more medium well. It wasn't the worst, but just not what we had expected.I will say both our drinks were pretty good. I ordered a hot toddy and she ordered the caramel apple mule. We ended up getting another round of the mules before leaving.When we asked for the check, we looked it over to see that it had cost us $88 in total for two people (two drinks each, one main dish, and an appetizer). They had added an 18% gratuity to the bill for two people on a Monday night. Once we split the bill, they conveniently had an extra spot for ""tip"" on the receipt. How do you charge an 18% gratuity on a two-person table on a slow night?

Also, the Brooklyn burger was a failure to me. This case however, I took that one home and ate at  other  time but did not enjoy. My friend ordered the Bronx burger and it looked nice also but was informed that it was not the best tasting.  Smarter decision might have been not to eat the burger but at least it did not get me sick and even the Half of the Brooklyn burger was not disgusting but just average.  Final verdict,  I just don't see myself eating here with a Groupon deal or not. The borough burgers normally cost $15 each or somewhere around there. Good luck finding your way home.",9,7,9

Basically, he was rude and when we ask about sitting upstairs he said it is closed for lunch but there was a group of people that walked in the other waitress offered them to sit upstairs but they did not and left due to the AC. And at 420pm other people came in and they were seated upstairs.My advice to any one who wants to go there to think twice about it.

49,Kirill V.,"Manhattan, NY",47,103,81,1.0,2/5/2017,"This place doesn't deserve any rating. Here is a full breakdown of why they get 1 star.1) It's very cold inside. It's 38-44 degrees outside and customers expect to be in a warm place and don't even think about the cold inside. These people don't know how to use thermostat. It doesn't make your visit very pleasant. Temperature inside was around 58-65.2) Latte is $6. Small cup of latte where all you can taste is bitterness of burnt coffee. Asked for milk because even after 5 packs of sugar it still tasted terrible. You don't call it latte and don't charge $6 for it. What I had is worth $2-2.5. Learn how to make latte or don't even mention it in your menu please!3) They don't give you water unless you ask! I don't know what kind of people this place hires, but apparently low skilled employees with no customer service skills and understanding of table service works. When customers get seated you bring the water right away or within a minute. Not when I asked you after we got food and I already thirsty from your salty burgers!4) They don't ask how would we like our burger to be made! So if you are a lover of bloody burgers or well done you will be disappointed.  They do medium rare. At least in my case. Mine was slightly undercooked. I had no time to ask for replacement because I was in a rush. So make sure you know that their staff doesn't even care what you're into. You get what THEY want.5) Cajun burger was terrible. Meat was below average and like I said undercooked plus they put all spices in one part of the burger so I almost choked from it. Was  a tasteless burger and then BAM! Salty, full of sodium and other spices so I needed to drink water right away. Just from taking one bite. 6) I got confused about tipping at this place. Gave them couple dollars, but I guess they got offended and gave me change. Thank you for understanding how shitty you are by giving me my change. I think you know your service was so terrible that you don't even deserve any tips. You don't even deserve couple dollars.",1,,

I came here with a few friends to have a Burger, you would think since the place is called ""five borough burger"" you can't go wrong by ordering the burger. Well guess what, it's a Saturday night at 8pm prime time and the manger of this joint didn't order any burger buns for his restaurant to make burgers..... anyway the staff is friendly and nice.

52,Kazi I.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,14,1,1.0,1/2/2015,"I would have given three stars if it wasn't for the despicable customer service. We were seated quickly by a very friendly waitress. We ordered a SALMON burger with cheese, Panini with cheese, a coke, and a water.There was smushed fries and what looked like oil or ketchup underneath my chair so i asked a different person if she may clean it. She said she will ask the guys but this so called guy never came and I had to sit with my legs stretched out the entire time.PICTURE BELOW!First came out two glasses of coke...Wait what, we ordered 1 coke and 1 water! Screw it, I'll drink coke.Then came out a Turkey burger...Wait what, we ordered Salmon! The person took it back and the very friendly waitress came out and started arguing with us adamant that we ordered a Turkey burger. I went on to remind her that I also ordered a water and this FR**IN mess underneath my chair has not been cleaned up yet. She shut up and just went to the back. At this point, the food tasted like sh*t because of her sh*tty attitude. I was hoping for an apology, or coming to an agreement but I was just given talk and a scowl. I'm not going to mention her name because I don't want her to get in trouble but if she's reading this, waiting 101, customers always right (in this case, I actually was!) The salmon burger comes out 10 minutes later by a different waitress while I'm already done with my Panini. Our original waitress continued to completely ignore us. No one came to us for a refill nor did we know who to ask for it considering our very friendly waitress was avoiding eye contact the whole time. When time came for the bill, I went to the bar and asked that lady, our very friendly waitress printed out the check and handed back to the bartender who gave it to us.I do not have time for such childish games and dirty scowls. We only get 1 hour lunch break and many of my colleagues in the office frequently visit. I am going to make sure that doesn't happen anymore. I guarantee that.",4,5,

After 3 minutes another waiter came by and told me that it would be there in a few minutes.So i waited.... By the time my plate got there, my friend did finished his servings. So when my plate finally got there, it was a slightly smaller steak, and they had changed the baked potato with french fries. - which was not what I had ordered.- I was tiered and hungry, so i ate it, just to get out of there. - They had some guests sitting in the bar who was very loud and annoying.

I've heard many peopleSay that place is great. So I decided to give it a try. The menu wasn't too extensive but rather expensive.  The bill was over 40$ for two burgers and two sodas. The place was clean with a small seating area on first level there was a second floor which I did not go to.

60,Brian S.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",74,271,110,2.0,10/9/2014,"I'll start off with the good and the only reason why I'm not giving this place a one  star rating. The burgers are actually quite delicious, particularly the Bronx and Manhattan offerings (vodka sauce on a burger is pretty epic). The sweet potato fries were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, and the onion rings were savory and satisfying.The service was pretty awful.  Legitimately awful. Everything took 15-20 minutes, including receiving napkins and utensils.The desserts shouldn't be considered desserts, they were clearly generic store bought items which did not seem to be kept well. Their milkshake machine was not working, which for a burger joint is not a good sign, and even beyond that they only gave the three generic flavors of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.We went with a Groupon which was fine until the bill came and they added restrictions to it that were not mentioned in the deal. The manager, I'm assuming, eventually honored the original deal but we had to wait for him for a good amount of time. Not returning again, which is a shame because the burgers were good.",1,1,1
61,Tyler L.,"New York, NY",357,922,1278,3.0,9/20/2014,"Tried the burger and fries here. Even without a drink, it is not that cheap - $15. They have 5 different burgers - each is named after a NYC borough. The burger was actually very good. It is above average in size - about the size as most diners serve. It was also very, very juicy and comes in a very soft brioche bun. The fries were not bad but nothing special. They are bit thicker than the thin McDonalds style fries and have a heavy garlic flavor. This is definitely one of the better burgers you can get in the area. However, I had better and bigger burgers for lower prices, so this place ends up rating average for me.",1,,1
62,Kimberly Y.,"New York, NY",23,27,63,3.0,1/17/2015,"A co-worker and I stopped in to grab take-out for dinner. A waitress greeted us at the door and took our orders. I ordered the cobb salad and my co-worker ordered the turkey wrap. The waitress kindly told us that our order would take about 10 minutes so we sat by the bar and ordered some much needed drinks. About 30 minutes  later and a few drinks in our orders finally came out.The food was freshly prepared and the portions were quite large (definitely a plus). The cobb salad came with grilled chicken, avocado, a hard boiled egg, and bacon on a bed of romaine and tomatoes. Nothing too fancy...your typical ordinary salad. The chicken was a tad dry but the amount of bacon they put in made up for that. I requested ranch dressing which they put about a tablespoon in 3 tiny sauce containers. Definitely not enough for the size of the salad. My co-worker enjoyed her turkey wrap but I think she enjoyed the fries more since she devoured those first (or maybe she was just starving from not eating all day). All in all, not bad to get a ""quick"" bite to eat.",,,

All in all I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back to try the other types of burgers they have.",,,
98,Michelle R.,"Waco, TX",36,18,0,1.0,12/19/2015,"Nope. Don't do it. Great service, friendly staff, quick food to table. BUT food is low quality. Appetizer mozzarella sticks, that came served on a bed of decorative romaine lettuce, definitely came from a frozen pre made package. The burger meat was fatty and clumpy (yeah I said clumpy.) the sweet potato fries were tasteless. The cheese on the burger was a Kraft single. The burger meal was $9. it's just not up to par with other Manhattan dining. So just skip it.",,,
99,Michael C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,3,0,1.0,2/8/2017,"Came here last night, and while there are many amazing burger places around the area such as shake shack and chick fil a, I'm not sure why I even bothered with this place. From the outside it looked like this was a sit in restaurant and upon arrival I noticed that there was no host/server/waiter so the bartender had to walk out from his bar to greet us and seat us. After sitting down I just could not feel comfortable as everything was old and greasy. Especially the menus looked dirty, and on top of that, the chairs and tables looked like they were salvaged from somewhere. At that point I just hoped my food was clean. I ordered the burger of course, but the waiter/bartender who was actually such a nice guy, left with our orders but never bothered to ask how we would like our burgers done. (This is no surprise because his job is behind the bar and this place was extremely understaffed and needs actual wait staff) Finally when our meals arrived but our burgers were so well-done that it was semi crispy. The quarter slice of dill pickle was soft and tasted really off. I'm usually a huge fan of pickles but this one definitely didn't cut into the palette with any sort of semblance of refreshing dill taste. The Diet Coke was actually another type of cola soda, and it was completely flat and watered down. On top of that, they have a policy of 18% gratuity added on to the final bill when there was no waiter to begin with. Where does this tip go to? I don't mind spending money on a great burger and service but this place is lacking both. Two burger meals (fries and drink) will cost you $50. You can get a pretty nice steak for that. I think this place can improve in many ways and considering the area it is in, I expected a lot more from the establishment. You simply can't name yourself 5 boro burger and name your specialty burgers 'Manhattan burger' 'Brooklyn burger' etc and fall this short. It becomes an insult to the city. I won't be coming here again unless they make some changes.",,,

101,Klarissa L.,"New York, NY",64,165,952,3.0,9/25/2014,"HAPPY HOUR Happy hour special is from 6-7 and beers are buy one get one free.  Please note, prices of beer are not on any of the menus or signs.  Please also note, the server does not tell you, but for this deal to apply, you must order the same beer.GROUPON DEAL STORYCame here with a groupon deal.  The deal says you get $50 to spend on food - there are no notes regarding restrictions on what we must order or that you cannot order drinks.  I don't know how many people have used groupons before, but there are more or less two types of deals:1. the ones for a dollar amount, which you get to order whatever you want off the menu - sometimes drinks are restricted and sometimes they aren't.  2. the ones that are like a prefix meal - you get two drinks, two entrees and a dessert to share - pretty much they list out everything you're allowed to orderWith that said, when I first arrived, I arrived about 20 minutes before my husband, it was still happy hour - so I ordered myself a beer and Nachos to start.  While I was sitting and looking over the menu the service was spectacular! Every time I looked up and made eye contact with someone, they would come over and ask what I needed.  I was pretty much being waited on by three different servers - and the restaurant was NOT empty!When my husband arrived and we decided to order him a beer [as it was right before 7].  We double checked with the waiter that it was buy one get one free, and it was still happy hour.  The waiter advised the beer was $8 and yes it was still buy one get one and happy hour.  My husband took about a minute to decide on the beer as the waiter stood waiting.  He chose a different beer than me on the menu (we don't like ordering the same thing so we can try a wider variety).  Since we had asked about the happy hour twice, and the price, I thought it was obvious we wanted to take advantage of the buy one get one free.  Later the waiter informed us it only worked when you ordered the same beer ... during the long minute the waiter waited there for my husband to decide on the beer, and when my husband said 'oh I wanted to order your beer, but I guess I'll try a different one' ... at ANY TIME the waiter could have told us happy hour restricted us to ordering the same beer and we would have been more than happy to order the same beer.  Instead, he didn't say anything, AND told us AFTER 7pm, so we couldn't even order two more beers as our 'free' beers.THEN we went to order our food and advised that we had a groupon.  Waiter then advised we get two beers and two burgers with our groupon.  Beers are $8 each, and the most expensive burger is $16.  I tried to explan that there are two types of groupons and there were NO restrictions on this one.  We went back and forth for a while until finally he got the manager.  We [in my opinion, nicely] explained again how groupon works, as we've often buy deals.  In the end, the manager was really nice, and allowed us to use the groupon the way we wanted.  At the end he even came and checked on us and gave us a round of beers on the house.  This made me feel a lot better about the overall experience as I felt like our waiter was intentionally deceiving us.  The whole bogo beer thing pissed me off, especially because he was there when we were deciding AND initially he seemed so helpful and friendly.THE FOOD Crispy Chicken Nachos I love my Nachos and these were made very well - there were no soggy chips at the bottom, all were crispy and delicious.  I also liked how there was a generous portion of chicken and the chicken was crispy!! For $12 I would say the portion was very good.  This was easily my favorite dishOnion RingsProbably one of the worst onion rings I've had.  The batter is not good, not fluffy or light at all, as onion rings should be.  You can also taste none of the onion. Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the fries either, they weren't salty enough and they weren't crispy at all ... of the three, I guess I would recommend the Sweet Potato Fries since we didn't try them, and the other two options we tried were not good.Brooklyn Burger I don't like burgers, so I didn't try this, but my husband said it was okay, as other reviews have said, I think it's an overpriced burger ... I would much rather take my money and go to shake shack - their burgers are much better. Crispy Chicken Caesar Salad WrapChicken was same as in nachos - very yummy! Wrap was a little too oily for my taste, but very delicious! And i guess i did order a Crispy Chicken Wrap! i did like how there was a little Caesars salad in it for extra flavor!Overall, I would come back to this place for Happy Hour.  I would like to give this place another try and see how it is ...",,,

We started with Red Sangria....I'm a Sangria lover and this one did not disappoint.  Mild and fruity.I had the Queens burger, my mother had the Bronx burger and my daughter had the Hawaiian burger.  We could have shared 2 between the 3 of us....plenty to go around.  The beef patty was cooked through, which often means a dry patty but this one was not.  It was very juicy and flavorful on it's own even before all of the additional toppings were added.  The roasted peppers really added to it for me.  The service was great...our waiter appeared to be new and made some errors but the person training him stayed on top of everything and made sure our experience didn't suffer.",1,,

It was a 2 or 3 inch think brick (or hockey puck) of a burger of tasteless meat that resembled salmon. The fries were fantastic, but the actually meal or main dish... was awful. My companion's order was to be a regular deli sandwich, pastrami on rye. We were in NY after all, almost the king of deli sandwiches, right?  Turns out they throw the pastrami on the grill and heat it until it's a dark brown. Again, tasteless  and just plained ruined of an easy sandwich. It did not state it was going to be heated or cooked in any way.

He basically tossed the menus at us. The worst part of the dining experience was the Manhattan we ordered - after I tasted the Manhattan, it was just straight whisky with a Maraschino Cherry in it. After asking the bartender what was the matter with the cocktail, he told me they were out of bitter (and probably vermouth, too. I didn't taste any of it in the drink). However, we were not informed in any way by the waiter from the time we ordered the drink to the arrivals of the orders. After telling the waiter by myself, he decided not to refund or compensate my order because ""I finished half of the drink"". Considering the drink had only like, 3 oz or so, I only had 2 sips...so wow, really?I am really surprise - this experience is like I ordered chicken and they gave me pork, and they tried to deceive me. After finding out myself that they gave me pork & inform them about it, they didn't think they made a mistake and told me to suck it up.When we were paying the bill, one of my friends was trying to pay with her debit card. For some reason, our waiter returned to her and told her ""the credit card doesn't work"".

124,Inna S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/18/2015,"5 Boro burger - sports bar, American (traditional). What kind of traditions the owner means we don't know. But we found one for sure. We don't talk about the food , it's desperately so-so like you can see enough in another reviews. The only one tradition that we found it was a guy who's a manager there. It's something unbelievable. Does he even know how to work in a customer service and with people? Hell No. He doesn't. His tradition includes just screaming on the workers. He is very mean and rude even with the customers. We were there a few times. This unrespectful behavior we see all the time. Who's an owner? Does he bother himself to check cameras at least once in a while, what's going on in his place? ( I pretend to think that they have enough of cameras around the place). So let's go back to the ""traditions"" of this place, because older generations as well as people of higher positions suppose to give an example of behavior to the rest of the workers. Considering to the actions of the manager we mentioned the same rude, screaming, impolite behavior in front of the customers from another worker. I'm so sorry, don't remember his name, but he was only one Asian worker that night.In conclusio, my advice if you wanna treat yourself with simple American traditional food, there's a lot of choices around with better quality. But if you are addicted to the live action that you can post on YouTube there's a place number 1 to go and always welcome for some screaming rude shit around. P.S. probably there's logo suppose to be ""F**k the tradions"" instead of ""American tradional""",,1,

150,Kalisha C.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",12,122,10,3.0,3/24/2014,"Decent.  Had a fine lunch with a colleague.  There is a fine beer selection - nothing fancy - and an American menu with pretty good burgers.  It's nothing gourmet and won't be the best burger you've ever had, but it's a good location and you can sit and have a beer.",,,
151,Isabel L.,"Manhattan, NY",29,4,28,5.0,9/23/2015,OMG!!!! We can't move now!! Huge portions at very reasonable price!! Will come back whenever veeeery hungry!!,,,
152,Lindsay P.,"Montauk, NY",7,5,3,3.0,6/12/2014,"3 stars.... Let me start out by saying the food was incredible! We had amazing burgers and deserve five stars. The service deserves 1 star maybe less. We had to wait an extensive amount of time for everything: our drinks, our waiter, our check, even to pay for the check. The food was great! And relatively inexpensive! But the service, it was definitely the downside of the restaurant. Oh and for a table of two tip was already included. I would've just tipped for the chefs if I could.",,,
153,Bob T.,"Yukon, OK",0,2,1,4.0,8/3/2014,The burgers were really good. Lots of flavor. Larger portions for both the burgers and fries.Had both the Brooklyn and Bronx burger and both were cooked through and still juicy. I would eat there again.,,,
154,Bradley S.,"Northeast Dallas, Dallas, TX",5,3,1,3.0,4/5/2014,"Service and location (especially 2nd floor) was great, but food was mediocre. The burgers were not as good as other burgers that you can get in midtown. The fries had an interesting flavor, but the onion rings were too oily. Our server and the rest of the staff were very kind, friendly and attentive.",,,
155,Aubyn D.,"Baldwin, NY",24,1,0,5.0,3/21/2014,My go to place for cheat meals without feeling too guilty :). Haven't been back since the renovation but more space = more fun - great place to bring friends after work or have a low key night out,,,
156,Kjersti D.,"Oslo, Norway",1,1,0,5.0,10/12/2014,"I recommend this place! I see a lot of people complain about the bad service but that is not what I experienced! We got a nice booth since we wanted to watch a game. A man gave us menues and cutlery instantly and a waitress came to take our  drink order 1 min later. The beers came after a few minutes and we got to order at once. 10-15min later the food was on the table, and it was delicious!! Thank you 5 boro!",,,
157,Erika V.,"West New York, NJ",0,1,0,4.0,4/9/2014,I had the Bronx burger and it is by far the Best burger I've ever had. Service and location are great!,,,
158,Fern G.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,33,20,4.0,4/7/2014,"I stopped by here after an evening class with a friend. We shared a couple of appetizers, the potato skins and a portion of sweet potato fries. Good tasty food and good portion sizes. Very cheap also! Barely $10 for the two appetizers - will definitely come again. Good customer service also.",,,
159,Aisha T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,6,4.0,6/8/2015,"The only thing better than good food is good service. Feliciano is one of the best waiters of I've ever had!!! My mom's steak was absolutely delicious. The peach sangria was tasty. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my turkey burger was a frozen pattie and we know those are never impressive. If they add a homemade turkey burger, I'd easily switch to 5 stars.",,,
160,Ivan O.,"White Plains, NY",4,4,4,5.0,3/19/2014,"My friend and I stopped by the other day for happy hour, they have the 2 for 1 beer deal which is great, we ordered the Bronx burger with the melted mozzarella cheese, guac, pico de gallo... And the Brooklyn burger with. The crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, and Cajun seasoning, it was amazing! The best burger place I've tried so far!! I defenetly approve!",,,
161,Ciera L.,"Tucson, AZ",6,153,23,2.0,1/1/2015,"Server was slow, food was below mediocre & drink prices were outrageous. Paid $9 for a crappy bottle of cider and $8 for a bottle of crappy IPA. Not worth it.",1,,
162,Dave D.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,0,2.0,8/8/2015,"Had a Reuben that was 80% fat. Soda tastes funny. When they brought me the wrong beer, saw them recap it and return to the cooler.",,,
163,Matt H.,"Hazleton, PA",1,5,0,2.0,4/10/2014,"The food here was good, however the service was terrible. Our waiter was only able to successfully get one out of four orders right. Three of us had to send our orders back in order to get the correct food.",,,
164,David F.,"Homer, AK",110,10,7,2.0,6/27/2015,Cool atmosphere nice location made it really easy to grab a bite there after some shopping. Waitress forgot our mozzarella stick order and I was under the impression that sweet potato fries were included with the burger (not $4 extra).,,,
165,Shenice F.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,0,1.0,6/3/2015,This place is horrible!  They made me and my friends wait over 30 minutes to get our bill and it was not until someone said something that they claimed something was wrong with their system!  Such a complete waste of time! Thoroughly disappointed in their service.  The manager was not accommodating to our complaints or concerns!,,,
166,Mike R.,"Pacifica, CA",0,1,0,1.0,7/2/2014,"First off, I'm a very easily pleased person when it comes to food. I rarely ever complain the slightest bit about anything I eat. This establishment has good service, and a pleasant staff. Somewhat of a cheesy dive bar feel in a burger/taco joint, but that's besides the point. The food was completely terrible with no effort or care put into the preparation or the taste. Oily soft gooey sweet potato fries, and a horribly dry bland Reuben sandwich, which was a feature on the menu. The disgusting icing on the cake was the urine flavored pickles, (no joke the pickles smelled as of they've been soaked in urine, maybe a disgruntled chefs clever attempt at a joke) which I immediately spit out, then asked for a manager. The rest of the dinner was ruined, and my girlfriend and I didn't eat another bite. The manager showed up ten minutes later, and decided to not comp anything we had ordered. She proceeded to call the owner, who agreed with her about not being any help to with my refund of the garbage food i just consumed. I've never wrote on Yelp in my life, but felt it was my duty after the treatment I have received at this dump. Do yourself, family and or friends a favor, spend a little more money and go to a great restaurant next door called Keens Steakhouse, and the Keg Room right across the street for your dive bar needs.",1,,
167,Mike D.,"Locust Valley, NY",151,1,0,5.0,3/19/2014,I've stopped in here for lunch and dinner a couple of times now. You're not going to find a better burger anywhere else in the city. The service was great and everyone was really friendly. Try the Bronx Burger! It'll definitely make you want to come back for more!,1,,
168,Tori M.,"Manhattan, NY",191,4,0,5.0,4/1/2014,"Amazing find in midtown; great regular lunch spot. The new upstairs is beautiful and comfy. The beer selection is great, the staff is so friendly and attentive and give great beer/ food suggestions... The Queens burger with a Boston Lager was a match made in heaven and I've also had the Cobb salad which had perfectly seasoned, tender chicken. Quick service, delicious burgers. Can't go wrong",1,,
169,Lauren G.,"Union, NJ",0,5,0,4.0,2/28/2015,"I went here with 2 of my coworkers, and they messed up all 3 of our orders (Gave us the wrong burgers), which normally would ruin my day because I get crazy about food, but we ate it anyway and it was still good.  The fries were also amazing.",,,
170,Richard G.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,12/23/2014,Waited over 45 minutes to get a turkey club stand which and a pastrami sandwich. The place was not busy and the pastrami was horrible. Don't know what this place is doing but it's certainly not how you run a business.  Stay away and find somewhere else to eat!!!,,,
171,Mark J.,"Marietta, GA",1,73,115,4.0,11/18/2014,"On a bitterly cold night in NYC, we enjoyed a really wonderful dinner starting with delicious hot cheese quesadillas. Next came unique and tasty beef burgers cooked exactly as we asked. Melted pepper jack cheese really hit the spot. Terrific thick buns and authentic sour pickles too!",,,
172,Catherine N.,"Northfield, NJ",3,44,0,2.0,9/19/2014,"The food was average, ordered two kind of burgers. French fries OK ,onion rings not so good and the service was so slow. The server had too many tables. If I didn't have a Groupon for half off I would have been extremely disappointed.",,,
173,Sophia D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/6/2014,Horrible service. Was able to set up a yelp account and write this before we even got our food. Took an hour and a half.,,,
174,Tom C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,0,4.0,8/5/2014,"It was late evening, got hungry and we were looking for a place to eat.  This eatery was at the end of our block where we were staying (Best Western Premier).  We didn't really want to walk further so we settled at this establishment.  The menu had numerous selections from salads, mexican food, meats and fish dishes.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was a bit larger portion than I expected and was tasty too.  Don't order sides like rice 'cause it's a bit pricey.  I had beer with my meal and it was great on a hot and humid evening.  The staff were friendly and service was great.  Price wise it's doable.",,,
175,C R.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,3,0,2.0,7/13/2014,"I went to this Restaurant to watch the Argentina vs Germany World Cup game. The ordering was slow, which was understandable since it's the World Cup. I ordered a Turkey Burger Deluxe and friend ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger Deluxe. It took us a while to get the menu for drinks, we received the menu in Overtime of the match. Now here's the problem, my friend ordered ice cream but was never received. When we got our bill my friend was charge for cheese on the burger but never asked for cheese. The ice cream made an appearance in the bill. My friend and I split the bill. I told the waitress, Salwa, to charge $36.58. She came back telling me my account was denied. When I went on my credit card app, I was charged $34.05. I told the waitress but she dismiss me and told me,""when it's on 'pending' it means it won't go through"". I quickly called members services of my credit card. The representative told me I was being charged twice the $34 and $36. She paid someone else's bill on my credit card. I quickly got the error corrected and was successful charge for my bill. The waitress, Salwa, didn't apologize for her error and brushed me off when I first explained her what happened. I was completely unhappy service but the food is good.",,,
