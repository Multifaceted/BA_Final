0,Taralove D.,"New York, NY",20,9,0.0,5.0,9/1/2018,"Delicious burgers New York style with one of the coolest owners around. You want a taste of the city ? Then head over to Harriets and Don will share his knowledge of the city,as he is a native New Yorker. It's mostly take out with a few small tables and chairs for quick in and out service. The sweet potato fries are also delicious as well as the pie company pies ( another NY company). It's not fancy. It's Good!",,,
1,Ben P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0.0,1.0,10/7/2018,Delivery very was a disaster. Called when the food was 15 min late. Assured it would be here in moments. I live within 6 blocks so 15 minutes is more than enough time to get here. 20 minutes later no food. Called Harriet's to cancel after my food had been traveling around NYC's streets for over 30 minutes and they asked if I would like to keep the order if it was warm?  What kind of question is that?One chance to make a first impression and they blew it.,,,
2,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",306,626,196,1.0,5/25/2018,"This place should be shut down my the health department.  I have lived in the area since 2012 and always passed by this place put off by the handwritten menus taped all over the windows, but a few Sundays ago I had a hankering for a fried chicken sandwich and thought I would give this place a whirl.  I ordered a take-out sandwich since I read on here delivery was ridiculous.  While waiting for my sandwich, this is what I witnessed:-The cashier, whom was handling money, was checking delivery orders.  She used her bare hands to move food around to make space for dressings and other condiments.-The cashier noticed a burger order was wrong (it had bacon instead of just cheese).  The cook in the back scraped off the bacon and put a new slice of cheese on it and put it back on the grill instead of making a new hamburger.-The cashier also noticed two other orders were incorrect so an argument ensued between the cook while I was standing there.  While they were arguing, the bun burned on the grill for my chicken sandwich.  The cook removed it, threw it away and places another bun on the grill bare-handed after wiping his forehead.I finally got my sandwich and was on my way.  The new bun was burned, the cheap pickles had soaked through the bottom part of the bun.  There was no sauce and the chicken was greasy.  I took one bite and threw it away as I feared getting sick b/c of food mishandling.  Plus the cook touched everything with his bare hands and I'm sure had I not been standing there, the cashier would have too.  Yeah, I'll never be back.  This place is just downright gross.  Save your money and stomach and go elsewhere.",3,,
3,Amelia L.,"Flushing, NY",20,99,2307,3.0,11/2/2017,I love the fish and chips platter from here. It comes with a great dipping sauce.  And it's really hard to find good fish and chips in the upper West side so I was happy that Harriet's kitchen offers it.  I hate that the prices here keeps going up. And if you order for delivery they add on two dollars for delivery fee.,,1,
4,Gregg S.,"New York, NY",187,7,0,1.0,3/11/2018,"Tonight was the end. For more than a decade we've ordered from Harriet's. Either directly calling or using Seamless we've ordered from Harriet's as it was a go to for fast and delicious food. Over the last year the Fried Chicken changed, not in a good way. We stopped ordering that but ordered the Chicken Pot Pies and Buffalo Wings. The service got slower and slower and the food quality has dropped. Tonight's Wings were all grease and no flavor. They were so greasy that because the delivery person had the order upside down the grease went everywhere.  The Pot Pies were different. There were not edible. The chicken was tough and nasty. The potatoes were only half cooked. The gravy that used to be a delicious chicken gravy was either tomato or beef based. This dinner from Harriet's went into the compost bin and I made omelettes instead.",2,1,
5,Eddie L.,"New York, NY",50,4,0,2.0,6/24/2018,"Our first experience ordering takeout, very much looking forward to it after walking by it so often. But was quite disappointed. The burger was amazing, the fried chicken was done in oil that was in desperate need of change, and the chicken was so dry it was literally unedible. Same goes for the mashed potatoes and gravy, I guess they forgot to put more than just an eyedrop of gravy. The kernel corn was also tough, overall highly anticipated and very disappointed much better way to spend over $60 on takeout in the neighborhood I am sorry to say",3,,

9,Colin B.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/2/2018,The best roast chicken in town. I have consistently ordered Harriet's for over a decade and always seem to be quite happy with all of the food. I'm a little confused by some of these reviews describing unfortunate experiences in regards to service. The girls on the phones are always pleasant and I usually receive my order Ina timely fashion.

12,Ethan P.,"New York, NY",15,3,0,3.0,3/6/2018,"##### UPDATE ##### : Very soon after writing this review, the owner contacted me and was very apologetic and super accommodating.  He refunded my money and was so personally affected by my negative review, it was touching. This man cares and that's really nice to experience - particularly after a bad experience.  ##############I used to love this place and ordered from here for years. Tonight I ordered $60 worth of food. An hour later I got a call that they didn't have the Chicken Tenders that they charged me for BUT they will be charging me anyway - so I might as well order some ""extra drinks or something."" This very curt junior manager sounding woman could give a shit about how ludicrous the situation was and insisted there was nothing they could do except give me extra shit I don't want. I was very unhappy to say the least but I settled on some random fried chicken dish. Shit happens but the arrogance and flippant attitude of the junior manager girl I dealt with was infuriating. Especially since I have been supporting this place regularly for over 5 years. To make it all worse - order comes after 90+ min: medium rare burger is well done. [ugh], chicken pot pie is burnt. and no extra ""chicken or whatever"" as promised. So I call again and I get a defensive cook who tells me that ""the girl left and didn't tell me where to send the chicken"". He's out of his element as a customer facing person, so that exchange was a coarse as 80 grit toilet paper. So your luck may vary,  but for me -- my beloved Harriet's has died. Maybe someone really competent quit recently...In the end I have $60 worth of mediocre food and the whole shitty experience of being jerked around for the last 2 hours.",5,,
13,Lucia B.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,2.0,8/7/2018,"OK, my husband loves fried chicken, and the few times we ordered it, it was decent.  The Southwest chili bowl ordered the other day was delicious; however, the key lime pie arrived looking like melted ice cream-- totally unappetizing.  Cobb salad was WARM!! Musclun greens (warm and wilted) rather than iceberg lettuce which would make a cobb salad crispy.  Contained 3 small grape tomatoes and about a tablespoon of diced avocado.  No chopped eggs.  Thin blue cheese dressing, rather than crumbled blue cheese.  The overly spiced/herbed chicken was cut in large strips rather than diced.  I apologize for this long rant about cobb salad, but I love a well-made cobb, and, for $14, this was a disaster.And don't get me started on the mac and cheese.  The driest I've had anywhere!  Not at all creamy.  No one would touch it.  Perhaps I could try to salvage it by reheating with a bit of milk or cream...",1,,
14,Rebekah G.,"Lincoln, NH",0,4,0,5.0,8/13/2018,"Absolutely the best fried chicken I have ever had in over 50 years in this planet! Crispy, flavorful, moist, hearty. Could not have asked for anything better. Restaurant itself is a hole in the wall (the best places in my experience), but the chicken held up in a styro container for probably half hour till we got home and ate it. Awesome for a picnic in Central Park, take home.or even scoff it down in an Uber! Oh, and it is soooo reasonably priced! Cannot go wrong with fried chicken from Harriet's!",,,
15,d e.,"Manhattan, NY",0,36,0,4.0,2/24/2018,"This is a neighborhood place for us and we have often thought of trying it, but finally we did.  The portions are very generous, the food is more than reasonable, we ate in the restaurant itself so delivery/temperature of the delivered food were not an issue.Let us say, we really wanted to love Harriet's Kitchen....Two things -- 1. the food is very salty -- the fried chicken particularly so, even if you are eating the chicken and not the breading -- and 2. it is really uncomfortable to cut chicken with plastic cutlery.  For those few who eat in, it would be so much better to have metal utensils and real plates, not the same boxes used for takeout.  We'd have taken the food home, but it was cold and rainy, and the food would have gotten cold had we carried it away.  Tables for dining in does suggest dining in, but not have to fight chicken with knives that are completely inadequate to cut it.",1,,

Updated review",The owner of Harriet's kitchen contacted me and we discussed my bad experience. He understood why it had been a bad situation and also compensated me for the meal. I'm glad that I will be able to give this restaurant another chance.,1,,
17,Ian B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",167,2,0,5.0,8/15/2018,I do actually get tired of pizza and Chinese food. It's shocking. And I'm bummed I don't live near a Harriet's Kitchen. I think about their fried chicken and the pot pies a lot. Like I've taken a train from Windsor Terrace to the upper west just to eat that pot pie in the winter. It's that good!,,,
18,Kelly E.,"New York, NY",124,399,56,2.0,11/27/2016,"You know those places you really, REALLY want to like, but then you keep leaving unsatisfied? That's Harriet's.The UWS is desperately in need of some basic comfort food (no, I don't want to wait on the ridiculous jacobs pickles line) so I really wanted Harriet's to be my default fried chicken place. Countless times I've wound up with overly dry and burned chicken ): The sides aren't any better and if you order delivery be ready to wait for over an hour and not get the right order. Pass on Harriet's if you're on the UWS - just go uptown to harlem for proper fried chicken.",2,1,1

20,Izabella G.,"New York, NY",22,100,45,2.0,5/13/2017,I wouldn't recommend it. The fried chicken had a lot of thyme and was overcooked on the outside. And the sauteed spinach was garlicky but overly salty. The corn bread was okay. Good flavor but very brittle. Key lime pie was pretty decent as well although there was zero whipped cream to cut the tartness. I will not order again.,2,1,
21,Safina B.,"New Orleans, LA",0,1,0,1.0,3/13/2018,"I would post 0 if I could. Horrible delivery service and attention to order details. Not the first time either but this time I'll share my experience. I ordered 2 soups, received one. Requested a turkey burger, no grilled onions (the texture is slimy and gross) and they didn't even try. The turkey had onions and maybe 6 fries in the container. Someone clearly dropped my order and just put in the container what they felt gathering up. I also ordered sweet potato fries but received regular fries. The one thing they got correct was the dry, flavorless chicken fingers. Called the restaurant the woman that answered said she just got in and could not help me but to contact seamless. Contacted seamless and they stated they could only refund me for the one missing soup. I spent over $50 for takeout for something I ended up throwing out completely besides the 1 soup. I'll never order from them again.",2,,
22,Toni W.,"New York, NY",0,82,1,4.0,3/27/2018,Herb roasted chicken is always cooked to perfection...juicy.  It is so delicious!  The fried chicken is not as good and has a strange burnt taste to it.  Sides are delicious.,1,,

26,Robin D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,3/15/2018,This is the best food we have eaten in New York!! We had the chicken club sandwich and my son loved the Mac and cheese.

The fried chicken is absolutely delish - the coating/seasoning is the best I've ever had, including down south. Other favorites included the chicken pot pie and the fried shrimp. The delivery was incredibly fast and the customer service couldn't have been better/nicer. We'll definitely be ordering again!",1,,

Friendly and providing service with a smile these burgers are cooked to order, fresh, juicy and served with a helping of sauteed onions, lettuce and tomato on every burger, The kids and I have been eating these delicious ""hit the spot"" burgers for the last 10 years.  If you like coleslaw there's is the perfect extra topping to make a truly awesome burger!",1,,1
30,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",1,1,0,1.0,9/11/2017,"I like the food, in general, but their delivery time is ridiculous. It can take up to an hour for your basic burger/fries. I ordered meatloaf and mashed potatoes this evening. They delivered the mashed potatoes as a side order and forgot the meatloaf. So I paid for the mashed potatoes and called while the delivery guy was still there and pointed out their error. They said they would deliver the meatloaf ASAP - with an apology. One hour later the meatloaf arrived WITH mashed potatoes, and a bill for the entire amount. I called again and waited while they discussed what I should pay. How about gratis for all their horrendous customer support. They finally arrived at a lesser a mount after some discussion. Utter BS. NEVER ORDERING FROM THEM A GAIN!!!",1,,

33,Kendall S.,"New York, NY",2,4,0,4.0,4/21/2016,"Harriet's has solid burgers and fries, which come with a delicious chipotle mayo. I live about 30 seconds away and end up ordering take out from them a lot (be advised, there is one tiny table for 2, and no other seating--this is definitely not a place for eating in), and the burger is dependably good. However, the fried chicken sandwich was really disappointing, and the chicken was incredibly over-cooked and rubbery. I've only ordered it once, so it's possible that this was an anomaly. Basically, stick to the burgers, and you'll be happy.EDIT: I've ordered the fried chicken again quite a few times, and it has been fantastic. I'm convinced that I had a singular bad experience and that it was unusual.\",,,
34,Drew V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/8/2016,Never order delivery from here! My lunch today came almost an hour later than they said it would. And on top of that my order was incorrect. I tried calling the restaurant and they barely gave me an apology and told me that they were busy. Being busy doesn't mean you have to be careless. I ordered what was supposed to be the buttermilk chicken sandwich with fries. I don't eat mayo so I requested none and it came swimming in mayo. Plus the fries were soggy and bland.,1,,
35,Melissa E.,"Manhattan, NY",191,4,0,2.0,1/24/2016,"Underwhelming. The ultimate chicken sandwich was described as ""lite"" but was primarily only fried breading with very little meat. The chicken Caesar salad tasted good, but was described as ""giant"". Based on that we planned on sharing it between a few people, but what actually came was only really enough for one person at most. Definitely overpriced for how much you get. High points: Cornbread and half chicken was good and delivery came earlier than stated.",,,
36,Heather H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,53,0,1.0,6/14/2016,"Ordered online the Kale Caesar and wings. Food came in estimated delivery window. The Kale Caesar was $8 and was a few large torn up pieces of kale with two croutons in a small 4in. by 4in. container which looked like the saddest most overpriced salad I have ever seen, and once dressed it got even smaller. The wings were fried wings with some hot sauce on the side. They tasted good once i tossed them myself, but again not worth the price. Overall I was left hungry and making myself dinner.",1,,

40,Erum R.,"New York, NY",236,320,223,5.0,5/2/2013,"Tried this neighborhood gem and was highly impressed. It's a small joint with only two small tables (if you're interested in sitting) but I definitely think this is more of a grab and go kinda place based on the flood of phone calls they received while I was waiting for my food.They advertise a burger, toppings and fries for $7.95 on a self made sign hanging outside their window but it was a bit higher, at $9.50ish. I'm not complaining considering the portion sizes they offer. I ordered my burger medium well and it came out closer to well which is fine by me. They have 3 types of cheeses if you're interested: cheddar, mozzarella or bleu. I opted for the cheddar while my fiancé tried the bleu. Right when we put in our order the guy threw two fresh patties on the grill, which already adds points in my book for freshness. We took our food to go and I was very impressed by the size of our meals. The patty was huge and reminded me of something my dad would grill on a summer day versus the skinnier patties you find at a Shake Shack or Five Guys. Also, there was barely a drop of grease on the whole thing. A lot of times I feel full to the brim post burger indulgence but this time I felt happy and satisfied :-)You can tell freshness is key at Harriet's and they make efforts to stick to ""home made"". The burger was topped with tomato, shredded lettuce and grilled onions which is a perk you usually pay extra for. The cheddar I added was great and my fiancé really enjoyed the bleu cheese.We also shared a side of fries which were delicious. Also not too greasy, they were hand cut and seasoned well. I'm a ketchup junkie and didn't feel I needed too much.Clearly I loved Harriet's and believe everyone else will, too. If you find yourself on the Upper West Side or just want to check out a local burger joint, drop by! They also offer a large menu of comfort food options (fried chicken to mashed potatoes to Italian entrees as well) so you can definitely find something to please your appetite.",2,1,

43,Steve G.,"Manhattan, NY",15,2,0,5.0,8/6/2015,"There is a sign scrawled with a magic marker on a piece of white cardboard in the window that says ""This might be the best Eff-ing burger in NYC""I took that as a challenge. The buger with caramelized onions was cooked exactly the way I asked (medium rare) and served with a chipotle aioli, fries, lettuce and tomato. Then I took a bite. Wow, I had to admit the very nervy sign was totally correct! I'm not a beginner foodie, I know most of the best places in NYC, including it's best kept secrets. Now I know one more. You would never guess from looking at this tiny place, with just 2 tables inside, that such great food could be had there.As for the service, the owner has been there almost every time I went in, and I've been lucky enough to catch him at slow times in the afternoon between lunch and dinner and we have had some really nice conversations that made the experience even nicer, and believe me, the burger all by itself is an experience not to be missed. The fries are tasty and great to dip in the chipotle aioli. If you remember, you should order them extra crispy, the way I like them. I am looking forward to trying some of the other things on the menu, especially the Manhattan clam chowder. They have lots of things that sound adventurous,  as I try them, I will write more!Now that I know what these guys are capable of,  I'm looking forward to seeing what else they've got up their sleeves!",,,

We made special requests to and they were honored properly. The burger really was the best burger I have had in a long time, and cooked just as requested.  Lemon Chicken with Linguine was great.  Chicken pot pie was pretty good. Delivery was very quick, faster than indicated (we ordered before 6pm so it was probably before the dinner rush). Only feedback for Harriet's is: when someone orders a burger and fries, you should send ketchup! There were also no utensils or napkins, which for us wasn't a problem, but definitely could be for some.",2,1,1

The salad first of all was really small and was way way way overpriced. not a meal for sure. then the chicken they delivered was too burnt to eat, and when we called the person working said ""call tomorrow and talk to owner."" No offer of bringing another one, exchanging for something else, or a refund.So my friend called the next day to talk to the owner and apparently she played phone tage with him forever..and gave up. my friend is a force to be reckoned with, she does not give up easily, especially when she feels she has been treated unfairly. The fact that she gave up means the owner did not make it easy,. So moral of my story- crappy chicken, overpriced, and then no customer service. I will pass on harriets.",4,,

Updated review","After just two weeks I have come back here three more times for this burger! I crave it now. I'll be on the subway on my way home from work and I can't get Harriet's Burgers out of my mind. It is a blessing/curse that it is basically under my apartment. The burgers are consistently good. The grilled onions that top it really make it unique and simply delicious. The spuds are cut fresh daily and never taste old or under/overcooked. You can't have a burger without them. For dinner to be a filling burger, fries and a coke and it all come under $10, you can't go wrong. If you're lucky you'll get one of two tables...or just take it to go and enjoy it at home or in the park!It doesn't matter where you are eating the burger as long as you're eating it...",,,

I wasn't charged for it, it was use never ordered. I got a call about 5 minutes later for me to repeat my credit card number. The young woman wrote my credit card number on the menu along with expiration date and security that I got delivered with my food. Not a wise move to write a customers info on a menu that a delivery boy brings you. I have had my credit card info stolen along time ago by a delivery boy that had my card info written down on the receipt. I go another call about 20 minutes after my order to give them my address again. As I said in the beginning, the food was good but the ordering system is not that great.

66,Paul K.,"Edgewater, NJ",31,6,0,3.0,7/11/2013,"This place makes great food, but the only reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars is that it all depends on who is working the grill.  There is one guy there who gets lazy at times and leaves the buns sitting out all day.  They get pretty hard a stale.  He then tries to throw them on the grill in hopes of toasting it back to freshness (doesn't work).  I once tried bringing it to his attention, and he tried to argue with me that the buns are hard because they were toasted.  But then I demonstrated to him just how hard they were by tapping on them with my finger nail.  They made a very loud sound, and he knew he was found out.  He apologized.  But it happened again just two days later.Out of 5 trips to this place during the day time, you might get 1 or 2 bad experiences.  I think they have a different guy during the evenings, and I have never gotten a bad burger then.  The Indian Grill-Guy is the better one.TIP - they use the same buns for all their sandwiches.  So if you order a sandwich, just be sure to check your food before leaving with it.  Feel the bun.",,,

The kind that makes Californians who have sworn on In-N-Out all their lives forsake their false god and worship the new delicious deity of a patty with Shack Sauce. Then take the cash you saved from Harriet's lonely, overpriced hamburger and buy fries to go with your Shack Burger which aren't soggy and gross like HK's.The ""giant"" caesar salad with chicken for $12.75 is highway robbery because it was really actually lilliputian with about 1/3 of the romaine lettuce you'd expect, out of the box croutons, and what probably amounts to a quarter of a breast of sliced chicken.My girlfriend gave their Chicken Meal a shot, but it was more adequately called a Charcoal Meal as it was burnt beyond recognition, dry like dust, and 75% inedible.",4,2,

It's not quite Paul's Place in size, but in flavor, it sits up there with some of the best. It's a really dingy looking place. You could easily pass it walking on the street and never think twice. It looks like a rundown ghetto Chinese food restaurant from the outside. Un-befitting of the quality food inside. lol. But you know what, it's kind of adds to the charm.

The fish was fried in perhaps the most perfectly constructed batter I could ever ask for.  Excellently crispy, not greasy, dark brown goodness.2. The tartar sauce was clearly homemade and somehow tasted both lighter and creamier than most tartar sauce I have had.  How is that possible?  Don't ask me... ask Harriet.3. While waiting for my food I was able to eavesdrop on the cashiers, who were exchanging funny stories about people who call in orders (like the woman who ordered fish and chips but asked for no coleslaw on the side because she's watching her weight... hmmmmm).I image that if I ate burgers I would believe the sign that says that they have maybe, just maybe, the best effing burger in all of New York.  Wouldn't put it past them!",1,,

You get what you pay for- the food is not great. I've regretted it every time I ordered, except for once when I had been drinking down the street and was in desperate need of mozzarella sticks. Theirs are pretty good. The fries are not.The chicken fingers are EXTREMELY dry- impossible to eat without sauce. Unfortunately, the honey mustard sauce they give you is disgusting- it's literally a cup of honey with some mustard thrown in and mixed around. Way too sweet and gelatinous. They don't give any extras like ketchup packets or salt and pepper, so you're stuck with what you ordered. The chicken sandwich surprised me by being an actual grilled chicken breast covered in mayo- no breading to speak of. If you're going to slather a piece of chicken in mayo, you need to get some sort of crunch going on to balance it out... otherwise the consistency is just... gross.

When I didn't understand this (there was a language barrier w/ the phone guy & my paper menu listed the same prices as Seamless, while the restaurant's web-menu lists even cheaper prices than that), I asked to speak to the manager but was told there was ""no manager.""  After 3 more calls, they said the owner would call. 45 minutes after placing my order, my phone rings: ""Hello,"" I answer. A loud gruff voice barks back, ""This is Don. Who is this?!"" Not expecting such a call, I ask, ""I'm sorry? You called me."" With the grace of an irate baseball manager, Don demands, ""I told you my name. Now you tell me yours!"" I timidly oblige. Don then abruptly tells me he owns Harriet's & adds a volatile, ""What's your problem?!"" I hesitantly manage to say, ""Well...first, your tone."" At this point Don goes berserk, ""I don't give a [BLEEP]!"" There wasn't much productive conversation after that, mostly just Don shouting obscenities & insults. However, during Don's verbal assault I did learn of the price changes; for as Don explained it, ""I can raise my prices whenever the [BLEEP] I want, & I don't give a [BLEEP] what Seamless or your menu or online says!"" If I'm judging the food apart from the atrocious service, the burger's pretty good; but not much else is, especially not the mozzarella sticks which taste like bad frozen food. Portions are quite small. Plus, since prices are higher than as listed on their website, on Seamless, and on the actual paper menu, if you order delivery online you will get a call asking you to pay more in cash to the delivery guy.

Harriet's have something green in them, chives maybe, but are still darn good and the gravy is the best. Can't imagine better in a take out/delivery cafe. Okay, sometimes the chicken is a bit dry but I think that may be because I order the grilled skinless chicken. Feel that I get a healthful meal, always well prepared and at a good value. What's not to like?Yes, Harriet just might make the best take out chicken on the Upper West Side. Kudos.",,,

109,Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",440,973,42,1.0,9/18/2010,"I used to order from these guys a lot.  I kept giving them chances because I had a good experience the first time I went there.  I eventually realized that the good experience at Harriet's Kitchen was a rare, unique event; like finding a toad with 3 eyes or something.  The vast majority of the time, you'll likely be disappointed.  The most troubling thing about this place by far is the people that work there.  Not only are they extremely rude, but completely incompetent too.  I can't even remember how many times I've had to send back an order because they couldn't get it right.  It's always missing something; usually something that you emphasized on the phone that you NEEDED in the bag like napkins, honey mustard, silverware, or even side dishes.  The guy who answers the phone doesn't speak English nor Spanish.  I don't know what he speaks.  He doesn't understand anything I've ever tried to say to him; and I'm pretty mellifluous.  One time in particular that ticked me off was when I ordered chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce.  They brought the chicken fingers with no honey mustard.  I called to ask for my honey mustard.  It took them 20 minutes to bring the honey mustard 4 blocks.  My chicken fingers were cold and nasty by the time they came and the shady criminals absolutely refused to refund my order or get me a new order of chicken fingers.  Another time, we ordered for delivery 45 minutes before close and they just decided to NEVER come.  We waited for an hour and 45 minutes starving for our food before we came to the conclusion that Harriet's just ditched us.  We weren't that surprised, Harriet's has done a lot to screw us over in the past and that was the last straw.  The food isn't even that good.  The 1st bacon cheeseburger I ever had there was delicious and ever since I was trying to repeat that experience, but was disappointed every time.  The burgers now always either seem to be cooked all wrong or they have crunchy bits and parts around the patty. Plenty of other places in the neighborhood have better burgers and food in general.  This place doesn't deserve anyone's patronage, these are people whose moral fiber is so thin that they're willing to ditch people on delivery and not correct their mistakes when they make them.  To me, that's enough reason to put this restaurant on my banned list forever.  I just don't want anyone else wasting their money there because that's what happened to me several times.",1,2,

Chicken meals make great cheap dinners.  The chicken pot pie is good too (I'm not a chicken pot pie kind of person, though, so I'm mostly relying on my friend's opinion -- I had a taste, smiled, and gave a thumbs up).NOT SO GOOD:Don't get the pulled pork sandwich.  The sauce is bland as bland can get.  Somehow it's dry, too.  I relied entirely on the oddly sweet slaw that they put on the sandwich to make it through.Be careful about anything that requires a side sauce or topping sauce, because they often forget.  Want BBQ sauce on your chicken sandwich?  Want honey mustard sauce with those chicken tenders?  Check your bag before you walk away (or before the delivery person walks away).""JUST OK"":Fish n' chips are fine, when you feel like fish n' chips.  Nothing to write home about.  Not dry or anything, so nothing to complain about either.For sides, I stick with garlic spinach, fries, and mashed potatoes.  The slaw is OK on its own.  Have not tried the rice pilaf or baked beans, and do NOT recommend the mac n' cheese.",,,

I was surprised when we got there, since it's so small and dingy looking and I didn't know such a place could provide tasty food, but woo! it did! I love when the dingy places turn out good food. We got one of the two tables, ordered burgers and fries (and I had a stewarts soda as well), order arrived prompt, service was super nice, food was hot, fries salty and awesome. Yeah the burgers are greasy... but that's what makes a good burger! It was fantastic. Not the best burger, but most burgers satisfy me to the utmost  just by being burgers.
