There are, unsurprisingly, monkeys painted all over the walls.  There was a small, old-school TV on the wall by the bar playing a black and white movie.  The lighting was dim.  It had a relaxing feel.  Service was friendly and efficient and the cocktail I had was tasty.  Highly recommended for a low key drink setting.",1,,1

It was over seasoned with Chile pepper, used cream and regular bacon.  Really sad. Portion sucked to $24 too. Should have gone to McDonald's as I would know what to expect.Not repeating dining here. Maybe drinks. Good wait staff though, but the kitchen needs attention.",,,
2,Saddmun A.,"New York, NY",268,123,22,3.0,8/26/2018,"This place was okay. Company was good, but the food overall was unimpressive.  I came here after work with some friends for a ""power lunch."" The ambiance is very old school (think a place where 80's bankers would hang out). The service however was very pleasant and the dining experience overall was nice.  The food however was overpriced. I ordered the tomato soup as a starter which was nice, and the fish course which tasted good. But definitely not worth the price. Overall, I've had better food at other places but it's pretty conveniently located near where I work.",,,

I have had slices of baloney thicker than that. We ordered cocktails and our appetizers came and as our minuscule entree came we had to flag our waiter down for said cocktails. Dessert does NOT include coffee/tea. Hostess walks around asking tables how everything is. Very robotic. When we told her that we were very unhappy she blinked, and said ""Oh..."" and walked away with her hands in that supplicant pose and just continued on to the other tables asking ""How is everything?"" She isn't programed for complaints. Bravo! You had us in and out in 45 minutes. Phooey on you . Never again! How dare you! HOW DARE YOU!!! $130.00 for the ""bum's rush! So angry!!!!",,1,

The food was so-so anyways. And the help on the side by the other waitstaff? Pathetic. We waited over 40 min from when we were finished with our main course for dessert & I spoke up about that, stating the obvious. I would not come back here to eat per the poor service & the so-so food. But the cocktails were on point. I would only come back for those & nothing else.",1,4,1

9,Joseph P.,"New York, NY",29,397,458,4.0,8/4/2017,"I love Monkey Bar. Through the years, it's a reliable gathering place and standby in midtown. Wonderful for drinks, burgers and cocktails with an upscale ambiance and smart, put-together professional crowd that shows up after office hours and stays a few hours. Always mobbed for happy hour, the dinner crowd is split between the casual Monkey Bar, (if you can land a table or booth) while some spill into the adjoining dining room of the Hotel Elysee.   The ambiance here is reminiscent of Bemmelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel, only more casual. The artwork on the walls is similar a only with a monkey/ exotic animal theme. The music is light and jazzy -- all of which adds up to a casual sophistication that's becoming harder and harder to find today. Ladies who frequent here get a VIP card offering 50% off drinks.",1,,2

The restaurant is very cute - all dim lighting and lots of finance heavy people were in the restaurant (which makes sense given its location). We ordered a glass of pinot and a glass of cabernet. The wines were $20-$22 per glass which is pretty expensive, but the more disappointing part was that my drink (the pinot noir) was old and too aerated. There was a copper taste to my drink.We ordered the special braised octopus to start. The sauce was decent but the whole appetizer was very sub par. The octopus did not taste fresh. As entrees, I ordered the NY strip and my friend ordered a filet fish. The NY strip was one of the worst steaks I've had. The rare I requested came out to be medium rare, and the steak itself was stiff and awful. The entire meal came out to be near $200. I'm fine paying high prices, but given how low quality the food was, I would not advise coming here.",4,1,1

Bad service. Ordered a martini with olives which was fine (brought the drink without the olives though). Ordered chips with dip which didn't come out with our drinks. Waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Very busy place, with very small menu. Not a fan. Won't come back.",1,,

Updated review","I came here for lunch with colleagues this week.  I haven't been here in years.  It still has that clubby, old school feel while not being stuffy and weird. I had the chicken paillard. Not a fussy dish - flattened chicken with arugula, roasted tomatoes and what seemed to be caramelized onions.  This dish can often be sabotaged by chicken that has been overcooked, pre-cooked in bulk and heated up, lousy greens, etc.  However, everything was very good.  The chicken was tender and the greens were fresh.  All very tasty. The service was very good and we were well taken care of.  What I like most about this place is the décor and ambience.  It has an old school, clubby feel, while still being modern.  I am looking forward to my next visit.",4,1,1

22,Courtney D.,"New York, NY",641,88,519,4.0,4/29/2016,"*This review is for a post-dinner cocktail and app*Who: The Monkey Bar is a 'safe space' for New York elites to get trashed. The bar area is filled with wealthiest of NYC's silver foxes blowing off steam after a stressful dinner at 'The Palm' or 'Maloney & Porcelli'. What: The Monkey Bar is an establishment full of history. The decor of the venue is a cross between timeless class and a tropical vacation. The Howard's from Gilligan's Island would enjoy themselves quite a bit here. The Monkey Bar's signature cocktails all play into a tropical monkey theme with 'charming' names such as ""Monkey Gland"". They have standard high-end cocktail prices with beautiful presentation. In addition, I ordered the tuna tartare which came out quickly and was excellent.Where: Midtown EastWhen: If you're looking to people watch, I recommend coming on a late-night weekday.

But why do they keep messing with the bar menu? It was a big disappointment when they took the sliders, pigs in blankets, and the truffle popcorn off of the bar menu, but the sausage rolls were a tasty substitute. Now those are gone, too. Why can't they have decent bar snacks? Yes, it is an upscale place. Appropriate bar snacks (emphasis on bar) and upscale are not mutually exclusive",,,

29,Kris B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,0,1.0,8/13/2018,"I just had a miserable experience with The Monkey Bar's ""Restaurant Week"" offerings. I am not a novice to Manhattan's Restaurant Week -- I am well aware that the menu is extremely limited and the portions are smaller than usual. However, there is ""small"" and there is ""insulting,"" and tonight's offerings left my husband and I stupefied. We ordered the Roasted NY Strip Loin and Grilled Chicken Paillard. The meals should have been served with a magnifying glass. I have ordered cold cuts from a deli that were thicker than these cuts of meat. When the waiter put the plates down, I just about looked around for the hidden cameras -- I figured it could not be possible that this was what they called dinner. The chefs must roar with laughter as they assemble these ""dishes"" for the Restaurant Week suckers. What an insult to their customers! It would be better to not participate in Restaurant Week at all than to serve these meager, pathetic portions -- which still cost $42 per person (drinks separate and coffee not included). The purpose of Restaurant Week should be to introduce your restaurant to people who are not regular patrons, and to hopefully entice them to return. We left the restaurant feeling taken advantage of and slapped in the face... and although we have been semi-regular patrons in the past, will likely not return after tonight's fiasco.",1,,
30,Ryan K.,"Cranford, NJ",78,192,0,4.0,11/30/2016,"Food: very good. I attended with five guests for lunch. The butternut squash soup was the most popular appetizer, but i had the tuna tartar. Everyone really liked their soup, but I noticed it was a cream base so you health conscious folks should stay away. The tuna was awesome. I can't say this dish is a usual for me, but I would definitely get it again. Nicely seasoned and served with a type of wasabi sauce and crispy chips. Entrees included salads, chicken paillard and my crab cake sandwich. The crab cake was very nice with little filler. A slightly spicy sauce and large green salad on the side.Service: attentive, polite, cleanAtmosphere: cool, clean, fancy yet comfortable, murals on the walls, white table cloth, inviting, busyMisc: not cheap, but good business space",,,

Monkey Bar definitely has a cool, mature vibe. I especially enjoyed the live pianist. However....we basically had zero service all night. Our waiter actually forgot our food for almost an hour. Then we had to get someone else's attention to get the check. So, if you go, I would recommend NOT sitting at the high tables near the bar, because they're staffed by the one bartender and I think it's just too much for one person. Antisocial crowd. Cocktails very expensive. Probably wouldn't go back.",1,1,
32,Sarah A.,"Temecula, CA",1,29,18,2.0,12/2/2016,"Had drinks and food at the bar, have not eaten in the restaurant. I'm basing this review on 2 things: 1. Service It wasn't that busy but there was only 1 server for the whole bar area. I didn't get a warm inviting vibe from our server. He was very young and maybe tired but when I asked for his recommendation or a question he sighed and gave a short answer like I was bothering him. I ordered their signature drink and some oysters. The menu said the oysters came in the 1/2 dozen so I asked for 1 order. A cook came out with only 1 oyster. I was confused and said I thought I was getting 6. He takes it back and tells our server. The poor cook. The server chewed him out loud enough for everyone to hear. The server said ""I asked her two times how many she wanted and this is what she said!"" Wow man it's not a big deal. When the server walked by I tried to joke with him, I even apologized for the confusion and he just looked at me and walked away. Not cool. 2. FoodI eventually did get the oysters and they were wonderful. I ordered another appetizer and it was ok. Someone else got the burger and that was awesome. The drinks were good too. But because of the moody bar server I have no intention of going back any time soon.",3,1,2
33,Zachary A.,"Austin, TX",98,1004,0,3.0,1/2/2016,"When you walk into SLS, the first thing you notice is this weird bar with portraits of monkeys across from check-in.  You walk into the casino and notice the dealers wearing vests with monkeys on the back.  So the intrigue brought me back to try a drink at the Monkey Bar.They give you some complimentary spicy popcorn which hit the spot.  They have a few specialty mix drinks but nothing huge.  The bar area is pretty small and they somehow can fit in a live music act (I believe on fridays and saturdays) and shove him into the corner of the bar.  We came on a friday and the live act was good, but the lobby music was still playing - fairly loudly - so we couldn't hear the act clearly.  Nothing too classy or intimate about this bar and the drinks are nothing special.  You can come here but it not a must try.",2,,

If I were paying myself I would rate it a 3 star max as the prices are way over the top but I was being treated by my handsome date who could very easily afford it all so price is not being taken as a factor. Food was not to die for, nothing outstanding but good to pretty good..I had a lobster bisque for a starter which was 3.5 star, halibut which was a bit dry, scallops way too mushy, overcooked, only 3 star and the desert which I picked berry tart and tasted my date""s chocolate mousse respectively 2 and 3.5 star.

I finally got a chance to go last night with a good friend, and overall it was a great experience.The decor is cool. There are monkey murals all over the place, old fashioned red and white checked tablecloths to give it a kitschy feel, and lots of beautiful dark wood that reminds you you're in a NYC power restaurant. The servers are very nice. The bartenders took care of me while I waiting for my friend. I had a champagne cobbler (a little on the sweet side), and the seasonal Red Delicious, which actually turned out to be much better than I thought, given it's made with cachaca (not my favorite.)Where I have to take stars off is the food itself. The ""bread basket"" consists of hot delicious rolls that were maybe one of the highlights of the meal. I had the clams casino for a starter, and they were fine. Not great. They didn't taste super fresh and there were too many dry breadcrumbs in the stuffing part. I had the smokey spaghetti for a main course, and it was lacking in flavor. The small shrimp and scallops were cooked well, and the spaghetti did have a smokey flavor, but I felt like it should be a bold, zesty flavor, not a sweet, watered down flavor. All in all not the best meal.Dessert was the cookie plate to share--again, nothing to write home about. Cookies were warm but dried out. One of them, the chocolate one, was too dry to eat on its own. Maybe would've been better with coffee.I'm very glad to have tried this place. I'd love to go back to the bar and hang out, as it had a fun, welcoming vibe.

41,Pereless A.,"Forest Hills, NY",425,10,0,1.0,1/12/2016,"It brings be to great sadness to have to write such a despicable review. For years my father has held meetings and dinners at this establishment. My friends and clients have dined here. I ""thought"" it was the perfect nook for my partner and I to experience after seeing the Rockefeller Christmas Tree. Boy, was I wrong and should have trusted my instinct. When we arrived to The Monkey Bar we felt we were in the perfect place. The ambiance was rich with Christmas decorations that blended into it's beautiful decor. Our table for 2 was perfectly set in a corner booth in the main dining room. The table was even available upon our arrival time from booking with our Opentable Account. Unfortunately, this was the only exciting part of our experience. Everything went downhill from that moment. I understand we looked similar to tourist that evening. Due to our site seeing holiday preferences. The insulting part is to be treated as foreigners. We had to hale a bus boy for service after waiting 13.5 minutes for a hot tea. This is because we received no introduction from the waitress nor wine sommelier. When the waitress did finally come to our table. We received no apology nor name introduction. I still don't know her name, but she was petite, with slicked back blonde hair, and blue eyes. She was extremely rude in her demeanor, not attentive, and short with her words. Even after her introduction, I was put in the situation to ask for the tea again. (It's been now 22 minutes now and very uncomfortable.) The whole experience was far from enjoyable. The list goes on with even dining forks missing when entrees were served, and having to wait....and so on! I do not need to explain any further we catch the drift. We may not be regulars, but for 2 people we gladly enjoy a substantial dinner of quality and substance. This is not what we received. It was disappointing and I reached out to the restaurant the next day to give feedback, and no one has contacted me. I do not understand where the miscommunication is, but for a restaurant of it's age and caliber it's expected to be fixed. I will gladly update my review with better feedback and positive comments.

Anyway, I definitely could have sucked down more than one of those but managed to muster enough self-control to stop after just one. The cocktail was comprised of jasmine tea infused vodka, peach and lime. Yum! The fries are decent if you're wanting a greasy snack, and the simple green salad is also decent if you're needing something a little lighter and healthier. The cheese plate is also a good choice, although I would pass on the arancini. The fried risotto balls served with a bit of tomato sauce missed the mark a bit in the flavor and texture department.

The wine sommelier knew her stuff and recommended an excellent bottle of Italian wine.  The wine list was definitely on the pricer end --but there were still a few gems in there.  The wait staff was impeccable --they were constantly refilling water --food was servered all at the same time.  The waiter could describe every ingredient in every crazy dish.  Food: Apps: Yellowfin Tuna --this was amazing, but very very tiny --we wanted like 4 more portions of it. Main: 2 of us had the Halibut, 1 the duck The duck --was good but overcooked.  He ordered it medium.  The Halibut was cooked perfectly, nice crispy skin and perfect on the inside --the peas were so tasty --yum yum yum. Side: Shishito Peppers --so tasty, sad I didn't get the spicy one. Atmosphere: Very cute speak easy, beautiful artwork all around the walls.  I took several pictures and they didn't go crazy --so not sure if they were just tired or they don't care.  Check out their website for awesome pictures.  Very old school feeling.  Great to take your older folks, your colleagues, or like several tables your escorts.",1,,
47,Laura L.,"Westminster, CA",470,109,4,5.0,3/17/2017,"Came here last night for dinner and I was so thrilled to have been treated here by my boyfriend! We had the Wedge Salad (split for us by the kitchen), Branzino (European Sea Bass), Smoked Spaghetti, and Sticky Toffee Pudding.The Wedge Salad was so delicious. The tomatoes were so sweet and juicy, and the Greek goddess dressing was DIVINE. I could eat that dressing every day! The Branzino was perfectly cooked, with the skin crispy and the meat flaky and pure white. The spinach it came with was not overcooked (thank goodness), and the sauce was a perfect compliment for the entire dish. The Smoked Spaghetti, per our server's recommendation, was AMAZING. I usually order better dishes than my boyfriend, but this time, he took the cake (but it's not really fair since the waiter highly recommended this dish). The pasta was so delicious and wonderfully cooked, with a slight bite. The shrimp and scallops were fresh and flavorful, and the sauce was amazing. But I need to talk about the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I could die happy if I had that for a last meal. Our server was AMAZINGLY accommodating, and after mentioning that we had a show to go to, he made sure to have it out and ready for us within minutes of ordering it. It was hot and fresh, and so perfectly baked that I couldn't believe it didn't come directly from heaven. I have made numerous sticky toffee pudding recipes, and (pun intended) this takes the cake. Wow. The molasses and dates were perfectly balanced throughout the recipe, and the sticky toffee was not overly sweet but gently soaked the cake and made it just that much more divine. The ice cream that came with it just really took it to the next level.But hats off to the wonderful, knowledgeable, patient and efficient server that we had. I didn't catch his name, but I do hope to have him during our next visit. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends during their visit here.",,,

51,Joan H.,"New York, NY",208,484,3,1.0,8/14/2015,"I came for RW.  Granted, that is probably not the best indicator - but unlike some other fine spots that WILL serve food from their regular menu on their RW menu, Monkey Bar did not. Furthermore, they will be extremely particular about absolutely no substitutions to this menu (I happen to come when I'm doing a pretty hard sugar detox diet).The food was mediocre at best. The appetizer - a simple raw crudo, was actually very nice, except there was what looked to be a dairy based sauce on the plate (that I was able to avoid), though the waitress promised the sauce was a just a simple oil and vinegar.  It really annoyed me that she did not get that right after I explained my strict diet.  Her response, when she asked how everything was later on, was to basically ask if I were allergic.  It really matters not if a customer is allergic to something or not.  If a customer does NOT want something, she should NOT have to tolerate it! I did not appreciate that attitude. For the main, the only option I could get was the chicken breast on what was supposed to be spinach - but was so brown, tough and salty, it might have been kale.  The chicken was dry and salty, but substantial.  I did get a bit extra spinach, since I could not have the faro it came with. I had to skip dessert.  At another RW spot, I was able to substitute that for an extra side dish, but not here - that's just blasphemy!Service, needless to say, was extremely subpar for the establishment.  When me and the first of 5 guests arrived, the waitress seemed anxious to serve and checked in on us three times.  Once our friends arrived, however, service became very slow.  Finally, as suggested above, I did not like the attitude.The setting is cool and feels fun.  Too bad the unhappy server doesn't let you enjoy it.  Of course, coulda been a fluke day for her.Prices on the regular menu are just laughable considering how poor the food was off the RW menu.  I should think RW is a chance to entice customers to come back.  It did the entire opposite for me.",7,4,1
52,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",102,439,0,4.0,9/18/2014,"Hadn't heard much about Monkey Bar until I made a reservation and told friends I was going - then all of a sudden I didn't stop hearing about it! It's surprisingly difficult to spot easily on 54th Street. The front bar area is cute and seems like it would be fun for a date. You go toward the back and down some stairs to the main dining room, which feels very old New York. There are wide booths, murals on the walls, and another bar in the back corner.The service is thoughtful, if a bit slow. Our waiter made great recommendations. We started with octopus, the saffron risotto, and the heirloom tomato salad. The octopus and risotto were great; the heirloom tomato salad was fine, but the ""homemade"" mozzarella cheese was a bit of a disappointment.For entrees we had the duck, the roasted chicken, and the lamb. I loved the kale cannelloni that came with the lamb. The duck looked delicious. I tasted the chicken and it was perfectly cooked and quite moist - not at all dry or bland.We didn't order dessert, but our waiter brought us this small bowl of mint chocolate malt balls, which were phenomenal. I ate most of them. I would definitely come back, but it's not cheap!",2,,

Hm.. all I can remember is that it was some type of pasta and that I when asked the waiter how large the portions are for a ""small"" and he said ""it's definitely not enough."" So why would you even have that as an option for customers for dinner?? Then when the ""large"" came, it's what I would have described as ""small.""

63,Betty Ming L.,"Westchester County, NY",60,357,42,3.0,8/4/2013,"Love the monkey wallpaper and monkey lamps. The clubby, exclusive ambiance is everything I would've expected from a place owned by Vanity Fair magazine editor Graydon Carter. The prices are beyond my wallet but I was only there for drinks and a snack with a friend who picked up the tab -- the only way this place is manageable on a budget. We stayed clear of the pretty dining room, which serves $19 chopped salads and $29 chicken entrees. Instead, we had a table in the bar area, which is right there when you walk in the door. Cocktails and wines by the glass are in the $17-$18 range, and go much, much higher. There's an 18-page booze menu on the restaurant's website.I remember the initial reviews for the food as being mixed. In my humble opinion, that's still the case, at least for the bar menu. Save your money and avoid the threesome of meatloaf sliders named for the late, great writer Nora Ephron. Like her last  work, the Broadway show ""Lucky Guy,"" these sliders are mostly overbaked, over-seasoned and not very filling unless you like crusty, dry buns. The fried corn fritters were crispy but not distinctive in any way. You'd think we couldn't go wrong with the cheese plate. And yes, it was okay -- although the thin slices of dried kiwi fruit and strawberry that came with it were chewy and strange. But food is not the focus at Monkey Bar. If you want to hang out with the city's media power crowd, stop by for a week night, after-work $27 glass of champagne. While we were there, we spotted New York Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger with columnist Maureen Dowd.",2,3,

Whatever your reservation time is,  the staff seems overwhelmed by managing an empty dining room.  Apparently the simple process of checking your reservation, gathering menus and leading you to your table (again in an empty dining room) is logistically impossible.  Perhaps in the super-heated NYC restaurant world, this is a new tactic to endear patrons to your establishment.  The dining room itself is lovely.  Our waiter was a professional. The famed bread - absolutely stone cold and awful.   An embarrassment.  My Woodford Reserve Bourbon pour was 1/2 a finger at 1/2 the bottle price - ouch.

When I was getting near finishing mine, I noticed that I was starting to find grit in my mouth. After a couple more bites to be sure, I turned to my colleague to tell her. She replied that she was experiencing the same thing. So we called the bartender over to tell him what we were experiencing, and actually showed him some clear evidence of grit on the sides and bottom of our salad bowls. I said that I was pretty sure it was dirt that probably came from lettuce that was not sufficiently washed. After studying the evidence for a bit, he said he would show the chef. A few minutes later he returned to say that they would comp our glasses of wine! No apology, no offer to make us new salads, plus the wine cost half of what the salads did. This was a totally unacceptable response to serving us a spoiled dish. We'll not just think twice about coming here again, we won't come at all.

When we told her we had a reservation at 5:30,  she told us the dining room was not ready yet.....huh?We were seated about 10 minutes later and our waiter came over - he was very friendly and personable. The atmosphere was classic old New York and absolutely charming, perfect for a romantic date with your significant other.We ordered drinks (which were just okay and a little pricey, but this is NYC) and when he returned with them we ordered our dinners: 1 steak tartar with fries, 2 butternut ravioli with chopped macadamias, brown butter sauce with truffle oil and foie gras and 1 smoked pasta. After ordering our waiter returned with a plate of rather cold rolls.Our food all came out simultaneously and was nice and hot. The portions were not large (which was just fine with me), and every single bite of the tartar and fries and ravioli were yummy, but the smoked spaghetti did not have the scallops it boasted in the description and had microscopically small shrimp (which really disappointed my husband). Overall we agreed that we would definitely return.

We were sipping wine and sitting in the corner, minding our own business, only to suddenly be informed by our snoot of a waiter that we had been collectively cut off. Appealing to the manager, we wondered, had we been rude?  No. Were we being disruptive? No.  Ok, so you are closing early? No. Well, no one is driving home, plus we are all adults and are capable of drinking responsibly, so what's the problem?  No explanation was given.

We made a reservation for a Saturday to celebrate our Mother's birthday. The restaurant was aware of the occasion when we made the reservation. She is an elegant senior citizen who loves the hustle and bustle of Manhattan and is remarkable for her age. Well we arrived only to find the main dining room closed. The manager claimed he had tried to call all week and inform us there would only be dining in the bar. Well I have an office, a receptionist and voice mail-no such message was ever left. Although we'd made the reservation on Open Table no one tried to contact us by the new revolutionary form of communication called e-mail either. The manager claimed the restaurant did not have my address. This was bad enough for a restaurant that puts on airs requiring a credit card for reservations of five or more and charges you if you don't show up. Worse, though there were five of us the retaurant tried to seat us at a table for four at the front of the bar with one seat protruding into the doorway's entrance. But that wasn't luxuriant enough-the table was so rickety that a waiter and bus boy could not stabilize it. So we left having enjoyed some terrific new york tap water on a stifling hot night. But all's well that ends well.. Parents, children and grandchildren trundled four blocks south in the delightfully humid dusk and enjoyed a wonderful birthday meal at Maloney & Porcelli which I highly recommend if the thought of going to the Monkey Bar ever crosses your mind. By the way I suppose I should mention that at least the Manager offered us a free drink when we arrived because of the snafu but I can't because he didn't.  Well the water was great!

The decor is charming and it has very nice lighting. Very romantic atmosphere! It looks small in the front but it has a large back room. I sat there at a large table with a friend. It was very comfortable. For restaurant week they had a prix fixe menu with a choice of 3 apps, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts. I had the cold gazpacho soup with shrimp and avocado. It was amazing!!! Very flavorful; nice texture and I loved the shrimp in it. They also brought delicious bread, which was a nice touch. For the entree I had sea bass served over polenta with tomatoes. It was extremely tasty with a great blend of flavors. It was the perfect size and presented beautifully. Finally, for the dessert I had the blueberry cheesecake. So yummy!!!! I left feeling very satisfied. The service was great as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend this for restaurant week. I also plan on going another time even after the deal is over. Try it!!! ;)",1,,

Let me start by saying that if you have a large group, and you're not planning to have dinner (or arrive when the dining room isn't open), go somewhere else. We waited for someone to help pull chairs over to the corner table, but ended up doing it ourselves. So we settled into close quarters as the bar started to fill up.Ordered the cheese plate, french fries and something that was kind of like a potato fritter - they were ok. The drinks, however, were nice and strong. Our server wasn't super attentive, but I guess you can chalk it up to a busy bar. It was ok.",,,2

The monkey bar is a great place to come with family, friends and colleagues and to relaxed after a busy week. The service is spectacular, not too much, the right level of attention, you could become quickly addicted to such a service.  Yesterday I went there with my wife to do a recap of our busy week. she asked for a grilled salmon, and me for a medium rare burger. Everything went well. Our drinks were perfect, I would recommend the seasonal cocktail ""harvest punch"" ($18), not too strong. If you like dessert, they let you create you own ice cream specialty using house made ice cream . I ended up with scoops of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, pecan nuts, hot fudge and whipped cream and banana slices....still looking to give a name to this sugar bomb dessert.The room and the paintings are splendid, love the booths.

Our waiter definitely took care of us and made sure he went over all of the good stuff on the menu. I had a chance to check out the menu before I went so I already had my eye on the Scottish Salmon. It was really good and came with fingerling potatoes and a little spinach. Very delicious! My appetizer was the Grilled Market Vegetables which were grilled and seasoned to perfection (asparagus, broccoli and carrots included). We were so stuffed that there was no room for dessert...maybe next time.The drinks were definitely on point. One of their popular drinks is the monkey-tini, but they were out of it so I went for the next best thing....some gin drink (cant remember the name) that was off the charts taste-wise. It went down so fast taht I had to knock down another one. Definitely a good place to try if you are in Midtown Manhattan. A little pricey, but still worth the try.

106,Aaron A.,"New York, NY",0,24,0,3.0,1/18/2014,"If I were rating the restaurant based off the experience I would've given it a five. However, the food is pretty important when rating a restaurant, and unfortunately, brought the rating down to a three. The restaurant is very cool, you walk into a small and crowded bar area that feels as if it were once a speak easy (i've heard that it actually was back in the day). In the rear is the main dining room. The wallpaper gives off a somewhat cheesy vibe similar to that of The Palm, but the ambience is nice. Comfortable seating and not too loud. I started with the wedge salad. It was great. A fresh ball of lettuce with creamy dressing and large chunks of fatty and perfectly cooked bacon. Off to a good start in my book...For my main course I ordered the Dry-Aged Bone In Rib-Eye ($55). My first complaint was that it came with a side salad of mixed greens. It was an eye-sore and I wasn't interested in eating a side salad with my steak, especially after just ordering the wedge salad. SIdenote: the NY Strip Steak came with fries on the side, which I thought should've been applied to the RIb-Eye as well. Enough about the side salad though. The steak was average at best. It came out warm, not hot, and while it was cooked to my liking (medium rare) it was very tough, and lacked the juiciness a top notch steak should provide. I hear the burger is great and was upset I didn't order it. The dessert was probably the best part of the meal. I ordered the Beignets and the Bosc Pear Cobbler. Both were great, but the Beignets were really special. Tender, doughy, with delicious side sauces of strawberry preserves and vanilla custard. A must order if going to Monkey Bar. Overall, very nice atmosphere and the service was exceptional. The food, however, was mediocre at best. Good place to come on business.",1,1,

109,Thom H.,"Syosset, NY",162,525,164,4.0,3/24/2012,"First of all - Lama, please update your review with a huge ""CAVEAT: VALENTINE'S DAY REVIEW"" on it.People - Do. Not. Eat. At. Restaurants. On. Valentine's. Day.It will make you hate your favorite restaurant, let alone one you don't know.OK.Saturday night, 8 pm reservation, seated immediately in a booth. First time here.Food menu had a good selection, typical ""New American"" without any oddballs or Asian Fusion. Cocktail menu looked terrific. Over the course of the meal, I had the Monkey Gland (unique and delicious), and the Pep Talk (good, but settles, so bitter at the end). We did not have wine, and so can't comment on the wine service.Speaking of service, the timing of the kitchen was okay ... the appetizers took a while, and when my oysters came out, I wasn't told which oysters were which - a peeve of mine. But the waiter came by shortly after, and after noting that the oysters were plated randomly, could point out which oysters were which on sight. That sounds unimpressive, but if you saw the oysters, you'd be impressed, too.Another note about unusual staff knowledge - when my lamb came out (perfectly cooked), I quickly asked the plate runner where on my plate the stinging nettles were (always wanted to try those!) He was able to describe to me how they were prepared and plated, as if he were our waiter. Nice touch.Food was delicious, though the mushrooms that came with my rack of lamb were oversalted. Wife's chicken was quite good, with a nice broth. Dessert was very nice, especially my wife's rhubarb parfait.Decor is classic - the murals in the bar area are original, which is authenticity that is hard to find these days. That's a short summary, but it's the decor that really sets this place apart.The pricing knocks my rating down a star, and almost two stars. Ouch. I guess that Mr. Carter has opened the reservation list to the masses, so long as they have the money to be there ... but having dined at Quality Meats the weekend before, at similar pricing, I would come back to Monkey Bar before QM.",,,

You'd think with such delightful name, you'd get a great mischievous dinner experience but alas this place is your standard hotel restaurant. The walls are cute and if you stay a while they play nice jazz music but otherwise the place is neither cozy nor romantic.I would have given it a solid 3, if it wasn't for the terrible service I received at this supposedly upscale place. I wanted to send the wine bottle back, provided we pay for the glass that was poured. The waiter claimed you can only send a bottle back if there is something bad with the wine. Strike one. I don't care about whether you take it back or not but at least pretend to check with the manager or tell me kindly that you can't take it back. Then when I was visibly upset, the waiter STOPPED SERVING US. I had to get the attention of busboys for glass refills or anything else. It was the most unprofessional service I've ever seen in my life.At that point with my night ruined, to be honest I didn't quite enjoy any of the food that was served. I don't remember being delighted with it anyway.I had one drink at the bar and they were courteous over there so the one star they receive from me goes to the bar section.Otherwise worst dinner experience and never will I recommend this place to anyone or set foot here again.",5,3,1

My only complaint is that the portions were very small - only 3 smallish scallops (which I guess made sense considering it was the restaurant week special).  For dessert, we shared all 3 dessert options - assorted sorbets (the banana was awesome), chocolate cake and carrot cake.  Of the 3 options, I liked the carrot cake best.To drink we split a bottle of wine and a round of cocktails.  My $18 martini was very good and definitely one of the better parts of the meal.Side note: I loved the decor!!

Hello, your decor is totally dated, your drinks are boring, and your staff are children. Refused to allow our party of 3 to sit down at a real table claiming that two were ""reserved"" which clearly means we are waiting for a party that looks like they will drop more change than yours. One waiter was clearly trying to help us get us a more comfortable Seating arrangement while the other two kids were working against him (and us) explaining certain tables are ""reserved"" which by the way were never filled during the 45' I had to spend In this place. Little did they realize we were more than willing to drop some serious change at an establishment a little more class, with a lot more style .....I am told there has been a write up or two in southern living magazine or some perhaps some other magazine or book which must have written ages ago - I would HIGHLy encourage anyone in search of a cooler vibe with better service to take a pass on this one.",4,,
116,Larry L.,"New York, NY",357,186,103,4.0,7/17/2012,"What pretentiousness? What snobbery? What haughtiness?I needed to book a last second dinner so I hopped on OpenTable, filtered by Midtown East and prayed for a high class restaurant that had prime availability the night of. I saw Monkey Bar. The name definitely rang a bell. My extremely sophisticated friend, Donghao B. had mentioned the place in passing, saying it was an exclusive restaurant with a storied past that commoners like us could sit to stargaze. That inkling of a memory was enough to sway my decision for dinner.When I met my friend for dinner, we entered the bar and it was just that - a bar. It was narrow, bordered by couple booths on the left and the bar on the right. I had no clue where we would sit. Thinking I literally booked a regular bar for dinner, I panicked. I mentioned we had a reservation and I was lead to the back, where I entered the grandiose dining area engulfed in a red hue.  We were seated in a relatively quiet area and started our dinner as I wiped the nervousness from my face. The fried oyster and Berkshire pork with kimchee caught my eye. I'm usually skeptical about Asian fusion dishes, but as esteemed entertainer, Aubrey Drake Graham, would say, YOLO. Seriously, if I could live only once, then I would make sure I had this dish at least five more times. It was a classic play on a Korean dish, but that extra fried oyster just added enough flair to the relatively commonplace combination of pork and kimchee. The buttery fried oyster was crispy to the taste and the pork, of course, was cooked to perfection - the melt in your mouth kind. Don't you just love it when a complex dish clashes texturally yet harmonizes and plays the perfect tune to your taste buds? I sure do.For entrées, we went with the duck and the lamb and they were also presented uniquely.  Each meat was prepared in two ways, i.e. the duck had a duck breast and a duck leg confit. Basically, two cuts of the same.  This presentation definitely made me feel like I got my money's worth and it is rare to receive such great value at a high end restaurant, so for that, I applaud Monkey Bar. However, I couldn't say the duck or the lamb was top of the class, which is why I'm only giving this restaurant a four star.This place is a great for dinner after a busy day at work. It's right in the hustle and bustle of Midtown East and sometimes, as I'm told, you can catch a celebrity or two and I'm sure you don't have to be a TMZ fan to appreciate dining with the stars.",3,2,3

They have some crazy specialty drinks that were fine but I would suggest partaking in one of their fine wines by the glass or micro brewed beers. We were seated at a wonderful oval table for 8. The dinning room has a warm, comfortable feel to it. Our server was Yarrow and she was spectacular. We had some strong personalities in our group and she handled us perfectly. They have a nice wine list in which you can find pretty much anything you want.  I can vouch for the chopped salad as a starter. It was very flavorful (and healthy!). As for mains, My wife and I split the beef sirloin, halibut and we also tasted some potato gnocchi. They all tasted very good and had a good presentation. Each were cooked properly as well. We also ordered the roasted mushrooms and french fries as sides. Again-Very good.  I was worried about the food after reading some past reviews but our experience was excellent. We ordered some sort of salted chocolate cake/ice cream for dessert. It was just okay with the chocolate being way too salty.It can be pricey depending upon what you order and how you pick your wines.Overall, I'm glad we took our group here.

Initially, I heard good things about this place to why I decided to take them there. As we walked in the staff stared at us without a pleasant greeting. I honestly didn't think anything of it (I actually thought that it was because we looked beautiful) lol... While waiting for the food we decided to take pictures the manager abruptly told us we are not allowed to do so and did not explain the reason why. A Few minutes went by and I asked one of the waiters who by the way I thought he was the only nice guy there to take a picture and he does. The manager rudely told him off in front of us which I thought was very unprofessional. The waiter explained the reason and we understood and put the phones away. I am already feeling uncomfortable with the situation the manager continued to look at us, speaking to her staff and looking at our table. I decided to look around and we were the only Hispanic people there. I am still giving them the benefit of the doubt because I am a restaurantholic. While we were placing the order, I asked the waiter to recommend their best wine, and he replies ""Oh here is the cheapest one"". I  was very insulted because he mentioned the price when  I asked for quality. By his response he implied that we couldn't afford it. I have been to better restaurants than this one and I never encountered this kind of treatment. We ate fast because we wanted to get the hell out of there and the bill came, the 20% of gratuity was included when the waiter came he had wrote in the gratuity himself. While being there I thought awwww how nice I innocently called him over and asked him why did you add the tip I wanted to give you extra he said is ok you don't have too. The 20% was almost $90 and I delete the amount he wrote and gave him an extra $30 which was $120 in total. As I am walking out and my back is turned, He says, ""THATS WHY YOU DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!!!!!!!!!!"". I wasn't offended by the ""no picture rule"" but his inappropriate comments as I was leaving, I found that to be very disrespectful. To top it off the food wasn't as delightful as I was expecting and I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone, in addition to its poor customer service, the experience itself was uncomfortable, the atmosphere seemed very judgemental from beginning to end.

This is also a review about how women are always right.The dining room is stunningly gorgeous.  It is both whimsical and something out of a dream I once had when I was six. I loved it.That, I believe, is where the compliments end.  The menu they set up for Valentine's day was insipid to say the least.  The courses were sad, bordering on pathetic.They had a salad, some poached oysters, and a soup to start.  As a mid course, they offered salmon with lentils, lobster, and a little pasta.  For mains, they offered a steak, a pork chop and a duck breast, and for dessert they offered donuts and a souffle.It sounds scrumptious.  Rest assured, it was not.  Everything was either underwhelming at best, or served lukewarm at worst.  Mala was served the salmon twice.  She insisted she had ordered duck as a main, and the mistake was corrected after we had finished our main dishes.  Which were served to us in miniscule portions.  Keep in mind I like small perfect portions.  These were small, almost cold pieces of meat.  I think our cats would have liked them...I did not.  The best part of the meal was the desserts, but by then it was too late to salvage the wreck of an opinion I had formulated of the 'famous' Monkey Bar.  I may have been right about it being a very off night.  There was a couple behind Chris who broke up, rather passionately-not with each other- but with the restaurant that night.

123,Jenny H.,"Manhattan, NY",45,89,59,4.0,2/16/2015,"The evening started with a warm welcome from Dan, the bartender and a perfectly mixed ""Nuts and Rye"" cocktail. This drink is a magnificent blend of rye, coffee liqueur, syrup and orange bitters (I believe I got the combo right) that is strong but sweet and very pleasing to the palate! Well worth the hefty price tag ($18). We had a reservation but were never rushed to our table, allowing us to savor our cocktails at the bar before being sat. Once at the table, we were served by the friendly and attentive Eddie. I ordered the cream of mushroom soup (superb!!! Not too salty, perfect amount of creaminess), the Bass (very tasty, not too fishy), and the creme brûlée (had a strong orange flavor, I wasn't a fan) from the restaurant week menu. My friend ordered the hamachi (she loved it), the cavatelli with lamb ragu (probably the best sauce I have ever tasted and perfectly cooked pasta!) and the toffee pudding (SO delicious! Very sweet). Our other friend ordered off the regular menu. The baby beets and goat cheese was awesome. The chicken pallaird was overpowered by the huge amount of greens on the side, although he thoroughly enjoyed it and cleaned his plate,I thought it looked more like a salad than a main course. The decor is very old school, dim lighting and huge round booths with monkeys everywhere! The fabulous service reflects the ambiance, you feel as though you have been propelled back in time to an era when dining was an event. I loved my Monkey Bar experience!",,,

Let's be fair.  5 minues after we sat down David Schwimmer and his wife sat next to us and they became the center of attention for our waitress.  The sommelier was apologetic when she realized that the server forgot our wine and that there was a HAIR in the olive oil.  She even brought us a nice Muscato with our final course..  All in all a great night with my friends but no reason to return when there are so many other spot on in EVERY category restaurants in Mid-Town!,,,
129,Bradford O.,Hong Kong,15,24,2,2.0,11/30/2011,"I should start off by giving credit where it's due. The clubby, historically-rich ambiance at Monkey Bar transports diners to a different era, and in a good way. It's the kind of restaurant you see in classics; a place where Greta Garbo would have lit up a cigarette as Benny Goodman poured out a swing tune. Even better, the menu brims with exotic, brilliantly paired ingredients. The whole place makes you want to fall in love. We visited mid-week. Upon entering, the host and servers were warm and inviting. We had resolved to take our time, so initially it didn't bother us that the service was somewhat inattentive. As time progressed, however, our efforts to order a second round of drinks were stifled by our inability to get the attention of any server, all of whom were concentrated intently on larger parties. Eventually we got the drinks. By this point, quite some time had passed since our arrival so we asked the runner to get our waiter to take our food order. Another twenty minutes ticked by, and our concern turned to frustration. It was only after we flagged down several passing wait staff that we were finally able to order. I opted for sea bass and my date got the lamb. When the food finally showed up after what felt like several more hours, I was encouraged by its thoughtful plating. It could easily have contended for the cover of a foodie magazine. Adornments of celery leaves and razor-thin sourdough crostini suggested the long wait had been worthwhile. As we started eating, however, it quickly became apparent that everything had been sitting out at room tempurature for quite some time. My fish was a solid piece of rubber and I struggled to cut it apart. The accompanying cockles were sandy and exuded a strong fishy taste and odor. The menu had promised guanciale but it was nowhere to be seen. In fairness, perhaps it had been liquefied and therefore accounted for the briny, lukewarm dishwater concoction the fish was soaking in. My companion's Colorado lamb was gamy and overcooked. It was surrounded, purportedly, by ""heirloom"" beans that bore a striking resemblance to garden variety cannellini. Summarily, all of the food we consumed was awful, but we dared not send any of it back for fear that we would end up sitting around for several more hours. Sadly, the food and service at Monkey Bar are no match for the wonderful environment. And even by Manhattan standards, it's not exactly a cheap night out.I will not return until the ineveitable kitchen overhall.",7,,

131,Sara P.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",136,184,42,4.0,2/28/2014,"Came here for Restaurant Week Lunch. The menu was fantastic and interesting. The service is extremely professional (almost intimidatingly so) and the atmosphere is ritzy yet cozy and vintage. The patrons all seemed to be very moneyed and dressed up. This restaurant is the place to bring a date you want to impress or if you want to feel like you're in NYC back in the 40s. The food was really great.The bread was a pull apart type bread and was warm, had a little melted butter glaze and sea salt topping. It was served with unsalted butter and was truly amazing. Off the Restaurant Week menu we had the Sweetbreads, Cavatelli with Short Rib Ragu, Hangar Steak, Beignets and Ice cream. The portions were perfect and every dish was executed well. Everything we ordered was simply delicious. I really appreciated how every dish wasn't overdone with buzzword-y garnishes. The food was just so good on its own, it didn't need any fancy embellishments. While the Restaurant Week menu was stellar, their normal menu is quite pricey and seems a little more traditional, however I would definitely come back for a romantic dinner date.",2,,

133,Dana C.,"New York, NY",1,65,62,2.0,9/25/2012,"There is something very special about the iconic dining room and famous murals of The Monkey Bar, and if you're in the mood for a fabulous cocktail in a warm, supper club like, upscale space that harkens back to another time and you want to have that experience in midtown, well then The Monkey Bar is an excellent choice. (Though if you're going to spend $18 on a martini why not go to Bemelmans). The bar is cozy, with a few red leather booths along the wall covered in red checkered tablecloths. The bartenders are skilled and welcoming. Unfortunately everything falls apart at dinner. It's a beautiful space to dine in, and while you're paying extra for the chance to eat classic dishes in this space (think a $22 burger, a $19 chopped salad, a $26 roast chicken) none of that would be a real problem if the waitstaff had their act together. The Monkey Bar clearly had their moment a few years back when Graydon Carter did the redux and it was impossible to get a table--it seems that now the VIP's have moved on and so has the top notch service. The food is good, if overpriced. Rule of thumb is to stick to the classic dishes and avoid the overly fussy preparations that don't always hit their mark. But the real problem is the waitstaff. At a recent meal we were made to wait for long stretches of time despite the fact that there were only three or four tables occupied in the large dining room. (This was a Monday, but still--I don't think it's too hard to get a table these days.). The drinks all arrived at different times, which made toasting a special occasion awkward and endless. The meals arrived out of order and to the wrong people so that we were left shuffling plates around like we were at a diner. We were never greeted, welcomed to the restaurant, checked on, or asked if we'd like anything else. In the words of one of my dining companions it felt like we were at a Chili's, not a top Manhattan destination. Bottom line: I'd highly recommend the bar and skip the restaurant.",,1,

We definitely go for that old New York charm (think Cafe des Artistes) and traditional but excellently prepared cuisine, and Monkey Bar fits that bill.  The decor is quite interesting -- while sitting at the bar waiting for our party to arrive, we learned from a very friendly bartender that the murals in the barroom are original from the early 40s.  The mural in the main dining room is pretty awesome as well, and you can spend a fair amount of time trying to guess who's who on the walls. I also loved the setup of the main dining room -- the individual round tables makes it feel very private even when the place starts to fill up.Now onto the most important stuff -- the food! The monkey bread they bring out is warm, moist, and just plain delicious. My mom and I shared the fried green tomatoes with feta and the grilled veggies with crispy polenta to start; both were good but the fried tomatoes really stood out.  The birthday boy had steak tartar and thought it was well-executed.  For my main course I went with the chicken paillard, accompanied by a lovely arugula salad with lemon and a side of creamed spinach (a personal fave, and done nicely here).  My husband had the lobster thermidor, and is still drooling over it days later. I don't eat seafood, but if you do, this is clearly the way to go.

I love me some crunchy veggies! Then once we placed our order, our server brought us over a pan of monkey bread! Wow. Just wow. This bread might have been better than the bread I had at One if by Land, Two if by Sea. It was so delicious--buttery deliciousness. Loved it.Then our appetizers came out (and we only ordered appetizers to start because my parents wanted to see how good the clams and oysters were before they ordered an entree). My Dad loved his Clams Casino and my Mom really enjoyed her Oysters Rockefeller. We had a heavy lunch earlier that day, so I went with their Chopped Salad which was very yummy--and a generous size! After we finished those, my Mom wanted another order of Oysters Rockefeller, but my Dad wanted to try the Lobster Thermidor. However, he was extremely disappointed. First, the lobster was too tough and chewy and second, the dish was covered in too much melted cheese. The restaurant manager was extremely nice though and took the lobster off of our bill and replaced it with an additional order of Clams Casino. My Dad was a very happy camper. We also got a side of steamed asparagus which I dominated--I love asparagus!As if we weren't full enough, we of course got some dessert, the Eton Mess--homemade whipped cream with chopped berries.

The atmosphere immediately was awesome. Just a classic NYC bar, which was perfect for my out of town guest. Brian the bartender was simply great. You don't mind paying $12-15 for a drink when they are unique, and masterfully prepared. I started with an easy one, a martini a bit dirty. One I saw him mix up a few other drinks for other patrons, I knew he was serious. I asked him to make me up a drink, and within a few questions to me, he knew what direction he was headed. After sampling his creation a few times, he knew it was ready. It was a fantastic bourbon based drink with a hint of bitters and orange zest. Damn...nailed it. As far as food, we did try an app as I was a bit peckish at that point. We had the fried oysters with jalapeños and garlic. One word there: killer. Overall, I can surely vouch for the bar.

Loved the bar.....the restaurant was ok...food was good, service was good....no worries but the the experience of the night is generally predicated by the company you keep and my ex wife is a horrible date! I had to endure 90 minutes of her cackling and whining until she had enough wine to match my level of sobriety. I can't tell you how pleased I was to be able to retire to the bar for an hour of repose from her ceaseless complaints about some aspect of her life. I m sure the bitching kept coming..but I couldn't hear it. The  piano bar took me away from all that. So I give a thumbs up to the BAR!",,2,

But hey, if you asked me, I really don't give a crap about the scene if the overall experience is not on par! The food was really mediocre, and the service was spotty and slow. We had a table of 10, and two entrees were forgotten and came 30 minutes later than the rest of our table---with a waiter who reminds me of those ""gorgeous looking -dim-minded-aspiring-actors""---go figure. I had the pork chops and it was overcooked and definitely on the dry side...although the sweet potato mash was pretty decent (but not decent enough to make up for the overcooked chops). Everyone else's seemed to pretty ""meh"" as well, no one was really impressed.The only highlight of the night was that Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell sat behind us, until she got up and elbowed me in the head while putting on her sweater (and didn't apologize). wah wah wah....",1,5,3

167,Nils E.,"San Francisco, CA",155,101,1,3.0,10/13/2009,"Is it true that you can go blind from spanking the monkey?See No EvilEasy on the eyes indeed. Graydon Carter has done a number on this place with soft, indirect lighting, brass railings lining myriad red leather booths, and wall-to-wall murals depicting old New Yorkers of a bygone era. The ambiance is both sultry and comfortable, with the booths affording a modicum of privacy, both real and imagined (lest one forget that Carter is a man about town and rolls deep with celebrities, glitterati and a cadre of hand-selected paparazzi).   Hear No EvilMonkey Bar is billed as Midtown's old school supper club, and while it is open to the public, they still seem to want to play hard to get. The imposition of a cumbersome reservation process (email-only for advance reservations) and an implausibly long recorded phone message left me banging my head against my desk. Despite booking weeks in advance, I was still uncertain whether I had a reservation until the appointed day when I received an email requesting confirmation. Really? Email? If they'd sent me a tweet, I might have been impressed, but my spam folder made quick work of their reservation system. Luckily, it was a Monday night, and Carter and his posse were taking the night off, so we were granted access.Speak No EvilBusiness dinner that it was, I laid down the law with our order: one app and one main course, followed by dessert(s) - a minimum of least eight different plates. The ideal opener: OYSTERS Rockefeller. These mellifluous mollusks did NOT disappoint, and while I may have chosen a different variety of oyster (slightly larger), there was no disputing the kitchen's deft measure of parsley, butter and cheese which decimated the last vestiges of my pathetic diet. Their HAMBURGER was grubulicious. Taking a page from Minetta Tavern's book of bovine wisdom, the Monkey Bar used dry-aged beef, which lent just the right modicum of complexity to the flavor. Topped with a molten slab of Cabot cheddar, the burger exploded with juice when bitten, and there was no shame felt in allowing it to drizzle down my chin. A mini-bucket of crisp, flakey fries distract the pallet momentarily, like a gasp of air before diving back into the meat mélange. You don't consume, you make love to this burger, and your entire countenance will divulge it after the fact with heavy eyelids, rosy cheeks and flecks of cheese and juice lingering on the corners of your mouth.Eat More EvilUnfortunately, the climax of the burger was swift and ended all too soon.  The rest of the meal felt like torpid, indecisive foreplay. Really?  That's IT?!  (Suddenly, I could empathize with housewives everywhere.) Their Scottish salmon tartar was gummy and had the consistency of wet cat food; arugula atop beef carpaccio was harmless, but also mostly flavorless; the skate Grenobloise was grenoblasé - the freshness (or lack thereof) of the fish was barely masked by the oil and capers; Nora's Meatloaf, despite a valiant attempt at a cover up with a tasty mushroom wine sauce, was as interesting as the name suggested, a loaf of meat; and the steak and eggs (a breakfast item on a dinner menu) was mezzo mezzo, with a beautifully poached, light and delicate farm-fresh egg atop a mostly uninteresting and bland cut of sirloin.Dessert was a step back in the right direction, with a sticky TOFFEE PUDDING erasing most of our memories of the other courses (except the hamburger and oysters, of course). Despite misgivings of being overly sweet, the caramel/molasses flavors of toffee were traced marvelously in a pudding that would have made Bill Cosby weep.I'd revisit Monkey Bar just for the ambiance, but only if it were convenient. I never sampled ""the bar"" as it was business, not pleasure that brought me there, and they were in the midst of revamping their bar menu anyways. Still, for the prices you pay in Midtown, there are plenty of more alluring options, and you can't escape Monkey Bar without dropping a cool hundy.Oh well. Monkey see, monkey do.",15,17,16

I haven't had many of the cocktails, but I would imagine they are good. Personally, I would never eat in the main dining room as it's a bit too faux-sceney for me (midtown scene? come on...) What I do love is having dinner in the front bar area. The booths are comfortable, relaxed and well lit. I have eaten at MB a number of times and I have settled into a few favorites. The salmon tartar is really fantastic, one of the best. The fries are great; well salted. A side order of brussel sprouts are very savory. The sea scallops are pretty good; this coming from a serious scallop lover... One night they had an egg white omelet with creme fresh and caviar that was DELICIOUS. Try requesting it and an order of fries. Fantastic. I would not recommend this place for out-of-towners looking for a special dinner.

Lobster cocktail with -- would you believe -- green goddess!  Only the chocolate soufflé is missing from the menu, and I bet you can order it special in advance.  The bar is very loud, with people seeming to be in a shouting contest, probably due to the small space and hard walls.The ambiance is definitely conducive to people-watching, and having grown up in Chasen's, I fancied that since we were seated in front -- where you can see who's coming in -- we were favored.  Besides Graydon Carter, who was hiding out from the blowback of his Wednesday Massacre at Vanity Fair, we didn't see anybody we knew, though everybody looked like somebody we should have known, except for the loud and vulgar stockbroker we had the misfortune of being seated next to.  We might have spied Dominick Dunne, if he'd not died just a couple of weeks previously, which is too bad, since I was looking forward to dropping a few names by him.Oh yeah, the food was done flawlessly, the exorbitant Krug (anniversary/birthday) was ice cold, and the service quite cordial and cute.  A close-to $600 dinner for two, which is about par for a top table in NYC or LA.  Consider $200 of that a cover charge.By the way, I notice that some of the poor scores are from a while back.  Carter recently replaced the chef, and even the Times critic says the food has improved.  Maybe a revisit is in order.",2,1,3

The beautiful dining room/gross food combo verges on the Le Cirque dining experience, except there are less men entertaining their mistresses, I've yet to eat anything that was actually disgusting, and the servers aren't even half as rude (actually, they're pretty nice.)I love it when this place is on RW menu because it would really shock the conscience to spend more than $50 for lunch and a glass of wine here, but at the Restaurant Week price the so-civilized dining room makes up for the food for me, hence the three stars and my multiple past and likely future visits.",,,

I was so excited to try Monkey Bar after finding out that they are one of the only restaurants in the city to serve Lobster Thermidor. My hopes were high and I didn't let the tacky pizza shop tablecloths in the bar area discourage me. The meal started off nice with some of the freshest vegetable crudites that I have had. The dip was a bit on the watery side, but these vegetables were a hit. Then the monkey bread...oh the monkey bread. It was a cross between a donut and a dinner roll and I loved it. It was dense but in that oh so good way. Monkey Bread makes me happy. Now on to the paid courses. We shared the highly recommended oysters rockefeller and I am not a fan. I haven't had it before but I don't think they were supposed to be as watery as they were. The flavor was meh and I barely finished two before letting my friend take the third one. I thought, hey maybe it was just some bad oysters...but then the lobster came. It looked ok, nicely presented in the shell, but after further inspection it seemed dry. In a nutshell it tasted like dry overcooked lobster with some cheese melted on top. Even if it was cheaper I wouldnt have been a fan. What little sauce it had was thin and watery and the flavor overall was just bad. Also, it was obvious that they prepared our two entrees at the same time in one pan, because upon splitting it into our two lobster shells, my friend got stuck with 90% mushrooms and hardly any lobster. Sloppy. At the end of the meal we wanted the peach melba (even though the meal was so disappointing we did want to end with something sweet) and at 830pm we were told they had run out. Ummm, lets just call it what it was and say that they didnt have it at all today. Disappointed we just asked for the check.

We had salmon and beef  tartare WOW who needs to go to Nobu after you eat this here. I think my date wanted to order a 2nd round but we had already ordered entrees.  We also had the pasta special which was spaghetti and meatballs.  Again it was fantastic the flavor, the sauce the noodles.   I had the salmon which was probably the best I ever had it was cooked perfectly with a bit of crispiness and I ate every bite.  Shelly who is a vegetarian opted for the risotto I think it had mushrooms and fava beans in it. That had to be the most flavorful of the night and Steven dropped his spoon and said he wanted to come back just for that and or be buried in that risotto.

199,Vi V.,"New York, NY",16,127,164,3.0,10/2/2007,This bar is practically hidden!  You could walk right pass it without noticing. I went there because the bartender is a friend of my friends. The atmosphere is laid back - allows for conversations. I really liked the bowl of crunchies (a mix of peanuts with various crisp) that they served complimentary.And i highly recommend the mango mojito. I usually hate mojitos but the mango mojito here is deee-licious! and our bartender friend is just the sweetest friendliest bartender there is. Come here if you want to be able to talk with your friends-or the cute bartender.,3,1,3
