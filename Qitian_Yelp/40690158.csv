0,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,3.0,7/9/2017,"This spot is a pretty popular midtown lunch place. They also offer catering and recently catered a breakfast so a seminar I attended. The breakfast package seemed like they had ordered ""the Deluxe"" because there were a ton of options: - various egg wraps some with bacon, some with sausage, most with cheese. - A fresh fruit salad with fresh fruits, though the watermelon should have seedless. I'm not spitting seeds at a business meal like Huckleberry Finn. - Yogurt and granola - a lovely bread, bagel, pastry and muffin platter I seriously lusted after.The egg whites and vegetable wrap was a little soggy but didn't taste awful. It's also a little pricey for what it is.",1,1,1
1,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,3.0,6/23/2017,"Came here for a quick lunch as I was headed to a client meeting. There are many different options here ranging from the pasta station, salad bar, sandwich/wrap bar, or pre-made meals. I went with a sandwich and got the BLT with avocado. The awesome thing about that place is that they include a free iced tea with all meals. This place also offers dine in tables for those that want to sit down and eat.The sandwich itself was nothing special. It was as expected and decent for a quick grab and go place. It ran me about 8 bucks which I think is relatively cheap for lunch considering it was midtown. Overall, decent place for something quick. Be prepared to wait however as they usually only have 2 cashiers working and it could get busy. I would be back again if I needed a grab and go.",,,

For a small salad (6 toppings) priced at around 10 bucks, I would say it is at about the average price level in this area. You also have no limitation in terms of choice, protein or veggie. The only complain I had is their limited option of dressing. Plenty of seating space inside, even during busy hours at noon. If you have nowhere to turn to after grabbing the food, Fresco is your ideal spot!",15,12,14
4,Jayson C.,"Jamaica, NY",14,176,426,4.0,3/5/2017,"I always get the same 2-3 items here and it been good.   Their Chicken parmesan rollup (bread are fresh) are moist and the included potato chips are good.   I also had the Chicken Marsala and pasta and was flavorful and moist with good portion.   I was really full from that.  Overall workers are friendly and fast services.  For NYC price, I feel it is a good deal since they added in the free ice tea when you buy lunch here ( That's is one of the benefits and reason for me to come here ).My friend pointed out to me the owner is often there and I did see her there a few times during my lunch.  So that is a good sign that they care and keep on top of this.",,,

6,John C.,"Cold Spring Harbor, NY",1,2,0,5.0,4/18/2018,"Fresco On The Go is as good as it gets for a quality takeout/eat-in lunch in Manhattan, and especially Midtown. As a Long Islander, I am used to quality delis so once I found Fresco, I've found myself visiting the Scottos' for lunch a few times a week.Fresco is known for fresh ingredients, great selection, and an awesome mom and pop family feel.I personally recommend their salads, chicken caesar roll ups (due to homemade wraps), sandwiches on fresh focaccia and their warm food bar, which has pastas, fresh vegetables and fish. Lastly I'll  mention that they have complimentary iced teas and Arnold Palmers. If you're in Midtown, give Fresco OTG a shot. You won't be disappointed.",,,

Updated review","Update: I guess someone saw my review. See photo!Love this place but I can only comment on the Chicken Parmesan Roll-up and the iced cappuccino. I've been coming here since 2014 and that's all I've gotten because they are so good. 4 stars because I have a slight case of OCD. The sign above the roll-up counter has a misspelling; it reads ""Chickem Parmesan"" instead of ""Chicken."" This sign has been like this for years and bugs me every time I go in. It implies laziness/indifference on the part of the owner, who clearly does not care about perfection, especially since the sign has been up for so long with this error.",,,
8,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,3.0,9/8/2016,"REAL TIME LUNCH REVIEW!Those rollup pics looked so good, I had to give them a whirl, and see if that grilled bread wrap thingy lives up to one of my area favorites.Pre-ordered the tuna rollup for 12:15pm delivery.  Arrived half an hour early....but looked like they had other deliveries for the building...so no biggy there.For $15 (including tax and generous tip), that is one small wrap (the entire thing measured about 6"")...though ample portion of delicious kettle-cooked chips.  Moderately filling because of the bread, not the innards.  Tuna salad was fine, though not mind blowing (could make the same at home).  The grilled rollup bread was good.  Intriguing that they used shredded cheddar rather than sliced cheddar.  For the price point, though?  You'd get more bang for your buck elsewhere, with equally fresh quality, and better flavor profiles.However, I can see a platter of these making for a really nice option for office catering.Might try again, if on the company dime.  Might not, if on my own.",1,1,1

Updated review","As time goes by this place has become aMore frequent place to order lunch. They have a decent size menu but what seems to be the best are the Salads & Roll ups. Salads that have constantly been good are the Chicken caesar ,love the croutons The Chicken Milanese salad is great , nice tasting chicken & dressing better when they don't drown it in dressing. Both Chef & Cobb salads are always good as well. Another good salad is the Mediterranean , add chicken makes it better good dressing. Not a big fan of the Asian salad they add way too many bean sprouts , good dressing tho. Roll ups best is still the Chicken Caesar, The Steak Roll up is pretty decent as well. The Tuna Roll up is actually pretty good, good tasting tuna a bit too many onions but still not bad. Roast beef sandwich ok & The Meatball Parm hero is not bad. They also have a pretty decent Fresh roast turkey sandwich. We tried the Calamari & it was ok , think they over fried it a bit dipping it in the sauce makes it taste better good sauce. finally still enjoy the Margarita pizza super thin crust not bad. Over all they have decent prices , quick service & delivery if u order in. Good lunch place.",6,1,2
10,Dana M.,"New York, NY",113,307,113,3.0,3/4/2016,"I rarely change my weekday lunch spots, but today I wanted something new and exciting! So my friend recommended this place because there are places to sit. The place was pretty crowded, but orders were taken relatively quickly and the line to pay was quick as well. Most people did takeout so we were able to snag a table for a little bit.The menu is very extensive. They have everything from fish to salads to sandwiches etc. So picking what I wanted was difficult until I saw there was a meatball sandwich on the menu (YES, DECISION MADE). The sandwich was $8.50+tax and had 2 meatballs about 3 inches in diameter on a roll with some extra sauce and parm cheese. And I got an iced tea (which is included with a meal). I have to say, the meatballs were very good, but the price seems a bit steep.This place was good with a good variety but is nothing amazing.*FYI - Prices on their website were different than what was charged in store",,,
11,Jennifer W.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,9,3.0,3/30/2016,"I order Fresco's Tuscan Fries and Lemon Herb-Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Mozzarella Cheese.  The delivery time wasn't too bad since I ordered at 11:46am and it came at 12:50. The height of lunch time in NYC. The sandwich on rye was a surprise since I thought it would be on a hero. Not big deal. The mustard was very light. The lettuce and tomato were extremely fresh and tasty. The only problem I have is with the soggy fries. They tasted old and just soggy. Not even worth it, so I ended up throwing them away.  Rosanna should know better.",,,

19,ghost g.,"Edgewater, NJ",34,115,533,3.0,4/18/2013,It's mid-town so if you are looking for value then you are in the wrong zip code.  I have been coming to Fresco on the Go for a couple of years now and pretty much the only thing I get are one of the made to order wraps.  They have about 5-6 to chose from but my go to is the ceasar steak wrap.  Its pretty much a ceaser salad sandwich.  What makes the sandwich is the wrap which is also the same flatbread they use for their pizzas.Yes the whole place is pretty much yuppie/ banker city hence the $15 dollar sandwich and soda lunch.The place is starting to look a bit run down. But otherwise A-OK for a midtown lunch.,,1,1
20,Lauren R.,"New York, NY",1,5,0,5.0,1/19/2016,"This is definitely the best grab and go lunch place in Midtown East. All the pre-made salads are super fresh and the grilled chicken is actual grilled chicken- not like the weird cubed chicken at Essen or Europa. Their specials are awesome too- usually chicken or roasted turkey over farro or quinoa and vegetables. They don't skimp on portions either.  Besides the pre made salads, I love their tuna salad roll up (with dill, green apples and raisins) and their Turkey BLT with this awesome herb aoili.  The free Arnold Palmers and iced tea is a great touch.",1,,
21,Gourman D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,25,0,1.0,6/15/2015,"I work pretty close to here so it's convenient. However, it is awful. The one thing it has going for it is the seemingly unlimited toppings on your pasta for a set price. Which is good if you want everything, and overpriced if you only want it simple.They have interesting homemade wrap bread but they're customer service is awful, as is their quality control and consistency.  If you ask for something that's not automatically included they can't hear you. I guess they think it's better to ignore their customers than say no to them. Sometimes the chicken parm wrap has cheese in it, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes they give you two handfuls of chips, sometimes they give you 10 chips total. Sometimes the chips are well done, even overcooked, sometimes they're cooked so little that they're still pliable when you start eating them. Sometimes you get so much stuffed into your wrap that it falls out when you pick it up, sometimes you don't even get stuffing in every bite. And too often you get a piece of chicken that is simple inedible, like rubber.I guess it's nice to have a guaranteed customer base with high salaries and not have to worry about putting out a product with any semblance of quality.",,,
22,Catfish H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,229,107,2.0,7/12/2013,"Basically a midtown rip-off.  $10 before tax pre-made Cobb salad was a pathetic smattering of flavorless chopped lettuce and barely ripe tomatoes, complimented by cold cheap bacon and bland, dry grilled chicken.  Nicoise made with a pinch of canned tuna and little else.  Sandwiches with slivers of protein on lousy bread also come in over $10.This is one of those places that would not last anywhere else but in midtown or FiDi.  Literally worse than the midtown deli chains with bright signage that will go unnamed.  I used to come here because it was step above the generic places in the area- now it is one of them.  Still earns two stars because the soup is not overpriced (yet).",,,
23,Eric And Arisa C.,"Seattle, WA",229,111,131,2.0,3/2/2013,"Seems like they maybe get by on local business men and women coming here for a convenient  lunch to go, but it has a dirty, unimpressive environment and average to below-average food. Also, could use a decor upgrade, right now everything looks a little piecemealed together (like a room divider to coverup their restaurant supplies, ceiling fans look like they're falling apart as they droop down, etc.) Finally, service is get-by-service - it suffices, but teeters more on the side of lazy.",,,
24,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,2.0,3/30/2010,"This is a very strange place for a gourmet restaurant to open.  Its basically one of those lunch places that has a bunch of options which largely overlap.  I came here because Fresco was the first place in NYC to offer grilled pizza, was on the NYMag pizza list, I was in the area for an interview, and I enjoy grilled pizza in general.First off, the staff here is not that bad.  They seem a bit moody, but seeing the kind of people they have to deal with, thats to be expected.  They're the kind of people who are working in food service because its their job, not because they love what they do.  There's also too many of them, and it seems like this place might have some management problems in that they have so many extra people around, but I digress.  Regardless, they aren't that bad, and they were actually quite friendly to me.  However, the majority of the people who go here are yuppies.  They walk around like they're better than everyone else, sneer at each other, get their overpriced lunch, and then go back to work.  I held the door when I was coming in for about 10 people, and didn't get one thank you, for example.  Fucking yuppies.Regardless, I got a small margarita grilled pizza.  Unlike most margaritas, it came with tomato sauce, bel paese, and pecorino romano.  This combo was alright, but the real problem was that the guy killed the pie with pecorino romano, leaving it way too strong and salty tasting.  The bel paese was mostly neglible because of this, although the tomato sauce helped as it was pretty good.  The big problem I had here was the crust.  The 'crusts' were premade, but the main problem was that they were much more like the kind of pita bread that you use to make wraps.  In fact, thats exactly what they doubled for here.  The crusts here are also the same as the main restaurant, as the guy here told me.  The crust itself was largely flavorless except for some grill char, and it was also fairly soggy.  I didn't hate the resulting pie as a whole somehow, but this certainly wasn't a good grilled pizza, let alone a good pizza in general.  If you want real grilled pizza, try Coals in Morris Park in the Bronx (yes, that borough you are scared of).",1,1,1

44,Michael S.,"New York, NY",4,40,0,4.0,3/25/2006,"This is what Italian food is supposed to be like. Great portion size and great flavor. Everything is fresh, the bread is awesome, the meatballs and chicken cutlets must be made by an Italian grandmother everyday (they certainly remind me of how my grandma cooks). Throw in the unbelievably friendly service. It's my go-to place when I need a good Italian panini, whether it be chicken parm, meatball, or cold cuts. Be prepared since it is a little pricier than some places, although not outrageous for the location and definitely worth the money. Also, very busy during peak times and only open weekdays 6-6, other than that it's perfect.",,,
45,Matt F.,"New York, NY",314,48,1,3.0,12/14/2010,"fresco on the go is right across from my building, so i go occasionally... usually when i'm in a rush for lunch... i have tried a few things and have really only enjoyed a few of them.  1.) The pasta station! Love me some tortellini with vodka sauce, chicken, veggies, and ""spicy"".  It's a solid amount of food.. but it also costs around 10 dollars.2.) Meatballs... You can order a side order of meatballs with sauce, a little bread for dipping and you are set... 3.) The homemade potato chips are pretty delish.. but over 2 dollars for a small bag.I've tried a few other things and they have been medium... so that's why my rating is middle of the road... some things are good... some are so-so",,,
46,Kristen G.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,10,0,3.0,6/2/2011,"The food tasted great and there was a variety of choices of meals, drinks, and desserts. The line was really long though and there were no available tables during the lunch hour. I'd go back to grab the food and eat it elsewhere. Food was a little bit pricey but then again, it's Manhattan.",,,
47,Billy N.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,3.0,10/17/2008,"Great place to grab a quick and tasty lunch.  You can either sit there (although it is crowded) or take it to go.  They offer a great variety from pasta dishes, salads, asian bar, sandwiches, and wraps.   Although I think the prices might be a little steep, the food makes up for it.  The Chicken Parm Wrap is my favorite.",,,
48,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,672,0,4.0,9/30/2010,"We have only ordered delivery from Fresco, but several times we did, it was absolutely amazing.  The food arrived fast, the hot food was still hot, the portions were generous, and everything was fresh and delicious.  Their wraps come with a huge heap of potato chips, so no need to order anything on the side.  Definitely one of my favorite places for late dinner and work thru lunches",,1,
49,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",184,618,2,3.0,2/17/2008,"The restaurant is usually packed so this is a good place to grab lunch. The opposite of serene, Fresco is bustling so if you're looking for relaxing, go elsewhere. However, thier prices are great given the portion size and quality (also given midtown lunch prices) and it's a great spot. The only upside to the bustling is that even though it looks really full, turnover is so quick that finding a seat shouldn't be a problem. The only thing that really bothers me is that you feel like you're sitting in a beehive and I usually leave more stressed out sitting there than at work.  That says LOADS-deduct one star! Try the lasagna, it's delish.",,,
50,S. D.,"New York, NY",6,73,6,3.0,12/30/2009,"Granted, the only thing I ever order is the chicken parm wrap and lemonade but the wrap is delicious. I like how they toast the wrap prior to rolling it up. Great spot for lunch even though it gets really crowded.",,,
51,Lindsay M.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,117,3,2.0,2/26/2009,"didn't love any sandwich options.  too lazy to create my own salad.  didn't want pasta or beef meatballs.  ended up with margarita pizza.  or shall i say ""margherita pizza"".  this is one of those times when air quotes would definitely be appropriate.  i like thin pizza.  i like grilled bread.  i don't like slightly soggy grilled bread with some barely melted cheese shavings and a tablespoon of sauce.  and i picked up a drink from the cooler but had to ask them to remove it from the bill when it rang up as $3.75 - really?  for a bottled drink?",1,,
52,Sam M.,"Brookline, MA",0,12,0,2.0,8/7/2009,"Grabbed a burrito from here for lunch.  Size was OK, meat was greasy, black beans were cold from the salad bar, contents were not warm enough to melt shredded cheese despite a 5 block walk to my office, shell was a wrap not a burrito shell so it held together poorly.  Very dissapointing.  Will not go back.",,,
