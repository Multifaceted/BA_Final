0,Marlene D.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",231,138,113,5.0,9/14/2015,"Finding a place that has a lower east side feeling to it on the UWS is not easy, but I found one! I went here with my friend last Saturday for brunch, since this place is only open on Saturday and Sunday, and I really enjoyed the pigs in a pretzel, string bean fries and bruschetta carbonara with poached eggs, bacon, tomato, herbs, shaved cheese. I highly recommend the beer with citrus that they serve. Staff was very sweet, caring and attentive. Service was prompt. Thank God I finally found a place on the UWS that is trendy and cool. I'll definitely be back at some point. : )* Cash Only *",1,,1
1,Felice S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,3,5.0,3/25/2018,"This place is a find! I wish It were open more days than just Sundays. Delicious comfort food, such as yummy grilled cheese. Also have healthy food, such as fresh, crisp Kale Caesar salad.",2,,
2,Juliet R.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,4.0,3/5/2018,"I've been lunch eating at this neighborhood secret for years and it never disappoints! Just celebrated my 40th with a private party and it was just right. The evening decor was delightful, the food was amazing, and the night-of service was terrific. They did a great job with special requests for guests with different dietary needs and the personal touches I wanted. Looking forward to the first parmesan truffle grilled cheese lunch of my new decade.",1,,1
3,Lindsay T.,"Richmond, VA",170,188,166,4.0,12/14/2015,"Amused was a great Saturday afternoon NYC lunch discovery after spending our morning at the Natural History Museum and Central Park.  It is a very close walk to both locations.  My husband and I were just walking around looking for a place to eat and were immediately stopped by the large ""Artisan Grilled Cheese"" sign painted onto the brick.  This is basically my favorite thing in life so of course I wanted to stop and check it out.  The restaurant is small but it wasn't crowded at all.  The servers were extremely nice and helpful as well.  They bring you water in steel mugs, which is the best way to drink water IMHO, and let you peruse the menu.  I chose the Gruyere, Swiss, French Onion on Sour Dough and my husband chose the Smoked Gouda and Fig on Peasant Bread.  We decided to share our sandwiches, and a box of tots, of course!  Both were great, but I have to say mine was better.  The Fig would have been better but the cheese didn't melt all the way.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and would love to go back again.  Keep in mind Amused is CASH ONLY!  Definitely can hinder what you may order if you don't have the funds on hand.  Its hard to have a cash only place nowadays; I hardly carry cash unless I know in advance I'll need it.  Also, FYI, if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to go through the kitchen.  Doesn't seem to bother the cooks at all, but it is weird to walk straight through.  I felt like I was in their way, and in some way contributing to a health code violation, but maybe this is just the norm in NYC?",3,,1
4,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1638,64835,5.0,3/7/2015,"This appropriately named, confusingly self-described ""Small Plates & Pop Ups Restaurant"" is pretty awesome. You will be amused by their playful takes on comfort food and very well-executed renditions of beige food.The misleading ""Small Plates"" part of the restaurant subtitle doesn't do justice to the other half of the menu, which includes a big list of awesome not at all small grilled cheeses and other sandwiches, and excellent shakes. As for the ""Pop Ups"" part, make sure you note that they are only open from Friday to Sunday. For the rest of the week, they hold private parties and dinners and are closed to the public.The food is mostly pretty heavy, which makes the too much food we ordered even more overwhelming:- String Bean Frites ($9)Surprisingly there are no fries on the menu (though they do have lots of varieties of tater tots on the brunch menu), so we opted for the closest thing, these delicious fried String Beans. Much like a lot of the stuff here, the plating is very amusing, in this case with some of the frites packaged in a little custom pouch alongside the ""green goddess dipping sauce"".- Pig in a Pretzel ($12 for 5)Like a fancier version of pigs in the blanket, but not quite as fancy as the similar ones at Alder, these were delicious. Topped with honey smoked mustard and ""mustard caviar"", these were as nice to look at as they were fun and tasty to eat. - Kale Caesar Salad ($7)Gotta have some green among all that beige. This was a pretty delicious version of a caesar salad, but was pretty straightforward compared to the other kooky stuff.- Ramen Carbonara ($16)The most amusing of all of the dishes, this ramen swimming in creamy carbonara sauce was served in a custom styrofoam Cup O Noodles cup. It was super rich with the combination of that sauce, the runny poached egg, and the thick chunks of pork belly. This delicious, satisfying cup definitely does not qualify as a ""small plate"".- White Cheddar & Tomato Bacon Grilled Cheese ($12)On to the sandwiches, this was a very well-executed grilled cheese. Nice and crispy with some great flavor from the tomato bacon, this was a great choice.- Patty Melt ($14)The patty melt was even better. You can't really go wrong with a beef patty, onions, and swiss cheese on crispy rye bread, and they do it perfectly here. Get this.- Salted Caramel Shake ($8)This shake was excellent, but super unnecessary with all of that heavy food. Maybe save it for dessert to go with the crispy churros.- Deconstructed S'mores ($6)Back to another bizarre item, which turned out to be surprisingly delicious. The ""deconstructed"" s'more here consists of a marshmallow injected with a long syringe filled with chocolate. We were instructed to squeeze the syringe into the marshmallow, which made a wonderful mess of gooey, chocolatey marshmallow. The single marshmallow is tough to share, so you might want to get two of these.- Churros with Salted Caramel Sauce ($8)The churros were excellent, and were in the form of crispy little bite size pieces. There were a bunch of them served in a brown Chinese takeout container alongside a generous helping of salted caramel sauce.The cozy restaurant is set up with a large well-lit communal table in the center, with small two-tops lining the walls on both sides. Service was great and very friendly. Make sure to note that it's cash only and on the pricey side, so be prepared for that. There is so much more on the fun menu to try that I would definitely return, perhaps at brunch to try some of the additional selections not on the dinner menu.",23,11,14
5,Ari M.,"New York, NY",0,9,7,2.0,6/18/2017,"Essentially felt like an overpriced grilled cheese place. Also, please don't use paper plates to serve food.",4,,
6,Edward R.,"Chicago, IL",16,24,0,2.0,11/27/2016,"I was excited to try this place, because I had heard it was very inventive. We went for brunch, but the menu was pretty limited and basically had regular brunch-type dishes. Similarly, the drinks menu was pretty by-the-numbers, and the drinks weren't particularly good or strong. I didn't try any of the grilled cheeses (maybe that's their real forte), but I found the food pretty mediocre. The service was a little slow as well, and on top of that they're cash-only. (I can't stand the cash-only trend. I'm not sure if restaurants are laundering money, or they just love to inconvenience their customers, but this practice is idiotic IMO)Overall it was ok, but I felt there wasn't much value or service for the money. Won't be going back.",9,,1
7,Ishan G.,"New York, NY",107,5,0,2.0,11/17/2016,"We went here for brunch on Sunday and the experience was less than stellar. The spiked rosemary lemonade was good, and the service was quite good as well.The main problem was that all 4 people at our table ordered a poached egg dish and none of the eggs came out poached. They were all boiled, which just spoils the experience of brunch altogether. Besides the eggs, the food was quite decent, but I definitely would not come back here for brunch.",6,,
8,Stephen H.,"Alexandria, VA",0,24,14,3.0,3/11/2017,The food was decent but it was quickly clear the staff wasnt used to serving. Very confusing process as the servers were confused about what was on offer. Our understanding is this place is primarily for catering so I guess that makes sense. Simple menu. Long wait for food.  Super annoying that we had to pay cash and were not told in advance. Far too expensive for experience and food.,5,,
9,Verena S.,"Manhattan, NY",12,20,1,4.0,5/27/2017,"Possibly the best grilled cheese sandwiches in New York... absolutely delicious and a notch above any other grilled cheese sandwiches I've tasted (and I have tasted plenty!). I'm not giving 5 stars because they only have high chairs seating and that might not be a comfortable (or feasible) seating for everyone and they don't serve ice tea (a brunch place without ice tea?). But I will absolutely go back for the sandwiches because they are a.m.a.z.i.n.g! Everyone there is also very friendly and kind, which adds to the positive experience!",1,,
10,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,4.0,11/7/2015,"Amused is only open for brunch Saturdays and Sundays (they have a catering/private party business during the week) - so you better make sure to drag your ass there one weekend because this is an unusual Upper West Side gem.It's a small joint & not a lot of seating, so our large group sat at the big communal table in the middle. Their menu is full of unique ways of cooking eggs as well as many, many grilled cheeses. Absolutely loved the grilled cheeses. The standouts were gruyere + candied bacon, smoked gouda + fig, and monterey jack + pesto + muenster. We also enjoyed the egg dishes, especially the poached eggs + tater tots - simple but delicious. These crispy taters are definitely worth a try.Highly recommend Amused for a casual, fried, cheesy brunch on the UWS.",,,
11,Nicole G.,"New York, NY",275,169,109,5.0,4/27/2015,"Been wanting to try this place forever! Presentation is good, food is even better! The Party Starter RxThis was my favorite presentation of the night. They even gave us an extra shot of sochu which they served in a medicine measurement cap. It was also very delicious! I don't like sochu but this tasted amazing and was quite refreshing Fried Green BeansThe green beans are served in a seed envelope which is adorable. These tasted like typical fried green beans they were good though I felt the accompanying sauce lacked flavor.Pigs in a Blanket with Mustard CaviarThe mustard caviar distinguished this dish for the better. The ""pig"" is served in a pretzel crust that was good.Candied Bacon Grilled Cheese SliderGouda and Fig Grilled Cheese SliderBoth grilled cheese sliders were good. The candied bacon was the best very tasty. Though the sliders were small as the server had warned us. They are served on sourdough bread.Ramen CarbonaraThis was my favorite. Presentation was on point. The pork belly was tender and delicious as was the poached egg and carbonara sauce/brothDeconstructed S'mores These were unique and delicious. I don't like smores usually because I feel that the graham cracker dries it out too much. This however was graham cracker crumble and just the right amount. At $6 each though I felt that was a little pricey.Aside from food, service was very nice and knowledgeable. We were in decisive and rather chatty- the server didn't bombard us, gave us time and space and was present for when we needed him. Given that I trieda large portion of the menu, once they/if they add new menu items I'd be back.",2,,1

13,Alex T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,5.0,2/5/2017,Came here for brunch for the first time today and it was amazing! The staff was so fun and friendly and the food was delicious. Their stuff has a lot of unique twists on ordinary food. I had the Kitchen Sink salad (which was a bunch of greens and veggies and bacon and cheese) with poached eggs....SO GOOD! Definitely a must try for anyone looking for a new brunch place. Will absolutely be coming back regularly!!,,,
14,Mike P.,"San Diego, CA",13,80,16,3.0,10/10/2015,I thought I'd be more amused but I left disappointed. Had the patty melt. Burnt patty. Mac and cheese wasn't very good (sauce not very flavorful). Had the pig in a pretzel. Cool concept but came out cold. Long wait time for everything to come out as well. Maybe they were having an off morning. They actually comped our drinks because of how long it took. They were nice but expected way better based on other Yelp reviews.,1,,
15,Mary M.,"Douglasville, GA",15,38,12,5.0,11/14/2015,"Found this place on Yelp when the wait for Jacobs Pickles was over 2 hours on a Saturday. Decor is cute. Several side tables with one giant table in the middle. Service was great. Had the buffalo tater tots, as an app. Really good! Will try to copy at home!  I went with a gluten free grilled cheese sandwich and my boyfriend had the patty melt each were excellent. Didn't order any drinks, too early. The salad looked great. Def would come again.",,,
16,Michael T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,2,5.0,5/16/2015,"[Update of previous 3 star review for Say Cheese]Note: Only open weekends. Cash only.This new version of the former Say Cheese (same owners, some repeat dishes) has gotten all the pieces right, and approaches thematic destination dining. It's still something of a secret, too, so now is the time to check it out. The grilled cheeses themselves haven't changed (fine by me -- still tasty), but they are now just one part of a larger menu centered around a delightful take on childlike pleasure.You will probably get little dishes to share, and they all remind you of childhood in some way. Many have an element of interactivity, like if Disney turned its attention to food.  I'm thinking of the pig-in-a-pretzel, the mini corn dogs with cracker jacks, and pork belly slider. The General Zoe's Cauliflower and Ramen Carbonara (which comes in a ramen cup) are not only fun, but delicious flavor bombs. A great example of the interactive aspect is the Deconstructed S'more. At brunch it's $3, and you get one [pictured]. Trust me, that's enough for a dessert after a midday meal. A baster (or plastic syringe or whatever) is filled with some thick chocolate liquid, and stabbed into a cooked marshmallow that's covered in graham cracker crumbs. While you eat it, you squeeze and suck from the tube of chocolate. The flavor and texture are wonderful, and the playful tube-squeezing brings a smile to your face.The brunch itself is as good or better than the more popular brunch places in the immediate neighborhood. I got the Bruschetta Carbonara [pictured after I broke into the yoke]. The poached eggs were perfect, with cooked whites and runny yokes. The dish includes plenty of bacon, tomato cubes, crispy herbs of some kind (probably basted in olive oil and baked, but who knows), and a rich carbonara sauce. By the time I finished, there was still some sauce/yoke left over, and I wanted to scoop it up with my finger (if I were with someone, tater tots would have done the trick). The bread at the bottom stood up well to the quantity of sauce, and was split into a cute shape. Astounding stuff.  They now have cocktails made with sochu/soju (basically a vodka substitute), beer, and wine, not to mention all those fun flavored juices from the Say Cheese days. A fellow dining near me got a milkshake to go, so I know that's possible. Atmosphere: the room is relatively small, with one shared table in the middle and several two-seaters on both sides, but there's plenty of space. It's filled with old fashioned tchotchkes and Brooklyn-like wood and brick. The '50s/'60s pop playing quietly in the background would normally just be invisible background, but it relates remarkably well to the overall play on childhood.Price: Back in 2012, Say Cheese was too expensive. The prices haven't really changed, and inflation has finally caught up with most of their dishes. I'd say it's now standard for the 'hood.As summer has come, do yourself and your friends a favor and try this place out. The silliness mixes with real technical chops in the kitchen to make a memorable meal. -------------------There are two negative-ish things about Amused. I didn't remove stars because I don't mind, but you might, so consider yourself warned. (1) CASH ONLY. This complicates family outings, limits tourist traffic, and generally adds stress to what is supposed to be an impulsive let's-go-have-fun experience. Amused is not an arm-wrestling steakhouse where customers speak in the language of greenbacks, hookers, and hedge funds; nor are they just a to-go snack shop. And it's 2015. Come on. (2) WEEKEND-ONLY (plus, uh, Friday night, if you can remember that). My partner and I used to joke that Say Cheese was a drug front whenever we walked by and it was randomly closed. Yes, I realize they do catering during the week. But it's honestly hard to remember Amused exists when you combine its ""huh?"" hours with its inconspicuous middle-of-the-block location.",1,,1
17,Cindy Y.,"Carmel, IN",69,131,72,3.0,6/13/2016,"I don't come to this neighborhood much, but it seemed like they are trying to re-market themselves or trying something new after some hiatus. I don't know the back story, but they were offering rosemary lemonade at the entrance, and I couldn't resist especially since I was starving and the space looked especially nice on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The lemonade was very good, but I was not too impressed with the service. I walked in and had no idea what to do. I had to go up to the counter to ask if I should sit myself. They quickly showed me to an empty table. The menu wasn't so clear to me, and because most of the yelp reviews are from last year, I had nothing to go by. I was a little peeved that there was a minimum $10 per person and it's cash only. When I asked the waiter for recommendation, he immediately pointed me to the most expensive grilled cheese on the menu without giving much more details. I wasn't about to pay $14 for a grilled cheese, so I opted for the gruyere, swiss cheese, and onion on sourdough ($12). It came out on an oversized paper plate (I wish the extra space on the plate was filled with something like a few pieces of fruit or greens or a small sized tomato soup), but it smelled really good. It was very fresh and I enjoyed it a lot in the beginning, but it got too much by the end. The whole time I was dining, I realized the owner or the manager was busy entertaining other customers (maybe they are regulars), but she only came by my table once. That was nice, but she did it in passing, so I didn't feel particularly cared for. She offered a couple this watermelon/fruit ""pizza"", which I did not see on the menu at all. Anyways, the space was bright and sunny and I enjoyed my book there (though I wish they had turned the music down a little. The space has this echo effect which makes other patrons' noise much louder.) Overall, food is overpriced and service is a hit or miss.",1,,
18,Vincent L.,"New York, NY",100,2,17,5.0,4/17/2015,"This new restaurant is the neighbor of the studio I do yoga ( NY loves Yoga ). I could not remember how many times I walked by here.

19,Nellie N.,"Raleigh, NC",143,3,1,5.0,2/12/2017,What a wonderful experience! This place is well worth planning your Sunday morning around. The Gouda and Fig grilled cheese is absolutely phenomenal! The staff provides a warm and friendly environment that makes for a delightful afternoon.,1,,

The portions are quite big (so go hungry). The decor is delightful and it's a cozy comfortable spot. My friend and I literally enjoyed everything brought to the table. The grilled cheese is by far one of - if not the best I've had in this city. Served at just the right temperature, and with a sick balance of cheese. The string beans, and tots were also amazing and a must have. You also must have a milkshake! The service was superb as well.. Even the music was on point.

23,Janet U.,"Cockeysville, MD",8,8,0,5.0,10/17/2015,Visiting NYC with friends and looking for a place after walking around Central Park all morning.  Shared a number of items.  Everything was great.  Service was fast and friendly.  Green bean frittes were really good with the green goddess dressing.  Highly recommend.,,,
24,Emmanuel M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/18/2016,"Brunches at Amused have become a genuine delight and great addition to my relaxing Sundays.  The aura and vibe radiated from the aesthetics and layout of the small spot offer a refreshing touch to the dining experience.  It's hard to describe the blast of satisfaction and fulfillment I receive at first bite from any of their gourmet grilled cheeses (swiss bacon!!) or at first sip from one of their flavorful milkshakes.  Aside from their traditional options, they offer a unique variety of funky dishes, like the elote core pineapple and the watermelon pizza.  Having been there 3 times in the past month and a half, I can vouch for this wonderful venue and its hardworking chefs and staff.  Do not be surprised to have the owners or one of the chefs come enjoy a nice chat with you [and offer you some complimentary items].  Very genuine people with a passion for the culinary arts and appreciation for their foodie counterparts  Chef Will is doing a great job and is open to hear your perspective on the items and venue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   Culminate your afternoon with a stroll through Central Park, just a block and a half down the street.",1,,

29,Carla C.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,2,0,5.0,10/15/2015,"As we settled into our seat at Amused, we were greeted by a friendly and excited server. He took our drink orders and as per our case we informed him of our daughters allergies. Our experience, as far as New York restaurants go as always been indifferent. However, at Amused not only were we shocked by the degree of care, concern, and seriousness of her case he made certain that her plate of food was free of all major allergens. I have never had our daughters allergies treated with so much attention-from double checking the ingredients on the batter, to verifying if the oil was ok (it wasn't) and they switched fry oil!!! I applaud Amused, the server and congratulate this progress. Thank you! Thank you for ensuring the safety of our child and you shall be sure we will be back-again, and again! For those families who suffer from severe food allergies, finally a friendly family restaurant that will take your concerns to heart.",,,
30,Carrie V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,37,0,3.0,4/11/2015,"My husband and I recently read about Amused and were  looking forward to trying it out. We live a few blocks away and have been past it before but could never seem to catch it when it was open. We found out that they are only open Friday-Sunday. We visited on Saturday evening and we were happy to see only a few other couples and no wait! I ordered the french onion grilled cheese (amazing!) And we shared the spicy cauliflower (also amazing!). My husband isn't in to grilled cheeses so he ordered two small plates (pigs in a pretzel + two little tacos). He said they were tasty, but they were very small. We couldn't wait to order dessert since we heard all about the deconstructed s'mores! It was good but my biggest complaint is you get only 1 small, standard sized marshmallow (not even a graham cracker)! The price is $6 for 1 marshmallow! Even by New York standards, that is extremely high! A sandwich and a few small plates later, we spent $80+ on dinner! I think the food is phenomenal but portions are small and not meant for sharing and for what you get, I feel it's a bit over priced. If I were rating just the flavor of the food I would give an easy 5 stars. But, portion size + cost is where I feel there is room for improvement.",1,,
