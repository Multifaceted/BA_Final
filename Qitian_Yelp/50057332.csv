0,Steven S.,"East Windsor, NJ",102,146,13,4.0,7/21/2018,"Came here for a business dinner (approx. 30+ people), and really liked everything about the place:- Great neighborhood- Excellent service, from the minute we walked in- Everyone enjoyed the food (myself included, especially the pasta)- Really nice to see that they were able to handle a ""crowd"" like this, and serve up the food fresh and hot!Highly recommend!",,,
1,Mariana M.,"Phoenix, AZ",372,18,2,5.0,5/24/2018,"Initially we weren't sure if this is where we should go to dinner when we saw the rating but we're glad we did! It's a cozy modern feel, we waited to be seated in the comfy chesterfield by the fireplace. The service was great, everyone was friendly and worked as a team to make sure we (and I assume) everyone else was well taken care of. The food was really good, I got the Cacio a Pepe and Rafael got the Lamb. Both were delicious. And again, service was great. A place can have great food but when the wait staff doesn't work as a team it's just not the same experience. The only thing is that there was a bit of a funky smell when we first walked in but not bad enough to make us go somewhere else.",,,
2,Elizabeth M.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,95,174,3.0,9/18/2018,"Came in on a Tuesday evening after work with reservations and was promptly seated. Our server was courteous and gave the authentic Italian vibe in describing all of the specials for the evening. I was transfixed with the aesthetics of the restaurant as it provided a calming, warm vibe. We started off with a variety of samplers ranging from sausages, cheese and Olives which were delicious. I had a glass of White Wine which went perfectly with my Risotto. I am a bit spoiled as this is the second time having Risotto - the first time I tried it at another Italian restaurant was to die for, so I was truly looking forward to having it this time around. Though the presentation was beautiful, the flavor lacked some excitement. The risotto was rather dry despite the creamy texture. The service truly made up for the dishes. Now while I had a fabulous time with the company and attentiveness of the server, the food wouldn't quite drive me to come dine here with vigor. I would definitely come back and sit at the bar to sample their other specialty cocktails and nosh on appetizers instead.",,,

4,Cait M.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,103,30,4.0,7/7/2018,"This was an excellent authentic Italian meal. I felt slightly rushed even though there were not many ppl there, but after telling the waiter to slow down he obliged and apologized. The mozzarella w 20 month old prosciutto wrapped in filo dough changed my life. It was one of the best appetizers I've had in Williamsburg in a long time. The interior was super cozy and we were fortunate enough to eat in the window which was also awesome for people watching. The food was awesome, also had great wine and the Negroni Original. Definitely will be back.",1,,
5,Joe K.,"Rego Park, NY",1,15,5,1.0,9/22/2018,"I arrived at 8:05 for an 8:00pm reservation. The hostess asked me to sit on the couch and wait for my date to arrive, she did at 8:15. I asked the hostess when my table would be ready, she asked me to wait at the bar and have drinks, we did. The hostess came and got us to advise us a table was open 20 minutes later, she asked us to close out our tab, rather than offering to transfer it to the table. It took 15 minutes to close out the tab because the bar tenders did not have their act together. Then, as we pay the tab, the hostess comes up to us and advises us we no longer have a table, she made a mistake and the manager has some choice clients he must sit, so we no longer have a place to eat. Very nice.",1,,
6,Patrick W.,"New York, NY",226,179,709,1.0,12/12/2017,"I've eaten here many times - tonight will be the last. It pains me to give this review, a colleague told me about this place and I tried it based on his recommendation in late 2016. My rating is not based on the food, I think the food is fantastic.I picked Antica Pesa for a family dinner this evening. I didn't recognize the manager/owner I usually see here, I assume that's Lorenzo (based on reading reviews) with the mustache. Here's what we ordered.(2) Crudo e Bufala Croccante $20 ea.(1) Polipo Grigliato $18 ea.(1) Cacio e Pepe $20 ea.(1) Schiaffoni all'Amatriciana $20 ea.(1) Lasagna alla Bolognese $24 ea.The server (manager maybe) suggested the steak Fiorentina at $110 - saying each of us (4) would get maybe 3 or 4 slices each. Based on that price point, I declined. He then suggested an additional pasta, I agreed.(1) Spaghetti ""alla Chitarra"" e Vongole $32 ea.When the Cacio e Pepe and Schiaffoni all'Amatriciana came out, the server said he told the kitchen to split the pastas for the four of us. I felt the Cacio e Pepe ""portion"" seemed larger but I just brushed it off. The Spaghetti ""alla Chitarra"" e Vongole and Lasagna alla Bolognese came out separately. The ""split"" pastas was quite filling, we barely got through the Spaghetti/Lasagna. Neither were particularly great tonight and I've had both in the past.We passed on dessert and asked for the check. I expected it to come out to the dishes I ordered ($58 in appetizers, 4 pastas at $20/$20/$24/$32) to total $154 + 8.875% tax; totaling $167.66. Instead, I received a check that came out to $219.92. I was confused. The appetizers were billed correctly, the Spaghetti ($32) and Lasagna ($24) separately - then 4 ""Bittico"" charged at $22 each. I didn't ask for an explanation, I knew what this ""Bittico"" was when I saw it. What I don't appreciate is that the server took it upon himself to provide me with 4 of the ""Bittico"" without explaining this to me. I ordered 4 pastas, I expected 4 pastas and we'd plan to share them. There was no mention on their website or menu in regards to a sharing charge or something similar. If the restaurant would have had an issue with this, they should have brought it to my attention.I found it to be very disingenuous. I still left a tip at roughly 15% ($30) of the subtotal pretax, the other server who handled bread/water was quite nice. The venue itself is beautiful, I do think the food here is great but I don't want to be taken advantage of like this.I've eaten here many times since I discovered Antica Pesa. I've referred countless friends, family and clients here. It's a shame that I never wrote a review for them until now. A On the bright side, I won't have to update what would have been a 5-star review to the 1-star I feel now.Antica Pesa, you've truly disappointed me. I've enjoyed many meals here but I feel cheated. Such a shame.",4,1,1
7,E B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,2,2.0,10/14/2018,"I was so excited for my birthday dinner here, but came away disappointed. It didn't feel like the restaurant cared about your experience at all, and service is half the experience in my opinion.We had a 9:00 reservation and were seated at 9:35. They didn't acknowledge the inconvenience, if they had it wouldn't have been such a sore spot. Another party was offered Prosecco during their wait and when I inquired the hostess said ""well that was for the owner's party...do you want us to offer you Prosecco?"" That wasn't the point, and felt condescending.We finally sat at 9:35 and waited and waited until finally someone came over at 9:52 (yes by now I was keeping tabs on my watch). Even then there was no actual greeting to the point that I asked ""are you our waiter?"" We asked our menu questions, but weren't allowed to put in an order for an appetizer yet as everything must be ordered simultaneously. The food was okay - the cacio & pepe wasn't bad, but there wasn't much pepper so it was more like mac & cheese. The carbonara would have been nice except the meat was overdone, so each bite was overwhelmed with the flavor of burnt bacon. The eggplant was good.",,,
8,Ellie W.,"Boston, MA",523,578,142,5.0,3/20/2017,"I admit, I'm a little bit in love with the restaurant's back story, and its dedication to sourcing local, seasonal ingredients -- but the food is on point. I was mostly in an indulgent food coma for about 93% of the time and lamenting a nap while someone fed me everything (not sure why classical painters didn't paint that as a picture of heaven), so my memory is a bit hazy, but a few of the star dishes:+Polipo Grigliato - probably my favorite and filled with flavors that worked so incredibly well together: grilled octopus, mashed potatoes, celery, pomegranate and basil olive oil+Mezze Maniche alla Carbonara - Imported Italian pasta, parmigiano reggiano, pecorino romano fulvi cheeses, egg yolks, guanciale la quercia, black pepper+Guancia di Manzo - Beef cheek, red wine sauce, creamy polenta, parmigiano reggiano The ambiance is cute, intimate, modern, and all sorts of delicious. Can't wait to head back for another round of Italian food coma ;)",5,1,2
9,Ilda K.,"Palm Desert, CA",7,5,0,1.0,8/6/2018,"Pretentious server ( Tall gentleman with mustache and glasses), the most bland gnocchi I have ever tasted in my life. Also my friends pasta was undercooked. Besides the beautiful ambiance, this place is not worth anyone's time",,1,
10,Farah P.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",106,38,45,3.0,5/2/2018,I went here over the weekend. I really liked the interior and the food was very good too. I liked how attentive the staff was and the pasta had just enough sauce not too much like most places do. The atmosphere was nice and cozy with low lighting and lots of wine bottles every where. It's a perfect place to take a date. The reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because even though the place was basically empty we felt like we were rushed out by the staff. Weird,,,
11,Aderly K.,"Brooklyn, NY",139,25,0,2.0,8/11/2018,"Decent food but pricey for what it is. Bottled wines were priced at 3.5x-4x retail, which is very high -- places typically do 2-3x retail. Did not like the customer service.Place is also a bit pretentious. They did not seat us because only 4 out of 5 of us had arrived even when the restaurant was 90% empty on that Monday evening. We requested to sit down at our table instead of at the bar, yet still a no go after they asked 2 managers. I would not return.",,,
12,Sahul R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/15/2018,"My dinner experience lasted less than 45 mins. I walked in for valentines dinner at 9:30 and was out of the restaurant by 10:15. No thank you for your ambiance! I will have nightmares of eating at this restaurant from now on! To sum up this restaurant,1. Animated, pretentious and uncalled-for attitude of the host/hostess.2. Waiters are in a rush to send you back home from the moment you enter. What are you in a rush for? There were more than 5 empty tables around us.3. Average food - not worth the pennies! 4. And how stingy can you get with that wine pour? It was like a tasting quantity for $15.If you have money to go out and eat at this restaurant, I suggest you order a seamless and tip that delivery guy who delivers your food with a smile on his face.",2,1,
13,Tess M.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,0,2.0,1/26/2018,"Would love to give more stars as our waiter and food were great. Buffalo mozzarella app was amazing. Order it... as was their classic negroni. I found their pasta slightly too al dente but still good. I'm giving two stars for the staff. My party spent upward towards 1k and within 5 mins of paying the hostess asked us to relocate to the bar, of where there was no seating for the 5 of us. We spoke to manager and he specifically said ""two hours is enough"" with no remorse. Similarly to other reviews, this ended in a shouting match outside. Safe to say I won't be coming back. Rather spend that amount of money on a restaurant with superior customer service.",4,1,1
14,Linda S.,"Manhattan, NY",31,24,38,5.0,1/31/2018,"We received a recommendation to come to Antica Pesa when we were in Rome.  Loving all things Italian, we made sure to come here when we got home.  The decor is beautiful and welcoming.  It's classic and not over done.  There is a bar and lounge area that is separate from the dining tables.The staff was lovely, warm and welcoming.  The hostess was very friendly and gave us a nice welcome.  We met the manager Lorenzo and told him of our Roman connection.  He took the time to speak with us, ask us about our trip and then made sure we were happy with our table.The service started immediately when we sat down.  The staff came over with water, bread and olive oil.  We ordered a fabulous bottle of wine to start.  The menu is small but focused.  It reminded me of being back in Italy and included dishes that you don't normally find in NYC (such as the cacio e pepe).  For appetizers we had the grilled octopus and an order of the grilled calamari.  The octopus was outstanding, tender and tasty.  The calamari was just ok but you could tell it was fresh.  Our main course was cacio e pepe (naturally) and the new risotto with truffle that had just been added to the menu.  Both were delicious.During the course of the meal, the staff constantly checked on us as did Lorenzo.  When it came time for dessert, we had a great conversation about how challenging it can be to find a good cappuccino in the states that can compare to Italy (we both agreed it really does not exist).  However, he said to try his and add a little molasses which did help the flavor a lot.  We split a wonderful dessert (and they made one special for me as i have a severe nut allergy).All in all, we had an amazing experience at Antica Pesa and can't wait to go back.",2,,
15,Hugo H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,7,5.0,5/6/2018,"Currently living the area and can't stop coming here. It's become my favorite Italian restaurant ever - including my old haunts in Rome during an extended stay there. Service is better than anywhere in Williamsberg - and everything on the menu - which I've now pretty much had, is terrific and the best version of classic dishes you'll find anywhere. Nothing more to say except go!",,,
16,Roxana F.,"New York, NY",70,202,21,2.0,12/23/2017,"Antica Pesa could have been great, four stars, had it not been for a terrible FOH staffer who ruined the experience. From the moment I walked in, the hostess made me feel like I didn't belong there, constantly badgering me if I had a reservation (I did) with major attitude, and telling me I couldn't sit in their waiting area because I was there two minutes before they opened. Yes, I couldn't sit in the area designated for waiting. That should make you laugh, or roll your eyes. We also asked if we could sit in another table out of the way of the bar and those passing by, and were told there was a reservation for that table. Just FYI--that party never showed up in the time that were there, and there were plenty of other tables available as well. This attitude continued even until the end of our experience, with a shouting match between her and the person I was there with. You read that right, a shouting match. If there was ever a person high on the fumes of some assumed power from her position, it was her. I was not surprised to find that other Yelpers also had a similar experience with this employee based on some of the reviews I read afterward, and I eagerly await their manager to respond to this post with whatever ""version"" of the events they had, as they did to other Yelpers. They certainly weren't much help in the restaurant itself. Eye roll.But I digress. The rest of the experience was fine. Our waiter was attentive, helpful, and funny. The rest of the staff was also attentive although bordering on hovering. As soon as I took my last bite and would put my fork down there was someone there to take my dish. The food itself was fine, I wouldn't say worth the price necessarily but it was an experience. Someone ordered the penne pomodoro and the penne was stuck together. That shouldn't be the case in an ""upscale"" Italian restaurant. The fish I ordered was lovely but nothing special. Same with the dessert. Wines were priced like manhattan. Cocktails were the same but their pours were for children. I would not go back or recommend this place to friends.",5,,1
17,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,7,5.0,5/13/2018,"I've been to Antica Pesa for each of my last two birthdays which coincides with Mother's Day typically. Each time the food has been excellent and the service better than expected. I was not rushed and every effort was made to make my parents and I feel at home and comfortable. The food was out of this world always. The pasta is prepared like it's supposed to be. If you want soggy noodles go to Olive Garden. There is a feeling when you eat here that the food as been prepared with attention to detail and curated to a point where you can remember the meal by the menu items you try outside of your main course. This is right at the top of the list of the best places in Brooklyn IMHO. As for Yelpers feeling rushed; look...this is one of the most popular Italian restaurants in the world right now. It is small and small because they don't want a factory-like atmosphere. They want taste, and plate design with a hit of class. You can't just sit there talking for four hours about the silly things you're going to name your children and marvel in amazement at the fact that you all watch the same crap on Netflix.  Each and enjoy yourself but with all the bars, hotel rooftops and music venues in Williamsburg you shouldn't waste over an hour after your meal is over sitting at the table blowing hot air. Another thing you can like about this place is that everyone who comes in has a collard shirt or neat looking attire. This isn't a place to come dressed in your tennis outfit or Nike dri-fit. Food is excellent. Staff wonderful. Come here to start the night.",,,
18,A C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,23,5,1.0,10/28/2017,"BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT GO HERE. It is vile.SUMMARY:This place does not need you - or any customers. I mean, they're cool enough to be from Italy and have a place in Billyburg. This restaurant is about *their way or the highway* from the doorway to dessert, so get thee to a Burger King if you want any level of courteous service (or even to be treated like a human being).Oh, and the owner displayed the grotesque behavior of someone with serious instabilities and whom I literally consider to be dangerous. He physically & verbally attacked us in front of the entire restaurant and appears to hate women. THE STORY:We arrived promptly at 9pm for our reservation. The hostess said simply, ""Step inside. It's gonna be a minute."" So we stepped inside.After waiting 10 minutes, we found a seat in the lounge. We ordered wine & waited another 10 minutes for that. A total of 30 min in, another hostess came over & said, ""You can go pay for your drinks and then I'll be happy to seat you."" Yes, that's verbatim. And no, we weren't smart enough to leave right then.We went to our table, waited another 10 min. My boyfriend went to the bathroom & I agreed to order if anyone came over. Except we still had no menus. And no one came over. I waved to a nearby server & asked if we could have menus. He said...No. I explained how long we'd been waiting and he responded, ""We do not place menus until everyone is seated."" OK, I get that you have your thing & all, but under the explained circumstances you really should just make an exception. He refused. Finally, our server came over with menus and seemed nice enough. We ordered a bottle of wine. Guess how long that took to come over. By the time we got our entreés, it was 11:30. The vonghole my boyfriend ordered was an inedible, soupy mess. We waited & waited for our sever, but finally called over the menu guy from earlier. He went & got our server. My boyfriend told him how disappointed he was w/his dish and the server pretty much told us we were crazy, then disappeared again. A few minutes later, someone literally DROPPED a plate of tiramisu on the table in a sort of drive-by. Then we were really done. We called the server back over and he walked away to return with the owner. This is where it gets really good.The owner wouldn't even listen to ONE calm sentence of our horrible experience. He immediately started yelling at us & tore up the check. We reiterated that we didn't want free food or a complementary dessert - we just wanted the meal we ordered in a satisfactory state. There was no talking to this seemingly unstable individual. I finally got angry and said ""This is bullsh*t"" and he literally *pushed* me and screamed at me to leave. I'm 5'2"" and female. He then proceeded to whisper in my boyfriend's ear about ""this crazy bitch"" - yes, for real - and continued yelling at me between creepy whispers. My boyfriend finally lost his temper and yelled back, at which point the owner screamed louder and actually pushed us out onto the sidewalk. Really, we should have called the police, but we were both in shock.",6,3,3

20,Brent S.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,3.0,5/24/2018,"This is one of those reviews that unfortunately has more to do with a seating experience at Antica Pesa than the rest of the restaurant... We live in the neighborhood and checked to see if they had reservations open online. Turns out there were no shortages of tables for 2 people so we decided to show up (without making one) a few minutes later.The hostess asked us to wait in the cozy lounge area and suggested a drink while we waited. We checked in 15 minutes after and were told it's almost ready. 30 minutes after and again almost ready. 45 minutes after and no coherent answer. 1 hour later and the answer: 30-45 minutes. Not wanting to be strung along the journey of incompetency anymore, we left and went to Keste for some pizza. Not before paying for our drinks though - having anything taken care of by the restaurant would've required a hint of hospitality.We've loved Antica over the years as an authentic Italian experience between our business trips to Italy. Unfortunately after this experience we have never returned.",,1,

For main courses we ordered gnocchi, pasta in white sauce and the sole entrees. The fish was just mush, it tastes like it was frozen before and it was just drowning in water on the plate. I'm am not sure why my party didn't send it back. Pasta was a little too al dente, we joked at the table that we could possibly take it home and cook it again. Gnocchi was the best out the 6 main dishes but we definitely had better. We all did not even try finishing the main plates, they were very disappointing. I honestly don't think I'll go back to this place.",,,

Updated review","It was my least favorite visit here. I will still give them the same rating, after all they can't always be perfect. There 7 of us for dinner before a Brooklyn bowl show on Saturday. Our friends were 1 hour late for the reservation but the restaurant was very accommodating and let us seat at the table. We started at the bar. Our Italian bartender was absolutely charming and charismatic. He made us the tastiest mezcal drinks. While waiting for our friends we ordered a few appetizers: a cheese board, an octopus and a Burrata. A cheese board was not presented in the same impressive way as last time. All appetizers were tasty. For our entrees we had a few pastas, the branzino, the red snapper and the lasagna. One of the pastas was too dry so we had to send it back to the kitchen. It was done in a very sweet and thoughtful way. My branzino came almost raw. I decided not to complain but nobody asked me why I didn't touch it. This time the dining experience here was not perfect but what is? We had a great time regardless!",1,,1

31,Jaime M.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",179,6,0,1.0,5/13/2018,"I ordered the lasagna and my date ordered the lamb. There was a significant amount of talking by staff about the food and the anticipation was high. However we were quite disappointed that for all the talk and the claim the lamb was slow cooked for 20hrs (or 12 depending on the server) it was overcooked and dry and cost so much to boot. I had to send the lasagna back to heat up and it can back burnt. The ""nest"" salad was not a salad. Far from it. I'm Italian and never saw anything like this. It was $16 for a egg, a dollop of cooked unseasoned spinach and a bunch of thin dry crispy noodles I have never encountered. Save your money and cook for yourself. If you just want ambiance sure go here and try to impress your date. *eye roll*",,,
32,Leopoldo B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,5.0,11/1/2017,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in NYC, hands down number one in Brooklyn, perfect for a date but also fun for a group dinner. The place has a very cozy atmosphere, whether you're lounging on the chesterfield couch having an aperitivo by the fire pit or sitting at one of the corner tables. The food is unbelievable, there hasn't been one time where I skipped ordering the philo dough Mozzarella and Prosciutto as a starter, it's just a MUST, even if you do not eat pork, just get the damn Mozzarella because you won't get that anywhere else in the city. The pasta is always perfectly cooked and the classic Cacio e Pepe and Amatriciana are just as good as they are in Rome (I was born and raised in Rome). The staff is almost entirely from Italy, where waiting tables is a profession, they are Professionisti! The vibe is very cool and makes you feel at home. Very extensive wine selection and any cocktail you can possibly imagine at the bar. However, beyond all the specific ratings on food or decore, the atmosphere is what makes the difference, it's always a memorable time. Wish they open another one in Manhattan!!! Grazie Antica Pesa!!!!",,,
33,Brooke Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,0,1.0,2/19/2018,"Restaurant downhill. Menu is overpriced for the quality of food you are getting. The $35 black truffle risotto had 5 tiny slices of truffle on it, risotto had minimal to zero flavor and tasted like baby food. There are much better Italian restaurants in Brooklyn. If you don't feel like venturing out to the other better Italian spots than you are better off staying home and ordering Chinese food.",,,

35,Melissa K.,"Roslyn, NY",178,2,0,1.0,12/3/2017,The lasagna we ordered was terrible. Could not even eat it. The sauce tasted like cheap mac n cheese sauce. Definitely not worth it.,1,,
36,Lindsey C.,"Lawrenceville, Pittsburgh, PA",24,74,536,2.0,6/12/2017,"Dined here with some friends while visiting New York for the weekend and left feeling pretty underwhelmed with a large dent in my wallet. I actually called the restaurant ahead of time to be sure they could accommodate a vegan, the worker was so friendly and kindly checked with the kitchen for me. Downside was our waiter wasn't very attentive at all. It was unfortunate timing, as he was tending to another table of what seemed to be friends and was checking in on them often. Food did come out rather quickly, and our cocktails from the bar were fabulous. However was very under impressed with the salad ordered as a starter - it was essentially 10 pieces of lettuce.  The vegan pasta option was spaghetti with an arrabiata sauce - it came out cold, and the pasta wasn't even al dente but was undercooked. The rest of the table really enjoyed their entrées - the ravioli, spaghetti Cacio e Pepe, and the carbonara with egg yolk were major hits. We also arranged for a dessert to come out with a candle, and the house tiramisu was a hit. Just didn't have that great of an experience, being neglected by a waiter when you're paying for an expensive meal is never enjoyable. The ambiance of the restaurant is warm and inviting, but I won't be back given the service.",,,
37,Pdter M.,"Baldwin, NY",1,57,4,4.0,7/8/2017,It's 4th of July in Williamsburg and we just walked here from our hotel.The ambience is trendy but sophisticated. We shared a pasta dish of spaghetti in a pepper cream sauce. For our main courses my wife had the lasagna bolognese and I had the eggplant parmigiana. Everything was very good and the service was excellent. This restaurant is a bit pricey but the quality of the entire experience was worth it.,,,
38,Sylvia L.,"Forest Hills, NY",146,436,647,2.0,6/1/2017,Came here with a bunch of friends for dinner on a weekday. Simply put. NOT IMPRESSED. Service was spotty at best. The waiters were pretentious and didn't care to come by with water. They never looked to see if anybody needed anything. A good restaurant staff is trained to always be looking to see if your guests need something. They were definitely not on point when it came to that. Food  was average. Not anything special. Prices were high for what was being offered I don't have a problem paying higher prices for good food and excellent service but this didn't check off any of the boxes for me. One done!,,,

Please, Train your  Hostess Melissa, she has an arrogant attitude.We left after sitting at the bar for 5 minutes, not a welcome restaurant, I booked my reservation for the wrong date on OT , and she told me to step inside to check what she can do to accommodate us ( restaurant was empty ) while we were  waiting at the bar I was able to modify my reservation on OT and I saw plenty availability and I chose 6:30 pm, she came back to me she said "" we have a table, but you can seat just for 1hour and a half, I told her I modifed my reservation for 6:30 pm and I saw plenty availability .

41,Morgan H.,"Long Beach, CA",1095,805,1386,4.0,6/10/2016,"I came here on a Wednesday night for a late dinner, and there were only a few other tables dining. The restaurant has an extremely authentic feel to it, and the menu notes that they originated in the Trastevere area of Italy. Aside from one other table, we were the only patrons not speaking Italian. Everyone working there appeared to be from Italy and were speaking Italian as well. The ambiance is dark and well-designed with a modern feel to it.To start, I ordered a Tequila Mule and my friend ordered a classic negroni. The alcohol selection is upscale and we both enjoyed our drinks. They bring you out plenty of grilled bread to enjoy with authentic Italian olive oil, and our food was fantastic.Crudo e Bufala Croccante: Prosciutto di Parma served with fresh Bufala mozzarella cheese in a filo crust. This is served on 2 plates so that each person receives their own filo-wrapped mozzarella. The cheese was melty and the thin filo was a beautiful encasement. If you are a fan of cheese, this is the perfect start. Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe: Italian pasta encompassed by parmesan and pecorino romano cheese with black pepper. As a cheese fan, I was in heaven once again. The balance of cheese to pepper to noodles was just right, and the portion was more filling than it appears to be. This wasn't my dish but I kept stealing bites even after I was stuffed from my own dish.Mezze Maniche alla Carbonara: Made with the same cheese and pepper as the above dish but with the addition of egg yolks and guanciale. The tube-shaped pasta was al dente, perfectly coated with the delicious sauce. The guanciale seemed a bit overcooked to me and as as result I enjoyed this dish less than the other. While we enjoyed all of the food and were stuffed at the end, we didn't find the service to be pleasing. Our waiter was not friendly to us, but was very friendly to the people sitting next to us. We also only saw him about 2 times through the whole meal. We would have liked to order more cocktails during the meal and digestifs at the end, but couldn't get anyone's attention. It was a shame because the food was such great quality.",13,12,14

First of all the hostess is so mean for no reason. The execution of the food? Terrible. We had the Arctic char and it was dry, over cooked and not fresh. The vegetables that came with it were unseasoned and so meh.... also the presentation? What presentation ? There was none. I am so disappointed because we used to love this place. Don't go here.

48,Jaya C.,"Queens, NY",0,6,0,5.0,12/10/2017,"This place is our favorite in the entire city. The management always remembers us and makes us feel like we are guests in their kitchen, which is run wonderfully and the excellent menu NEVER disappoints. The prices are fair for the amazing love that clearly goes into the food, and their head hostess, Tia, always adds to the experience with her wonderful smile, professionalism, and her recollection of all of the regulars (names, their lives, etc.).  Lorenzo never stops bustling around the room making sure everyone is happy, and even though they have had a number of different bartenders, they've all been delightful. This is a great place for a date night, family dinner, catching up with a girlfriend, or anything else at all. Even though we don't live in the neighborhood anymore, we always trek the distance to make it there. We only wish we could go every week.",,,
49,Jeffrey H.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,26,0,1.0,9/28/2017,"Food was terrible. Service was poor. Sadly, nothing great to say about this place.  I was there last Saturday night and my friend and I could not believe how badly our evening turned out...total bummer.  One friend raved about this place, one friend warned me against going there.  I should have listened because it was the worst dining experience I have had so far in 2017.",,,
50,Kate E.,"New York, NY",102,16,4,3.0,3/20/2017,"I would love to give Antica Pesa another try as I have heard great reviews about it and the atmosphere is totally up my alley. With that being said, my first experience here was okay but as far as the food, it was nothing worth recommending. When I mentioned it to a friend, she mentioned that she also dined at Antica this past weekend and found the food to be okay but nothing worth raving over. Unfortunately, I am gluten free, therefore, I think this was the first issue when it came to what was ordered. My boyfriend and I decided to split items on the menu and went with two antipasti, one pasta and one entree. For our antipasti, we had: the grilled octopus and the beef tartar. The octopus was okay but a little chewy in some parts and too grilled in others. The beef tartar had a nice flavor to it but honestly, the serving size may have been better for a larger group as it made me a little nauseous to eat the whole thing. Our biggest mistake was the pasta, we chose the risotto since this was the only pasta on the menu I could eat because I am gluten free. In all honesty, if you don't LOVE beats (and I mean love), do not order this. The only flavor is beet. We barely ate any of this. Lastly, for our entree we had the chicken. Overall, this was good. It was an interesting combination and the flavor was nice. The chicken was a little dry so I wouldn't say it was anything spectacular but probably the best thing that we ate from the menu. Overall, the atmosphere and service will definitely bring me back to try it again. Our waitress was kind enough to remove the risotto from our bill since we did not enjoy it and she was very attentive during our dining experience.",,,
51,Brietta Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,534,312,3.0,2/26/2017,"I've wanted to try this place ever since I first read about its opening and was finally able to over last weekend with A to celebrate his birthday. We went right at 6 on a Saturday night and there were already a few tables occupied, which means they will seat you if you're earlier than their opening time. We did notice the table next to ours were offered different choices of bread, while we were just given two plain pieces, which were disappointed about. We started with the prosciutto, which everyone's raves about and had the spaghetti cacio de pepe and lasagna. The appetizer wasn't as amazing as we'd hoped and the pastas were both very salty and that is coming from someone who loves salty food. The nice manager advised us to start with the spaghetti, which gets cold fast and he was right because it got cold almost right away. The lasagna was the dish we preferred more, which was very hearty. The tiramisu was dealt the star of our dinner because it was delicious! It may have been the best we've had. It is garnished with chocolate pieces on top and around the dish, and goes so well with it. Definitely get it for dessert!",,,
52,Cheryl D.,"Plainview, NY",1,6,0,1.0,5/6/2018,"Awful dining experience at Antica Pesa in Williamsburg Brooklyn. We got there for a 6:30 PM reservation.  Restaurant looked beautiful and was empty.  My cousin's traveling from a long distance was caught in traffic and got there 25 minutes late.  Shortly before they got there our waiter told me that we needed to order right away because he had to turn the table over at 8 PM.  I didn't think keeping a table on a Saturday night for 90 minutes was reasonable but as they walked in we quickly placed our order.  We had drinks & appetizers and at 7:45 our main courses arrived but they made an error.  They brought 2 of the same dish and hadn't made what I had ordered (linguine with clams).  They told me it would take another 15 minutes to make my dinner.  I sat and watched them eat and when they were finished, my dinner arrived.  In between, I asked for the manager.  If our waiter wasn't so interested In turning our table around, he would have put in our order correctly.  The manager Roberto came over and I told him about the waiter's attitude.  He said they wouldn't ever push their customer's out of their restaurant.  I told him how we were treated and he was skeptical on what we had to say.  He took my dish off of our bill and said mistakes are sometimes made.  Yes, mistakes are made but the mistake about my dinner wasn't the big problem of the evening.  Also once I called over the manager, our waiter never came back to the table.  The bus boy and manager handled our table.  The biggest kicker was that there were empty tables all night.  The food was good but we won't be going back.",,,

54,Sean B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/31/2016,"There were six of us for dinner on NYE. Food was all right but the service was abysmal. We were told they planned 2 hours for service, which we were fine with; however, the staff didn't seem capable of turning a table in that time, including a 30 min wait between clearing appetizers and bringing our entrees. Again, this would've been fine except that as we were waiting for our server to run our cards, another random server/host/manager came up to us and said ""guys, you're 20 mins over your time limit. Please hurry up.""  When we told him we were just waiting for the check, there was no apology, just a lot of rambling and excuses. I had to ask him to please stop talking to us so we could settle our bill. In short: ambiance is nice, food is middle of the road and the staff is a mess. For the price point, there are definitely more worthwhile Italian places in NYC.",2,,

Literally have never had a meal I didn't like... and unfortunately we never have leftovers to bring home!

57,Alizeh R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,42,3,3.0,10/15/2017,"We ate here a few nights ago and I have to say the first reaction is to how crowded the place already is - especially where managers are standing and advising big groups of guests and that means all the servers keep bumping into your chair for a lot of the night (in this case that's what happened to my husband).We decided to share a pasta as our primi - clams and spagetti which ended up being very salty, with a few clams (chewy), and super oily spagetti (the pasta was el dente) -The steak was lovely, though overpriced and we had to haggle to waiter to let it be served medium rare instead of rare (it does cook on the steaming platter but I don't like my steak to be red on the inside which he wasn't so cool with but in the end relented). And though we had quick and attentive service through out the courses, when it came time to pay the bill my husband couldn't get anyone's attention.All in all I have mixed feelings on our experience.",,,

We ordered the file dough wrapped mozzarella with prosciutto as appetizer, then Schiaffoni al Amatriciana and Cacio e Pepe for the main course. Everything tasted great!  The server even precut the mozzarella and plated  them separately, it was so thoughtful.

We were introduced by our Italian friends who told us Antica Pesa is real and very much worth a visit. They were not wrong. I really enjoyed the food. The wait staff was very attentive and made some great recommendations and the pasta was indeed al dente (As advertised). Only downside is that the wait staff was up selling the food choices, I'm not a great fan of only recommending the expensive dishes as it doesn't do justice to either the menu or the kitchen staff.

61,Atida G.,"Austin, TX",10,3,1,5.0,9/6/2017,"After visiting the original Antica Pesa  in Trastevere Rome, which was an incredible experience - typical Roman dishes made from carefully selected ingredients and being showered with warm Italian hospitality and superb service, we went to Antica Pesa in Williamsburg NY in June 2017. This place is managed by a Lorenzo Pannella, of Pannelas family . Simon and Francesco are in charge of the original Antica Pesa, which was founded in 1922 and is running for four generations of this family. the NY space is very different in decor. It's contemporary and sophisticated but still warm and inviting with relaxed ambiance . The food was delicious and the presentation appealing as at the Roman location. We tried the standout classic dishes with a modern twist   at times. The traditional family recipes  using local seasonal products, artfully plated house made pastas , bursting with flavor and  a wide variety of all Italian wines and spirits makes this a true Italian experience , not less then in Rome!We'll absolutely  go there  again when visiting NY or Rome !",,,

The the service had devolved into the typical terrible service I expect from many Williamsburg establishments. In the service industry you should treat everyone as a guest. Because we walked in without a reservation and not all gussied up, we were treated like riffraff undeserving of their attention. Granted we didn't go a full three courses--the food was so bad I'm not regretting this decision--because we had a show to go to. But the food took way too long. The sauces on two of the dishes had dried out and crusted over while my lasagna was burnt. The food was flavorless. I haven't had a meal this bad in a long time. I want my money back. That was the worst $100 I ever spent. The only good thing about the meal was the Cherry Spritz cocktail. That was amazing. Kudos bartender!",2,1,

Having noticed Antica Pesa while doing errands we decided to give it s try !  RESULT : SUPERB. The restaurant is def clique yet casual ... def fancier than most Billyburg locales that we love  so much ! Great bar and feeling of being in another city or country aka Italy ! The bartender DEVON did not disappoint at all !  Friendly fun and makes a mean Martini ! Be sure to stop in when you want an upscale relaxing atmosphere.

Same with chicken cutlet entree, however after I paid my 600+ bill, I was asked to leave abruptly. Confronted the manger and was told my dinner was long enough.

69,Cyrus R.,"McLean, VA",43,40,16,5.0,10/23/2015,"Tl:dr; Exceptionally high quality food, great ambiance, and very helpful and congenial staff. Pricey, but you get good value for itThe longer version:Antica Pesa is definitely one of the most high quality, authentic places to get some kick-ass Italian food you'll find in the area. Coming our way stateside as an offshoot to a similar restaurant in a Roman neighborhood similar to Williamsburg, they simply know how to do things right here.For me personally, the mezze maniche alla carbonara tasted as good as when I had the privilege of eating the home cooking of a Roman friend of mine's old school Italian mother. Carbonara dishes you'd find elsewhere in the US are mere imposters, but here you're able to find the real deal.There were other dishes like their caponata that were also fantastic, but for me personally it was the pasta that put them over the top.As far as the scene goes, they've put in some effort re: lighting and decor to make it look pretty trendy. The room is filled with a subtle golden orange hue beset against dark brown mahogany. Generally I'm personally not too keen on scenes like this, but they definitely make it work.Keep in mind that the prices are fairly steep, but that's because they're catering to a higher end of the marketplace it seems. From my perspective at least, it's money well spent especially if you go with one of their pastas.Overall, very highly recommended place to go if you're looking for true Italian food and/or for a special occasion.",,,
70,Marta P.,"Woodside, NY",1,22,1,3.0,1/7/2017,Management saves on heat. Kept us very cold even after few complaints. Heat was turning on and off. People seating next to us were also wearing jackets while eating. Snobish.,,,

Fine, we were pretty happy with that.The food was ok but the service condescendant and unprofessional. From the busser who brought a flute of champagne that we never ordered (took it back as soon as he realized, didn't event leave it on the table), to someone else refilling water in our whiskey, to spilling the entire espresso pot served with the Affogato on our guest without much apologies what else can I say... Ah, they never replaced the espresso. The Affogato without the espresso poured on the gelato? just a gelato. The tiramisu was also very disappointing.One of the guest ordered a coffee but had to ask at least 3 times to get it and we are really not high maintenance people... Only Roberto, one of the server was pretty good.When leaving the place I mentioned to the owner/ or manager that the service was pretty bad but the place looked amazing, he said : ""Well we have a lot of good reviews, it was maybe a bad night for you (no apologies). what was wrong besides the coffee spilled, huh?"" Ok great thank you for your understanding...I guess Antica Pesa is one of this NY restaurant where they really don't care much about the guests but wants to turn table.

We arrived 15 mins early and when we asked about our table we were told ""what time was your reservation? your table will be ready at that time and not a moment sooner"" which was pretty rude. After we got drinks at the bar the rude hostess came back and said ""those drinks need to be paid for at the bar before I can seat you"" which is just a really terrible way to word it and extremely pushy. All you need to say is that the drinks can't be transferred to the table and please ask us to close out, like every other restaurant. Then, the table we were placed at was right by a station the servers constantly needed to access so I was hit in the head by passing servers with trays all night. We didn't receive menus for at least 20 minutes after we were seated and no one noticed until I got someone's attention. Overall the food was great but the service was pretty bad.",,,

A highlight for me was the prosciutto and phyllo wrapped mozzarella served with a tasty arugula spinach salad. Very delicious. The desserts served were so so. But the pasta courses were perfectly al dente. And coffee with dessert was a treat. We did have one of the servers hush us when we made a toast and were apparently too loud.

77,Julia Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,1.0,11/16/2017,"Worst restaurant experience in a long time.  Service was completely inattentive.  Waited over an hour for main course as we watched people around us eat, who arrived way after us.  Waiter forgot every item of our order - which was two items - and ask us to repeat twice.  Had to ask about the entree three times.  Had to ask for water three times...for some reason he kept filling my glass only half way?  Cacio e Pepe was extremely al dente.  Salad portion was small and Gorgonzola dressing was mild and unimpressive.  Staff kept bumping into our chairs.  I am shocked, considering the ambiance and menu.  Awful.",,,

79,Vincent L.,"Middle Village, NY",481,5,3,1.0,10/7/2017,"Last night my friends and I tried Antica Pesa for the first time. Walking into this place, I said to myself wow what a nice atmosphere. Then it was all down hill from there. As we sat down, we were given 1 baby piece of focaccia bread. Next came the appetizers. 2 pieces of prosciutto on the plate, not even enough for an infant. The grilled octopus, was 3 small piece enough for a mouse. Then came the linguine with clams. 3 freakin clams!!! Stay away from this place. It's robbery at its finest. If you want a nice jacked dinner go to Don Peppes or Maiella to eat like a Stram.",,,
80,G L.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",2,83,4,2.0,8/17/2017,"Very strange this place has lasted as long as it did. It was empty on a wed night. There is an overall soullessness that permeates here - into the food and the service . As the menu changes every twelve weeks ago - it's hard to know what to expect but think boring classics made with decent quality ingredients with very Italian names . We shared two starters, three pastas, three entrees. All of the above were agreed upon to be horrible except the steak which was very well cut and very well executed.  Del Posto offers a similarly authentic selection ...with a waaaay more interesting results. Waste of $500. One star for the busboys and one star for the steak .",,,
81,Jill S.,"New York, NY",14,386,0,4.0,3/31/2015,"Ladies and Gents - Antica Pesa is where it's at. A beautiful restaurant that is both spacious as well as gives an intimate feel, Antica Pesa is not your typical Italian restaurant that offers only pasta. They do have pasta, yes, but they have way more than that on their menu. The crudo e bufala croccante and la burrata nell'orto as appetizers are insanely good, and with a group of 6 the restaurant arranged individual plates with these appetizers instead of having us all go for one or two plates. For entrees our group ordered the lamb, branzino, monkfish, potato gratin, and pasta carbonara. All dishes were given rave reviews by the group except for the carbonara, which was quite salty and not very flavorful.The staff is excellent. Not only is the hostess polite and friendly, but she is full of life and hilarious! The service is excellent. Water glasses always full and staff always nearby to check on us.  I'm giving this review 4.0 stars only because I can't give 4.5. The only reason I'm not giving 5.0 stars is because the carbonara wasn't great and we did have to wait quite a while to get the check. Oh - go during the week. It was barely full on a Monday night which I think created a better experience for us!",,,
82,Taylor S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,9/30/2017,"The service here was awful. The servers, managers and staff were careless. We ordered a steak rare, it was medium well. It cost 110 dollars. We talked to a supervisor - he brushed us off and told us ""it wasn't medium well, it was because it was served on a skillet and cooked while at the table."" We politely asked to talk to the manager, at first he would not let us. Then the manager came over and was extremely defensive - he did not take the blame for any of his workers, he automatically told us next time we need to send the steak back before we say anything. That is not what we were getting at, we wanted to merely address the attitude given to us. Anyways, I will not be dining here again.",,,
83,Tanya B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,1,5.0,2/5/2016,"Beautiful.  Everything is beautiful.The space is large, open, warm and sexy all at the same time.The food is fabulous.  Simply lovely, authentic Italian fare. Dishes are served with care and an artful hand, are delicious and rather filling.  The Arctic char was perfection, butter smooth with a delicately seared paper thin crust.  The gnocchi (the ultimate test) was divine. I can honestly say this is the only time I've ever had truly Italian tiramisu in the States.  The kind you scoop out with a spoon and have melt in your mouth.We came with a well behaved 3.5 year old (a child accustomed to dining out & being in the company of adults).  We were greeted by a stunning hostess, Tia, and I instantly felt shy of having my child with me in such a stunning space with such a gorgeous staff. There was no need to be.  Not only is the fare authentically Italian, so are the people.  Unlike in Europe, going out in the States tends to have a sharp divide between places that make adults feel welcome and those that make children feel welcome. But just as it would be in Italy, Tia made me feel instantly at home and at ease at the restaurant with my daughter.  She was welcomed & treated kindly and respectfully just as any other guest would be.  I was transported back to my years residing in Italy, enjoying the beauty of good food, wine, and company.  As it should be!This made for perhaps one of the most relaxed, joyful, sparkling evenings I've had in Brooklyn.  Antica Pesca is a jewel of a restaurant.Go, enjoy ~ and you will enjoy ~ I can guarantee that you will not regret, and will most certainly be back.",1,,

Atmosphere, staff, food, decors, everything was absolutely outstanding.Before writing this review I read some of the old ones and I really don't understand what's wrong with you people. I find 99% of the reviews with less than 3 stars absolutely a disgrace.We had a reservation, were late by 1hr and 45 min and the hostess I read you guys criticizing so much was not only table to accomodate us in less than 10 mins but also gave us 2 glasses of prosecco on the house like it was their fault we were late. Thank you TIA you were funny, professional and very attentive. We sat down, our server Roberto understood what we wanted to eat and drink in less than 30 second, literally. You rock man, thanks for the wine pairing.Here's what we hadThe magnificent mozzarella and prosciutto ( to die for it's really not enough to describe how good this dish was) which me and my gf shared it (kitchen split the dish for us, so nice!)I got carbonara, my gf got amatricianathey came with a little table and offered cheese to grate (pecorino o parmigiano) and different peppers with different level of spiciness which i think it's brilliant.from the hostess, to the server to the manager the whole experience was absolutely incredible.Antica Pesa is your to go place if you have the ability to stop hating and actually be honest about good, tasty and real italian food. Half of you doesn't know anything about pasta and for who said no i don't want pasta al dente i actually want it cooked i can definitely tell you to stop eating pasta and most importantly do not review restaurant on pasta because you don't know, understand and can't afford to criticize it as pasta is MEANT to be AL DENTE, you don't like it? then go get chicken and broccoli at the chinese restaurant.Absolutely fantastic antica pesa, I will be coming a LOT and i will tell everyone about this gem in brooklyn !Bravissimi !

There 3rd brother actually lives and runs the restaurant in Rome.  I came on a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed. The restaurant apparently has a large celebrity following as scene by one of the owners, Francesco Panella's Instagram account as featured on Eater.com (ny.eater.com/archives/20…), and I can completely see why.  To eat I had the tasting menu which featured an appetizer (a puff pastry burrata and prosciutto), 2 tastings of pasta, and beef.  Everything was delicious.  The puff pasty burrata was exceptional.

I understand a suggestion of wine pairing-I work at an upscale restaurant- but I would never have used the verbiage and tone that was used. The waiter also kept suggesting we order more food after we ordered our entrees. Not everyone wants a 3 course meal. I could tell he was disappointed in our spending and I'm pretty sure I even saw an eye roll when I said, for the second time, that we didn't want a starter for the table. Won't be going back.

87,Casey M.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/15/2017,"Antica Pesa was previously my favorite Italian restaurant in New York, however after last night's experience I would have to be convinced to return. Last time I was there, a fight broke out and we still had a great experience and thoroughly enjoyed our food. Last night however was the opposite for both service and food quality. The kitchen lost power or gas and we were told there was no pasta options - disappointing as this is the main reason we go there, but we adapted and added a different dish to make it a 3 course meal. However, as we were finishing our meal, we noticed pasta being served to another table - when inquired, the response were were given was oh that was part of a 3 course meal ticket and offered no apologies or real answer. We were understanding about kitchen limitations, but clearly those limitations were only for a fewThe food we did have was sub-par, particularly the branzino which was more a bland pile of mush than the delicious branzino with fried eggplant and olive oil mashed potato which our waiter described.Also, we got the branzino because they said they were out of chicken in addition to the pasta.After the disappointing meal, we were finishing our wine on the couch by the fireplace (more to get away from a patron continuously shining her iphone flash light in our faces) when the front door was propped open despite no one passing through, making the area very chilly. Unsuccessful to get anyone's attention, I got up and asked the bartender if it was ok if I closed the door. His response was ""whatever"", so I closed the door. A few minutes later, overheard the maitre d a few feet away complaining about me closing the door, which I found very unprofessional and rudeOverall extremely disappointed in the quality of both food and staff - used to say is a must go, now I say stay away",,,

92,Tony P.,"Miami Beach, FL",25,38,120,4.0,11/11/2015,"Initially I would rate this restaurant a Very Good; I try not to be influenced by what others are saying (around me). The restaurant is a spacious beauty with very large light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, a waiting area with comfy leather couches, a very large bar (which seemed to be an interesting place to sip a cocktail or a wine or even a hot tea), and even room for a family style table at it's entrance. The tables, lined up and down the sides of the dining area, as well as placed down its center, were spaced well- unlike it's sister restaurant of the same in Trastevere (Rome, Italy) which I and incidently, so did the entire party with whom I dined.The somewhat limited wine list seemed a bit pricey (or have I been jaundiced by the offerings in Miami Beach where I now reside) ranging from a few bottle priced in the $45 area to well over a $100 (but maybe it was because I was picking a red- Lagrein Koessler- which was quite good at $55), the appetizers settled in below $20. The pastas were the lower priced offerings and the entrées in the $20 to $30 range- quite typical of the trendier restaurants in NY. The desserts were moderately priced. Expect to pay just shy of $100 per person with tax and tip.All of us settled on a small bowl of pasta e fagiole that was unlike that we were used to (""it almost tasted like a cream of mushroom soup""); I was the lone diner who ventured away from the grilled, sliced, well prepared pork loins (and bellies) (Mailino Porchettato) with veggies than included sautéed endive; I had a dish of thinly sliced beef with sliced onions in a glaze prepared table side on a hot stone (Straccetti alla Piastra), with fingerlings and mushrooms of the day. The desserts looked good and we're just that with a nice assortment of flourless cakey choices, an obligatory Affogato which was shared by the ladies, sorbets and gelati (which was shared by the men). Oh, you can a large selection of the food gluten free.One word- impeccable, attentive (okay, that was two). Nice touches, too: an assortment of hot peppers that were cut by the waitstaff and choices of cheeses freshly grated, added to whatever.",1,,

95,TJ K.,"New York, NY",41,11,1,4.0,3/14/2016,"An excellent Italian! The problem with many restaurants in the W'burg area of Brooklyn is an amazingly superfluous sense of arrogance and pretentiousness. This place has none of that. Both the service (all Italian-speaking, slightly cocky, but professional) and the food were what you can expect from a proper Italian restaurant. As for the ambiance and interior design: modern, sleek, nice. Not too loud either!The antipasti were premium quality, though some cheeses should not be served as cold as they were, that's the only minor I can think of... The entrees (branzino and beef) were both cooked to perfection. Bread served throughout the meal was top notch, so much better than the nasty tangy stuff so often served in NYC restaurants. A fine wine list, nothing too complicated, complements a wonderful selection of dishes. All in all, I can only think that the menu is not very creative, but quite honestly, that's what you really should hope for with Italian fare, especially in hipster land!",,,

A bit too dark to take pictures but...hey, the world is not perfect! And with a flash its not bad.So, ambience very nice, the service very very nice and fun. Timing between a dish and another was perfect too.Ask them to show you the wine list of their restaurant in Italy... you'll adore it if you are a wine fan (just make sure you are not ignoring your partner for too long...!) Octopus with lentils was delcious, there was a fresh lemon taste which made the dish interesting. The carbonara pasta was FANTASTIC, the guanciale was perfect, crunchy as it should be and as they make in Rome. The saltimbocca were different from the original recipe but really really good, worth the try.Only one ""weaker"" dish was the fried artichokes and sweetbreads. A bit too greasy, and the artichokes were so thin that it was not possible to realize that it was artichoke. I would just suggest the Chef to go for bigger pieces! Sweetbreads were very good.A very nice place to go with friends or even romantically in two, you'll enjoy!",,,

I took a few bites and told B I just couldn't eat it, and felt bad, because I really hate wasting food.Tagliolini alle VongoleHomemade tagliolini pasta,little neck clams, zucchini and cherry tomatoes with a fennel and saffron sauceThis was better than the other pasta, and I was able to finish my portion, but this dish wasn't very memorable.What was memorable about this place was the bread service and the additional side table they add to your regular table when you need more room.I also want to say really good service, and I would come back here for drinks.",1,,

I came here in the hopes of ordering certain dishes only to find out they were unavailable. That's what happened here.  I'll make this short and sweet. This restaurant isn't terrible. The food is actually very good. I wanted to try the homemade marinated sardines and the braised beef & polenta w/ Taleggio cheese and my fiance wanted other items that weren't on the menu. Unfortunately, they had a completely different menu, with the exception of house favorites. For antipasti, I ordered the prosciutto & mozzarella in phyllo dough and my fiancé chose the grilled octopus. They were amazing. Our plan was to order the two pasta tastings to share and then order two separate entrees. We didn't care for the secondi section of the menu and they didn't have any specials, so we opted to go with the pasta as our main courses.I ordered the Cacio e Pepe and my fiancé went with the Amatriciana. They were perfectly executed. My pasta wasn't too peppery or too cheesy which can happen sometimes with this dish. It was delicious. The sauce on my fiancé's pasta was very flavorful and it had a great, bold taste. They offer a tasting of the two. I would suggest going that route because the entree portion of either becomes one note and too much of a good thing after awhile. Concord grape sorbetto was a nice, light finish to a very good meal.We had great service and the decor of the restaurant is warm, cozy and inviting. I particularly enjoyed the lighting and the fireplace adds a nice touch. I recommend Antica Pesa.",,,

The atmosphere , the food and the waiters were all very good although the portions are on the small side. What really put us off was the hostess. When we arrived the restaurant was virtually empty. She seated us at an exposed table in the center of the restaurant. When we asked to be seated at a more intimate table at the side of the room she refused, because the table was set for one person more than the number in our party. Keep in mind that there were plenty of tables empty at this time. The table we had asked for remained empty the whole time we were there and just as we left one table setting was removed. The hostess made no effort to make us feel welcome or appreciated as clients and perhaps she is not the best person for this position, because the rest of the staff was professional and courteous.",,,

This decor is unique in a neighborhood that is home to plenty of shabby-chic spots. The hostess really stood out, with her friendly attitude and warm personality. My boyfriend headed to the bar for a cocktail. The hostess noticed that I didn't have a drink, and brought me a glass of champagne while we waited. I really cannot express how wonderful this woman was! Once we got to our table, we looked at a menu with diverse options that were clearly labeled as vegetarian, vegan, and/or gluten free. Our waiter was lovely and gave excellent suggestions for a wine to pair with the cheese plate we ordered. I had the gnocchi with sweet potato sauce. (I practically licked my plate it was so delicious). My boyfriend had the caccio e Pepe spaghetti. It was also very good, but it was the least impressive part of the meal. Before asking for our check, the manager stopped by to chat with us and give us his card. He also threw in the most delicious tiramisu I've ever had, as an apology for the brief wait we had for our table. Altogether, we were both extremely impressed with the experience. I will definitely be back, and I've already referred several of my friends.",3,,1
115,Tom A.,"Oakdale, NY",0,18,3,4.0,9/22/2015,"Had dinner here last Saturday with friends. Very lively, busy and beautiful place.The food was amazing. The problem we had was that they were very short staffed. Tables not cleared after apps..too many dishes on table..we had to remove our dishes and glasses ourselves and used a random cart that was left next to our table. We had trouble getting drink orders placed and needed to get up and get cocktails ourselves from the bar.I think it's worth going back to and I will for sure, however i'll probably go back on a weekday night and I bet my experience will be much better.They should be better staffed for busy weekend evenings.All in all, we had a great time..we laughed that we needed to clear our own table and get our own drinks, but we had fun and that's what counts.",,,

However, the food is consistent.For appetizers, we ordered the grilled octopus, the prosciutto and mozzarella, the arugula salad with artichokes and zucchini, and the delicious smoked duck. All appetizers were tasty.We shared several main dishes such as the lamb ragu lasagna, the spaghetti ""cacio e pepe"" and the wild salmon with caponata.Service was efficient for a busy Saturday night.All in all, a solid 4 star place.",1,,

The pastas at Antica Pesa are outstanding. The cacio e pepe could not be more perfectly al dente - you won't even get spaghetti this exquisite at Scarpetta. The lasagna is better than the one at Del Posto. Sorry, Scott and Mario. I love your restaurants, too, but this food takes me back to Italy. And the service is just as friendly.With that said... the kitchen can be fearfully slow, even when the restaurant is half-empty. And I prefer my bread before the meal fresh and warm but not toasted. Small prices to pay, though, for those pastas.",1,,

There are not many places here that have good pasta but this place is very promising. I especially enjoyed their spaghetti cacio e pepe (wanted to see how well they can make this simple dish).People were pretty dressed up and the clientele was older than your usual crowd in Williamsburg (which to me is usually an indication that the restaurant has good service and food).tckbelly.com/2013/03/12/… I am definitely going to go back and try their other pastas.,2,,

The service was horrible as the waiter spilled vodka shots all over me and then did not apologize. When I tried to speak to the manager, he put all the blame on someone at my table and even shook his finger in my face. He was extremely rude and did not even apologize. He has no understanding of personal space and got very close to my face and did not even let me speak.

The ambiance, décor and customer service was great! I love the area that looks like a living room it was very cozy and added to the great vibe. The menu was just okay to me. I noticed that there are so many reviews here that says the menu is exceptional but for me it was just okay. I ordered the Risotto all'Astice and my bf ordered the Spaghetti Cacio E Pepe. My dish was good however I left hungry and my bf portion was even smaller. The presentation of the food was great, the taste of the food was good however I still left with more to be desired. The waiter altho he was nice and attentive when I asked him what wine paired with my meal best he was unable to give a recommendation. Maybe he isn't good with that type of thing but I expect that from waiters when I am dining in restaurants of this caliber. Overall it wasn't a bad experience it was okay.

I ordered the Schiaffoni all'Amatriciana and it tasted as if it came from Olive Garden. The pasta was not salte and the sauce tasted as if they opened a new can of crush tomatoes and didn't let it simmer with onions or guanciale (which was likely the case).

131,Y. J.,"New York, NY",9,15,22,1.0,8/26/2014,"3.5 stars for good but overpriced food, thoughtful presentation, and attentive service from wait staff.  ZERO stars for mind boggling rudeness from authoritative-looking man patrolling the premises all evening, presumably one of the 3 brothers who run the restaurant.  Yes Francesco, I'm talking about you.  But if you think I'm confusing you with another authoritative looking man in a blue blazer / white pants getup, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong. I had dinner here with my boyfriend last Friday.  Francesco stopped by our table several times over the course of the evening to check on our dining experience.  He was generally polite, solicitous, and making a good show of being a gracious host, BUT with one exception.Each time he came to our table, Francesco made a bee line toward my boyfriend, made eye contact only with him the whole time, and behaved as if I didn't exist.  After this happened several times, it dawned on me that he was coming from the mindset where the man of the table is the only voice that needs to be heard, as he picks up the bill and speaks for the woman.  The woman is to be seen but not heard, as her role is by and large decoration + arm candy.  It felt like a scene straight out of Mad Men.No, I was not distracted or looking another way.  I was actively looking up in his direction, in such a way that if he had registered my existence the slightest bit, eye contact would have been inevitable.  And no, this was not a large table that would have made a brief acknowledgement and attention to each guest impractical.  There were only two of us seated at a small table.  And no, I am not a toddler, deaf mute, or foreign tourist who speaks no English, where a simple ""how is everything so far this evening?"" would have come off as moot or insensitive.  I happen to be an adult, non-speech impaired woman in her late 20's who speaks English just fine.   I'm not an easily offended person, or an over-zealous feminist constantly looking for a bone to pick with strangers.  I don't walk into restaurants expecting the world to revolve around me.  I wouldn't expect acknowledgment of any kind when, say, eating out in a country where women are considered second class citizens, or in a fluorescent-lit hole-in-the-wall where customer service is clearly not a priority.  But Antica Pesa is none of those things.  It's a sexy, sleekly designed fine dining establishment with prices to match, where bread is served in elegant long wood boxes ... where waiters bring you a plate with 4 different kinds of fresh pepper to choose so they can snip small delicate pieces onto your pasta ... where the staff spends a small eternity serving pasta onto your plate with painstaking, loving care, when I could have done it myself for 5 seconds or less.  In short, it's the type of dining establishment that asks -- if not positively screams -- to be judged on customer service and treatment, because it bills itself as such to the public eye.  In this context, the rudeness I experienced there, in stark contrast to the treatment of other guests that same evening, was jaw dropping.Absent an apology or explanation from management, I WILL NOT RETURN.In closing, I just have to say: Francesco, there are way too many good dining options around for women to put up with that kind of behavior, let alone from a midtown Manhattan power lunch spot that somehow ended up in Williamsburg.",15,9,3

The classic dishes like mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, ""cacio y pepe"" and ""sciaffone"" pastas, the leg of lamb entree are all fantastic, and the additional ever-changing seasonally-updated menu options keep me coming back time and time again.Definitely make reservations if you are coming on a busy Friday or Saturday night, or if you have a larger group. I've eaten here with groups of 12 on down to just myself, and the owners and wait staff make each meal feel like a special occasion.

143,Christine L.,"Brooklyn, NY",161,45,3,5.0,10/5/2014,"Antica Pesa shines in every way. It was our second time here and I can honestly say, yes, I'll be back, and yes, it was better than I remember. Be warned, if you were there at 9:30 on a Saturday, you may have had to wait, and perhaps the timing of your dinner may not have been fast as you are used to, but for my husband and I, that isn't a problem. When you are eating food this good, I don't want to rush through it and then end up with agita. We started out with Crudo e Bufala Croccante; what was fabulous was that they split the order so that my husband who is not gluten free could have the mozzerella in the pastry and I had it plain. It is an amazing appetizer. I have no idea what the supposed chef below was talking about with regards to the cheese being tough--the buffalo mozzerella was creamy and perfect--an absolute delight--and mine was room temperature, which indicates that the plain mozzerella that I was served is fresh and in standing salted water before it was served. If you are Italian, you know this is the only way to keep mozzerella from getting hard and stringy. For our main entrees, my husband got the canelonni with lamb ragu which he salivated over and were gone pretty fast. I got the bronzino wrapped in potato slices with roasted red peppers, asparagus, and eggplant--not normally a gluten-free dish on the menu, but one which they made an exception and made for me, in spite of the kitchen being very busy. The dish was absolutley amazing--bronzino skin was crisp, potatoes were crisp, fish light and flakey, peppers and eggplant the perfect succulent compliment to the other flavors and textures on the plate--a truly perfect dish. This should never go off the menu.Dessert continued on a high note; we had a trio of sorbets and a peach crema cotta. What a meal--we cleaned our plates. Perfection.",1,,

Upon arrival they seated us right away and gave us the perfect spot so the stroller was not in anyone's way.  We started with white wine and the best appetizer I've ever had - Crudoe Bufala Croccante!! We then switched to red wine to pair with our main courses - the Mezze Maniche Alla Carbonara & the Schiaffoni All Amatriciana. We aren't familiar with Italian wines but we told our waiter what we usually like and he picked the perfect ones for us.Although we only tried a few things- everything we did try was beyond our expectations and we can't wait to come back.

Saw the front of house managers fighting with each other in the middle of the dining room, that should have been our first red flag. Waitress took our full order, 15 minutes later the appetizer came, grilled octopus over potatoes. The potatoes were lukewarm and the octopus was blend. Our drinks had yet to arrive even after we finished the appetizer, they sat at the bar for 20 minutes because the waitress was nowhere to be found. When the drinks arrived the ice had already melted. It gets better - the glass was cracked.  Now for the mains- the overly hyped Cacio e Pepe was a disaster. The first one was like a cold soup, so I asked the waitress for a new dish. It came out warmer but tasted terrible. This place has no quality, all smoke and mirrors.  Do yourself a favorite don't go there.",,,

153,Jae Z.,"New York, NY",183,356,30,3.0,11/20/2013,"There was an article in Slate a few weeks ago on whether we still have a reason to go to Europe when most anything we could want from Europe can be had stateside. On some level, Europe can be overly romanticized by Americans. Is it the perpetual colonial inferiority complex? By contrast despite growing popularity of Chinese food, and the elevation of food as an art form, most people are not making the connection between these two trends. Unless it's a Jean-Georges venture, Chinese and southeast Asian food seem to be most authentic when it's found in a dive or hole in the wall, which is ironic because I almost never eat at anything less than banquets in China...Yet, a too fancy venue has never detracted from authenticity of an Italian or French place. Au contraire, I think it's not an uncommon practice to use fancy interiors to create the illusion that here is a place to be taken seriously despite the very average and pedestrian food. The food here is not the occasion, it's not worthy of the decor. Some of the appetizers appeared more promising but after tasting the cacio e pepe introduced by the bartender as ""Italian Mac and cheese"", I had no inclination to try anything else. Frankly, if you're going for a class act, you might not want a self proclaimed foodie bartender to make such clumsy presentations of the food, who incidentally can't make any proper cocktails outside of the house menu (my old fashioned tasted like it came from a fake Irish bar in midtown). Aside from that everything else is simple as can be, which is fine if I were just looking for a cheap lunch time option in Florence, but the pomp and circumstance led me to believe this would have been a more exceptional meal. It's like going to Spice Market (I've never been) for pad Thai.  But then again, you would, right.",4,4,1

157,Meghan A.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,17,10,5.0,1/19/2014,"When I arrived at Antica Pesa at 6pm, I had fairly low expectations because I'd gathered that it was more of a place to ""be seen"" than enjoy delicious Italian food. Because we arrived when it opened, we were kindly greeted by a majority of the restaurant staff and seated at a great table towards the back. My visiting friend had been to the sister restaurant in Rome and gotten to know the owner Francesco well, which was our main purpose for checking this place out. Unfortunately Francesco was back in Italy, but we enjoyed meeting his brother Lorenzo.Our bread and suggested wine (a red blend) arrived quickly and both were lovely-- the restaurant's signature olive oil and bread is definitely worth the calories.We started off with the vegetable sampler, which I would never have chosen myself (I had my eyes set on the beef carpaccio, but opted to pass on a second app) and was very impressed with the quality and presentation. It included a unique type of hummus, fried phyllo/dough and some delicious chilled marinated vegetables. My entree was the Pesce Crosta-- the market fish (cod) that had a sunflower and pumpkin seed coating and was served over some sort of thinly sliced starchy vegetable in a delicious unknown sauce. It was very good, but my friend hit the jackpot with her Coniglio Arrosto-- roasted rabbit stuffed with sausage, wrapped in bacon, topped with a Concord grape sauce and served with broccoli rabe. It was truly out of this world! I'm not usually a fan of broccoli rabe, but this garlicky preparation was amazing. I also loved that the protein entrees were surprising large enough to satisfy and left us feeling quite full, despite not having ordered any pasta. We ended with the tiramisu and the chocolate plate for dessert, which I'm sad I forgot to take a picture of. The chocolate plate consisted of what I'd describe as a flour-less brownie with a scoop of homemade chocolate gelato topped with a berry sauce... Pretty much heaven on a plate.We probably overstayed our welcome as we were there for over 3 hours drinking wine and enjoying the lovely ambiance. The service was great the entire time. Call me cheesy, but I loved being ""shmoozed"" by the owner and other manager... The attention placed on our happiness, as well as all the other tables we watched them visit, was appreciatively noted.If I HAD to find one thing negative about our experience, it would be our server's suggestions. (And this is me being VERY picky as a long-time waitress/bartender in the restaurant my parents built from the ground up). For each course, as well as wine, we asked for his suggestions and every single time he immediately named the most expensive item on the list. While it's very possible that these suggestions genuinely represented his/the chef's opinion of the food, (as he truly was a good server) one can't help but question the sincerity of his suggestion. As a couple of laid back girls who spent over $100 each on dinner and wine at an upscale restaurant, the thought of ""upselling"" at every turn possible just doesn't sit right with me. But hopefully it was just a coincidence ;)All in all, expectations exceed. HIGHLY suggest and can't wait to return!!",1,,2
158,Elio A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,2/9/2016,Great experience.First time. Went on a Saturday night with a 9:00 pm reservation. We arrived early and hung out by the fire place. They received us very well and were running a bit late with our table. To apologize they gave us a glass of Prosecco. Very much appreciated.The meal was really good. The appetizers are abundant. We had the salad and mozzarella and prosciutto. One would have been enough.Pasta portions are very generous as well. All very tasty and delicious. Great service and crowd/ambiance.Recommended.,,,
159,Courtenay W.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,5,0,4.0,8/10/2013,"I'd read a pretty rough review in the New Yorker, so I think I was expecting to be disappointed, but I was so very pleasantly surprised. Had a reservation for three people at 7pm on a Wednesday were seated immediately at a great table towards the back. Each of the three cocktails we ordered were delicious: the St. Germaine and prosecco was crisp and refreshing; the passion fruit, lemon, agave, and tequila concoction called Dana's Passion; and they made a great Old Fashioned.We were presented with a wooden chest stocked to the brim with warm sliced Italian breads and bread sticks and ordered the cheese plate to start. It came with generous portions of a creamy bleu, slices of a good manchego, a tart cherry jam, and honey. We all ordered the split portions of the Spaghetti Cacio E Pepe, buttery without being too heavy, and the Schiaffoni All'Amatriciana, perfectly al dente pasta with smokey guanciale in a light tomato sauce. They arrived along with a sort of pasta sommelier who provided freshly grated parmesan and a spicy pepper-infused olive oil. On the topic of sommeliers, he was very helpful and knowledgeable and steered me towards a red blend that was perfect with our meal and less than what I was considering.A generally lovely dining experience. I'm looking forward to heading back and trying other dishes (though I will probably always try and talk whomever I'm with into splitting the pasta duo for a pasta course). Not cheap, but not overpriced for the quality of food and drink. Ambiance is a little industrial, a little restoration hardware, a little meatpacking with the big white drum chandelier; pretty quiet when we got there, but was picking up as the evening went on.",6,1,5
160,Mikkel B.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,8,0,1.0,4/9/2015,"What a horrible and arrogant restaurant experience. I went to dinner with my mother (60+) and my fiancée, our waiter had no service skills and spoke down to us several time, made verbally fun of my mother, who asked for a wine spritzer (half wine half seltzer), and rushed us through our dinner. We couldn't eat any of our two main dished, so asked to have it to go. The waiter returned with one small plastic container, where both dishes where smashed together: grilled monkfish, duck breast and pork-belly. Our $60 entrees were ruined. When the manager came down, I told him about our bad situation, he didn't seem to care and did not want to take any action.   I have been dining here several times since the restaurant was opened and even visited the restaurant in Rome. I never expect any restaurant to remember a guest from earlier visits, but this will absolutely be the last time I will ever visit Antico Pesa. I still tipped 20% as I felt bad for the runner and hostess, who depend on tips that for their wages.",3,1,

We entered the restaurant thru the wrong entrance by accident. The hostess told us to go back out the wrong entrance, and enter thru the correct entrance. I was so embarrassed.

Updated review","This place has it all, truly. From the decor, to the food, to the ambiance and PERFECT service. Antica Pesa is truly a gem. The owners and employees make you feel like a special guest in their home every time you enter. The food is incomparable to any other Italian restaurant in NYC. EVERYTHING is delicious, but particularly their famous Roman pasta dishes like cacio e pepe and amatriciana. I recommend this restaurant for a date night or a special event, or just any day of the week because it really is THAT good. The space is large, open and really sexy. The wine list is delightful. Every employee, from the hostess to the bussers are well trained and provide the best service I've ever had. Antica Pesa is a true jewel of a restaurant. I can only assume these negative reviews are written by competitors because I've been numerous times and don't have a single complaint. Go and enjoy a true Italian experience, I can guarantee that you will not regret it, and will most certainly be back.",2,,
164,Emily W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,7,0,1.0,6/2/2013,"I can not even review the food because I did not get to eat there.  I made a reservation for a party of 6 for Saturday night.  We arrived on time to be told that the table was still occupied and it would be 15 minutes. It was suggested that we sit at the bar to wait.  We waited and soon 20 minutes without being told what was happening.  As the hostess came by, we said loudly that it would be nice to sit down. She then mentioned that  it may be another 15 minutes.  My cousin who was joining me for dinner asked if we could have some bread while we waited.  This request was not honored nor was the request for just a glass of water honored.  Our patronage at the restaurant did seem to be a priority for the staff nor was our comfort a priority  At 9:03, we decided to leave the restaurant. Based upon my experience on Saturday, I do not think I will ever be trying the food at this restaurant.",4,3,
165,David S.,"Woodbury, NY",97,12,0,5.0,6/3/2013,"I have a friend who loves food!  When he eats at a restaurant and the food is great he will call me right away and say ""Dude FOOD was SICK""!  Which means we need to go try it.  So we made plans with 3 couples to go out for dinner.  One of the couples bailed last minute because he thought traffic from Manhattan to Brooklyn was going to be 2hrs...Take a train we all said....I don't take the subway!  Well his primadonna ass missed out on a fantastic dinner and time with friends....We had a reservation at 730pm but my fiancé and I got there early around 630pm.  I suggest going to the Brooklyn ale house before 7pm for happy hr!  $5.00 beers and it is next door to Antica Pesa.  Good starting point if you want to save a few $$ on your first few rounds of drinks. Maybe this review would be a little better if I didn't have the beers and whiskey before, because I might have a tough time remember what everyone ate at the table.Staff was great from the moment walking in the door the manager or owner (foggy) recognized my friend and it felt like he knew him for years.  We ordered a few glasses of Rose and it was delish!  Our other friends (not the no train guy) finally arrived (they took the subway) and we sat right away.  We all decided to order a bunch of appetizers for the table (here is where I might fail you).  We got the Salmon tartar (delish), octopus (melt in your mouth goodness!! Might be better than the Greek places that know how to cook octopus), crispy eggplant chips and some type of cheese (yum), prosciutto (which my friend said my fiancé and I ate the whole thing without sharing - I don't believe it), and something else I think....sorry can't remember.For dinner I ordered the carbonara and my fiancé ordered the cod...I think one of the couples ordered some type of spaghetti and from the look and sound it was like that lady and the tramp movie, him and his wife slurping down the meal face to face... so I get my dish and It looks beautiful with a side little dish of the frothy egg ready to be placed on top of the pasta when all of a sudden my fiancé spills her glass of wine on my plate.  I quickly mopped it up with a napkin and my buddy told me the next day it looked like I was going to cry.  But after all the wine was mopped up I took a bite....wow it was sick!  The pancetta was crispy and the egg adds a nice creamy elements to the dish.  I was in heaven!  My fiancés cod was good but if and when I go back I am sticking to the carbonara and will make sure my fiancés wine is nowhere in sight.  Food was great, service was fun and friendly and we will be back soon!  So my friend is now 3 for 3 and I have posted all on yelp...we are going to Greek restaurant on LI this Thursday so you might see another posting from me soon!",3,2,1

167,Geraldine L.,"New York, NY",9,12,0,3.0,6/19/2015,"This place would have gotten 5 stars had it not been for our sneaky waiter! Mid-meal, my friend asked the waiter for a glass of red wine. The waiter asked what kind of red, and she said she liked something with a full body. The wine he brought her was excellent. In fact, myself and our other friend tried it and commented on how good it was. When the bill came, we noticed this glass of wine was $35! My friend asked to see a wine menu, and lo and behold, our waiter opted to bring my friend the most expensive glass of wine on the menu without asking.. Not a good look. Besides that, everything else was great. The food and cocktails were delicious. The atmosphere was lovely. It was quiet yet lively at the same time. Overall a very pleasant experience (minus the surprise on the bill).",,1,

I will give it another chance and come with lower expectations and expect the high price.The Good:Saturday night. Was able to reserve a table for 9:30pm.Bread box - nice touch, breads are decent.Appetizer: mozzarella in puff pastry with proshuto - very good. It's probably the most popular appetizer and was prepared fast.The Bad:Table was ready only at 9:50.Waiter forgot to ask if we want drinks and we had to ask for the drinks menu after 15 minutes of wait.The lowest cost wine is $15 for a glass... almost the same price as a bowl of pasta.... that is pricey.Pasta ""Lamb gnocci"" - tasty but pricey for the size which wasn't big.Pasta ""Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe"" - I make better pasta at home. My friend ate maybe half the portion he really was disappointed. I tried it too and agree it was plain and on the dry side.",5,3,1
171,Erik D.,"Manhattan, NY",25,83,0,5.0,12/2/2012,"Skip the negative reviews here, all 1- and 2-star reviews of Antica Pesa come from people who have not reviewed more than ten restaurants in their lives on Yelp.Now on to my actual dining experience: It was amazing and memorable in every respect.Let's start with the decor and ambiance. When I first walked by, the beautiful interior looked so inviting that I had to stop and look for the name. Luckily, I realized that it was the restaurant which we had a reservation for. I find the interior design tasteful and interesting, for example the extra large white lampshades that in combination with the lights at the walls provide a warm lighting for the dining room. The fireplace further contributes to the cozy, chic atmosphere. On that night, there was even a jazz trio playing in front of the fire place, which was great.Food: A large selection of different breads are served in wooden boxes that resemble containers for wine bottles. More important than the nice presentation was the fact that all kinds of bread tasted fresh and delicious. For appetizers, we chose two typical Roman dishes, spaghetti cacio e pepe, a minimalist pasta with cheese and pepper, and schiaffoni all'amatriciana, which is based on guanciale (cured pork cheek), pecorino cheese, and tomato. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and impeccable. For the main course, we shared the lamb, which was extremely tasty and tender, one of the best lamb I ever had. The lamb came on sautéed chicory, which I haven't had in a long time. Unfortunately, we couldn't manage dessert, the portions of the previous dishes were quite big.Service and staff: We seemed to have two waitresses, which was a bit confusing at first, but they both were very kind, helpful, and efficient. There was no mix up with our orders and we didn't have to wait long for our dishes although it was a busy Friday night.Altogether, an absolutely great Roman restaurant in Williamsburg, definitely worth the trip from Manhattan or elsewhere.",8,,

I was expecting a high quality meal here and my expectations were not met in any way. Half of us (group of seven) sent our food back and the replacement dishes were also terrible. The pasta was under cooked, the sauce was bland, the lasagnas were burnt.  It was easily the most disappointing Italian meal I have ever had in New York.",,,

The food is good, the mozzarella inside the filo crust is magnificent. I've had lamb chops, the ravioli, the salads pasta all great!However the last time i went on Friday night , the wait staff was pretentious, and some of our food was under cooked.

175,Judy M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",120,48,0,1.0,10/22/2012,"Wow. Went there with a friend for dessert. Started off promising with nice hostess, but went down quickly from there. First we ordered two glasses of wine and said we had a couple questions about the desserts. Three different people had to be consulted about the desserts, until one guy finally gave us the breakdown. And these were not complicated items. We each ordered one and asked where our wine was. Again with the consultations. Much time was spent placing blame, but after sitting there for about 20 minutes, we each got our crappy little glass of wine. The bimbo at the next table broke her tooth on her salad, so much fuss was made by the owners and every single serving person. Luckily her tablemates were bitching about their botox, so at least that was entertaining because we had quite a while to wait. Floor show! Apparently dudes in Ed Hardy are botox-resistant. Forty minutes later our desserts arrived. Our waiter dropped them on the table and then fled. Both the desserts were same thing, though we had ordered two different items. As soon as we could find the waiter, we called him over (and they were NOT busy on a Monday night). We reminded him that we'd ordered two different desserts and he shrugged and said yes, that when he'd seen the kitchen had fucked up, his ""eyes had bugged out."" WHAT? But, you know--whatever. It's chocolate. How badly could you fuck up chocolate? Apparently pretty badly. Like most women of menstruating age, I adore chocolate. Low-brow, high-brow, I love it all. But this sampling of chocolate was mostly inedible (one scoop was okay). But really? A WILDLY PMSING WOMAN FOUND THIS CHOCOLATE INEDIBLE. A Little Debbie chocolate cupcake would've been preferable. A tiny Hershey's Kiss would've done the trick. But this shit is for the birds. If we didn't have the Ed Hardy Boys and their trick at the next table we would've been a lot angrier. Oh, and since when, in Williamsburg, is a bag of golf clubs considered decor? Ugh. There was nothing taken off our bill, no apologies, but we each got a small box of dried pasta (WTF?!?) as a ""thank you"" for being customers. Antica Pesa, you are the worst restaurant in Williamsburg. And really, that's saying something.",9,14,7

Getting a table was great and they were so sweet about accomodating us as people cancelled via text, or showed up with a plus one. They worked with us on everything. The layout and design is so sexxy I about lost it. I love the vibe and the crowd was this mix of high brow and Brooklyn nu-locals. The ambiance opened up for us to have a great night--a great celebration and a great meal. My food was insanely good, and the portion was just right. Not too big which I dislike.

I used to eat at the restauarant in Rome all the time when I lived in Italy and it because a real neighborhood place for me there. My mother happened to be very sick when she and my father came to visit me, and it was that night, and I took them to eat at Antica Pesa. It was the first time I had seen her eat her entire meal in almost a year. Maybe they're still trying to figure out their menu, I don't know.

Have had solid dinners here. From the bread & olive oil to start to the dessert.

The Sea bass was the best thing I ate all night, although, still not the kind of dish that would have you coming back for more.Desserts were mush and really disappointing.  These guys need to make some serious changes if they want to make it in this town.",2,1,1
180,Elizabeth D.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,20,0,2.0,1/6/2013,"I went to Antica Pesa with some friends in specific defiance of all the 2- and 3-star reviews on Yelp.  It's a new place so why shouldn't all the comments about poor service and lacking cuisine just be the usual opening kinks?  How bad could Italian food be, especially in one of the trendiest new spots in Williamsburg?  Well, it wasn't good.Things started off well enough.  We waited for a little over an hour at the Brooklyn Ale House next door, then came back in enough time to grab a (pricy) drink at the bar prior to being seated.  The restaurant is gorgeous, with an eclectic combination of high tables near the front, traditional dining space near the kitchen in the back, and some adorable low couch-y seat things near an open fireplace in the middle.  Whichever Yelp reviewer stated that it looks like a Manhattan restaurant in Brooklyn is right - this place has some well-cultivated ambience, in spades. Sitting down, I was all ready to call every negative reviewer an amateur.And then we started eating.We ordered the calamari and radicchio salad as appetizers.  The $16 calamari came with about 10 pieces and some odd citrus sauce.  The radicchio salad was good, if a little bland, primarily due to the lack of the ""good stuff"" - walnuts, fruit, pecorino.  Nothing great but nothing particularly compelling.The bread box, which was unnecessarily huge, was the first indication we had that something wasn't right.  It had about 15 different kinds of bread, an assortment of everything from bread sticks to poppy seed dinner rolls to some sort of stale baguette slices.  Did 3 people need about 35 pieces of bread? It wasn't just an odd choice, but strangely wasteful.I personally liked my entree, the broccoli/cauliflower soup with bleu cheese croquettes - aside from some strange vegetable slices in the middle of my soup, which I picked out.  But my dining companions didn't fare so well, with a carbonara pasta that featured inedible bacon and some fettuccine that was so salty I'm surprised Mayor Bloomberg hasn't banned it.  We're not picky people and yet a good deal of the small-ish pasta portions went uneaten.I'm going to keep my comments about the service brief, since the restaurant IS in Williamsburg, and if there's anything I've learned it's that good help seems to be hard to find in the area.  But a glass of wine ordered halfway through the meal never showed up, so if you like to receive things that you order, then take heed.All in all, I wish Antica Pesa had the food/service needed to live up to its truly awesome space.  But it doesn't.  Maybe they'll get there down the road - and I hope they do - but for now I'll steer clear.",2,1,
181,Paul Q.,"New York, NY",0,168,31,5.0,4/22/2013,"Loved it.  The mozzarella with prosciutto was delicious.  The dual white sauce, red sauce pastas were also fantastic.  Chicken entree was tasty and rounded out the dinner nicely.  My only critical thoughts were that I'd like to see a more substantial selection of fish options on the menu and the desserts were only OK.The room is comfortable and has great energy.  The wine list is good but expensive.  The service was wonderful.  They were so nice I thought they had us confused for someone of grander importance.  After being at so many places in Manhattan where the personal touch is less than stellar (ie. snobby, entitled), this place struck all the right chords.Highly recommend.",1,,

I told her we were going back to our apt on that same block.  We left to wait the time out and were very excited for our impending dinner.  Came back 30 min later and she told us ""things were crazy"" and she had given up spot on the list - she informed us that there was no other option than to wait and hope for a spot at the bar. She never even called us to let us know our table was ready.  We would have stayed had we known the hostess was so incompetent. Management:  train your staff on customer service.

My GF has ordered several things, including the spaghetti, which is actually quite good. The host, bartenders, wait staff as well as the owners who are usually around are all extremely nice and welcoming, which is refreshing in Williamsburg. The last time we went there, there were four people in our party. The service was slightly off (sort of forgot about us after food came). We all would have had more drinks but they never asked. This experience was certainly atypical and the food was still great. Highly recommend for a date spot, outing with friends or if you have friends or family coming to town.

187,Froster T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,2.0,3/28/2017,"There is no excuse for the bland, under-salted Carbonara I experienced last night, from an establishment that has deep roots in Rome. It also has a branch in Doha, Qatar, it seems, and perhaps this pablum would have met with approval there. But Brooklyn? They should know better. (And it should have been better. Much better). Everyone at table who ordered this was fighting over the salt shaker. Those who ordered the Amatriciana fared worse, as this is a pasta that is supposed to have a zing. Or at least a ping. (Nossing). As far as the vaunted ""local"" designation mentioned by others on Yelp, the ""locality"" of the ingredients is Italy. That's an awfully long distance from farm to table. Judging from my experience, they should have kept going. The only reason this isn't a 1 star review is the charm of the staff, and the graciousness of the room. But those are not the reasons why one hastens to a trattoria, no?",,,
188,Elizabeth E.,"New York, NY",390,34,6,5.0,10/23/2012,"How lucky am I to have this open right around the corner from my apartment! Went there last night after hearing rave reviews of the Roman location from friends and family (my father forwarded me NY Times article over the weekend). The Brooklyn location deserves the same accolades as its sister restaurant for its amazing service, food and decor. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I took a seat at the bar and admired the chocolate dessert the lady was noshing on next to me. The owner, Francesco, came over to greet me and welcome me to the restaurant. When my friend eventually arrived, we were promptly seated.Regarding the food, I was impressed by the large potion sizes considering nothing on the menu is over $30. We split the butternut squash polenta soup, grilled stuffed calamari, fettuccini with little neck clams and zucchini puree and braised beef cheek with whipped carrot puree. Hats off to the two chefs as it was delicious. I'm already planning on what to eat for my next trip back.During the meal, the owner and waiter checked on us several times and on our way out, we were given boxes of their spaghetti. I'm thrilled that the owners chose to settle in Brooklyn and look forward to returning for another amazing meal soon.",2,1,
189,Jay H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,0,1.0,2/4/2016,"I've had one spectacular meal at Antica Pesa and was looking forward to sharing this find with non-Williamsburg friends. I made reservations and showed up on time with our party of four. An hour later after several polite follow ups the maitre de and bar staff became dismissive, rude and would give no indication as to when our table would be ready. I've never been treated so poorly by a restaurant. We ended up walking out and I vow to never go again.",1,,
190,K B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,5.0,7/22/2016,"In a neighborhood filled with hundreds of restaurants, Antica Pesa stands out on so many levels. I've been going there regularly for over a year now. The 2 brothers from Rome who own it love what they do- it's in their blood. Their passion quite literally greets you at the door and you can taste it in all of their food. It's fresh, of the highest quality and with great presentation. Every dish I've had... Delicious! And it's consistently delicious. These guys pride themselves on their food and they'll love to help you navigate the menu for your perfect choice... And a wine to go with it. Great place for a date, with family, clients, or dinner at the bar.",,,
191,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,2.0,11/21/2012,"Sadly, Williamsburg has another new restaurant I won't likely visit again. With so many excellent choices for Italian, including Aurora on the south side, why bother with an upstart that is overpriced for both portion size and quality? The decor is well executed; more Manhattan than Williamsburg, but with the requisite amount of shlocky vintage trinkets to make it seem like the restaurant might just belong here. However, the food and service leave much to be desired.My dinner guest and I arrived with high expectations for a lovely Roman meal and while the space did not disappoint, the staff seemed harried and inattentive. Despite workers practically outnumbering patrons, we had to ask for the basics. Chairs were not clean, no wine list was provided, wine was slow to be served, and they attempted to serve our entrees before the appetizer. Despite the mix up, no apology was offered and our entrees eventually arrived on the slow boat from Italy. Food quality was satisfactory but not particularly inspired. I enjoyed the stuffed grilled squid but longed for the deep seared flavor I've had at other locations. The Cacio e Pepe pasta wasn't nearly up to the standard of the namesake restaurant that we frequent in the East Village. My Gnocchi was served with a nice roasted tomato sauce and pesto but the cheese-filled dough was just so so and the size was more appetizer than entree.Williamsburg restaurants may be known for poor service with lots of attitude, but that combination only works if the quality of the food helps you forget the service. Unfortunately, in the case of Antica Pesa the opposite is true.",2,,
192,behnaz r.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,21,5,4.0,7/22/2013,"I've been to Antica Pesa twice, once for a monday night dinner, and the second time for dinner on a friday night.The food is excellent, anything off the menu and cocktails taste delicious. I recommend their egg appetizer (which I cannot recall the name of) to share.The ambiance is fun, and chick, with a little lounge area, the bar and the seating options up front and in the back. The only problem I had with it was on friday night, we finished dinner and were chatting when the waiter asked us to leave since there were people waiting for a table.... I understand it was very crowded and didn't complain much, but it saddened me and surprised me that they would do that. However, I don't think I need to give them below a 4 star, since their dinner is delicious.",,,
193,Brittany K.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,192,17,5.0,8/11/2014,"I have no idea how people are rating this thing any less than 4 stars. The inside of the place is beautiful, the wine list is extensive with options at all price points. The menu was not huge, but everything we got was delicious. The owner, Lorenzo, is an absolute gentleman. Helped us pick out our wine with very little direction (it was delicious) we also asked for his recommendations for apps and dinner and everything was delicious. The desserts were also amazing. I will definitely go back. Lots of famous people eat here too! Service was impeccable.",3,1,
194,Lisa R.,"Manhattan, NY",373,14,1,1.0,6/16/2014,"A SCAM!! I went to Antica Pesa for my birthday because my cousin new the owner and friends said it was amazing. When we arrived the owner Lorenzo was absolutely amazing and treated me and my boyfriend like royalty. he said, I heard it was your birthday and I'm going to take care of you. We weren't even allowed to look at the menu to order food. They brought over tons and tons of good. At one point we asked to not bring anymore food because we couldn't eat it. Of course more food arrived, then champagne and dessert.  Overall the food was good, but many of dishes they served was stuff I would have never ordered. Finally my boyfriend said we were so full and asked for the check. DO YOU believe they charged us for everything they sent over. We were disgusted as they didn't allow us to order anything brought over 5-6 dishes and then charged us for everything. We only got dessert for free. The bill was over $240!! I will never go back! They totally hosed us. We even said something to the waiter but of course he didn't do anything. NEVER GOING BACK!!",11,7,2

Updated review","Just dined at the original Antica Pesa here in Rome. Sincere hospitality. Outstanding food. Incredible setting. Grazie Mille Pietro, Simone, and Roberto. See you next year!--George Boutilier, New York City",,,
196,Paolo C.,"New York, NY",46,68,2,2.0,6/2/2014,"i will give it two stars because the manager does really an oustanding job! The food, however, is really not good at all. The branzino was airplane food quality and so were the pastas we tried. The service was also slow. We were 8 people and tried many plates and none of us liked anyhing. The table was the smallest table we have ever had in NYC. It was also a Saturday night, but perhaps the chef was sick as the quality was so incredibly poor that I would otherwise be suprised that the restaurant has semi-good ratings.",5,1,1
197,Bianca R.,"Dallas, TX",26,84,4,5.0,5/22/2013,"An Italian dream meal.  Although the food and wine list was the main attraction, we were enchanted by the staff (with Italian accents) who were welcoming and totally charming. Not your typical Williamsburg restaurant.  Interiors are modern with a warm glow and provided a lovely dining experience.  Very unassuming on the outside but once you enter you feel a world away.  True escapism. We started with the tartare di salmone and the fresh mozzarella in a filo crust served with prosciutto.  Both were memorable. The pea and leek veloute with scallops was my main and could have licked my bowl had I forgotten my manners. Others had the salt cod with tomatoes (which was exceptional), carbonara pasta, and a fabulous delicate tiramisu to finish. Wine list is fabulous.  Bellisma!Amazing food at such reasonable prices.  Go, you will not be disappointed.",,,
198,Yorma D.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,27,1,5.0,10/2/2013,"Tables were fairly large for these days and it was very appreciated!!!  Great space, easy on the eyes and very interesting menu.  Also had a relatively inexpensive wine and it was delicious.  The owners are wonderful, brothers that really take the time to talk to people and make sure all is good.  He came over, my wife mentioned my birthday and voila, couple glasses of good champagne.  Very nice gesture, professional and the kind of things you like to see from an owner.  Bread basket is nice with terrific bread sticks.  Can't recall the names of the dishes we had but the lamp chops were great (not crazy about the stuffed zucchini's that came with) and the pastas were also excellent.  Also had the lamp lasagna which was friggin amazing.If you simply don't want to wait and deal with the big crowds, ...just go during the week around 7:30, 8:00 and you'll be very comfortable.",,,
199,Tony K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,30,12,4.0,8/1/2014,"Arrived around 8 without a reservation and got a table for 3 right away. The place is the back half of the old Planet Thai, but you'd never know. The room is nice and surprisingly quiet considering how crowded it was, I'm so tired of going out to eat in Brooklyn and having music blaring over any attempt at conversation, that wasn't an issue at all. The service was all a bit over the top, lots of hand gestures and numerous stops by the table.. felt a little forced, and theme-y but good overall. The crowd was a bit older than the standard williamsburg haunt and very boozy, I haven't seen so middle-aged people stumbling to the bathroom since.. well, never. Then the food, all in all everything that came to the table was delicious. The mozzerella crudo was so gooey and warm and each of the three pastas we ordered were exceptional, pasta was perfectly al dente' and nothing was overcomplicated. Simple italian flavors, fresh ingredients, and perfect portions. Antica Pesa is a bit pricy but not out of line with other places in the neighborhood and they excel in simple italian food.",2,1,1
