My party of three loud, pale people might never know, since no one wanted to toss away their delicious order to find out. However, if you do brave try it, please let me know.My pal knows how my husband and I feel about old school diners, so we met here for breakfast. We all shared the famous French toast and I had a grilled cheese. That's right, bread on bread on bread. Sweet bonus: We sat at the same table Kate Winslet did when she was interviewed about Eternal Sunshine. There was a pic above us to prove it. Who doesn't love New York moments like that?",6,1,7
1,Ly N.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,19,37,4.0,11/18/2018,"This is a tiny little fast paced dinner that serves the classic breakfast foods so well. This is a cash only place, so make sure you bring cash!! First walking into this restaurant, there a decent amount of seating, but the tables/seats are very close to each other. I got the avocado omelette and French toast with sausage! The avocado omelette was exactly as it sounds, an omelette with avocado chunks mixed in throughout the omelette. It was really good if you like avocado. The French toast had a really good crisp to it and had good texture. My one complaint about this restaurant is related to the service. When I was seated at my table, the waiter threw the menus on the table, and it made me feel like the waiter was annoyed or angry.",,,
2,Gregory K.,"New York, NY",592,3,0,3.0,10/15/2018,"Pros: quick service, cute old diner feel, good bacon/coffee, cheapCons: their pancakes and French toast were a 3/10 in my opinion. Also did not have maple syrup, was corn syrup syrup. Not a good breakfast spot if you like pancakes/French toast",,,

We got the famous French toast (perfect texture chewy, soft, fluffy) and a cheeseburger special that was perfectly cooked. The vanilla malt milkshake was not the best I've ever had but pretty close!",,,

The price of food is good but cash only.The decor is about 70 years old so it is not modern. The single restroom is downstairs; hint on this place.I don't often come to this area but I will make a stop next time to try their other food items.",4,3,3
5,Joyce W.,"Boston, MA",457,457,1112,3.0,1/26/2018,"Cozy and unassuming, it's definitely a good find to hit that diner craving. We were a party of 6, and on Sunday around 10:30am, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Not bad at all given the prime time and group size. It's definitely more advantageous to be a small group of 1-2, because the place is TINY! We ordered a mixture of French Toast, Pancakes, bacon, eggs, and Pastrami Sandwiches. All were tasty, but not mindblowing. The fluff factor was wonderfully high for the French Toast and the Banana Pancakes - super satisfying! Portion sizes were quite fair.Overall, it's actually surprisingly affordable given the neighborhood. But be warned it's cash only AND it'll be hard to flag down the servers. This place is BUSY! It's an eat and hustle kinda place!",1,,

8,Ari N.,"New York, NY",391,159,410,5.0,8/27/2018,"This is my favorite diner in manhattan. It's the last remaining spot that makes you feel like if you still eat at diners that you're not necessarily a disgusting pig of a human. The place is clean and the business is run as well as anything going on in nyc. You get in and out, drip coffee refills on a dime.  The owner is the nicest woman and you feel at home here. 5 stars!!!",,,
9,Terrance B.,"Atlanta, GA",337,15,64,5.0,4/3/2018,"I have only eaten at this place once, so I'm going to give it a five star rating based not only on the food, but the New York experience. I like how it's a little bit of a hole in the wall and the menu is extreme. Like, you can literally find everything to eat on there! I experienced a great morning breakfast and brunch.  I would recommend it to anyone within walking distance that can get to it to try it out. Really good in the neighborhood.",2,,1

The ham and cheese omelette was delicious.The service is good, depends on how busy they are.The prices are very cheap compared to other brunch places in the village.I highly recommend that place.",,,
11,Oswald B.,"Queens, NY",42,14,30,4.0,6/16/2018,"Came here for a quick pick up breakfast. Waited about 10mins from ordering to leaving. They were very busy. The cooks have a very limited space to cook on. I commend them because they were attentive and on point. For everyone eating here leave a tip, cooks work hard. This place is a nieghborhood diner, looks like it been there for a long time, so the decor speaks for itself. And this space is very limited, but it's cute. They also have outside seating. Prices for Manhattan are fair. They have a extensive menu. Overall, a good place to eat for a small group or come alone. It's the nearest diner on hudson.Updated September 2018 : As i say again, this place is very busy, they don't take calls so i had to go and order pick up. The place was packed, but i was in and out in 7 mins. The waiter even came out to hand me my food.  $10.85 for two eggs, home fries, sausage and toast and a large coffee.",,,

So sit down and be part of a little film history!When you walk by do you smell the bacon in the air? It's all produced by this lovely diner. They make the best crispy bacon that keeps your pancakes and or waffles from being lonely! The best breakfast in the west village without any glamor attached...because guess what? It doesn't need it!They also a really great tart fresh squeezed lemonade that's great for the summer! I love it here! You'll never know who you'll sit next to, it could be a star!",2,1,1

I ordered and subsequently paid for my food, but the man who prepared my food behind the counter oogled and stared at me during my entire meal. He also went into the back kitchen where he could not be seen by the patrons or other employees. I had to rush to finish eating and leave early with my young son. As a woman and mother, I felt very uncomfortable for the duration of the meal and I left feeling gross. I will not be returning here.",1,,

Everything was coated in a thin layer of grease which I figured was a result from frying bacon all day...and never cleaning anything...ever. Halfway through our meal a customer, sitting at the bar, was startled from a roach crawling on her foot. She quickly smashed it and kicked it off the ledge like ""no-biggie, this happens all the time."" I looked around to see if anyone else was as disgusted by the incident but everyone seemed to shrug it off as they kept munching on their pancakes like mindless zombies.  The photos make this place seem WAY cleaner then it actually is. If you're looking for cheap but good breakfast food, roaches don't bother you, and unsanitary anything is no biggie then you'll probably like this place.",8,5,1

The second I stepped into La Bonbonniere, it reminded my college time back in my home city, where I had very simple yet hearty breakfast everyday. Food here was certainly nothing special, yet it carried a familiar family feeling, that I was longing for for a long time.I would, and probably should be back for a real meal - egg omelette, some ketchup, and a small cup of coffee!",11,5,9

In other words, the opposite of the neighborhood but very much in the spirit of NYC.We only stopped in for a quick bite. I asked for a whole wheath bagel with cream cheese and nova lox, and that's what I got, plus two hot cups of joe. Everything was spot on, and I look forward to trying something more ambitious on a return trip.Come here if you want to step out of the West Village and into Twin Peaks for an hour or two.Pro Tip: On a weekend, come well before noon unless you want to end up waiting in a pointless brunch line.",5,3,3

30,Rodrigo P.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",110,13,7,5.0,3/16/2018,"Perhaps my favorite breakfast in all of New York, La Bonbonniere stands atop of its competition with its raw and NY-esque ambience launched into stardom by its unequivocally tasty food. Their breakfast options are limitless and the food bar works like a well-oiled machine constantly bringing out delicious meals ranging from loaded and succulent french toasts, to appetizing and colorful omelettes, to even some of the most raved about pancakes in West Village.This little joint stands over in 8th Av. and has the charm and nature of an old dinner style restaurant. The servers are nonstop moving machines picking orders, getting supplies, handling customers, and so on.

Got the breakfast staples and some diner regulars. Rice and beans were delicious (pretty hard to mess up). The food's kept simple and delicious. However, eating here and people watching on a cold day with a coffee in hand is a charm.

Thanks to Yelp, it led us to La Bonbonniere which was just a walk away from the market.La Bonbonniere is a small diner located in the West Village. If we did not read the reviews prior to our visit, we would have never guessed a restaurant with the name of La Bonbonniere would have been a place that serves diner-style food at inexpensive prices. We shared a french toast, topped with bacon and a side of mac and cheese. The french toast was fine and comparable to the average diner. I personally enjoyed the mac and cheese at La Bonbonniere. The noodles were not over cooked and the cheesiness was good.Its a great place to go if you are just looking for an affordable, low-key, quick and tasty meal in the city.",3,1,2

I went with my friend for lunch and he had one of the best turkey clubs ever -- couldn't believe it. The bread was soft with some char, the turkey was fresh cut and seared on the griddle, the bacon, I suspect, was deep fried, the lettuce crisp, and the tomato hard and juicy. How does this exist?? For some reason, I had the veal parmigiana with pasta and it was great. I was concerned that tourists would be here, that some article in the guidebooks had already tipped them off and I'd be rushed in and out of the experience, but no. It was 1pm and Wednesday and there was no pressure to do anything.Lots of characters popping in just to stay hello. This is the West Village. Where do all these people come from? NYC is still weird, hallelujah! And they have a stack of shims by the door. A stack. Of shims. Of Shims. Shims. We're talking shims here. A stack of them. By the door.",4,1,4

The owner of this place are really sweet, which adds to the overall experience because they make you feel super welcome.

47,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,472,774,5.0,2/13/2016,"This West Village legend has that ""Extra Something.""Maybe it's the grease that soaks their stovetop all day long from the nonstop omelette-after-pancake turnover, the residual coffee stains in the generous coffee pot that refills for free or the swiftness that your breakfast is made (in under 6 minutes, without fail).Whatever the reason, this longtime diner always trumps the frou-frou West Village spots that dot West 4th. The dishes are homemade, frills-free and downright delicious.My favorites are the doughy French Toast with sausage dipped in maple syrup, and the plentiful sunny-side-up runny eggs with authentic Spanish beans and rice and bacon with a side of wheat bread. I had this meal this morning and now I want it tomorrow!Moral of this story: skip the $14 omelettes up the street and the overdressed crowds and saddle up at the counter before the stove and watch your meal unfold before you.

48,Chip R.,"Morrisville, NC",510,469,1035,3.0,7/23/2015,"Bottom line: La Bonbonniere is a solid authentic A-OK 3 star diner experience. Definite old school diner atmosphere, greasy spoon in both appearance and menu offerings. Cash only however. Don't write them off for a good diner meal in the West Village.The Deets:Apparently La Bonbonniere is a West Village mainstay, even frequented by some of the local celebrities in the West Village area when they want to eat low key on the down low. With such a name you may expect something a bit fancy, but this place is quintessential greasy spoon diner type eatery. In fact, greasy spoon about says it all...in appearance, attitude, menu, and cuisine. And sometimes, you just NEED that. La Bonbonniere is solid in representing here as a bit dingy but comfortable feeling in a small dining space inside. I visited for breakfast on a recent NYC visit, and found a good breakfast selection. I ended up with a turkey and Swiss omelet, pancakes, breakfast potatoes, and toast with OJ. The omelet was ok, the turkey meat was a bit dry from the process and there was an overabundance of Swiss cheese. Pancakes were good but a bit too mealy for me, more of a meal type flour maybe. Potatoes were a bit grease saturated and mushy so they were not really my style. The toast, OJ, and coffee rounded out the meal pretty well. Staff are hurried and minimal interaction but get the job done. Do note that these guys are cash only so put away the plastic.",4,,2

Our coffee cups were immediately filled multiple times and if you sit at the bar, you'll get an amazing glimpse of how they prepare the food - also very sanitary as they wipe off the boards every other second.

I love this place and the reason my opinion is even mildly interesting is that I don't like breakfast out! La Bonbonniere is the only place I've ordered actual breakfast at, in an actual diner/restaurant, for probably a decade. What I get (never stray, never stray) is the blueberry pancakes and bacon, and a single over-easy egg on the side. Those who dislike breakfast out know that pancakes are really risky, since they're the easiest thing to prepare poorly. The ones here are not puffy and cake-like. They're actually kind of chewy, and they have tons of fresh blueberries. The bacon is chewy, too. Greasy, crazy curly, awesome. Coffee is great. Atmosphere is New York. Just shut up, eat your breakfast and enjoy.",,,

I ordered the French toast with bananas and blueberries and bacon and I was shocked at the amount of food on the plate. It was pretty good. The fruit wasn't all that fresh but the challah bread French toast was amazing! The bacon was made just how I like: a little fat on it & not too crispy. On the other hand, this restaurant is a hole in the wall, literally. It's small and outdated and needs renovation. I took my boyfriend here for a birthday brunch expected something a lot nicer but it's simply just your old school  diner. So do expect good food, just in a dingy atmosphere. Also cash only!I forgot to mention... My boyfriend doesn't eat pork so he asked for turkey bacon and they ONLY have pork. Just a heads up.",2,1,2
61,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,3.0,8/14/2015,"When you hear the name ""La Bonbonniere,"" you might think of a fancy French candy shop or bistro. This place is NOT that. It's a very no-frills diner with the smell of bacon grease infused into the walls and furniture. Not that that's a terrible thing, but it can get a little overwhelming after say, an hour in the establishment. It never seems terribly crowded here, which is especially good when you want a greasy weekend brunch without having to deal with, you know, other people.They have your standard diner brunch dishes (pancakes, french toast, omelettes, bacon, etc.) in rather heart-stopping portions. They kinda just pile the food onto plates and don't pay attention to presentation at all, so don't expect food-porn worthy pictures that will wow your friends on Instagram. I'm a fan of the french toast with bacon, or the ever-popular corned beef hash. The bacon is somewhat of a wonder, because it's not particularly thick-cut, or even super flavorful, but you just want to eat piles and piles of it. Yes, all the dishes here all rather greasy, but really hit the spot when recovering after a night out.Service is pretty quick and friendly, Note that it's cash only, which is slightly annoying when you're splitting checks but the prices are better than most brunch places in the West Village, so it really won't be too much of a burden on your wallet if you have to spot someone. Come for a relatively inexpensive morning meal, and the prospect of smelling like bacon for the rest of the day.",8,7,7

Don't let the window scare you off. This place looks a little messy from the outside. Well, maybe from the inside too. That's okay, because this joint is very authentic. And very proud and I like that very much. Everywhere you look there are pictures or articles about this place. Even if they are already very popular they still show it off. And that's not because they are a show off, but they work really hard and believe in what they do.The food is all about egg, bacon and sausages. My omelette with cream cheese and bacon was heavenly.

I got a side of bacon and home fries with my French toast, both very good, but expect to have to douse your home fries in salt because I'm not sure they season them at all. The French toast is absolutely the star here. My husband had the burger, which he said was ""nothing incredible, but it was definitely a damn good diner cheeseburger""Service is super quick & efficient. 6 stars for the French toast, 4 for everything else, ergo, 5 stars!

Updated review","Very lackluster greasy spoon. I don't mind the smell that it leaves on your clothes or anything like that but rather felt that the potatoes that everyone had lauded were disappointingly bland and the hash brown with eggs that was suggested in the tips of the Yelp review section were only alright but had nothing particularly special to them. This place may be better for their pancakes and other highly praised carb heavy options but I'm more of a carnivore, so take that into consideration when reading this review.Note that this is a cash only place",,,
84,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,3.0,1/12/2015,"I was very disappointed not to see any West Village-residing celebrities upon entrance, but at least my pancakes were good. Ha! I was just running some errands in the neighborhood with the beau and his younger brother, and our tummies were a'rumblin'. La Bonbonniere was rather unassuming from the outside and the epitome of a ""greasy spoon"". Damn you if you don't feel instantly comforted upon walking in here! I felt instantly ""at home"" once I got in, surrounded by striking photos of Molly Shannon, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Juilanne Moore. You'll get serviced quickly and get your food at lightening speed! The banana pancakes are steaming hot, but the homefries...I was not a fan! I am pretty picky about my homefries. For these, the taste was off, almost a little bitter, and they were pretty mushy, lacking that crispness I enjoy. Also, in typical NYC diner fashion, a glass of Tropicana orange juice showed up as $5.25 on our bill. I saw them pour it next to the counter, straight out of the container. I can get a 64 oz.  container at my local Fine Fare for $3.99. Up-pricing, the the win!This is absolutely an excellent spot for a quick and filling breakfast on the run, and the people-watching and opportunities to listen to fellow diners' interesting conversations are abound!",1,4,1

If you're craving some greasy breakfast food in an awesome neighborhood, definitely check out La Bonbonniere. During my visit we were somewhat ignored by the staff which meant we didn't get any coffee or water refills, and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.

It's an old school place, it kind of feels like a place that helped coin the term greasy spoon. It looks a little dingy on the inside with random yellowing photos and articles peppering the walls.I forget what the manfriend ordered, but he didn't complain about his meal (didn't moon over it either). I went with the lox plate; it's hard to screw up with a lox plate - it wasn't the best I've had, it wasn't the worst. I also got a side of potatoes with cheese; I don't recommend adding cheese to them, it didn't meld well with the seasoning (paprika, I think) and it wasn't melted, so there were chunks of cheese slices I ended up picking off of them.Overall, it's a decent diner; if you're not looking to spend a pretty penny on a meal, it's a good option. Although, with a 4 star average and nearly 200 reviews, I was expecting more.PS - Cash Only",3,2,1

It was a good thing that we got there when we did, because soon after it got really crowded. He ordered the french toast, and I ordered the Banana pancakes. The food was amazing! They gave us a nice sized portion as well. The coffee was good too! They only accept cash, so it was a good thing I read a few reviews prior to going.

We ordered this and that and ended up with $25 per for breakfast. My main issue was that my French Toast tasted strongly of bacon, and I'm a vegetarian. I get that they probably use the same grill for both, but I've had diner food that didn't leave bacon in my mouth for hours...",1,1,1

I have been here a couple of times and had the same experience each time. I'll go back, but not because of the service!",,,

The corned beef hash was definitely not the best I've had, but it wasn't the worst I've had either. If I got to choose again I'd probably order the pancakes or French toast everyone raves about. I also didn't understand the home fries hype. Previous reviews mentioned they were not seasoned at all, and my first bite proved that true. Three stars!",,,

My partner had corned beef hash and eggs, which was also tasty, and the prices were very reasonable.

156,Cori C.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,401,17,4.0,10/7/2013,"Any of the ""real"" diners in New York City have been intentionally left to serve a certain kitsch niche. Such is life in a gentrified city. This place has walls covered in taped-up posters and articles and - believe it or not - a pay phone. It has the feel of a place that's cleaned every day, but hasn't gotten a deep clean since the decor was modern, but that's part of the diner charm. The food was standard diner fare for cheaper-than-normal-NYC prices. If you aren't up for a pretentious brunch, want a quick bite, or are feeling homesick, this is the place to go.",3,,

I got the banana pancakes with sausages which I think was great but i still find it pricey for what I'm given. Their dish should come with more sides by default other than one type of meat such as some form of potato or fruits.We also ordered fried tomatoes in hopes of getting some of the best battered deep fried goodness we often find served at diners. Instead, we got a plate of sloppy sliced tomatoes that were clearly just pan fried over a stove top... To say we were disappointed would be an understatement.Not sure i'd come back again.. It is cash only and totally looks like a hole in the wall. The pancakes are tasty IMO but other than that, everything else was mediocre.",,,

Came here for breakfast with a friend.  They only lost a star because, while I appreciate La Bonbonniere's unfancyness, and also while I do not need a white-gloved waiter to pull out my chair for me, I do need to be told to sit in a restaurant.  There was a free table for two, the staff not only saw me and my friend standing awkwardly before them, but they pushed past us a couple of times to go outside and come back in, and still, no ""Just go have a seat!"".  So we stood a couple of minutes while the staff actively ignored us until, seeing we were determined to out-wait them, they said, ""Oh!  Go have a seat!""  And we did.I had eggs, my friend had eggs, eggs were delicious, pancakes too, coffee was really, really good, and overall I will be back.  I've been to the House of Cards & Curiosities across the street a few times and that's a fun little store to poke around in if you're in the mood after your (really quick, since they serve it up so fast) meal at La Bonbonniere.  Final note: this really is one of the last truly greasy spoons in NY.  Another good greasy spoon is the Stage in the east village.  Give them a try as well.",1,,
179,Matthew A.,"Bronx, NY",9,72,21,5.0,6/29/2014,"This place is fantastic. I'm pretty sure I found my favorite brunch spot in NYC.At BarBacon you get a grilled cheese sandwich with a pathetic portion of bacon for $13 from what I saw. First of all, why are you paying $13 for a god damned grilled cheese sandwich? Here, you only pay $7 and your sandwich is slathered with twice the amount of bacon BarBacon will give you. BarBacon, imo, can suck it. Who needs it when La Bonbonniere will serve you food with bacon and actually won't rip you off on it? They make so much bacon here which allows them to be very generous with the bacon portions. My friend had two eggs over easy with fries, toast and bacon. I was legit surprised by the amount of bacon he was served. More than I get at home!The grilled cheese sandwich was probably the best grilled cheese I ever had in New York. The bacon was the right amount of crispy and it surprised me how good it was since I wasn't even here for that.

183,Luke R.,"American Canyon, CA",99,25,2,5.0,4/4/2012,"To start: coffee - strong, dark-brown, robust; just like my boyfriend.To eat: French toast (possibly on a brioche bread) - warm, moist, but with a crunch and the right balance of spices in the custard.To side: BACON!  I don't know what they make this bacon in, but it's the most amazing bacon I've ever had in my life.  I should write a musical about just their bacon.To finish: a food coma worthy of a repeat taste.We've been here 3-4 times now and I really love this place.  It's my favorite spot for morning eats.  I'll continue going there for as long as I live in Manhattan.",3,4,3
184,Diana H.,"Lebanon, NH",209,379,14,5.0,5/18/2012,"A little hole in the wall with excellent service, bountiful food and just the right amount of hustle and warmth.We ordered eggs, bacon and pancakes and all were excellent.  The price was fantastic and the little touches is really what makes this joint a 5 star.  Touches such as giving you a whole bottle of milk to add to your coffee, a whole container of butter to put on your pancakes and or toast and a solid cup of coffee.  It is a very small place so if you are a party greater then 4 and there for breakfast you will probably have a good wait.",2,2,2
185,Jonalynn L.,"Bayside, NY",5,5,3,4.0,6/13/2015,"A classy authentic restaurant that is very fast pace. I came here for brunch and I had the pancakes, bacon and eggs and they are recommended to get! The restaurant gives a really old school/ vintage vibe and the service here is great besides being a little messy this place is a great place to grab a bite. Would totally come back again!",,,
186,Hami A.,"Houston, TX",16,22,0,5.0,5/8/2012,"We originally were going to Soy Cafe, but it closed down recently so we headed around the corner.  I am glad that we did! This place has great coffee (what is it with New York coffee??). I had the special, a corned beef hash omelet, and my husband had a spinach omelet. Both were outstanding. Their home fries were big chunks of potatoes with seasoning.The only thing better was the service. Great job, guys.",3,1,1
187,Kerry K.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,564,29,3.0,2/8/2013,"This place is a legit old school diner. I went here for a business breakfast and had a good time. The potatoes were good and the bacon was extra crispy (just how I like it). I would have given the place 4 stars, but I had to stay with 3 because there was no place to put my bag without feeling like it was going to get dirty. Maybe just wipe everything down once in a while. Don't get me wrong, I'm cool with an old school diner. Just a swipe of cleaner every once in a while would be helpful though.",,,
188,Mike K.,"Seattle, WA",89,147,91,3.0,4/23/2012,"Came here for brunch yesterday with a few friends and we ordered breakfast foods around the menu. The french toast was fine, but nothing special - a little powdered sugar would have helped its case, as would have real grade A or B maple syrup, not grade Aunt Jemima. The blueberry pancakes were packed with blueberries, but they were also chewy, or even stringy, implying that the pancake batter had been mixed for too long and therefore caused gluten strands to form. Our favorite was the corned beef omelet that we ordered with cheese (American) - it was a good mix of the ingredients. The toast that came with the omelets, which came pre-buttered, rendering the concord grape jelly packets useless, was alright and the home fries, ham and sausage were all standard diner fare.The prices are in range with similar restaurants and I have to say that the service was fast and attentive - when we requested skim milk for a cup of coffee they brought the entire quart-sized plastic container and left it on our table.La Bonbonniere is an old-school diner - nothing more and nothing less. The only thing that's special about it is that while diners like this one used to be found in abundance all over the city, their herds have been thinned to endangered status as a result of competition from similar species that sport organic coats or trendy spots (I sadly lost one a block away from my apartment a few months back). I'm not saying that I prefer one over the other (there's a time and place for each), only that things can change really quickly in New York: to those who can remember, what was once the norm now seems like a hazy memory, and to the waves of new immigrants who descend upon the city every year, New York is ever-refashioned and -repurposed in their constantly-updated snapshot of what they do and do not experience, leaving the past to be blown away by evening breeze as it rolls off the river.The bad news for everyone who loves Bonbonniere: it's alright, not great, and you can get better in the city, even at regular diners.The good news for everyone who loves Bonbonniere: places like this are still a dime a dozen outside of New York. Go forth and Yelp them!",3,,1
189,Trish H.,"Bayside, NY",16,23,9,4.0,2/1/2015,"Not at all expected! The decor is underwhelming , but has an  old lunch counter charm at the same time. That being said the food was amazing, fast and low cost , especially for the village. I can't say enough about the spinach omelette- delicious! We are coming back for the pancakes. Remember it is cash only. Come hang with the locals",,,

191,Kayan W.,"Manhattan, NY",27,48,12,5.0,4/22/2012,"Something about this diner is truly American to me.On a rainy Sunday @1pm there was a line of about 10 people waiting.  There's no sign-in system so just line up.  It moves quickly.  When you're at the head of the line and a table opens up, just walk over.  By the time you get there, the fast-moving staff will have cleared it up already.They move super fast here, yet we never felt rushed.  Once we ordered our food, it arrived at our table within about 5 minutes: fresh, hot, correct, and delicious.Current online menus have outdated prices so here's what we paid:Pastrami omelette, home fries, toast $8.50Two eggs w/ bacon homes fries & toast $7.50Chili over rice $7.50Coffee (repeatedly refilled without asking) $2.50OJ $2.50The entire staff was *SUPER* nice.  After we paid, since there was no one else waiting for a seat, we stayed at the table for a while to watch the rain outside.  The waiter came over to ask if I wanted more coffee.  We felt welcomed and there were smiles and thanks all around.",2,,

The food came quickly and they checked on us during the meal, but after they cleared the table you have to be pretty assertive about getting the check which is generally unheard of during Saturday brunch in New York City.Lemonade - if you like it more tart than sweet, you'll love theirsBacon - if you like crispy bacon and lots of it, you'll be pleased. it's AMAZINGEggs - good old diner eggsFried tomatoes - wouldn't recommend them. they're more like slightly grilled tomatoes.",2,,
195,Chad R.,"New York, NY",232,473,8,5.0,11/28/2015,"Always walked by this place..excited by the possibilities at this old style diner. Finally, came for brunch on my birthday and it was a special birthday surprise. No lines...very relaxed atmosphere...amazing food...frequented by many celebrities. Loved it...the food was outstanding..vegetable omelette is loaded up with terrific veggies and the griddle retains amazing flavors which incuses everything it touches. And the challah french toast..was outstanding...it was that perfect blend of toasted on the outside but a little undercooked on the inside..it didnt even need syrup..buy you should still go it..enjoy the greasy spoon experience. Just make sure you have enough cash..no credit cards used..which the norm in nyc for outstanding restaurants with impeccable reputations. Finally, this family owned restaurant is Peruvian..which is the most under-rated of chefs in the world. This place only makes the case stronger.",,,

199,Dave M.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,135,0,4.0,11/12/2011,"Short short story: I grew up in New Jersey, where we are proud of our diners, so I ended up going to a lot of diners. This has been my favorite diner that I've been to that hasn't been in New Jersey. It's a small little place but they cook the food very quickly for you and it tastes so great! I've been here twice, the first time getting a bacon omelet (as good as it sounds) and then a challah bread French toast the second. Is there any better bread to make French toast out of than challah? I can't think of one. They're so quick too -- order your food and it's out in minutes. I had went there with a group of around 8 or 9 people and they had everyone's food out in less than 10 minutes.Sometimes a bird will fly into the place (probably more of a summer/spring/fall problem) because the door is open but they're not a problem.There are some other great restaurants in the area too so maybe after you finishing have a bite here, you can run across the street and grab some chocolate or if it's later at night (or you feel like a Bloody Mary), Tavern on Jane is a great little place for a drink",2,1,1
