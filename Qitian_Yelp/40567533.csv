0,Lux C.,"San Francisco, CA",134,15,0.0,5.0,8/30/2018,"for a good time, order wine from pete on thursdays.the vibe here is strange and the people are stranger. pay no attention, however, as the drinks here are both cheap and strong AF. wine pours stop at the rim of the glass and it's easy to spend an hour or 5 getting absolutely blasted here.",,,
1,Tara W.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",18,104,274,3.0,6/20/2018,Pretty small and nice place. Drinks were amazing. The music was k but the bar tender was not friendly. My friend requested to change music she said no and we asked for light beer and she was like which one and as we tell the brand names she would be like no we don't have it and basically she ended up saying we don't have light beer as we didn't restock it seems. After few shots we went to some other place to drink.,,,
2,Cree P.,"Jamaica, NY",151,127,351,5.0,1/20/2018,"I came here with one of my friends for the first time last night and we had no idea what to expect because it wasn't that busy for a bar on a Friday night. But we soon discovered that that was a good thing. It's a fairly small bar that's right next to the very busy 13th step so if that's not your scene definitely come here instead. I'm glad we stopped by because we had a really nice time. As soon as we got in we were lucky to get some seats right at the bar. We had a couple of drinks, I tried a shot called Pickleback for the first time (shot of Jameson with a shot of pickle juice, I know weird) and we were lucky enough to have great conversation with one of the bartenders. Shout out to Declan for being a great conversationalist and attentive bartender. I would definitely come back here and bring friends for the chill vibes.",,,
3,Julia C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",212,3,0,1.0,2/3/2018,"Terrible service. Nasty and incredibly rude people.I came here earlier today for my birthday and the bartender threw a wet napkin at my face, justifying it by saying I was ""shrieking"" (even though I was sitting there drinking a beer).My brother went up to him with the napkin asking why he did that and the guy had the nerve to act as if he was entitled to do such a rude thing. Obviously, the rest of my friends and family got upset and stood up for me, and the bald bartender, along with his white haired friend, responded very aggressively. Even with my girl friends.The white haired guy pushed the girls up the stairs, even though we were already on our way out, and kneed one of them in the back to usher her up. Then when she turned around to ask him to stop, he put his hand on her chest and shoved her - very hard.My brother then told him not to touch a lady like that and the guy responded by grabbing him by the arm and yanking him down the stairs, in an attempt to fight him.He then tried to claim that he ""didn't touch any girls,"" even though we just watched all of these events unfold right in front of us.None of the workers showed any remorse for the disgusting way they treated us.Do not come here. This place is a disgrace.",5,1,
4,Casey W.,"New York, NY",544,577,36,3.0,9/22/2017,- nothing to write home about- like a million other bars in the neighborhood with the exception of their lure of free pizza- prices are comparable for the area but certainly not a steal- small and unassuming with minimal seating - usually pretty crowded,1,,
5,Jeffrey C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",388,3,0,1.0,2/5/2018,Looks like this place has issues with Asians. Drinks are cheap but I guess they have to be to cover for their absurd service. The bartender raced out from the bar in an attempt to fight me for confronting him about why he thought it appropriate to throw a wet napkin at my sister's face.They also shoved our ladies out with force and inappropriate contact.I'd recommend taking your business elsewhere.,3,2,
6,Rc T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",59,5,10,5.0,6/6/2018,Was here few time and last week as well so far I think it's very casual pub good for hanging out little dark tho.

Oh forgot to mention free pizza when I was there last week,,,
7,Meg A.,"New York, NY",0,75,1,1.0,4/25/2018,"Got to know a bartender here, saw his IG had a picture of him in blackface. Asked him to delete it, he flipped shit and blocked me instead-- and I've never been back. So when I see accusations on other reviews here that the staff might be racist... welp.The drinks are cheap, but they're not great, as you'd expect in a kind of divey place like this. I used to prefer the weekdays because on weekends it just got way too crowded. You really can't even walk to the bathrooms, it's that crowded. The crowd is also a lot younger on the weekends, it feels like a completely different bar.",,,

He chatted with us and just provided awesome service throughout the hours we were there.Free pizza showed up. AMAZING. I have never seen/heard of that.$3 mystery shots were delicious. I don't even know how many rounds of those we had. The prices were great on other drinks too.,,,

Updated review","Stopped by this bar and the bartender was being incredibly rude. So when we confronted him about it, he started screaming at us. And as we were leaving a tall caucasian man with gray hair started aggressively pushing us out. He jammed his knees against my butt and when I turned around to tell him to stop touching me, he shoved my chest to keep pushing me back when I was clearly walking out. He also denied that he laid hands on me when my friends confronted him. ABSOLUTELY disgusted by the workers here. Terrible experience. I'm surprised that this place is still in business. This is the 21st century and the fact that establishments still employ racist workers who think it's okay to put their hands on girls is absurd.",2,1,
12,Daniel W.,"Floral Park, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/22/2018,"Went in there on Friday night.  Bar was pretty empty maybe 10 people in there so pretty dead.  Two bartenders behind the bar.  They were extremely rude, nasty and impatient.  Went to order one drink and asked a question about a second one and she turned around immediantly and then proceeded to ignore the customers.  Would never go back again.",,,

15,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11002,5.0,9/16/2016,"They have free pizza twice a day. No, really. F-R-E-E.Sure, you should probably buy a pint (and it's possibly required), but nobody cares. They just have pizza delivered and you can eat it. I hear they used to do 2 Bros, but now they've upgraded to Nicoletta.Oh yeah, this place is also a bar. It's not quite divey, but it's certainly not fancy.

Really surprised this bar had barely anyone inside - with plenty of seating at the bar and around the walls for a group.Nothing fancy here, your standard beer and well drinks at your standard cost. No food either, but they had free pizza in the back and that's all anyone really needs to hear. Solid service, good drinks, chill atmosphere.",2,1,
21,Daniel R.,"Westport, CT",3,36,5,5.0,10/17/2017,"Great place to grab a beer! They have the game on and the bar conversation is great. Definitely a spot to become a regular. Best part of the deal?

22,David C.,"Chicago, IL",126,428,824,3.0,2/28/2017,"Came here with my buddy after an afternoon of recording while we waited for dinner time to eat at a nearby restaurant. The pub bar is downstairs. This is a dive like bar which has the old wood panels, the mirror backs, and even the pickles in a jar. The place was not that busy as it was still pretty early. The bartender was nice enough and served us some beers and left us alone. We were able to hold a conversation pretty clearly without interruption from other patrons or the music which was nice. They played a good set of music in the background and had the game on the TV. However, I can't speak to whether this is the same during peak hours. Drink prices are comparable to what I pay in Chicago. This is my type of place. It was nice to stumble upon it on my trip.",,,

Came here with a group of my friends, not only was the bartender rude AF, my best friend got groped by one of their workers and then shoved by him when we got upset with him.

Not really seeking a party scene. We came and and the bouncer asked for IDs. Since it was late, I asked what time the kitchen wouldclose. We were told that there is No kitchen= No bar food. We walked over to the bar and had to wait pretty long to be attended to or even noticed by the bartenders.

29,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",620,332,2370,5.0,2/3/2014,"Waking down the stairs into the scholar, you can't help thinking that this is how a bar should feel. Low lighting, old stools, coat hooks under the amazing copper bar. Classic. This place has been my unofficial start of the night bar for a while now, and there's many a reason why. First of all there's Pete, my favorite man behind the bar in the whole city. A genuinely awesome guy who remembers your name, knows what you're having before you ask, and takes the time to get to know you. Happy to call this guy a friend. Next let's go over the drink line up. The tap selection is extensive; you've got old favorites like Goose Island and Shocktop, and some new classics like Sixpoint Bengali Tiger. There's also a seasonal on rotation that they keep interesting, right now it's Sierra Nevada Celebration (Solid beer). They also have a great can and bottle selection, $4 PBR tall boys never go out of fashion right? The house drink list is long and covers all the bases, the LIT will knock you off your stool. Couldn't be happier calling myself a regular here, this place rocks - Come in for a game, play a round of darts, and hang out with Pete",7,6,6

He just took my receipt and then berated me AS A CUSTOMER, insinuating that I was out of line, before all dues were accounted for.I hope this place goes under and fast, if you go here be ready for a quick in and out because the bar etiquette is sub par.",2,,

Updated review","Five long years ago, my roommates and I signed a lease for our first apartment in Brooklyn. Just a few hours later we met a few friends in a little bar on 2nd ave for the second of soon to be hundreds of times. When you walk in you will notice the decor. Brick walls, copper bar top, candles. But then you look up. There, across from the door is a suit of armor. To your right is an Einstein-esque dummy pondering life's great mysteries. If you take nothing else from this review, take this: The bar is one of the friendliest, most welcoming places I have ever been. From the first time we went, the bar tenders greeted and introduced themselves. It certainly helps that they can pour a good strong drink all while keeping up all the conversations they hold along the bar. It started with late night parties with the younger staff. They were fun, drinks flowed quickly and efficiently down to our stomachs, and people were loud, but in a good way. Slowly, I realized how much more i enjoyed the slower paced, low key happy hours and weekend afternoons. This is the perfect place to sit down and relax. You can hold an actual conversation with everyone's favorite behind the counter bar host, Pete. Not only a knowledgeable New Yorker, but also a great bartender and willing to help you find your new favorite drink.  I am so glad that I was able to find a bar like this. Not only have they kept me coming back time and time again, but it holds up as a great bar for anyone that we invite. Enjoy this gem!",3,1,3
38,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, NY",117,327,83,5.0,6/19/2015,"NO lie, I LOVE this bar. Thanks to my friend Z for introducing me to this kind of seriously awesome dive cocktail bar and its free pizza.Yes - they serve free pizza at 6PM and at 10PM.The bartenders are all really sweet and overall great people, as are most of their regulars/patrons. I left my phone in the bathroom and some guy picked it up and gave it to the bartenders... who proceeded to take pictures but that's totally okay. I've been here at 4PM when it opened (thank you summer Fridays), and I've been here at 10 - and it's quite fun no matter what time you arrive.My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and chat with the bartender when it's slow/early. Pete was really fun to chat to, and quite pleasant seeing how my friend and I were already quite drunk from the wine we had at lunch. (Did I mention how much I love summer Fridays?) I'm looking forward to one day trying his cucumber margaritas and his cosmopolitans. Plus, he knew all of the good old bars and is just an overall good guy. The other bartender I've met (kind of - I have a picture of him on my phone from when I forgot it) is named Zach maybe? He's great, especially with his regulars.Another thing I love about this bar - they don't make a fuss when you want a cocktail... unless it's a frozen one (I'm assuming. I haven't seen a blender out on the bar yet.) Pete's actually the one who called The Thirsty Scholar a ""dive cocktail bar.""Come for the free pizza and inexpensive drinks (I love love love the John Daly, my friend J loves their bourbon lemonade) - stay for the great bartenders, the sports on all the screens and for the good times you're going to have.",3,1,2
39,David C.,"New York, NY",45,160,118,4.0,4/4/2014,More of a 3.5 stars than a 4 star but pushed it to 4 because the staff are pretty friendly. The place is a bit of a dive and sports bar. It isn't overly crowded when I went  on a friday night but still have a good amount of people. Happy hrs goes until 8pm and drinks after that still aren't crazy expensive. They have a dart board as well. Great if you are looking to chat and drink with friends and also watch some sports or not as it wasn't extremely loud. Nothing too crazy about the place but a good place to hang out with friends.,,,

44,Jacob J.,"Champaign, IL",5,19,10,3.0,6/22/2016,"Well...where to start? This is a pretty standard Irish bar. Not that that is a bad thing. The bartender that I had was a skilled mixologist. So if you're looking for competently made mixed drinks, this is a good choice. Average selection of beers and whiskeys otherwise. Word to wise though, if you hate hipsters like I do, you should avoid this place. The bald-pated bearded man who so competently served me my drinks spewed shit from his mouth constantly. The deliveries were a pain, the latest sci-fi movie was doomed to suckage because one of the stars of the previous movie wasn't in it, etc., etc. Honestly, bearded dude should shave. I'm reclaiming beards for adults. They're not intended for whiney, someone shat-in-my-bed-this-morning hipsters who hate everything that isn't raw hops-or-brusselsprouts bitter.In closing, I recommend this bar to everyone whose a fan of good mixed drinks and/or enjoys hipsters making perfect asses of themselves.

There was no buffet to speak of. In fact, there was no food at all! As an out of towner, I was thoroughly disappointed with that, and ravenous hungry. Never heard of an Irish pub that didn't at least serve bangers or fish N chips. Thankfully, they at least had decent free pizza someone brought in, and the beers are large, for a decent price.

There was one guy getting a little aggressive with some of the girls and the bouncers handled it well. I didn't really see anything special with the bar but it didn't seem like a bad place to grab a drink if you're in the area.",,,

We went in and ordered a drink each- her a beer, me a whiskey and coke. The bartender asked us to see our ID. When I showed her my ID, she flashed a light on it and laughed and said ""This is a fake ID."" (????????) I was like Uh.. no it's not. It's my ID. She was stubborn and kept insisting that it's fake. She said the blue light didn't shine as much as hers did, and that meant it was fake. So she showed me. She shined the blue light on hers, and then on mine. It shined the  EXACT same way, and she realized it, too! She was like ""Oh. Well, from the angle I'm standing in, it looked different."" And then tried to make me see it from her angle. What a dunce. I turned 21 in October 2013. Anyway, she ended up letting us stay.We sipped our drinks slowly, played darts, and just sat and the bar and talked.After about an hour and a half, she told us she was closing up and we needed to leave. We said okay and got our stuff together. As I was going to the bathroom right before heading out, I noticed she only asked us to leave, even though the bar was full of people.What's your deal, lady? Is it because we weren't ordering more drinks? We still weren't finished with ours, we were taking our sweet time.Anyway, I felt pretty attacked by her, although I'm sure she's a nice girl and was just trying to do her job since I do look pretty young. But don't accuse someone of having a fake ID, then kicking them out because they're not ordering shot after shot. I won't be coming back.Plus one star for being the only other bar (aside from Bull Mccabes, which is close by) for having a computerized dart game.",2,2,1

I lack the knowledge, understanding and sheer passion for sport-analysis. yes, alas, I am a philistineSometimes the shouting can get REALLY out of control. I understand people are really wound up around the game, but.... sometimes when people shout, they shout quite horrifically misogynistic or anti-gay things about the team, players, or opposing team.

Bartender had just sold 29 other drinks he would have never sold otherwise. We questioned the bartender, figuring there must have been a mistake.

It's narrow, but somehow there is always plenty of seating even for our big groups of two dozen or more. The bartender, Pete, (who everyone comments looks like Louis C.K.) is always quick with the drinks and a good conversationalist when time permits. If you're hungry, Veselka is just across the street. If it's too crowded, Ryan's is right next door and is a good place, too. This year, everyone on the pub crawl decided to skip the last two bars and just stay at the Scholar. Thanks guys!",1,,

It actually got less crowded as the night went on- we got there around 10:30 on a Friday and it was pretty busy, but when we left there was probably about half the initial crowd. Pretty easy to order drinks (no ridiculous waits or having to fight others to order). Overall nice spot in the East Village, but not the place if you are looking for something chill or low key",,,

Once we walked in, we liked it, but we loved the bartender more. Initially my friend and I just came for some drinks after dinner on a Wednesday. We met Andrew (my absolute favorite bartender ever by the way) and we ended up staying until after last call just hanging out at the bar drinking.  Now everytime we go in he remembers us and we catch up, then he ridicules us lovingly. He also makes sure my drink is never empty for more than a few seconds. Can you ask for more? No, I don't think so. The bar itself is really cool, you step down into it and it's all dark wood and stools. Love the physical bar itself too. I honestly don't remember the price of all the drinks, I usually just open up a tab and I am never scared to get the bill at the end of the night. the $5 sweet tea vodka and lemonades are so good too!The scene varies each night. Sometimes an older 30ish crowd, sometimes yuppies recently out of college. But  usually get friendly when drunk and don't have problems here. We've gone in regularly this past summer, enjoying all their bartenders eventually, but if we hadn't found Andrew I'm not sure would be coming as often or staying as long as we usually do.

I order two drinks and he charge me for an extra one which I didnt order then he got upset because I didnt tip him with my card that I paid with. Since Im a nice person I later then tip him and tipped him $100 SO he can learn how to NOT judge me or anyone who comes into the bar alone. Its a lesson learn to treat everyone the same even if they dont tip you or not because you never know who you are going to bump into. Hopefully he can read this comment and respond, would highly LOVE to see his view on this situation. And the funny thing is after I was a little buzz and tip him the $100 he tried to act nice and give me an extra shot that clearly I wasnt going to drink and it was of the wackest patron there and I left it right on the table and ask if anyone wants it and also ask him if he's girlfriend was around and took it to her.

105,Alex P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,1,1.0,2/19/2011,"I was also there when the bouncer and owner rejected someone with a service dog.  First of all, I have tons of respect for owners of NYC businesses, especially an East Village bar. I can't even imagine all the laws, issues, and situations they have to balance to stay afloat. But on this night, the owner had a very clear and easy decision and he blew it. His decision was between allowing (non-segregated) access to a service dog and its owner versus irrational concerns over health inspectors and people with allergies.  I'm sorry, but there are civil rights laws on the books protecting access rights for service dogs (cited in the other review). Health inspectors aren't going to write you up for that. And allergies are a bitch, but come on, you totally just made that one up.To everyone's credit, the discussion stayed calm and civil, but just ended in a stubborn stalemate. If the owner has a chance to review the law, apologize and guarantee future access to service dogs, I would change my review.P.S. The dog was so cute!",,,

The bartender was less than friendly. Upon receiving our drinks I discovered my wine glass had pink lip gloss stain on it (I'm not a pink lip gloss type of gal). I kindly asked the bartender if he could get me a new glass (showing him my glass) and once again he was less than sorry about the situation and I believe even grunted. My second glass was not much better but deciding not to ruin the good time with the good company we didn't say anything the second time...paid our $7 per wine glass and left.,1,,

The ceilings are a little low, for those who are nervous about that kind of thing, and despite the fact that it's not exactly packed all the time, it can get quite cramped due to the thin layout. Not exactly one of my favorite bars; it's selection is average, and the prices don't make me want to come back, either. At the same time, this is the kind of place you can pop into for a quick drink before a show or after dinner. Plus, the name rocks.BEER SELECTION: Average all around with prices to match.SERVICE: Nothing flashy, nothing sub-par. Simply ""meh"".Don't come in here expecting to watch the game.

No, bartenders/customers aren't very outgoing and just doesn't have the feel.  Club?  Not trendy enough, wrong music for continuous dancing.  Lounge?  You have to yell.

160,Jocelyn S.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",182,13,0,5.0,5/3/2009,"This bar will forever hold a special place in my heart, as it was the first one I ever stepped foot in in the city.  It's turned into the go-to bar for my friends and me, and the bartender has our Magners opened and waiting for us in the time it takes for us to walk through the door and down to the bar.  Quite a nice touch.  It can be really packed, but I've never had to fight my way through a crowd.  Usually not a line for the bathroom (huge plus!).  I foresee myself going there many a night in the future, and recommend it hands down.",1,,1
161,Ankita I.,"New York, NY",115,76,0,4.0,2/12/2010,"my roommate and i have been eye-ing this bar for a couple months now because of the name...the thirsty scholar...how CUTE!! so anyway, we finally made it out there last weekend on our way bar hopping and it definitely lived up to its name. inside, there were all these old musty books piled as well as all these other ""scholarly"" items as decoration. I have to say, VERYY cute :) i was a huge fan of the whole thing. I would say go there for a drink or two... It wasn't a place I could spend all night but should definitely be one of the stops if you are bar hopping in area.",,,
162,Gina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",254,207,2,5.0,12/11/2005,"I went there the other night and had a blast.  The bartenders are quick and nice and the bar was busy, but I never felt packed in.",3,1,1
163,Vicky L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,57,0,4.0,12/7/2008,"What a cute and cozy little spot!  I went there late-night on a Saturday with friends.  It wasn't too crowded, bartenders served quickly and with a smile.  The music wasn't all that pop-y stuff, but I nice mix of now and then alternative (i.e. Queens of the Stone Age, No Doubt, etc.). What's even better is that it wasn't too loud or overpowering, my friends and I were able to hold a conversation without shouting.  All in all, a very chill bar, I'll definitely be back.",2,,2
164,Anthony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,50,6,3.0,9/20/2007,"A lot of my friends actually go here for some reason. It's not a bad bar...just kinda a pub you sit around and chat [if you can actually hear eachother]. This is a good place to stop and meet people while bar hopping but not a place I'd hang out at all night, unless your having a really good conversation. The bartenders are really cool too.",2,,2
165,Joe P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,0,5.0,7/5/2010,"My first ""bar"" experience in NYC and I really enjoyed it. The bartender was as nice as could be and the $6 for a shot and 1/2 pint deal was very reasonable.",,,
166,J K.,"Seattle, WA",3,656,67,3.0,12/7/2008,"Pretty good bar, until it got crowded.  It was cozy and friendly and they have good hot boozey drinks.",1,1,1
167,Doreen L.,"Long Island, NY",282,604,36,3.0,6/6/2008,"not too bad but not that amazing, either. had a beer here - and liked the fact that it was pretty empty, pretty dark and pretty quiet. not very many annoying people - and the candles and nooks are a nice touch. wasn't blown away - it's just another stop along that row of bars, i suppose.",1,,2
168,Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",688,1833,7,4.0,5/30/2006,"It's a bar, much like most others. Good beer, but the drinks are smallish. What I really like about this place is the people who go there...very very friendly. The bouncer is great, he let me run in just to use the bathroom once, which can be rough in NYC, but hey, I ended up staying for a drink, so I guess they win!",1,1,1
169,Lindsay P.,"Denver, CO",4,54,0,5.0,9/4/2007,"This is one of those great neighborhood bars where the bartender remembers you when you walk in. They have great happy hour specials (including food from Ryan's Irish Pub, which is two doors down) and darts, but Pete the bartender is by far the best thing about this place. He is one of the best and nicest bartenders I've come across.This is not the place you are getting dressed to go to on a Friday or Saturday night, but it is a perfect place to come after work, relax and have a drink.Say hi to Pete for me!",1,,2
170,Elizabeth P.,"New York, NY",25,147,1,2.0,10/14/2006,"a bar's a bar's a bar... this bar didn't stand out to me in the night-long bar hopping.  The bar next door is way better, with great specials (sorry, can't remember the name of it, but it's to the right as you exit the thirsty scholar)... either way, this place had waaay overpriced drinks, and the bouncer guy tried to get me to flash him.... gross.",1,,1
171,Betty B.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,30,0,5.0,2/7/2012,"I've come to the Thirsty Scholar a handful of times already in my short time living in New York, and I love the place. It's a quiet little bar that has a great ambience to it and is more so for the relaxed drinker. The beer selection leaves a bit to be desired, but I think this is made up with the fact that they serve larger then normal sized pint glasses so it makes up for it. The best part about this place is the bartenders who are all very friendly and willing to talk to the patrons. One in particular remembered me after one visit, and ever since has learned my name and even which beer I prefer. That tells me a lot about the character of a bar that encourages it's employees to interact with the patrons. All in all, it's a great little place that I love to go to after a day of classes for a well poured pint of Guinness. Oh, beware though on the weekends it can pretty packed around 10pm, so my advice is to head there a bit early.",,,
172,Brittany W.,"Portland, OR",101,122,0,3.0,9/18/2006,bartender was nice about accomidating the yelp bar crawl...but didnt give us as much of a deal as other places didcool decor.... the einstien replicata when you first walk in is alittle creepybut besides that decent bar....,1,,
173,Jessica A.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,181,0,4.0,5/4/2006,"Great little place- great atmosphere, bartender, clientele. Nice talkative bunch. It may have been fun since my friend and I walked in last night, the bartender asked us how we were, and she replied, ""drunk.""",,1,
174,Owen H.,"New York, NY",8,37,0,2.0,7/29/2009,"So dull. The somewhat interesting exterior belies a completely forgettable interior. Prices are modest but not great, the space is very narrow and the ceilings are pretty low. It's also in the few times I've been mostly occupied by dudes. I suppose that's a plus or minus depending on your scene of choice.",,,
175,Nish P.,"Long Island, NY",12,31,0,3.0,3/31/2011,"Music sucked,expensive drinks. I gave this place 3 stars for the polite waitress.",,,
176,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",686,1303,3044,2.0,11/27/2008,"Ultimately came here on election night to watch the results.  Their advantage over the neighboring bars was that they had tvs, they were tuned the appropriate channels, and I could actually get a seat at the bar.  The bar itself was pretty simple with a narrow selection of drinks.  I was sort of surprised that the bartender was unaware of some common mixed drinks and was not too attentive to customers even after being tipped.  All in all, not a bar I would regularly visit.",,,
177,Francesca G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,88,0,3.0,2/3/2006,"Edit: They lose points for having some of the most obnoxious bouncers I've ever come across.  I was entertaining a friend from overseas a few weeks ago, and not only were we told we couldn't go in because he ""only"" had an international driver's license, but the bouncer wouldn't even let me get our regular bartender to vouch for us, even though I had a NY State ID.  ""It's not up to him... *I* make the calls.""  Okay, ego!  Lame.  Now that my favorite bartender's been relocated, I have no reason to go there. Original Review: I've been going to Thirsty Scholar for a while now, and everyone I take there ends up making it their new favorite meeting spot.  The bartenders are awesome (Alan's one of the friendliest, most attentive bartenders I've ever met, and that's saying something).  It's very upbeat, and fun, and even the bouncer is friendly!  Very Irish decor, but not to an overwhelming, cliche level.",,,
178,Jessica M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",12,40,0,2.0,10/20/2008,"ugh. this place was full of budding bromances and flabby girls in halter tops and bad highlights. if i wanted this shit i would have stayed in LA. plus i had to practically sock the bartender in the side of the head to get him to help us, despite the fact that there was pretty much nobody there.however, shit was relatively cheap.however again, we were given tequila shots with NO SALT AND NO LIME. is salt expensive, guys? heh?maybe i'm just not thirsty or scholarly enough for this business.",,,
179,Nicola B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,4.0,4/17/2011,"Great little bar, loving the sawdust on the floor and all the knicknacks hanging on the walls.  Drinks are reasonable and the staff lovely.  Defintely a bar to checkout.",,,
180,John K.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,20,0,4.0,2/2/2009,"I went here last night for the Super Bowl. Actually I had been here twice before as well. It's small, but the bar keeps are very friendly, give out free rounds, and if you're at the bar they'll have another round for you before you can ask.",,,
181,Groundresonance C.,"Seattle, WA",0,99,16,1.0,2/19/2011,"Tried to go here for a drink last night with 4 friends and they wouldn't let us in because one of us had a service dog.  When we explained to the bouncer that any service dog has public access to any public establishment under NY State law and showed him the dog's paperwork, the bouncer said he couldn't let us in because someone might be allergic to the dog.  I then asked what if there was a sight impaired person with dog, would he let them in and he said yes.  This made no sense, so we asked for the manager.  He said he was the manager and we could tell he was lying so we called him on it.  He eventually went to talk to someone he called the owner and the owner said if we wanted to stay, we'd have to remain in the corner with the dog.  We said we had the right to bring the dog anywhere in the pub and both the owner and bouncer got in our faces and started to accuse us of causing problems.  We argued on principal, but eventually left when it became apparent that it was just a power struggle and no one was going to back down.  When we asked for the owner's business card, he refused to give us one and said he gets ""sued all the time"".",3,2,1

186,J T.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/9/2010,"I never wrote a negative review about a bar but I felt that others should be informed about this establishment. I visited this bar tonight with a friend and ordered one drink.  As I was leaving the bartender thought that I did not pay. All of a sudden, as I was about to leave, a different female bartender stepped in front of me and said that I needed to pay.  Both the female bartender and the bouncer were very aggressive and tried to physically stop me from leaving. I told her that I had already paid. The bouncer physically pulled on my arm and threatened to call the police. I was accused of something that I did not do and felt very intimidated. I am just so shocked and appalled that this happened to me. I have actually been to this bar a few times in the past, but never will I go there again. This incident was so unfortunate and I do not want another patron to experience what happened to me.",,,
