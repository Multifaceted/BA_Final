0,Joi B.,"Long Island, NY",3907,1738,1274,4.0,9/25/2018,"I love seeing performances here because the sound is pristine and the stage/seating affords everyone a good view. I need to keep an eye on their schedule because in the past I've seen brilliant performances by solo members of popular bands that would otherwise be playing in much larger venues. On Saturday night, I had the privilege of seeing German chanteuse, Katharine Mehrling. The performance and sound were super impressive and I was pretty blown away! The tickets came at a surprisingly affordable price at $20. I know every show is priced differently but this is really a NY steal if you ask me.As others mention, there's the drink or food minimum which didn't seem especially enforced as each time we wanted to order, we had to flag our server which I hate doing, especially at a show. The service was pretty much the only slightly sour note, besides the fact that they shockingly don't enforce a ""don't talk during performances"" policy (two guys behind me held a conversation throughout the show. I really don't love having to tell people to be quiet when that's just common courtesy). Those two slight complaints aside, I will gladly support this theater on the regular and recommend that you do the same. Just please go outside to chat! And Joe's Pub, encourage your staff to keep the drinks coming!",17,9,13
1,Neighborly N.,"New York, NY",0,61,18,5.0,9/21/2018,"This is an awesome venue for live performances. I always have a grand time here! I fell in love with flamenco here and keep coming back. If you have never seen flamenco live, you absolutely must see it at Joe's Pub. I guaranty you'll fall in love with it too!This is NOT a vegetarian friendly environment. My only wish is that the menu were more representative of what people normally eat. Finding an entree or appetizer is too troubling here and requires so much work to force myself into eating the least of all the things I hate.",,,
2,Tracey A.,"Marin County, CA",297,1261,1571,4.0,9/12/2018,"If you're headed to NYC and you haven't checked the calendar at Joe's Pub you're heading there unarmed.  Holding tickets to at least one event at Joe's Pub is standard operating procedure in my household.  Why?  A huge variety of shows to choose from, an intimate (but not tiny) space and, with the exception of a few ""too close to the stage"" seats, every seat in the house is quite good.  On an earlier visit I made time for a jazzy CD release party for a Turkish big band.  My most recent visit included an evening spent watching Kevin Smith Kirkwood (Kinky Boots) channel Whitney Houston (RIP), featuring doppelgängers for both Bobby Brown and Mariah Carey.  Just reading that you're probably regretting not sitting in that audience.  When you purchase your ticket you also select your seating and I'd recommend somewhere a table or two removed from the very front.  Beyond that, there's excellent sight lines and great sound from everywhere.  Show prices vary and each ticket requires either a $12 food purchase or 2 drinks which is standard for a place like this.  Joe's Pub is great on theater off-nights (generally Mondays or Sundays) when the Public (with which Joe's shares the building) is otherwise quiet.  It can also be good if you're seeking a fun, last-minute outing.  Cheaper and different than a Broadway show, Joe's Pub makes for a great night out.  I've never had a bad time here and expect I never will.",5,4,5
3,Audrey L.,"Englishtown, NJ",121,121,377,4.0,11/8/2018,Came to Joe's pub with a 14 person group to see Ryan Raftery perform the Obsessions of Calvin Klein. Ryan is amazing....he wrote the show and performed.  He's an amazing talent not to be missed.  The venue is small and set up cabaret style. You are crunched in at small tables but any seat is a good seat.  Food and drinks are served during show....$12 minimum per person.  Show tix were $45.  It's the place to see up and coming performances without taking a big chunk of change out of your wallet. Also handicapped accessible and parking sometimes on street or garage next door.,1,,1
4,Brenda P.,"Manhattan, NY",3,72,152,2.0,4/10/2018,"Pictures say more than a thousand words. Call me crazy but when I order the ""burrata, roasted carrots, orange and farro,"" and I'm expected to pay $18 for it, I expect much more than a tiny piece of burrata with exactly 12 (TWELVE!) tiny farro grains (please see my picture with count in green dots for evidence), and ONE orange slice sliced in 4 tiny pieces. This is abuse and my stomach, wallet and dignity felt violated. As a music venue, this place rocks. It's small and intimate. I wish there wasn't a minimum consumption, OR that the prices weren't so high, OR that the quality and quantity of the food were reasonable/a good value. At least one out of the three would be awesome. I give 2 stars instead of one because at least service was decent and because of the place as a music venue.",5,4,
5,Kimberly S.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,5,0,1.0,11/5/2018,"Saw the Tiger Lillies, who were absolutely amazing as always. Even Joe's Pub couldn't ruin the show, although they certainly tried really, really hard. After we sat there ignored for almost an hour, watching them constantly walk right in front of us over and over and over again bringing food and drinks to other tables, they finally came to take our order.  I laughed.  I wanted something an hour before. They said it was our server's first night. No apologies, just that explanation.  No management overseeing anything, making sure everyone was served. Although I was hungry and had to watch everyone else around us eat, that wasn't the worst part.  Servers loudly discussed orders next to us during quiet, moody songs, banged into my leg and table over and over again, and the seating was cramped and uncomfortable.  I hope I can avoid this place at all costs in the future, and the Tiger Lillies play somewhere else!",2,,
6,Cam E.,"New York, NY",601,196,1228,5.0,12/8/2017,"Joe's Pub is the quintessential New York music /performance spot. Excellent acoustics and good roster of performers.It's a good fun night venue compared to most. You're not squeezed in too tight, every seat has good views, the staff is great, plus the drinks menu and food menus are above par for this type of establishment.  You are guaranteed a fun experience! We love Loser's Lounge. They are the best note for note accuracy for every group they mimic, QUEEN, the BEE GEES, and tonight, Burt Bacharach.We all just love Joe's Pub!**cover is usually $30 with 2 drink and/or $12 food minimum **",20,10,25

8,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,5/17/2018,"Went here with some friends to see a comedy-type show. The show had some high points and not so high points, but it was decent overall.As for the food, I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with a side salad. The side salad wasn't dressed completely enough, but it was quite large. I honestly wasn't expecting much from the fried chicken sandwich, but aside from it being a little on the small side, it was actually quite tasty. And being it's the cheapest entree on the menu ($19), I highly recommend it.Overall, this place serves up some decent food at slightly-higher-than-they-should-be prices and the shows are hit or miss. The service is minimal, but what else would you expect for a meal during a live event.",2,,
9,Dan W.,"West Hollywood, CA",70,13,1,4.0,9/12/2018,My husband and I enjoyed a beautiful night at Joe's Pub on Saturday night. We saw the delightful Justin Vivian Bond who was wonderful as usual and had a blast. The food was much better than I had expected and the venue is just divine! I couldn't believe how gorgeous and grand it feels. The staff were lovely and competent as well! The only little gripe I have is that you couldn't get a drink before the doors opened. At least 50 people were their early (it was 8.30 in a Sat) so a good chance for the venue to make some cash. And the seating in some areas (where we were) were WAY too close! Please shuffle the tables a little!!! There was room. But overall a fantastic experience. We'll be back soon!,,,
10,Karen J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",154,36,45,5.0,8/24/2018,"Lovely venue, good set up, great live music. Servers and staff were super friendly and attentive.

11,Ben C.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,4.0,8/31/2018,"Went to see a show last week and, since I don't drink, I had to order $12 worth of food.  I wound up spending $15 on the fried mac and cheese ($20 with a generous tip/didn't want to wait for change) and it was much better than it needed to be.  In fact, if you knocked the price down to $10 or so, I'd say it would be worth the money.  If I recall correctly, there were five or six of the cube-shaped bites.  On top of them was a heaping portion of microplane-grated parmesan and an herb that I couldn't quite identify but which added a very nice freshness.  In the middle, there was a mini-gravy boat filled with buffalo sauce.The bites themselves were very well fried, not at all greasy.  The texture contrast of crunch, chewy (from the pasta), and creamy worked quite well.  They were salty but not too salty.  The flavors of the cheese, especially the grated parmesan, came through quite well.  For $15, I would normally expect more food than was served, but the situation is like a movie theater concession that is mandatory, so for what it was, it was very good.  That said, I wish the venue didn't make drink or food purchase mandatory, but it's a non-profit and operating costs are very high in lower Manhattan (or any part of Manhattan), so I understand why they would do that.  It's either that or raise ticket prices.The only issue I had was with the service, with requests for water going unheeded, but I think that's just a limitation of the context.  The space itself is quite nice, with good acoustics and lighting.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable and there could be a bit more elbow room, but that's the kind of nit-picky stuff that keeps it from being a five-star venue.",,,
12,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,472,774,4.0,4/16/2018,"Have performed at and been an audience member at this top-notch place. When tourists think of a ""cool night out in NYC,"" this is it. The incredible acoustics, the lighting, the intimate seating. Even the food is great; saw Jake Shimabukuro perform tonight and we ordered the cheeseburger and fries, the fish tacos and the broccolini. Would order all of this again, but get the broccolini without the smokey sauce underneath. My two gripes with this place is the mandatory cover charge, and their choices of theater shows to feature; a lot of the theater is that very downtown, aware its ""edgy and avant-garde"" kind of theater that gets a NYT critic pick but not a major following with longevity. This keeps out the great shows that are fresh but maybe not ""cool,"" by their standards.",1,,
13,John F.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,286,276,4.0,10/1/2017,"Food isn't bad, atmosphere is a little stuffy. Drinks are pricey, but beers are not crazy. Obviously it is hard to review this place without taking into account the show.We saw Grace Kelly there... And she is great everytime. It was an engaging show, and when she closed by wandering the crowd, it really brought out the venue itself.I'd definitely get back there to see another show.",1,,1
14,Annie H.,"New York, NY",214,589,1726,3.0,1/13/2018,"I would've had a great time at the show and the venue is definitely nice, but a MAJOR warning to those that come after me with any dietary reactions to not trust the food here.The waiter had checked for me which items were gluten free as I'm still working though how not to be a hermit while celiac, and I ordered the shrimp taco - especially since at most places, the shell is safely made of corn. This is NOT the case here, I realized from the texture of the taco after a few bites that it was clearly made of flour (or at least a corn and wheat flour mix), and the reaction was so bad that even though I typically don't show any symptoms from a small amount of gluten contamination till a few hours later, my stomach was immediately grumbling all night and I felt sick the entire show. This is the first establishment that I've ever encountered this with, and while I love the performance and space, I am not thrilled about the major and lingering health implications this has caused, and would strongly advice anyone with dietary restrictions to be mindful not to order anything while enjoying a show.",5,,
15,Alexandra L.,"Manhattan, NY",1021,679,2376,4.0,5/16/2017,"The Quick: What a cool venue to see a performance in! The food was good, but the vibe was better. The Details: Whenever a restaurant has a comedian or show, usually the food is awful and you're forced to buy it with the price of admission. At Joe's, the food was very good, and the performance was even better! Really enjoyed this venue. The Damage: since I didn't pay, unfortunately I cannot comment. Check the menu, seemed a tad bit pricier than expected, but you pay for the entertainment",12,5,9
16,Ben S.,"New York, NY",0,17,0,2.0,6/8/2018,"I went here for a gig the first time last night.  The music was great.  The service was fine.The food is massively over-priced.  I paid $29 for a little skillet of cooked veggies.  In most other places in the city, I would expect to pay no more than about $15 for such a dish.  Blatant ripping off, my recommendation would be to eat first and then go to this place.  I will note that the prices for drinks seemed OK (I think my beer was about $7).",2,,
17,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,11/20/2017,"What a classy little place for watching live music, shows. Perfect place for couples who would like to watch a live performance with an intimate setting. They have a $12 min cocktail per person requirement which isn't quite bad. They have quite a lot of variety of cocktails and most of them are pretty good. We ordered the fried Mac and cheese with buffalo sauce which was out of the world. Their French fries were pretty amazing too! So much so that we requested another round and even though their kitchen had just closed, they gracefully obliged to our request.",,,
18,Jameelah S.,"Manhattan, NY",284,264,1988,4.0,2/8/2018,"There's a divey-hipster feel to this venue. The show that I saw was unbelievable... Kevin Smith Kirkwood in ""Classic Whitney Alive"" with several outfit changes (especially the pop out of the initial windbreaker out a la National Anthem) and special guest was the ultimate show. They packed us in there with the tables positioned close enough to get the maximum bodies with out being exactly on top of one another. The crowd was friendly so the close proximity was not uncomfortable! We sang, danced/ rocked & ""broke bread"" together; fun indeed!",1,1,1
19,Suri M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,171,11,4.0,3/25/2018,"It's New York City, so you have your choice of live music venues every night. If you decide to come here, it's for a special (read: extravagant) night out. Show tickets start at $30 (plus fees), and there's a drink/food minimum order once you're inside. You might get lucky, or you might have to spend at least $12 on food or buy at least 2 drinks. So buy a cocktail and have a good time! Leave a generous tip :) The food is pretty expensive for what it is, but there are plenty of vegetarian options (beet salad, cheese plate, etc).",,,
20,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,3/30/2016,"I received tickets to a show here as a gift and I'm so grateful because I don't think it's something I would have explored otherwise. The $14 food/drink minimum is annoying in theory, but really if you think about it what show/bar/restaurant would you go to in the area and not spend that much? The roasted beet and blood orange salad was tasty, as were the fries. The menu isn't anything super original but they have a good variety of hearty bites and I enjoyed the wine, too. Definitely not cheap ($19 for a burger), but again - these are the inflated prices you expect when you go to a place like this.The experience, though, is really all about the space. The stage is pretty small, but from what I could tell every table had an amazing view of the stage. The tiered dinner show layout felt really retro and fun to me - definitely not your typical concert! The sound was awesome and the servers were pretty good about getting orders and delivering food and drinks without being distracting.",12,7,12
21,Emily L.,"Boston, MA",236,174,133,4.0,3/27/2017,"It was my first time at Joe's when I came to see my favorite folk artist perform with a few friends. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the place impressed us with the rich furnishings and intimate size. From the seating chart it had been hard to tell how far from the stage we would be, but in the lower area we were up close without obstructions, great for enjoying the music.There's a $12 minimum for drinks and food, but we decided to have dinner and that put us well over the limit easily. Getting there 30 minutes beforehand definitely helped us get settled and take our time with ordering so we could start our meals before the show. Our server was fantastic and attentive, with some good recommendations on the menu. She handled my dietary restrictions well and came back with helpful answers from the chef. I got two appetizer portions, which were plenty filling: pork tacos (no longer on the menu but delicious with just the right amount of kick) and roasted beets (at that time, 2 types of beets -- refreshing, but I was beat by beets afterward). My friends enjoyed the cauliflower cassoulet and burger, but the winner was the fried chicken sandwich.Price-wise, entrees are in the $20s all the way up to high $30s, which is rather expensive but at least it was quality fare. Not a cheap night out, but then again, we were there for the music and it all jived together harmoniously.",1,,

25,Jeannette L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1436,781,2455,4.0,8/7/2015,"I went to Joe's Pub for a concert recently with my boyfriend, who got a table for our group of four. We went to a 9pm show. He has been to this venue a few times and really enjoyed the acoustics of the space, in addition to having good times there. From Lafayette street, you walk up these tiered steps to the main entrance. Once inside, we were greeted by a staffer who asked us if we had tickets. We had purchased them online and needed to pick them up Will Call. The queue was fast and we got our tickets right away. The venue recommends that you arrive 30 minutes before the show. This way, the staff can escort you to your seat or table. There was a show before the 9pm one, so everyone for the 9pm show was in line in front of the hall's doorway. Once the crowd from the earlier show let out, doors opened and we were seated. Our group was at Table 37, which is further back in the room. You get a good view of the entire stage. The acoustics of the room are so good that it doesn't really matter where you are seated. Our waitress was very friendly and really took care of us. For a table, there's an order minimum (either 2 drinks or $15 worth of food per person). We ordered starters and sides to share, and a few drinks.- Corn Salad, Wild Arugula, Walnuts, Sherry: This was really good. I wasn't totally sure what to expect, but we all thought it was delicious. I would order it again. - French Fries with Malt Vinegar Mayo: You get a good amount of fries and they are the thin, extra crispy fries (very tasty). Great item to share at the table. - Night At the Drive In Cocktail (Vodka and Prosecco): So I'm not a cocktail person, but I wanted to try one of their signatures. It was good. A little too sweet for my personal taste, but I think it's good as a cocktail. It kind of tasted like a drink form of those Hostess Cherry Fruit Pies (you know, those two squares with the glaze on top in a wax paper wrapper). - Narragansett Lager draft beer: A nice lager.I had a nice time. It was a pricey night, but I had a good time. This is a place where - for me - I would only go if I really loved the act and the act did not play as often in the area. It's like a special occasion/event venue for me.",1,1,1

28,Mark P.,"Brooklyn, NY",81,6,0,5.0,5/31/2017,"My favorite venue for music in the city. Before I moved to NYC, I rarely went out to hear music, but the acts here are eclectic and fascinating. I've never had a bad seat in the house and I've loved every show I've gone to. While there is a food/drink minimum and some stuff is over my budget, you can satisfy the requirement with their affordable yet delicious burger and fries. And they have a knack for booking great world music talent. As somebody with a particular interest in various aspects of Japanese music, I greatly appreciate how many Japanese acts they've booked in particular. But quite frankly, everything that goes on here (and at The Public Theater in the same building for that matter) sounds interesting. After I went a few times, I googled the name of the person in charge of programming. Her name is Shanta Thakes and if you're reading this Ms. Thakes, keep up the good work! :)",,,

The 2 stars are for the show room! Very cool. you feel so close to the scene and the acoustic is great the - 3 stars if for the service. The guy who took care of us was very rude. He was probably very stressed... but come on it is not a reason to talk that way. you can explain nicely that you will be back in 1 minute. The ton of his voice was very aggressive. The second thing i did not like was the 2 minimum drink. i honestly don't like to be force to pay for something I don;t specially want.

The space was perfect. The sound system was tip top to ensure the music wasn't echoing (told you this was no normal rendition of 12th night) and the seats where comfy.Lastly, staff. Lovely stuff.

Reserved seats and table create true order from chaos - making it all run very smooth.Servings and drinks are darn good pub food - hence the term ""Joe's Pub"". - so don't expect a Michelin experience.

I was further from my date then I may have wanted to be so we couldn't interact a lot during our time there - but alas, the show wasn't very long. Over before you know it.No one really hangs out afterwards. You're in for the show, then out. Could be good for a first date that you're unsure about.

We were here to see a performer and I had never been to this venue before.  It is super easy to get to and we didn't have to wait at all to get in the door.  Tons of friendly staff to help seat you and the server was there in a matter of seconds to grab us a drink.  They do carry a drink minimum, but it is pretty easy to meet.  Some have complained about the minimum, but honestly it was very easy to meet.  (One drink or an app and you have met it!)  The room is awesome and looks large, but in reality it is a smaller more intimate venue that doesn't make you feel cramped for space.  We didn't try anything off of the menu, but the food looked amazing!  Overall this is a really great place to catch a show if you can.  I will be back for sure.",2,1,2
41,Jake B.,"New York, NY",117,5,1,1.0,5/30/2016,"You buy 2 tickets at a Joe's Pub at The Public.The price is reasonable (30USD a pop) so I decide to purchase them.-Then there's this:1. Beside forcing you to give your phone, address, etc - which u are obligated, even if you live in Buthan (selling it for 3rd party spammers, i guess)2. Then they add fictitious fees. Pub Fee, Pub Facility... what do they mean? Ain't I paying a ticket to enter a venue already?3. And then they ask for a minimum purchase of 2 drinks. I was gonna consume more than that anyway - but it's just disgusting on how they try to milk every penny from you.4. Then they have the guts to ask you if you want any of their spammy ""breaking news""5. Finally they let u know that there are no refunds if u change your mind.

42,Natasha C.,"Aberdeen Township, NJ",1,20,12,3.0,6/25/2016,"Went there for the first time with two friends to see Isaac Oliver on Friday, June 24th. The venue space is very nice and there is no such thing as a bad seat! It's very intimate, you're guaranteed to have a good time and even make a new friend due to communal table seating. The food menu wasn't that great and is very pricey. We ordered a fried chicken sandwich ($19) and the fried fish with chips ($32). I wish we would have passed on that as it was not worth the cost. The drinks are overpriced and not that plentiful but the frozen mai tai ($16) was quite delicious (I had two - yum!). The service was great and our server was very attentive even though it was a packed house!All in all, it was a good night and I would definitely return to Joe's Pub again. I would be more cautious next time when ordering food and stick to the delicious frozen mai tai. SUPPORT PUBLIC THEATER!!!!",1,,

47,Zachary S.,"Vero Beach, FL",305,355,3135,5.0,11/19/2015,"Without a doubt the best music venue and night club in the city. It's in a corner of the spacious Public Theater, not tucked in a side street of Greenwich Village, but once inside its intimate and evocative of classic nightclubs. There's not a bad seat in the house and the acoustics and lighting are outstanding. Apart from the admission fee, there is a $12 food minimum and a two drink minimum. Drinks are reasonable by nightclub standards--$15. Compared to now shuttered nightclubs, like the Oak Room at the Algonquin, the food here reflects more current culinary tastes and both food and drink can be had during a performance. The staff is eager to please and helps make it a memorable evening. A great place to bring a first date, or your wife. I'm posting the menu as of 11/19/15. I saw Melissa Errico there last night. She's remarkable anywhere she performs, but Joe's Pub was a perfect venue for her.",1,,1
48,Danny F.,"Seattle, WA",85,107,4,3.0,5/1/2014,"Came here to see the super talented sisters Lily & Madeleine, and was very pleased with the modern, intimate venue. Every ticket's for a seat at a table or a bar facing the stage, and there's not really a bad seat in the house. We were at the very back of the space and still had a great view.I was quite surprised to find that the venue had a two drink minimum, which more than doubled the ticket price as every drink option is extremely expensive; like $14 glasses of wine and $7 for 6 ounce pours of beer. We tried a couple house cocktails (their neutral Manhattan and their take on a gin Martini), which at $15 seemed like a steal relative to the wine, but they really weren't very good. Watery and oversweet. Figuring we'd just lean into the ""I guess we're spending more money here than we thought"" idea, we also ordered the calamari, which was delicious. Everybody else's food certainly looked very tasty, but again the prices for the food quickly make you realize you did not, after all, get a good deal on that show ticket.Our server was attentive, friendly, and very considerate of the fact that everybody was trying to watch a show. A very good experience over all, and I can forgive the high food and drink prices since the tickets themselves weren't very expensive. It would be nice, though, if they made it clearer upfront that you're gonna have to spend more than twice as much as you thought you would.",5,1,

50,Texican J.,"New York, NY",6,66,61,5.0,7/10/2014,"Joe's Pub is a beautiful, intimate world-class venue tucked away in The Public Theatre. The programming is varied but consistently high-quality. Everyone who visits or lives in New York should visit at least once. Although it relatively new, it has already grown a rich history, including the US debut of Amy Winehouse as well as the infamous New Year's Eve performances of Sandra Bernhard.The one and only drawback, as others have mentioned, is that everyone who purchases a ticket for a show is required to purchase $12 worth of food or order two drinks.I attended last night's preview performance of Bridget Everett's ""Rock Bottom"" and had a really great time and the service was impeccable. I ordered Joe's Burger for $18, which also included crispy fries and stuck to water - definitely the most bang for your buck. (There is only one menu item, the Ruby Red Tacos, which is priced at $12.)Looking forward to seeing many great acts at Joe's Pub in the future! Highly recommended! :)",2,2,1
51,Dude R.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,11/7/2016,"I must break this review down in two parts.  One as a venue, the other as a restaurant.  Venue.  What a great space.  I have been coming here for over 10 years and have had so many wonderful and memorable experiences.  Post the renovations I can only commend them for the improvements on sound and layout.  I do miss being able to stand at the bar and while the space is tight, I would expect this when going to a show.  Restaurant. Well.  Where do we start.  Prior to the renovations the food was expensive for what they were serving.  It was not great but edible.  Recently they changed to Andrew Carmellini's restaurant group and while most of the flavors were on point the entire experience was a total mess.  To start, like I mentioned earlier, the space is so tight.  This does not work when you are eating at a fine dining establishment.  It just doesn't. You are in other peoples heads, arms, feet - whatever ( or 5 inches from ) and if you are over 5'0"" it is impossible to get comfortable.  The drinks that we ordered were over priced and not that great.  One was a Negroni served up.  There are three ingredients in this drink.  It was not mixed properly.  The second was a dirty martini on the rocks.  This was brought out up, send back on the rocks.  It was neither dirty or a martini.  I can appreciate that it was served with castelvetrano olives.  These are great to eat but do not make dirty martinis.  It was also not dirty and cost $18.  Apologies, but for that price it better be the BEST FUCKING MARTINI EVER.  No exceptions. On to dinner.  We had some dishes that we really, really enjoyed.  They were cooked properly and seasoned wonderfully.  This was in the appetizer and sides menu.  One really unpleasant part of the meal was getting a fried chicken sandwich that had burned ( black ) buns. When you spend $20 on a fried chicken sandwich served with a salad you should have really high expectations and these were not met.  Not even close.  Also one came with a pickle, one did not....does it come with a pickle?As for the service, it reminded me of an average restaurant.  The staff was friendly and warm but slow on removing items on the table and was dropping silverware the entire show.  In the old days I would not really care but when the bill is $200 for 4 people that kind of rookie shit is not acceptable.In summary would I go there again?  Probably, but I will be sure to stick with the bottled water.  The most unfortunate part of this entire experience is realizing that the price of this establishment is going to prevent most young and price conscious people from attending shows.  Does not really match what the entire theatre is about. publictheater.org/en/Abo…",1,1,

These kinds of policies give Manhattan it's bad reputation. It just seems sneaky and you really feel as if they don't  value you as the a member of the public who works hard to pay silly NYC rents. Most of us aren't going home to palaces. The argument is, you live in the NYC area to have access to such a plethora of events, concerts, shows. But because of these costs,  this is why I don't go out to shows much anymore. I think this is ultimately why most people leave the city and never look back. Better to put your money on something you can enjoy every day, say, a place to live that isn't a 550 sq ft box.They also are responsible for Shakespeare in the Park, which provides the best commentary- if you want it for free, you better be willing to devote all day to standing in sweltering heat on a line that may not even guarantee you a seat.",3,2,2

My friend and I had tickets closest to the stage. I believe it's called stage seating or something. They lined tables right up against the stage so it's like you're right there with the performer. That's nice and all, but when you're hungry and trying to stuff your face you don't want to be smacking away at any ole thing while Wynton Marsalis is speaking about 2 feet away. If you aren't hungry, go for those seats.

Updated review","I'm increasing my rating by a star just because I saw the most breathtaking show here the other night--called ""The Untouchables,"" it featured members of the New York Theremin Society. The theremin, after all, is the only musical instrument that is played without being touched. The players included Scott Robinson, who included recordings from outer space and whose wife had made him a space suit for the occasion; and Dorit Chrysler, who appeared to pluck notes out of the air--in the manner of Clara Rockmore, a theremin virtuoso of the 20th century. David Schwimmer, who has had a long and stellar career as a studio musician, played music for the love scene from Vertigo. This all has inspired me to dust off my theremin and start practicing up!Still not happy at all with their meat-heavy, pricey menu; I'd gladly order up if I could even eat half the stuff on the menu (I'm  a vegan.) The only thing I can get is a salad, and still they hold me to the minimum--not fair, I say!",4,1,3

67,AleXander X.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,0,1.0,11/6/2014,"We were going to get tickets. $20. First there is a Joe's Pub facility fee of $6. Then a Joe's Pub Cafe venue fee of $3. Up to 49 for 2 tickets. Then while filling in the information they ask for a donation - with a suggested fill-in spot stating $11! - so it would be 60.Continue to checkout and it does an automatic ""round out donation"" to make it $50 [with a ""no thanks"" in tiny grey letters next to that - which we click]. We continue to checkout and notice that there is a minimum 2 drink/$12 per person drink/food requirement.

69,High Standard S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,85,1,2.0,11/27/2014,"I've been attending Joe's Pub performances for years, pre-and post remodeling. Joe's is a comfortable venue, and has reasonable alternative arts programming. The sound system is good for bands. Some acts are small and underground, but have outgrown La Mama or PS 122, and others are big names that could easily fill the Beacon theater.The assigned seating usually translates into being able to choose good views of the stage in advance; although, it can be cramped. The required drink and food purchases can be a bigger problem though. A hamburger cost $19, a glass of wine cost $14, and so on. The current fall, 2014 requirement is two drinks or $12 of food to be purchased per person. Frequently, the place is sold out and understaffed. One night, a salad and a hamburger took 25 minutes to arrive. A glass of wine took 20 minutes. A neighboring table's food was ordered after ours was, but came out first. The folks next to my table even helped out and protested that discrepancy to the waitress who took the order and then mostly disappeared until it was time to bring the bills. Without any sympathy, the waitress defended the lone bartender saying that it was busy and that the bar was backed up. Her dismissive delivery of this excuse seemed so well-prepared, it was as if this was a common experience. She could've warned about the potential delays beforehand so as to not seem like a jerk. Why don't they just hire more staff if they know the place is going to be busy and customers will wind up being pissed off? They go through this every night and should know better. Before the end of the performances, the checks already have arrived at each table, so some things are on time. When booking tickets through the website, the seating chart is useful. When going to actually check out, you'll be turned off by the $3 per-ticket fee, the $3 dollar ""Facility"" fee, as well as the automatic suggested donation the Joe's Pub site filled in on your bill, and which you manually have to remove, and which the site automatically puts back in on the final checkout screen. After your online transaction is completed, you can expect a series of membership solicitation emails and upcoming event  emails to come from the establishment. These are sent regardless of whether not you asked for them.Overall, the general nuisance is their continual money-hungry aggression, more often experienced in ""rent-a-stage"" entertainment venues with far less curatorial prestige, such as the Duplex or Don't Tell Mama.But I'm telling!",4,,
70,Thomas G.,"New York, NY",22,58,1,1.0,9/19/2014,"I wanted to love this place, it's a great feeling location, but while the decor is 5 star, the pricing policy is that of a seedy strip club.I think the two drink minimum is the keep the crowd in place for 2 hours so that they don't leave during the boring shows, I watched Catie Lazarus's painfully slow talkshow style comedy, devoid of anything that came close to laughter or interest. When do $20 tickets cost $50?  - at Joes Pub.Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to pay decent money to watch decent shows but let's have transparency. The ticket Price then has a faculty fee , then has a venue free, then proceeds incredibly aggressively to ask for a donation of $11, then you arrive, are forced to order two drinks per person, and then obviously need to tip.  This place is classy extortion, not a entertainment venue.And for my 250% of face value tickets, I got to see Cate Lazarus's show, which was the most boring 2 hours of my life.

The layout is awesome but get there early if you want a close up seat because it often gets packed. It's good to get there early if your getting food too because it's awkward to order while the band is playing and to turn your back to the band if your table is behind you to eat. They have a full bar, they have plenty of appetizers and entrees on their menu, and a small stage for an intimate setting to view your favorite artists. I had the burger and fries. I wasn't expecting much but it was actually delicious. The sound system was great, lighting and decor was charming, and the waiters were on point. It's a difficult gig I would imagine to offer those services while the show is going on but they managed to creep through the crowd like ninjas oftentimes going unnoticed  (at least by me because I was captivated by the music).

You are really crammed In close quarters and the seats aren't the most comfortable.  The wines were pricy and there was a decent variety to chose from.  The salads were fresh with delicious dressing.  It was great to support public theater!",1,,1
79,David B.,"New York, NY",59,140,2,5.0,12/10/2013,"Joe's Pub is home to one of my favorite events in New York City, the CMA Songwriters Series. These concerts occur about twice a year and feature some of the top country music songwriters, in an intimate setting, playing their hit songs. If you even vaguely like country music, these shows are seriously awesome and you should go check them out. The venue has communal seating, lit only by candlelight, giving off a dark and sultry atmosphere. And, while I don't expect a music venue to have great food, Joe's has a surprisingly tasty menu. My favorite menu item, Joe's Pub burger, comes standard with a burger lover's trio - cheese, bacon and caramelized onions. Instant heave. This burger is enormous. Joe's Pub doesn't shy away from toppings, as melted American cheese envelopes the burger, oozing down the sides and onto the plate. Gobs of caramelized onions and a healthy serving of bacon top the cheese and beef combo.At first bite you realize how tender and juicy the beef is. The bacon adds a hint of salt as the cooked to order meat dissolves in your mouth. The buns are nothing short of a challenge. They are enormous and put up quite a struggle for those trying to consume all vertical layers of bread, onion, bacon, burger and cheese in one bite.The fries don't disappoint either. These thin and crispy potato sticks are doused in salt, perfect to keep you ordering more beer.The VerdictI love country music and that's more than enough to keep me coming back again and again to Joe's Pub. Seriously, the shows are awesome and you should check them out. A major plus is the delicious food. Joe's Burger is my go-to meal every time I'm here and it always lives up to my hopes and dreams. Don't think this place stops at your typical bar food either. The kitchen puts out dishes such as grilled branzino, orecchiette and flat iron steak as well. Great food at a great concert venue, check.",4,1,1

84,Shaun F.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,28,3,5.0,7/22/2013,"I want to tip my hat to the Joe's Pub staff on their customer service.We attended a sold out performance and were seated where props on stage completely obstructed our view. Due to the venue being sold out, the staff were not able to reassign our seats, but the wait-staff watched for no-shows, and managed to relocate the two most obstructed guests to a better viewing location. Furthermore, I received a detailed email from the manager, along with an offer to return for another show. I have been a long time attendee of The Public, and have always enjoyed the variety of shows and venues that they offer. It was my first time requesting customer service, and they did a very classy job of handling my complaint. We look forward to future visits.",4,,

86,Jon C.,"Washington, DC",1,198,81,1.0,5/4/2013,"Overprice sardine can hell hole. That about sums up Joe's Pub. Went here for a concert and was hit with the $12 minimum order scam. The menu is grossly overpriced and really, really awful. My table had the pizza popcorn, ravioli, and a burger, and no one finished half their food. Thinking of just ordered a soda? $5 for a coke. What the heck! Worse they packed us in really tight like sheep in a pen. Some seats don't even face the stage, others are pressed so close to other tables you have to move things around to even get in the chair, and overall it was just a miserable evening. The band was great, the servers was nice and actually seemed to understand and know how bad the place is. I will never go to Joe's Pub again, I don't care who is playing, and I really hope bands take notice of how awful this place treats people.",5,,

Who knew that there was a diamond in rough on Lafayette St. I passed by this place all the time and never noticed it. I came here last night with a friend to catch a gig by The Poison Tree. We sat up front that I could even touch the stage. The ambiance in this place is good. Very relaxing, dimly let, but not too much. If you get a table. There is a minimum of $12/person on food. That was no problem for us cause we came to eat and catch a show.We got the Antipasto Platter and the Deviled Eggs sampler. The Antipasto Platter consisted of 3 kinds of sliced meats, parmesan cheese, olives, grilled flatbread, white beans, Gerkin pickles and spicy mustard. This was really good and good for two people.The deviled eggs were pretty good too. I just wish that we didn't only get $3 pieces for $10. If they gave us about 5 for the price it would have been better.All in all it was a great experience. The food was good, atmosphere of the place was excellent and the band was great.Also don't be shocked to go into the bathroom and see a mix of men and women.

91,Allie M.,"Montclair, NJ",697,188,481,3.0,7/10/2013,"My husband and I came here to see The Black Lillies on July 8, and while we were blown away by the band's performance, we can't say the same about Joe's Pub.First and foremost - there was a *major* time constraint placed on the band, which we found out about before they even started. ""The shows here are generally 60-70 minutes long,"" our waiter told us after I asked to have our food brought out later in the performance (to which he kindly obliged and brought our beer first, followed by our fried calamari about 30-40 minutes into their set). But, really - limiting performances to 60-70 minutes really cramps a band's style! My husband is always checking setlists online, and some of their other performances at similar venues lasted over two hours! They didn't even get to play their full setlist, which we snuck a peek at after the show. My hubby was majorly bummed out when he realized they didn't have time to play a cover of Tennessee Jed.Another let down: they weren't serving their full menu. Apparently, they have a ""condensed menu"" when the surrounding venues are not hosting performances, so many of the items that we scoped out online before the show weren't being offered. We were limited to a few appetizers, a handful of beers, and some New York-priced cocktails (read: $14 and up). Like I mentioned, we ordered the calamari, which was okay, except for that it wasn't just calamari - it was baby octopus, too. I really can't get past the texture of biting into their squishy little noggins, so half the plate remained untouched. The calamari was decent - not delicious. Overall, I think it's a rip-off that this place charges for tickets, then has a minimum food/drink purchase per person, especially when they weren't even serving a full menu!The silver lining: the set-up was nice, with plenty of (communal) tables and a wrap-around bar at the foot of the stage. It wasn't too big, just big enough to comfortably seat everyone while still feeling intimate. The sound quality was good, too.",1,,

93,Paul S.,"Brooklyn, NY",401,147,0,2.0,8/11/2012,"Are you a musician or booking agent? Stay away from Joe's Pub, unless you want to annoy your fans.Warning: Joe's Pub is not a pub.It's an overpriced dinner theatre wannabe. And a poorly-signed one at that.When I go to a show, I expect to pay a cover, watch a show, and perhaps grab a beer. Unfortunately, you don't get to do that at Joe's Pub.Once you managed to find the venue (which lacks a street number or sign), you're blindsided and coerced into buying things you don't want (and aren't very good). After shelling out for tickets (yes, actual paper tickets, which are at least $15), you're expected to order food ($12 minimum) or two drinks (at $8 for a beer or $11 for a cocktail, not cheap).As Philly B. writes, ""the food is ridiculously, deliriously expensive. As are the drinks."" I paid $14 for a vegetable panini that was both lukewarm and near-tasteless.Heath R. sums it up best, describing the problem as that ""Joe's Pub isn't a music venue. It's a dinner theater that, instead of hosting theater events, hosts music performances. So it acts like a dinner theater: Prices are high, drinks are costly, the seats are an unnecessary inconvenience, and they hope you order a meal to claim your table seating.""",6,2,

95,Kate B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,0,2.0,5/29/2014,"I attended Jill Sobule's Yentl performance last night at Joe's Pub and from start to finish, I am wholly disappointed at my experience for what should be a go-to cabaret space in NY.I found out about the event yesterday and was pleased to find a couple tickets left on the website. I purchased an unobstructed view seat - there were several that were partial view and I eschewed those. My seat could not have been more obstructed. I was directly in the back and a 2ft wide column split the center of the stage in half, obstructing both the view of Ms. Sobule and the lead actress. I moved my seat a few inches to the right so I could see the lead singer I had come to see, and it was directly over the checkout station for the servers which was naturally busy all night, and tainted with light pollution. The ticket ordering process was also poor. As I clicked through the screens, the ticket price went from $20 to $24.50, adding the ubiquitous surcharges for convenience - though whose convenience I'm not sure - and at the next screen the price went up to $40. I noticed this and saw that The Public deftly added a $15 ""DONATION"" to my ticket order. A donation by definition is something that is given. The Public was deliberately trying to fool me into ""donating."" So, luckily I caught that and unchecked a box I never checked in the first place. I went to the next screen, my price was back to $24.50. But then at the next it was up to $26. I reviewed the order again. To my surprise, The Public included another $1.50 DONATION in my charge. I unchecked it  again. I'm sure The Public has duped many of its patrons into unwittingly donating. That is classless and tacky. I would expect more from an institution as ""reputable"" as the Public. The concert itself I understand could be hit or miss, but the book to the piece last night was atrocious, the actors ill-prepared, and the entire set looked like it was being made up on the fly. The musicians were impeccable, but it seemed that it hadn't been rehearsed once, and even at the end Ms. Sobule admitted to not having an ending. Not a lyric of the music was memorized. Not much of a performance in my estimation. The lighting too was ill-prepared as lights would haphazardly pop up and cut out on people that were/weren't performing. Food of course is part of the Joe's Pub experience as we are required to eat or drink $12 worth. Of course there is nothing that is $12. I ordered a cheese plate and a ginger ale. The cheese plate is pathetic. There are three extremely small chunks of cheese accompanied by a bunch of very cheap grapes and three tiny slices of paltry toast. I tried in every way to pair the cheese with the items I had and still had a 1/4 left over. Again, another tacky addition to the Joe's Pub experience.  The plate could not have been more pretentious and was most definitely not worth $14. When I received the bill, what a surprise to be charged FIVE DOLLARS for a small ginger ale.  FIVE DOLLARS. I could have purchased four liters of ginger ale for that price. I felt like I was penalized for not drinking liquor. On the way out, I was handed a program for Joe's Pub events - and I was pleased by that. I do like the type of programming and I want to know what's coming up. I scanned through the program. It was the 28th of May. They gave me the program for May. There are only three more days in May. They should have given me the program for June. That was a complete waste. What poor planning. Overall, yes, I will probably return to Joe's Pub, but under protest. I like the programming in general, but the sly additional ""donations,"" the overpriced pretentious fare and poor preparation of the acts will give me pause in attending in the future, and I will definitely articulate these conditions to my colleagues and friends. A place like Joe's Pub at an institution like the Public should be setting an example for other spaces of the kind. From my experience, it has fallen in with the masses, who are just trying to make the most money with the least amount of effort.",8,1,1

I'm also a fan of the seating, which at Joe's Pub is not your typical theater seating. They have table options for larger groups, as well as small booths and tables for smaller parties which are spread out on different levels facing the stage. Table service is provided throughout the show.  Some shows allow you to choose your seating when purchasing tickets online, but others are first come, first serve. There is a $12 minimum food and drink purchase per person for shows. But they do warn you about this when you purchase tickets online. Food is pricey, but I would say alcohol is comparable to most nyc music venues or bars. I would definitely come back to Joe's Pub for another show!",,,

115,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,5.0,10/7/2010,"This space is THE BOMB!!!  I always scramble to get a seat on the cushy couches right by the stage (race ya for it!!!!) so that I can comfortably watch the array of talent they program, which suits everyone's tastes.  The drinks and food are way over priced, particularly for the portions you receive.  But they're comparable prices to any cabaret space in NYC.  And, in general, you're getting a consistently higher calibre of talent to watch while you dine.  In case you didn't know, you can't book Joe's Pub.  They have to find you and invite you to perform there (I'll make sure to tell y'all when I'm scheduled for my debut :-).  It's not an easy cut to make.  So you know you're getting proven quality.Anyhoo, their food is pricey but I've never had anything that I didn't enjoy.  Unfortunately, that's not something I can say for every - if any other - cabaret space in NYC!  And they have a lower food & drink minimum than other spaces.  AND food counts towards that minimum!  Most places don't offer that option.  I especially enjoy Joe's Pub's calamari (which I'm not sure that they offer any more...) and antipasto platter.  And the arugula salad is next on my ""to try"" list as it looks phenomenal (and is actually piled quite high).  The bruschetta also looked good and sizeable (yes.  I'm that guy gawking at your table while deciding what to order for myself :-).The technicians are great.  The space is actually quite versatile for performers who know how to utilize it.  The Box Office Staff are really nice.  And the wait staff really work their tushies off to give you proper, efficient service in a mad house environment.Get there EARLY to wait in line (outside) and get good seats.  It's worth the wait...because otherwise you'll be in the back or on the sides standing for the entire performance.  I'm sure that there have been times when everyone received a seat...but I've never been there when it wasn't a sold out house.I really can't recommend Joe's Pub enough for a really nice night out!",,,

There is a two drink minimum that the waitress kept reminding us about (two Jameson on the rocks $24). The seats are fantastic, I don't think anyone was in the way for anyone else.

117,M S.,"Herndon, VA",5,12,0,3.0,6/6/2014,"I really wanted to like this place! But, I would not go back. It is very attractive and warm. It makes you want to settle in for a long and enjoyable dining experience. However, at every turn the chef missed the mark for my pallet. For example, the Grilled Octopus was perfectly execute and the presentation was right on the mark; but, it floated on a sauce that was very reminiscent of Hellman's Mayonnaise which overwhelmed the flavor. If I had the ability to redesign the plate, I would have chosen something light and citric. Service: Amanda was just OK. We were one of maybe five tables on a Tuesday evening around 7 PM. Maybe that should have been our first sign? I understand that it is difficult to be attentive when you don't have many tables; and, it is easy to mistake the server passing by to check as trying to rush the guest. But, we felt a bit neglected. Our order: Flat Iron Steak (again avoiding gluten), Octopus, Pork Roll, and Arugula salad as well as assorted adult beverages and the soft serve swirl for desert. Obviously not all in that order.",1,,
118,Dave C.,"Pequannock Township, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,1/1/2016,"Just a brief word to highly recommend Joe's Pub, located within The Public Theater, in Manhattan.  The space in shaped like a wide pie wedge with the stage at the point.  The acoustics are sharp and warm.  You sit at tables or counter at two levels with the bar in the rear. My wife & I, along with another couple just saw Garland Jeffreys there on New Year's Eve.  Be aware that there is a 2 drink minimum in addition to the cost of the tickets but I feel that's fair for the quality of the venue. Will return as often as I can.",,,
119,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",719,1501,1720,5.0,6/20/2009,"I first met Joe's Pub with skepticism. I was invited to watch a friend perform. It was a cheap ticket and I invited others to join. One of my friends recommended to reserve a table. The disclaimer was that with table service came a $12 minimum per person. Fees on top of ticket prices? I was a little embarrassed to ask my friends to pay even more. I found out that even if you do standing room, you are still obligated to the $12 minimum. It makes no sense at all other than this is Joe's Pub's money maker. I decided to stick with the plan and got a table. Get a table! You might as well be comfortable if you're gonna pay regardless.I was a first timer at Joe's Pub and thought it to be pretty. It was nice, similar to Yoshi's in the Bay. And just how my friend had insulted Calle Ocho by calling it Chevy's, I had done the same to Joe's Pub. ""Are you kidding me? This is MUCH NICER than Yoshi's!"" she said to me. Lorraine D was right. Joe's Pub blows Yoshi's away. It has a flair of sophistication and it also looks hotter than any Las Vegas club without the sleaze. The tables and bar are illuminated and the only dim lighting available were purple and blue spotlights.We got around the minimum per person by ordering a bottle of wine (chosen from a lacking selection of about 5 kinds of whites and reds) and bruschetta and fries. Our bill came out to $20 a head. It wasn't too bad since we were at an early show and this was our pre dinner to get us through the night. We needed to eat and drink so we weren't just ordering for the hell of it. Again, I will reiterate how ridiculous the table seating policy is. Joe's Pub says it stops seating people at 6:15 PM. This is their ploy to get you to order more. Shows don't start until 7:30 PM. We got to Joe's Pub at 6 and the gates weren't even open yet.All that aside, Joe's Pub provided excellent sound and an up close and personal experience with your act du jour. I'll take Joe's Pub any day along with all the bad. If you ever have a chance, check out the sounds of Sarah Tracey and The Old Ceremony. It'll be the next best thing to checking them out live at Joe's Pub.",4,1,2
120,Megan R.,"Edgeworth, PA",0,39,0,1.0,11/7/2015,Standing in a crowded lobby 1/2 hour after doors were supposed to open and no end in sight. Go elsewhere. Lots of venues in NYC that aren't this much of a hassle.,,,
121,Andrew D.,"Silver Spring, MD",159,307,7,2.0,2/11/2011,"On the surface, Joe's Pub looks like a great venue for shows. The location is great, the decor is cool, and the long list of great acts they have flowing through there is quite spectacular. The ticket prices aren't miserable, and you can buy 'em right at the venue with no ""convenience"" fees.But there are catches... about 70% of the space is taken up by tables. In order to sit at a table, you must make a reservation. A reservation requires a $12 minimum food purchase per person. If you don't make the food minimum, they tack on the extra, no matter how much you pay in drinks (we had a bottle of wine, an app, and a dessert).The food is pretty good, sure, but if I go to see a 9:00PM show on a Thursday, I don't think I can justify dinner at that hour. *grumble, hate*So, if you can't get a table, you get to stand around the bar area, which gets crowded quickly. There is also a 2-drink minimum for hanging out at the bar. So... I can't sit, I have to stand butt-to-hip with all these other guys, and try to see around this column, and you're going to charge me for extra drinks. This is not unreasonable, really, as I probably have two drinks at just about every show I go to, but I dislike the requirements. And the drinks are a little overpriced.A month or so ago, after arriving 45 minutes before our show was set to begin, we were so far back in the line that when we got into the venue, there was nowhere to stand and no tables to be had. Rather than stand and crane our necks to see the show, we gave our tickets to a couple who didn't mind the claustrophobia, and got dessert at Chikalicious instead.So, for the ambiance and the shows, 4.5 stars. For the standing around outside in the cold and getting charged the extra $4 because I wasn't particularly hungry, .5 stars.  All being said, I will hesitate to see shows here in the future.Edit: There's a chance I interpreted my bill wrong, and instead of tacking on the extra because we didn't make our food minimum, I was charged 20% gratuity instead of the 14% I intended to give them, because our service was mediocre. I hate forced gratuities.",10,,

We chalked it up as a coincidence and they would fix it on the tickets. They didn't. Later on they moved both of us to a table and strangely we had the same table seat as well.

128,Ariana H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,12,0,2.0,4/13/2015,"I came here for a friend's event this past weekend and really wanted to enjoy the experience. The Public Theater building is newly renovated and has clean and plentiful amenities. We were able to reserve our seats via their online system which was helpful in visualizing the layout of the space.The service, however, was pretty terrible. We arrived 40 minutes before the show and our waitress was pushy with service. We stuck with overpriced drinks ($14 wine, $15 small, watered down cocktails) for the time being, and she subsequently removed our menus. Once I finished my wine, I then had to wait 15 minutes before getting her attention for another drink, refill of water, and menu once again. We ordered the 'marinated olives' and fried calamari. Marinated I believe means heavily, granularly, salted in this case, and the calamari - soggy. We stuck with these appetizers considering all other entrees were in the $30 range. Since we were very underwhelmed with the service/food thus far, it didn't seem worth the risk. We sat back and enjoyed the show for the next 20 minutes. Our check was then planted atop our table, without notice of last call, or the show ending (granted this was 8:45pm). We did highly enjoy the show and musical experience, though would not return unless expressly requested by a friend once again.",1,,

130,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,2.0,6/23/2010,"Not sure that any other name could be more misrepresentative of this venue. Rather than being a down-to-earth pub for anyone who could be construed as a Joe or someone who would patronize a place owned by a Joe, this was a shi-shi (how's this for an appropriate double meaning...in Korean, shi-shi means weeeeak) lounge-bar that looks like an aquarium lobby that got taken over by a Vegas hotel manager.Perhaps it's my own fault for just going along with a dude from NYU who said he got tickets to a free album release of an obscure and ambient band. When we got there, the 20-year-old bouncers just stared at us blankly; someone had forgotten to put the guy on the list. Accidents happen, but the uppity attitude was really ridiculous, and I was plain embarrassed to stand there in front of a whole bunch of other tools champing at the bit to get inside while this PhD candidate pleaded with the guy smugly holding a list on a clipboard. We got inside and scored a table because there wasn't space anywhere else. AS THEY SAT US, we were informed that there was a two drink minimum. This hidden charge was extremely irritating, but the set was about to begin and I wasn't paying, so we just took a seat. Feeling bad for my companion, though, I ordered a grapefruit juice. ""That's twelve dollars,"" she said, gratuitously, and yet appropriately, because who could have guessed that a thimbleful of grapefruit juice that tasted like it was off an airplane could cost nearly that much.Though I wasn't paying, I winced when I HAD to order a second beverage (Corona this time, though I bet it was like twenty dollars) to fulfill the bogus minimum. We were close to the stage, but my nose was practically in the backs of anorexic and overdressed girls, and the hapless waitstaff kept bumping about and asking people if they needed anything while the band nobly played on.Even if I had money to burn, I doubt I'd visit this place a second time, no matter who was playing (since there are other venues in New York City). It gets two stars only because it wasn't dirty, and because the sound system can't be faulted.

148,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,467,120,4.0,3/27/2010,"So a good friend of mine from Chicago won tickets to a private concert at Joe's Pub for Courtyard Hounds (who is comprised of 2 former members of the Dixie Chix).  And being that I commute to NYC every week, she inquired about giving them to me, after the disheartening fact that she could not get time off from work...BOOOOOOOO on work!And thankfully she was able to transfer them to me.  So last Monday, I was able to attend this concert at Joe's Pub, and unfortunately, I could not find anyone last minute to go with me.  No worries, I am a loner adventurer sometimes :)So the concert started at 7:00, and I was able to leave work around 5:45 to catch the 6 train to Astor Place.  When I got there, I was a bit worried, as there was a queue already out the door.  Promptly I crossed the street, got in line, and got in, as it was also a rainy NYC night.Upon entering, I first noticed what a great venue this was for private concerts.  Great acoustics, amazing layout with tables for dining and couches for those who want to just have drinks.  Cool.  So I opted for a table for four close to the stage.  But then, I noticed there were groups coming in looking for tables for 4, and because I was by myself, I relinquished my table, as I noticed there were tables for 2 right next to the stage.  And voila...scored a smaller table RIGHT in front of the performers.Once I got to my table, I got served right away, and ordered a mojito...what a shock right?  And to be fair, it was delicious!Now that I got a quick buzz going and before the opening act started, I decided to have something to eat.  Although they had a prix fixed menu, I decided to have just a burger, as I was not in the mood to gorge down food like I normally am (long day I suppose).  When they brought the burger...WOW.  Tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly.  And to accompany that were french fries that were amazing.Needless to say, the opening act was good, performed by a musician student from Columbia University.When the main act came out...I was enthralled.  They sounded phenomenal despite their hiatus from the music scene.  And take it from someone who normally does not listen to country music.  And was was cool as well was the fact that they were playing with instruments I have never heard live (banjo and fiddle).  But what made it amazing?  The seat...location location location.  RIGHT in front, being acknowledged by the main performers.OVERALL successful and entertaining evening.  I just wish my friend KK who won the tickets was there to enjoy such a lovely evening filled with such amazing live performance!  Thanks KK!",2,,1
149,Brian L.,"Hoboken, NJ",64,713,8,4.0,12/26/2010,"I am a fan of this venue.  It's sizable, but feels cozy.  You can get really close to the stage (understatement, you can basically be on the stage), or chill by the bar.  There's a $12 min to sit at the tables, but that's easily attainable.  I got the butternut squash soup (good, warm not hot - I'd ask for it to be hot) and the turkey club (large, comes with a side salad and chips).  Both were delectable and well worth the price.  The sofas seem comfy, but I think it was a really odd place to eat.  Some guy was eating a plate of pasta in his hands.",,,
150,Jess B.,"New York, NY",41,218,1,3.0,3/18/2010,"The two times I have been here, I have not paid for my ticket. My boyfriend at the time bought me tickets to see Jose Gonzalez, and I won comp tickets to see the World Record Appreciation Society last night. Both times the people working at Joe's treated us well. First time we had a reservation so we had a table right next to the stage. Since I was on the guest list the second time around, the hostess led us to this secluded booth in the back with velvet couch booths and the best view in the house. So, I can't really complain about my treatment at the Pub. The acts, from what I've sat through and what I see on their line-ups, are high quality and worth the price of admission. And yes, I do find the food/drink minimum to be a bit absurd. The food is not very good at all, and drinks are ridiculously priced. Ginger ale should not cost anyone five dollars, and mediocre paninis should not cost over eight. If you want to just munch on something with a partner, get the antipasto platter and a salad. That will push you about over the $12 food minimum per person limit.",2,,1

The good part about it I guess is that since everything costs 3 times as much as it would at any other place within a 10 block radius it's easy enough to meet the minimum. We had the bruschetta which was good but I kept catching myself loudly crunching at really awkward moments. We also had a panini which was great but the chips were mostly so stale you couldn't eat them and the salad was just a big pile of undressed greens. For $14 I expect better.

First of all, this place looks amazing and is perfect for cabaret shows and performances. Wonderfully intimate! I would give five stars for the ambiance. Great date spot to bring someone you want to impress. Now the bad, the food is pretty bad. It tastes so amateur and homemade. The bar menu is short, but if you must, the mini burgers and the quesadilla are the best value for the $10 per dish. Don't bother ordering anything else. The cocktails are pretty small BUT pricey! $14 for a martini or cocktail. and it was MAR-TINY! There was a tiny wine list as well.Other than that, the staff is nice, the show was great from wherever you were sitting/standing, but the food/drinks really brought it down a star.I will definitely be making a comeback to the Pub though, for the shows and concerts, but I will eat beforehand.",2,1,1

The bar area is nice too, though and has some seating. I once was seated right by the stage and only had a partial view because there was a huge piano in the way. If Jill Sobule is playing here that's a great show to see. I also went to their Canada Day show which was a lot of fun.

When I finally did get to see a show, it turned out to be a Jeffrey & Cole live performance. And it was actually my second time seeing them.I can't claim to be the number one fan of this venue. I like the people who work here- the girl who sold me ticket was a delight. But when I finally got in to see the show (I was more towards the front of the line for once) the person seating me asked if I wanted to be 'near the front of the stage'. I said yes, obviously... and she put me in a corner. NOBODY PUTS BABY IN A CORNER! But in the corner I sat like a good little bitch. And I should have bitched... because it somewhat ruined my experience. Very pretty interior, though. Homey. I would like to see a concert at some point here because it would be the small, intimate experience I like best.This is one of those 2 drink minimum places... which I really hate. The drinks were good, but... I just spent more here than I really wanted to. Especially when I couldn't even see the show. I wish I could give more details about the show itself... I was laughing kind of a lot. ""Becky"" (Max Steele) was there, who they kept introducing as ""recurring character and fan favorite"" - it really was funny every time. The plot of the show was about an evil nanny who seduces Jeffrey. Cole gets kicked out, but comes back to save Jeffrey in the end. They also punctuated the act breaks with scenes from their show on Logo. I saw both Alan Cumming and John Cameron Mitchell in the line waiting to get in, so that was kind of cool.I would totally go see a show here again. Just have to save up my pennies.

It's reminiscint of a speakeasy, with dark candlelit ambiance, velvet walls, scattered tables and a full bar.For this San Francisco gal, I appreciated the opportunity to actually be able to SIT at a show -- such a novelty -- and actually be served cocktails and food (gasp). The specialty cocktails run about $12-14 and I'm pretty sure our fries were $10.

And on the other hand, I hate it. Or at least dislike going there. I guess I'm a reluctant patron. And that's not a good thing.What do I love? The music and performances that are held at Joe's Pub. Their booking is extremely high quality and consistent, and if you're interested in slightly upscale downtown music, Joe's Pub is for you. I've seen Ethan Lipton, Eleni Mandell, and Loser's Lounge there, and every show has been excellent -- despite the fact that it was held at Joe's Pub, not because.What do I hate? The venue. I've not gone to a more uncomfortable, standoffish, and expensive place in New York City for music. Let's take last night's Loser's Lounge show as an example. Tickets cost $25. C. has a friend in the band, so we got one comp -- which made going bearable. (We also got to go backstage, and I spied John Flansburgh.)If you don't have a table or dinner reservation, you're directed to the bar area, which can get pretty crowded pretty quickly. Let's say you order a couple of drinks. C. got a ginger ale. It cost $5. I got a 7&7. It cost $11. Huh? $16 plus tip for a ginger ale and a 7&7?After we stood by the bar for awhile, I found the manager and asked if any seats were open -- if you wait for the people with reservations to straggle in, you can ask for leftover seats at the end, but it's not really welcomed that you just sit down on your own. Luckily, there were two seats open, and we got two on the edge of the floor. (I do thank the manager.) It was a little close and tight, but I was glad to be seated -- and the show was awesome.What I think is happening is this: Joe's Pub isn't a music venue. It's a dinner theater that, instead of hosting theater events, hosts music performances. So it acts like a dinner theater: Prices are high, drinks are costly, the seats are an unnecessary inconvenience, and they hope you order a meal to claim your table seating.When you think of it in that light, it all makes sense: $50 in tickets, $20 in drinks, who knows how much the food costs. But that's a night at the theater. It's a night at the opera.It's not a night out seeing bands, though.",11,1,4

We were one of the first groups in, but of course we didn't have a table reservation, so we had to pony up to the standing room only bar in the back where we were shocked by the $9 well drinks served in candle holders (for serious).  We were all little perturbed by (what I admit was) our lack of understanding of this environment when the hosted squeezed her way through the crowd and made a bee-line directly for my friends and asked if we wanted a table!

It didn't look cramped or anything. The sound the venue gives off is pretty good. I ordered my tickets over the phone and you can make table reservations over the phone as well (but different department- they will transfer you). I didn't make table reservations because of the $12 (each?) food minimum. I arrived at the time the show started and it was sort of hard to find space to stand in without blocking someone's view.Anywho, here is the layout:+ You walk in to find the ticket counter.+ You walk in further to be greeted by the hostesses who then ask you if you have reservations. One of the hostesses asked whether we wanted to get a table, which we declined. They tell you to go up the stairs to the bar to find somewhere to stand.+ Only to find a lower seating level (where the stage is), seating at the edge right above the lower seating level, and seating to the left of the long-stretch-of-a-bar. + This means that there is only a couple of spots to actually stand: along the bar area, on the steps leading up to the seating area to the left of the long bar, and on the lower seating level.+ We managed to not get in trouble for standing in the small area on the lower seating level. Be prepared to be asked by audience members or staff to move (either to go to the bathroom, to serve dinner people their food or to pick up their food after they're done).+ In the lower seating level, directly across from the entrance, is where you will find coat check.

182,Tempest B.,"Portland, OR",232,369,86,2.0,1/8/2007,"Heath R. said everything I was going to say about Joe's Pub, so read his detailed and accurate review.  They book great bands and the atmosphere is lovely, but they way they try to extort money from you is shameful.  You can't really get a good seat unless you make a dinner reservation.  The food is overpriced and none too good.  The bar area gets crowded and has too few seats/stools.  The drinks are also too expensive.  The only reason to come here is if your favorite band or singer is booked and you HAVE to see them and they won't be back in NYC for months or years.  Only under those conditions will I ever set foot in this place again.",4,,1
183,ethan m.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,2,0,1.0,9/20/2010,"A total racket. While they may book some interesting bands and admittedly have a great soundsystem, this is not a fun place to see a show. It's hard not to feel nickle-and-dimed every time you turn around. Everything is overpriced, there's a required 2 drink minimum to stand (effectively $24 on top of your ticket), sitting down will cost you another $12 minimum in food, regardless of how many people are there. If you're feeling spendy and pony-up for the mediocre, overpriced food, be sure to eat fast -- they'll kick you out as soon as the band plays their last note (gotta fit in three shows a night!).As you leave, they shake you upside down over a barrel so make sure they haven't missed any dimes or quarters.I'd be more annoyed at the service which is confrontational, but I just feel bad for these guys having to enforce such customer-unfreindly rules.Expensive isn't always onerous (hey, this is New York, we like to live the good life), but the way Joe's Pub approaches the whole thing will leave a bad taste in your mouth, regardless of how good the music is.",5,3,
184,Whitney M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,40,0,4.0,3/24/2010,I saw Sam Bradley at Joe's Pub in Aug. 2009! I had a great time! At first the show was sold out but later that day I checked back on line and some tickets became available. I got in the day of the show! The venue is very intimate and the sound quality was great.. although you can hear the subway go bye every now and then. Overall Joe's Pub is a great place to see an up in coming band!!! Check out Sam Bradley... he is really talented!,,,
185,Chris L.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,19,10,4.0,7/15/2008,"4 stars for the ambience2 stars for the food. I go to a number of shows here. Get there early as they play right on the dot. It's a classy place to hear some indie music. There's a ticket and a $12 food/drink minimum if you want to sit. The sound is wonderful and there's not a bad seat/place to stand in the house. The rumbling of the subway tracks are only annoying if you're there for a quiet acoustic set, but if you're there to see Amy Winehouse, Kate Nash, or Adele they can easily overpower the rumbling tracks.  But seriously, $10 for a plate of french fries?",3,,2
186,Galvin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",81,208,1,3.0,10/6/2010,"I came here to see a friend play some bluegrass (Sweetback Sisters, hollllaaaaa--or I guess, uh, hoedowwwwwwn), so I didn't mind buying a $15 ticket to get in. However, I was less pleased to be immediately guided to table seating and only later being told there was a $12 charge minimum. Don't worry though, because everything on the menu is considerately priced to help you meet that minimum quite easily. $14 for my girlfriend's fruity cocktail thingie is at least something that has happened before, but $12 for a small plate of hummus and most especially $7 for a Bud Goddamn Light is prefuckingposterous. I'm aware that this pricing stems from Joe's being a nonprofit organization, and y'know, yay for supporting the arts. But I'm sorry, knowing there's a good reason for my being gouged doesn't mean that I'm not getting gouged. Put in Yelp terms, the warm and fuzzies don't really affect my star rating, but a $7 Bud Light sure does.Overall: A cool venue, with great acoustics, but you should know what your wallet is in for.P.S. Meek poopers beware; bathrooms here are unisex.",3,4,1
187,David T.,"Memphis, TN",30,111,18,4.0,2/7/2007,"We stumbled in here on a whim and ended up seeing one of the best live musical shows we've ever seen. In Memphis, seeing a show in a ""pub"" generally means listening to a loud rock band bash out tunes in competition with the bar and crowd noise, so we were pleasantly surprised to find the ""listening"" atmosphere that Joe's afforded its acts and guests. And the acts on the night we visited included Elvis Perkins, another mystery to us beforehand (but an intriguing one to us given the Memphis connotations of both ""Elvis"" and ""Perkins""). We absolutely loved his band's set (can't wait till ""Ash Wednesday"" is finally released to the masses this month!). The acoustics were fantastic, and our sight line was great--we sat on one of the large sofas facing the stage, a VERY welcome comfort after a day of walking.This review lists 4 rather than 5 stars only because we did not try the food and drinks (other than a nice gelato) and thus have no reference point.",2,1,2
188,Anna A.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,168,0,1.0,6/26/2007,"Bad, bad, bad (for anything but jazz).This space can perhaps be a good match for a jazz concert, but not much else. Most other performances are completely destroyed by the sit-down arrangement that lacks space to rock out and, therefore, essential dynamics. Two drink per person requirement is moderately ridiculous given that there's already a cover charge, but the most blatant and bizarre dirty trick will occur in the restroom: a sad looking older woman (or a man, depending on the restroom you go to) would not permit you to open your own faucet or get your own soap from the soap dispenser. With a forceful intervention they would bestow these unnecessary services upon you and afterwords nod in the direction of a tip jar. Beware! If you do not tip, they will curse you as you are exiting the bathroom.To sum up, I've been there once and hopefully never again.",2,1,2
189,Jean G.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,22,0,3.0,5/7/2012,"The place was under renovation when we went (not inside Joe's Pub itself but the lobby and other areas) so it was probably not representative of the usual atmosphere. Joe's Pub is a great place to listen to music. The food is ok, but very overpriced, and the service is a bit scattered and slow.",,,
190,Philly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,139,44,3.0,7/4/2008,"I'm so torn over what to write about Joe's Pub. I saw one of my very favourite vocalists play here and it was an absolutely kick ass show, certainly in part due to the venue.Let's start with the good: They book great acts. There are very few bad seats in the place. It's an incredibly intimate sitting in which to see a performer, even more so if that performer happens to be one of your favourites. All of these are big pluses, but the minuses pack a pretty hard punch.For starters, if you don't make a dinner reservation, you're stuck in the back by the bar. One glance in the direction of the bar and you'll notice that it is far from spacious. We made dinner reservations out of sheer excitement for the show, which leads me to my next issue: the food is ridiculously, deliriously expensive. As are the drinks. And there is a food/drink minimum in addition to the cost of admission -- which isn't even for the whole night, but rather for a particular act. Our show started early and we were out of there before 9, but not before paying a small fortune for our food (which was decent, if overpriced) and drinks.In Heath R.'s review, he writes that the problem is that ""Joe's Pub isn't a music venue. It's a dinner theater that, instead of hosting theater events, hosts music performances. So it acts like a dinner theater: Prices are high, drinks are costly, the seats are an unnecessary inconvenience, and they hope you order a meal to claim your table seating."" As he concluded, that makes sense -- if you're going to the theatre. If you're heading out to see your favourite band, though, it's a bit of a nightmare, and certainly not a place those on a budget can frequent.4 stars for the venue, but 3 stars (I'm being generous) when the expense and various lofty expectations of patrons are factored into the mix.",3,,
191,Kelli T.,"Cambridge, MA",0,8,16,5.0,1/14/2014,"I loved this place. I went here for a singer-songwriter show this past summer and I loved how small and intimate it was.

192,Valentina V.,"Seattle, WA",223,256,28,4.0,12/19/2007,"I'm going to be completely subjective with this review...I LOVED the place, first, because I had one of the most romantic dates I've ever had in my life at this place, and it happened to be while I listened to one of my current fave singers (Peter Moren from Peter Bjorn and John.) Plus, Ryan and I had the FANTASTIC luck of getting the best seat in the house due to someone's generous cancellation. So we ended up having Peter Moren about five feet away! It was a great, intimate, and FUN show! The two highlights of the show? Moren did a cover on the AWESOME ""Take on Me"" by A-HA, and when the show was about to end he called Bjorn, who ""happened"" to be in the crowd. Cool. Really cool.The atmosphere is amazing, and for an acoustic performance, the sound was fine. Yes, drinks are pricey but dude, one can expect that in NYC...and if you do a couple of scotchs on the rocks, is not that bad...but yeah, if you are willing to get yippee-yippee with the spiritual waters, this is definitely not the place to do so.But if you have the chance to watch an acoustic show by one of your favorite singers, don't miss this spot. You won't regret it!",2,,2

Good service, pretty good food and with Ute Lemper where else would I be more happy to be?!May be other reviewers had probs there because they went on spec rather than booking ahead as we did.

The venue is posh, in every way (including the prices!) so come prepared (and early if you want a good table.). 10 Red Stripes were $124, and the food bill for 4 people was close to the same. Be careful here and in my experience, watch your credit card statement. Also, Don't see an 11 piece band like Beirut here, the stage is too small for it.",2,,1

Updated review","Time to update my review for Joe's Pub since it has new catering.The Pub is still the best place, hands down, for music. Not a better venue in NYC. So intimate, great acoustics.The Website allows you to pick your own seat, but you don't know/can't see the table numbers, which is terrible management. The food, however, has gone straight downhill while the prices have gone straight uphill. This is no longer the nice night out it was because you get soaked by the high prices for the below-average fare.The Public has contracted the catering out, and now we're stuck with some high-brow chef that doesn't get the venue & charges way too much for what he delivers.(My advice is to stick to drinks and a couple of items..)The number of share plates is way down,.$6 for a small bowl of mainated olives with fennel - seriously? Whomever thought that up should be arrested for usury. Same with the genius who is giving us the $9 pickle plate. Those come free in most places. Granted, this isn't a diner, but $9 for pickles. Those must be some 15-star pickles.The $5 pizza popcorn is the soggiest, worst item you could pay for. Ever. They should leave it on the tables for free, because people would order more drinks to get the awful taste out of their mouths. It is a good idea that is poorly executed.Gone is the amazing, wonderful humus plate to share. Why? Why Joe's Pub, why?If you want to share, get the french fries. They're great.If you want to share, we loved the chicken-fried chicken wings with buttermilk dressing (although it is idiotic to call them chicken-fried chicken...some bizarre homage to chicken-fried steak?). They were a bit greasy, but they were good.The crispy calamari with chipotle is promising. The sauce is great, but there isn't enough of it. The crispy left something to be desired, but I hope that was just that one time (had it another and it was a tad better).The rigatoni is tasteless, unfortunately.The burger is good, but be sure to tell them how you want it cooked. My friend wanted medium, and it came medium rare, which freaked her out a bit.Be warned, the servers are unprofessional, to say the least.The specialty cocktails are good, but expensive.I was there for a major benefit, and I was subject to traffic worse than the Holland Tunnel on a Friday night in the summer going back & forth in front of me. They don't respect the acts there. To avoid that, you are better off sitting down on the 1st floor or at the rail on the 2nd level.Also, many will put the gratuity on your check for a big party, but they won't tell you that. When you overtip them, they aren't gracious. They don't & can't do buybacks.  The servers need to be taken out back and whipped into shape by someone who knows how to handle a crowded venue. Maybe a performer will do it because they're shown so little respect by the waitstaff.",2,1,
196,Hannah A.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,77,0,4.0,6/4/2007,"This is a beautiful venue with outstanding sound that I would never, ever go to if I didn't get on the guest list. It's tiny, swanky as hell, with great seating (if you can get it) with killer acoustics. That said, I recommend drinking before you getting here, because a) the drinks are outrageously priced (hello, lounge pricing!) and b) the best way to get a seat is to get pushy and squeeze yourself in between a couple of pre-reserved tables in the booths in middle and you may need a little boost of courage to do this.Negatives aside, I have seen some incredible shows here. We're talking ""moves me to the point of crying"" type shows. (Lavender Diamond, how I love thee!)So, uh, ask me if I have a plus one some day? Or get your own damn perks.",1,1,1
197,Thom B.,"Washington, DC",62,86,5,4.0,7/7/2006,"We went to see diamanda galas the other night.  The intimacy of Joe's is terrific!  It's a bit crowded but that's to be expected at such a venue.  We did not eat, but we ordered drinks.  DO NOT DRINK there!  Good lord, at $10 a cocktail (well liquor mind you) you'll be broke long before you'll be passed out.  I had a Cape Cod (I know sorta gay), and while I like cranberry juice as much as the next guy, I like my vodka more.  My ""Cape Cod"" (still kinda gay) was just cranberry juice in a tiny glass.  I wish I had kids, they could have used the juice more than I.Great for listening to music though, and the staff is VERY pleasant!",1,1,
198,Maritess Z.,"Seattle, WA",599,281,9,4.0,3/13/2007,"I love Joe's Pub, I've performed here many times in different situations. If you're in the in crowd in NYC, you'll get invited to midnight parties thrown by socialites, and the crowd is rich, young, and artistic. My kind of scene, where the setting is perfect. Joe's Pub lives for artistic perfection, so the music is always right, the lights and the vibe are so important. It's really a New York experience.I've also performed for public events here, which is more like theater, and yes, the drinks and tickets are expensive, but it is so worth it, to do it even once if you can. I've seen live music by friends here before, and I have to agree with the other reviewers that the sound is perfect, the scene is amazing and you can easily see celebrities in there all the time. It's just a vibe that every performing artist should experience, this is what a venue looks like when it totally supports its artists and you can see cutting edge artists here presented in their best light, as opposed to some grungy bar, and you can also see famous artists perform too, like Tom Waits, which I haven't seen, but I hear nothing but great things about seeing famous bands there.I have to say that I have eaten there, and I was so drunk I don't remember what the hell it tasted like, but my friend who goes there all the time thinks it is the WORST food for really expensive prices. Go figure. Go for the vibe man, and eat dinner beforehand.",1,,1
