0,Lucien A.,"Brooklyn, NY",190,67,95,5.0,11/11/2018,"Cool Hand Lu says: Great atmosphere, friendly bartenders, and a great drink selection makes for an awesome experience.Employees Only was one of my favorite after-work spots when I worked in the area.  I was in the area for something else and when I realized where I was, I decided to drop by to see if it was still there and was happy to see it.  The dark curtains and the glowing red neon Psychic sign in the window was a welcoming familiar sight.  Upon parting the curtains and crossing the threshold you enter a space completely unexpected from the outside.The dark and almost smoky '20s era theme it has was as welcoming as the first time I visited.  The bar was pretty busy but not chaotic which is always a great sign of its popularity but also its organization.My first drink was the Ginger Smash followed by the Almost There.  Both drinks were delicious, with my favorite being the Ginger Smash.  My favorite drinks are tangy with a bit of a bite and Ginger always does the trick.  I'm horrible with names I don't use regularly but cheers to the bartender that worked on my drinks.  I always hate and feel bad when a drink doesn't turn out the way I anticipated.  Lucky for me that wasn't necessary this night.The prices are on the higher side, so be prepared for that.   Also be prepared to ultimately feel as though it was worth it as the ambiance is a nice little escape from the world outside.All in all, I had a great couple of drinks and an enjoyable revisit to an old haunt.  After looking at the menu I will definitely be getting a bite to eat as well.",1,,2
1,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,422,1424,4.0,11/8/2018,"For a random Tuesday night, this speakeasy was packed! There isn't much seating room if you want a drink near the bar, but my group of 7 lucked out when a larger table happened to be paying their check just as we walked in. Although it was bit of a tight squeeze, we all managed to sit at a table together.Cocktails were fantastic with unique concoctions and fun flavor combinations. All are on the pricey side, but comparable to most Manhattan prices.One of the hostesses (sadly I didn't catch her name) was so sweet and welcoming, and upon hearing that it was our friend's birthday, she even brought out a small cake for her. We were so surprised! Some yelp reviewers mentioned that the staff members were pretentious, but we never got that feeling while we were here.I'll definitely be back again for drinks, but next time I'll also have to try out their food.",2,1,2
2,Teresa T.,"Philadelphia, PA",162,305,218,3.0,10/15/2018,"My sisters and I came here for post dinner drinks and luckily were seated right away. As the night grew on, the bar got progressively more and more crowded so a table was much appreciated.We were left ambivalent about the drinks at Employees Only. They were pricey (but standard for Manhattan) but not terribly impressive or special. I don't think I'd come back unless for dinner, which looked promising, or if I was in the area.",,,1
3,Jen L.,"Cypress, CA",386,320,607,4.0,10/30/2018,"Employees Only was the last stop on our night bar-hopping in the city, and I'm glad I got to visit. We got the steak & frites, which was so good. The cocktails were delicious and the ambiance was lively and fun. My only gripe is that it was so loud it was difficult to carry on a conversation. Service was prompt and friendly. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in town to try the bone marrow poppers.",2,2,3
4,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,4.0,9/8/2018,"Friendly service and cool vibe. Of the speakeasies I've visited recently, EO did not let me down and is in my top five. For drink, I had the Fraise Sauvage - Fords Gin shaken with wild strawberries & Tahitian vanilla, finished with EO prosecco. I also ordered the bone marrow poppers because I had read about them in other reviews. I have to say I wasn't impressed by the poppers so don't feel like you have to order them. It's a tiny space so best to come at off peak times to avoid lines to get in or crowds. I came early and got to enjoy the space without too many others in there.",4,3,9
5,Rebecca K.,"Cincinnati, OH",72,68,105,5.0,11/2/2018,"I was so enamored with this bar. It only took a couple seconds after we walked in that a bartender handed us menus, even though there was barely spots open at the bar. While we were looking over the menu, I took off my coat and another two seconds after that I was approached by an employee asking if I wanted to check my coat. We found a couple open stools and ordered a round of drinks. I ordered the Autumn in New York which was EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be. The music was 50s rock n roll and soul which is just the icing on the cake that is the rest of the decor. I loved this bar and if I could have afforded it I probably would have spent every night of my trip to New York here!",,,
6,Celia N.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,145,495,5.0,9/23/2018,"I got two cocktails here, The provencál - Lavender-infused Plymouth Gin Stirred with Herbs de Provence-infused French Vermouth & Cointreau The Amelia -Aylesbury Duck Vodka & St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur Shaken with Puréed Blackberries & Fresh Lemon Juice.They were good enough that I could totally justify their price.  The bartenders were super friendly and nice, and professionally dressed. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the cocktails sophisticated and well done. No downsides, this is a great place to spend a few hours with friends or a date.",,,1
7,Darren B.,"Austin, TX",356,947,2625,3.0,10/9/2018,"After nearly a decade of loving well made craft cocktails and understanding that Employees Only was one of the first cocktail bars to revitalize the craft cocktail scene in America, I finally made it in.My initial thoughts upon entering were that it definitely did not feel like the crowd consisted of fellow lovers of well made drinks, but rather lovers of the apparent prestige of being at ""one of the best bars on Earth"" according to the Spirited Awards (like the Oscars, but for bars). After being escorted past the frenzied bar to the more tranquil back seating area by the host, we dove into the menu which was very intriguing. I always respect a cocktail bar where I want to try every drink on their menu. With some really unique combinations of ingredients, our decision was not easy. With our server's help we made a selection. Both our drinks arrived after not too long and unfortunately, the taste of both was pretty one note, definitely not worth the $17 per price tag. I'm happy to pay more for quality and depth of flavor, but this was not that. These tasted more like what you would expect from a $7 cocktail.The drinks and crowd made this more of a 2 star experience, but the best part of the evening was the service. It was a solid 4 stars and stood out, so for that I'm rounding this up to 3 stars.While sitting here, shortly after leaving and since my visit, I couldn't help but feel like I missed the boat. That there was a time when having a cocktail at Employees Only was probably a truly magical experience. It's like the town that gets ruined by it's own popularity becoming consumed by tourists losing what made it special to begin with. Tis a shame.",4,2,2
8,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",202,215,342,5.0,8/4/2018,"Can I just say that this cocktail lounge prolly has the best best service ever!!! It has won my heart. The bartenders are so attentive. They listen to you super patiently to help you place an order and choose your drink. They are very knowledgeable to confidently advice you and also, would make sure that you are being addressed even if the bar is crowded. Wouldn't really recommend it in weekends as it's a super popular cocktail lounge. This place made me realize how important customer experience can be. It leaves an indelible mark. I haven't yet talked about the quality of the cocktails in my review. The cocktails are as good as they can be and as legit. You pay $17 for a cocktail and You feel the cocktail going down your throat. They also have a tarot card reader right at the entrance. Apparently she's good. So get drunk and get your cards read.",2,,2
9,Graham K.,"Arlington, TX",120,235,191,3.0,7/23/2018,"Last stop on an NYC crawl with my girlfriend. The bartender at our hotel suggested it to us. Usually, it would be a speakeasy style bar, the front is a fortune teller. However, the bouncer outside and the raucous noise inside is a bit of a giveaway. Low lighting, almost candlelit everywhere. On Friday, the place was packed. The bartenders were busy but worked fast and were somehow able to hear my order over the din. The cocktail menu is extensive. Interesting combinations of flavors using uncommon ingredients like beets, shrubs, and bitters. Both cocktails we ordered were quite good, but they will run you about $15.Its a cool place, but a little pretentious. Solid cocktails, but not something that is incredibly unique (especially in NYC)",2,,1
10,Meghna S.,"Manhattan, NY",29,54,76,1.0,7/8/2018,"Racist, racist and racist... Shocking to see a racist bar in NyC.. such places spoil this melting pot of a city... My friends were in town and it was one of their birthdays.. we wanted to grab a drink at employees only. After making us wait in line for 30 mins they refused to let us in making excuses that the bar is full.Since we were a group of 5, they first started with an excuse that they can accommodate just 2. When we agreed to that hoping the birthday boy and his wife could atleast have fun.. they later refused that too saying the bar is over crowded. Wait but they just let a white couple dressed in jeans n sneakers in.. if this is not racism then what is.Hate to know such people still exist in this awesome City. Five thumbs down",14,1,
11,Conor S.,"Seattle, WA",66,221,210,5.0,9/29/2018,What a fun place to get cocktails. Yes you may have to wait in line but it's worth it. This place is great. fun inventive cocktails and a staff that is attentive and gracious. I got the beets by ale cocktails and it was very good. Sweeter than some might assume but delicious nonetheless.,,,1
12,Michael C.,"New York, NY",262,171,129,5.0,6/8/2018,"Really love the vibe of this place. Halfway between a speakeasy and a classy bar. Lighting is perfect, scene is upbeat yet intimate. And cocktails are on point. I came here with a few friends and we each ordered a few cocktails. I highly recommend the Amelia! Service was great. Servers and bartenders happily recommended particularly drinks to match our tastes. Very nice place in West Village",,,
13,Zachary A.,"Austin, TX",98,1002,0,5.0,10/15/2018,"Cocktails are the best here. Space is limited and the inside has a speakeasy and invitation only type of atmosphere. Cocktails come strong and take a while as they're prepared as ordered. $16 is a fine deal considering the hype and quality of the drinks. Really worth a go if you're in the area for a post dinner experience. Best Manhattan I've ever had from the menu, but I imagine they know how to make anything you throw at them. Come here - you won't be disappointed.",1,,

15,Camille G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",131,333,734,5.0,4/11/2018,"Before going in Tour guide Brett explained some history about this location as with the others. This one peaked our interest. Once inside we took our seats at the bar. Well a few of us stood up. I could never imagine this place completely empty even on a Sunday. Their was a few mixologist making cocktails and having a conversation. I always loved when they engage with their clients, just makes it worth while.  Took a tour of the back room with skylight. Plenty of seating. Beautiful bar fully stocked. Soft lighting and music makes it magical. We placed our cocktail orders and decided on bone marrow poppers. My cocktail wasn't on the menu recommendations from Brett. Dust something I can't remember but it was great. The bone marrow poppers with puff pastry was Delightful! Perfect executed!  I would like to thank the friendly staff. We had an amazing time!!",1,,2
16,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,5.0,8/4/2018,"Quite honestly my favorite speakeasy in NYC.  Great company, ambiance, food, and drinks combined.  This is a West Village staple and a true hallmark.  The curved bar is located behind the fortune teller's table  hidden by curtains.  Some food favs:1. Bacon-wrapped lamb chops: Smokey bacon wrapped around juicy and flavorful lamb chops.  Nuff said.2. Roasted half chicken: Juicy and flavorful with a crispy skin.  This has been one of my favs since 2011 when I first came here.  3. Duck confit: Very tender and flavorful duck over a nice sunchoke puree and garnished with peach and haricot vert.  It's juicy and the blend of rich and fresh flavors is a perfect balance.4. Chocolate tart: Decadent and rich.  Hint of browned butter flavoring that meshes well with the chocolate.  Ask for a scoop of ice cream (they sometimes have) on the side.5. Potatoes gratin: A comfort food for me here.  Creamy and flavorful.If you are in West Village, this is a must-try.  Seriously.  You can take my word or actually the words of anyone else who is a local.",1,,
17,Charles W.,"Daphne, AL",60,107,171,3.0,8/1/2018,Very hip bar and restaurant. The food was good but portions were very small. If you don't order the steak you will want to add several sides the other entrees. The sound level was overwhelming. Too many good choices in NYC to rate this much higher.,1,,
18,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,2/11/2018,"Walked in on a Monday night before 9pm and was seated immediately at the bar. Almost there drink - scotch, lime juice and apricot liqueur, fresh mint and splash of soda. Very refreshing and slightly sweet. Real fireplace to keep the place warm and cozy. I love that they have a psychic reader at the front to completely hide the speakeasy. Only reason we found it was because the bouncer waved us over after we looked lost. Totally chill and rustic vibe here.",3,1,3

They have good music playing and its a fun atmosphere. I tried a little bit of everything. I definitely recommend the bone marrow poppers, the cheese board and the gnocchi. For cocktails definitely recommend the lazy and the waterloo.",,,
20,Michael W.,"New York, NY",0,8,2,1.0,11/1/2018,"HOMOPHOBIC, FEMMEPHOBIC AND RACIST. I just came back from this ""place of business."" If you want an experience that is keeping with the times, come to this bar. There was a dark-skinned black guy and a white guy at the door. Immediately, upon seeing me, they said: ""we're full for the night."" I knew that they were lying, as most poorly dressed and poorly mannered bigots that work the doors in ""progressive"" downtown night clubs will act. ""I said, yea... right,"" and walked away. Not even two minutes later, after waiting to see whom they would let in after rejecting me. They let in several white, masculine-passing men (I am a black queer person who has been here before). I then waited for my car and saw that they let in several other white women and men. They looked down and the white door man laughed and pointed at me. Truly, such a horrible staff outside. Homophobic, femmephobic and racist -- right in the heart of West Village. Queer-femme people and black people do not matter to these people. The men at the door have underlying issues with their sexuality and their race. Internalized homophobia and racism plagues most who have sadistic pleasure in rejecting and accepting people outside of clubs as a profession. These men reject their true selves: race and sexuality. This place has definitely hired the right monsters for their lair. Only in time will this place meet its end because of its horrific front door people. One day you will reject the wrong person and it will be over. Until then, enjoy having horribly insecure men at your door make decisions, discriminate and lie. The black guy at the door: suffers from homophobia and internalized racism.  The white guy, with the Steven Seagal pony tail/hair style is reminiscent of the white, homophobic, racist (his black buddy doesn't know that... yet), femmephobic demographic that I used to see in rural Maine in the town before headed back to their motor neighborhoods. Truly classy people. Truly memorable experience with all of the laughs from the men at the door and truly gratifying when letting other people in. Good luck to you all. You are who you hire to keep at the door.",1,,
21,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1479,4342,4.0,3/8/2018,"Was looking for nice cocktails and dessert and had been wanting to come here forever. Somehow got a table as a walk in, and proceeded to have The Amelia, which was delicious, and an absolutely incredible chocolate hazelnut torte. One complaint, and it's what's keeping mefrom giving this place five stars: the coat check woman. She asked both my boyfriend and I at separate times if we needed change for a larger bill, then hovered expectantly before even getting our coats. I find this incredibly rude because it felt like she not only expected a tip, but was demanding one. She didn't give us the chance to offer first, and honestly, I was not inclined to tip at all after this attitude-filled encounter. Like I said, she said the same to my boyfriend as he was going to the bathroom, and again to me as I actually retrieved the coats. It left a sour taste in our mouths after an otherwise flawless experience.",,,1
22,Suki W.,"New York, NY",128,167,1166,5.0,1/1/2018,"Okay, so like. I've been wanting to come here since like forever thanks to my boyfriend talking about the one in Hong Kong. I've had it bookmarked for so long. I finally went last week and the first thing that caught my eye was the fireplace. I personally have a huge admiration for fireplaces.. and now that it is winter time? SUPER AWESOME. I felt amazing standing in front of the fireplace since I came from the cold winter air outside.What I also appreciate is the fact that they have coatcheck! PEOPLE-Please be kind and tip the person who checks your coat. Poor gal--I came with 4 friends and we all had big jackets and had bags. I watched her hold our big coats to go hang them and give us a ticket. Please be kind and tip her!Moving on--when I went, it was around 8 pm on a Thursday and it was PACKED at the bar and at their little dining section in the back. I also love their menu--it's filled with different cocktails that all sound very yummy. Our bartenders--Roger and Brian are also super cool. They were friendly and so talented in crafting these cocktails.I had the Quiet Storm and Almost There--Out of the two, I love the way Almost There looks just because of how colorful it is (super cool for the gram). And if you're someone who likes Moscow Mule (like me hehe), I would recommend you to try the Quiet Storm! It still has ginger beer in it and it's kind of like a slight twist from Moscow Mule. Overall.. I liked both of my drinks so I highly recommend those two. I also tried my friend's Old Fashioned and my gosh, they make a really good Old Fashioned there.If you're around the area, you should DEFINITELY visit Employee's Only and I hope you have Roger or Brian as your bartender though I'm sure all of them are friendly and talented :)Will be back and post more photos soon.",2,,4

I have been a regular at employees now for about 2 years and I just can't get enough. Everytime I step in the door weather it's with friends or by my lonesome the staff make me feel like a queen. The food is phenomenal and it is the only place in the city that I will order a Hemingway Daccari   because they ALWAYS get it right. Keith, Alejandro, Kimmy, Evan, Eric, Cecily, Julie, Reese and few others that I am forgetting to mention feel like my second fam. Hands down the best cocktail bar in all of NYC and maybe even beyond.",1,,1
24,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,5.0,1/8/2018,"TLDR: cool speakeasy that's lively every night of the week; delicious cocktails and steak tartarHave been here four or five times and definitely consider this place to be one of my favorite speakeasies in WV. During this particular visit, I came with my sister around 2am on a Tuesday. Despite how late it was, the bar area was incredibly lively and crowded while the tables in the back were less-so. We opted for a table and were seated right away.While I didn't order the steak tartar during this visit, I do feel the need to give it a shoutout. At Employees Only, they mix in the spices right in front of you, seasoning it to your liking. The steak tartar here has been more aromatic and flavorful than any other place I've had it.Their drinks are equally delicious and there's a wide variety to choose from. We decided on the fraise sauvage (gin, wild strawberries, vanilla, and prosecco) and amelía (vodka, elderflower liqueur, puréed blackberries, and lemon juice). The fraise sauvage was fruit-forward and sweet while the amelía was a bit punchier and acidic.Noise levels were moderate, so the ambiance is good for catching up with a friend or getting drinks on a date. Would recommend this place to anyone interested in the WV speakeasy scene!",2,,
25,Caitlyn C.,"New York, NY",298,197,318,3.0,2/16/2018,"Employees only is a great spot if you're looking for a trendy NYC lounge and restaurant. I found the scene inside to be a little ""too cool for school."" But, if that's the environment you like then you would probably really enjoy this place. The man at the front door was very friendly as was our waitress, but bartenders, cocktail servers and coat check all provided the vibe that they didn't really have time for me or anyone in my party.I came here with a large party of 9 people. Between the group of us, we ordered almost everything on the menu. I was happy to be able to try so many different foods. This menu is definitely geared toward the adventurous eater. Our appetizers included everything from oysters to bone marrow to a good old charcuterie and cheese board. I thought everything tasted delicious, even the foods I don't normally eat (bone marrow!). For an entree I ordered the squid ink, octopus risotto. I am such a sucker for risotto and octopus is one of my new favorite dishes so I did really enjoy this! The squid ink flavor is quite strong, stronger than I was expecting. But again, this was a fun and adventurous meal. I wouldn't want to eat here on the regular but I enjoyed it for a fun, ladies night out. The cocktails were INCREDIBLE, as I would expect from a speakeasy. I was a big fan of the ""besos"" tequila drink. Our table ordered tons of different cocktails and we were so pleased with all of them. Some other favorites were the strawberry prosecco cocktail and the one that had a dark elderberry syrup in it. Our waitress was so lovely. Very attentive but not overly obnoxious, kind and quick to serve us more rounds of drinks :)",,,

The dessert was fine (although the crust of the chocolate tart was so hard we could barely bite it). The service was a bit bisque, but again basically fine. The problem is, fine doesn't cut it when you spend $115 on two cocktails, one veggie pasta, and one dessert.",,,

Our bride to be had this place top of her list and deservedly so! We had some late night bites here and everything was so delicious! We enjoyed a grilled cheese and fries as well as the pastrami croquettes. The croquettes were DIVINE. While we dined, we had some great craft cocktails as well. Once we were done eating, we stayed in the bar area and sang our little hearts out. My only complaints here are that the bar is INSANELY crowded and the music was SUPER depressing at the end of the night. I have never felt so claustrophobic before. I seriously doubt they're in fire code with how many people are crammed in here. While this place is open late, they do a lot to get you to leave before the closing time- namely play THE most depressing music right before closing. That's ultimately why we called it quits. All in all, this place is a great spot and it's obvious why it's so crowded. I'm totally being a grandma with my complaints, but it's a fun spot!",1,1,
30,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,144,0,3.0,6/8/2018,"I've been wanting to come to this speakeasy for ages, and I finally made it in with a friend a few Saturdays ago. The place is tucked away behind a ""psychic"" shop, though it's still very easy to find compared to some other speakeasies in the city. We walked over at around 11:30pm to see how long the wait would be. To our surprise, they told us it would only be about 10 mins. Once we got inside, we were told to stand near the bar by the door. We grabbed a menu and ordered our drinks. They have a very extensive list, so you'll easily be able to find something you like. I had the Coffee Talk, which contains Gin and Vermouth. The ambience inside is split between the bar and the dinner section in the back. The bar area is definitely more lively and can be very crowded. For me, the experience was unexpected. In all honesty, my friend and I expected a place touted as one of the best bars in the world to be a bit more relaxed. The experience felt very similar to being hounded by drunk guys at a dive bar. Perhaps it was just the fact that it was a crowded Saturday night, but It wasn't a comfortable place to enjoy a quiet cocktail. Service is OK too. The bartenders are busy running around, so there isn't a lot of chatting or interaction. Overall, I was disappointed. I was expected better in terms of drinks (esp. for $16) and of the ambience. I'm very glad I came in, but I don't think this place is my scene.",,,

Came here at 7:30 on a Saturday night. I've seen Employees Only on speakeasy lists but it's definitely not a speak easy. It's extremely loud and crowded. The layout is a narrow bar followed by a dining area. There's seating at the bar and tables near the bar but all tables are ""reserved"" (aka you need to ask the host/manager to sit there). I ordered the Amelia first which was good, followed by the Caliente Besos. My friend and I both got tequila drinks (she ordered the Ginger Smash) and we couldn't tell which was which one until we looked at the menu again.. not a good sign. If I'm ordering $17 cocktails, I want them to taste unique and well balanced. A spicy drink should always taste more spicy than sweet.",1,,
33,Amrita G.,"Manhattan, NY",106,11,0,1.0,10/8/2018,"Highly over-rated.  Dinner here makes for an overpriced and unbelievable cramped meal.  The tables are absurdly small and the whole experience is absurdly uncomfortable.  The cocktails are good, yes, but there are dozens of bars with as good or better cocktails at this point",1,1,

Carefully handcrafted cocktails with in a speakeasy located in the heart of the village is what you'll find as you make your way in. We each had two drinks and the menu could've taken me all day to settle on but thanks to my wonderful server, she made recommendations for each of us based on the spirit we preferred along with our preferred flavor profiles. The drink with the wild strawberries was my favorite and while the prices are high it was worth every sip. This is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Manhattan and every time I visit I always find something new that popped up. Only two stops away from Jersey, it's located in a Trudy area that accesible to the NJ/NYC neighborhoods with a flair of taste. Once you walk in, you'll understand how cool this spot is. I only wish they opened a bit earlier but some things are worth the wait.",2,1,3

We arrived at 9:30 pm and there was already a line. Normally, I take that to be a good sign. It's early in the night and there's a line out the door. This place must be good. The wait was about half an hour before we got in. The decor is nice and I love the ambiance, but it was WAY overcrowded. This is what ruined my experience overall. Someone is always bumping into you, I was worried about spilling my drink the whole time. It's also impossible to get drinks at the bar and I thought their cocktails were overrated. I got the Provencal and my husband got the Billionaire Cocktail. Mine was a lavender infused cocktail. I normally like lavender, but it's usually more subtle. It was very prominent in the drink and it muddled the other flavors. I ended up giving it to my friend to chug because I couldn't have more than 5 sips. My husband didn't like his cocktail either.Overall, I had high hopes, but my idea of a fun night doesn't consist of constantly bumping into people because there's no space in the bar.",4,1,

37,Chantelle A.,"Alexandria, VA",278,400,28,4.0,6/21/2018,"I enjoyed my time at Employees Only. When the bar first opened, we had to wait outside because we didn't make reservations. After abt 20 min, we were ushered into the bar area and enjoyed a couple of drinks. The cocktails are pricey but, the cocktail menu offered something for everyone and the cocktails were well executed. The customer service was lacking. I felt the bartenders didnt really connect with the patrons. They were more like order takers.",3,,1
38,Katrina O.,"Staten Island, NY",124,75,0,4.0,7/26/2018,"Came here for a work dinner and was pleasantly surprised! I didn't find it that difficult to find, but that may have been because the security guard waved us over. A cozy little spot, but cramped for our larger group. The service was excellent and we were never went wanting. If you're into craft cocktails, this is a spot for you! For appetizers we ordered the gnocchi and bone marrow. I only had the gnocchi but it was delicious! For the main course I had the cavatelli with spicy sausage and it was honestly the best pasta I have ever had! Dessert was the cheesecake and it really didn't taste like it? It tasted more like a mousse, but still delicious! I look forward to bringing my boyfriend back here as it is definitely meant for smaller parties, I would say no larger than 4.",,,

I'm in town for 3 days from SF and it was on my to do list.Unfortunately just tried to enter with my boyfriend who was wearing open toe Birkenstock sandals. The door man said he wasn't allowed to enter because of open toed sandals. What seemed fair to begin with, he went on saying they don't want you to get cut, etc. Seems understandable.But then we watched a girl literally 10 seconds after us enter with open toed sandals. I said, ""hey, but it doesn't matter if she goes in?"" And he said ""yeah, it doesn't matter for the ladies.Heartbreaking. And unfair. ;(This was a Monday night around 10:40pm.",3,,

The cocktails and champagne were crisp and the service inside was lovely. I hope this place is ready to see me when I visit NYC, which is often!

42,Eduardo W.,"Jersey City, NJ",178,15,8,4.0,10/17/2018,"First and foremost, drinks here are probably some of the best in NYC. The Mixologists  know what they're doing, presentation may not be the best, but its straight forward, proper drinks right on your lips.  Employees Only just has that NYC vibe you just cant duplicate, well dressed bartenders, loud, buzzing laughter, great apps and of course well made drinks. Only drawback is the long wait time on the weekends and crammed drinking space when it does get busy. Aside from that, you want a real Drink, you come here",,,

The outside is very unassuming, but step inside and you're instantly overtaken with the old-fashioned swanky vibes. Dim lighting and choice decor with a bar at the front and a dining area in the back. The food is delactable and the craft cocktails are devine. I'm in love with this place.",1,2,1
44,Darby W.,"Savannah, GA",36,121,70,5.0,1/21/2018,"Next time we stay and have dinner here. It will be amazing I am sure.  Based upon the cocktails alone I think one could be fairly certain to be served a delicious and adventurous meal.  I must say that for NYC this establishment was accepting and unpretentious despite its super hip and trendy vibe.  I felt welcomed in my dungarees.  I would go back a little bit more finely dressed just because I would want to fit in a little bit better, but yet I was relieved to be treated well in what I was wearing.  The cocktails (and if you follow me, you know this is my jam) were wonderful.  We had such fun trying what sounded amazing and then was delivered in amazing style.  And then the final test: taste, flavor, bouquet...try anything, everything.   Close your eyes and point at the menu and say ""yes""...no disappointments here.  Thankfully it is Employees Only.",1,,
45,Jesse N.,"Manhattan, NY",401,84,23,5.0,2/24/2018,"LOVED Employees Only; the drinks, food, and environment were all A+ in my book. It was a pretty busy night but somehow my friend and I managed to get a table and our server was super nice and quick with our orders. I had a Penicillin and the drink was super flavorful and had a good kick of ginger. We also decided to eat the Parmesan fries with garlic aioli and they were addicting (there's nothing better than a crispy French fry). The bill was a bit expensive, but that's probably assumed when going here. Highly recommend for a fun night out, overall great experience. PS- the music the night I went was AMAZING, so many throwbacks from the Backstreet Boys to Ginuwine. I think we stayed longer because the music was so good.",,,

I absolutely love finding a spot where other guests are enjoying the night just as much as you are and are super friendly. Being that the regulars have a good time, definitely reflects on the bar. Managed to snag a spot when we walked in at the bar, super difficult post dinner. Bartenders were very attentive although it was so busy, plus plus plus on that end!Environment is luxurious, romantic, you name it!

48,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,4.0,6/6/2017,"I came in on a Thursday night around happy hour- foolish choice haha! The bar was crowded, but not overwhelming due the amazing and charismatic bouncer out front named Robert. He had me smiling from the moment I walked up to the door. I ended up deciding to get a table since the person joining me is on the tall and broad side. It's best to book a reservation, but we were just popping in for a quick bite before heading to the Lucille Lortel Theater around the corner so they were able to accommodate us for a bit. The bar is dim and cozy, while the small dining area is opened up by their sky light ceiling. It has a greenhouse quality to it. We ordered the Bone Marrow Poppers and the Lamb Chops with Salsa Verde. Bone marrow is of course always delicious, and the lamb chops were very well prepared. For my cocktail I ordered the Ready Fire Aim: Mezcal, lime, honey-pineapple syrup, and hellfire bitters. It was an absolutely excellent cocktail, spicy yet balanced and a little sweet in all the right places.",2,,2

Seating was limited but required if you would like to order food. The host was able to seat us without reservations at a table by the bar but while we waited ordered some very unique drinks. Once seated, we ordered the bone marrow poppers (my boyfriend loved!) and the bacon-wrapped lamb chops. The lamb was so FIRE, we ordered seconds. Everything is overpriced, especially given the serving size but that's NYC for you. Very cute spot for dates or linking up with friends. And they play the best R&B oldies. Will be back!",,,
51,Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",196,350,46,4.0,12/26/2017,"I came here for a work dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the place. The outside is very unassuming with barely any signs, so it almost reminded me of a speakeasy. I started my drinks with a ginger smash and while I thought it was good, I thought it was a bit overhyped. The Billionaire Cocktail and Quiet Storm tasted much better. For food, we ordered the prix fixe menu (gnocchi, steak tartar, charcuterie for appetizers) but we each had our choice of the main entree. I went with the pork chop and I started to regret my decision once I saw my coworker's gigantic rib eye being served. However, once I tasted my pork chop and compared it to his rib eye then I knew I made the right choice. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, but did not have much flavor to it compared to the pork chop. I barely had room for dessert, but the heart knows what it really wants. I tasted a few items, but the one that stood out was the butterscotch cheesecake (which I completely devoured).",,,1

Group of 4 of us went up the other night and they told us it was ""full."" So I asked, ""if four people come out, then we four can go in, right? We can just wait a few minutes."" And they said no. Then they called two white people behind us and let them in. Kinda speaks for itself. If you and your alabaster friends do get in, it's pretty much the same as any other bar in NY. Overpriced cocktails, the annoying Wall Street sweater vest crowd, everyone yelling over everyone else. Do yourself a favor.",,,
55,Helena K.,"Manhattan, NY",35,101,171,5.0,3/20/2017,"The main reasons for a rating of 5 stars:- A real speakeasy, meaning great cocktails- A real restaurant, meaning especially for a speakeasy the food was DELICIOUS- tiny place but top notch management of crowd so that guests can feel like it is a truly happening place without being crammed inside. there is even a real fire place in the bar area, cute!- There is always a line on weekends so the best idea to enjoy the place is to make a reso for dinner then come a tiny bit early to get the bar area experience as well as the dining area experienceFood: The bone marrow poppers are their ""must try"" and it is absolutely buttery and delicious. it is on a pastry puff - a real indulging plate! Listen to the specials of the day as they are usually all good - last weekend we had the rabbit pate, yummers. The 20 oz rib eye steak is definitely for sharing and is juicy and fatty - could have used a bit less garlic on top. You can easily check out the table next to you since the dining area is really tiny (max about 12 tables?) and the two chickies next to us opted for more humane dishes unlike me and my bf, like the steak tartar (made at the table) and some green salad stuff. Their portions looked insanely small and I would have fought someone if i had to share that but our order including 2 apps, a huge steak and 2 cocktails each and a glass of wine were sufficient.

If you are able to get a seat at the bar, It really is nice to sit back and watch the bartenders work, mixing up drinks. The doorman did a great job of keeping the bar at a comfortable level of crowdedness, did not feel as though I was being pushed and shoved to move around freely.Will definitely be returning, great spot!",2,3,2

We didn't have a reservation, but they sat us at a table until the 8:30 reservation did come in, which was super nice and ended up being more than enough time. We had oysters and bone marrow and the most amazing cheesecake. We also spent some time with the palm reader by the front door, so fun! Definitely a place to go and impress a date!",2,1,2

Table seating lines the front walls and then an entire room in the back. It's a very narrow bar, so I would not suggest coming here with more than 4 people. Be sure to get here early if you want a table or bar seat. Bartenders are all super nice - like, much nicer than any other speakeasy I've ever been to - and can make you something fancy if you let them know what kind of alcohol you like.

However, this should not deter you from going there to try the amazing cocktails.As an FYI, we didn't have a problem, but I've heard that they can be strict about dress code when they're really busy so make sure you're well-dressed.

We came here as a party of three, made reservation on the same day, and was seated quickly when we arrive. The entrance was not hard to find as there is always a long line of people waiting to get in.Cocktails- above average for an NYC speakeasy, very elegantly presented and the flavors are good (I recommend the Billionaire Cocktail, and Mata Hari) The bartenders showed exquisite techniques and had great knowledge about cocktails.  Food- really took me by surprise! I had salad, rib-eye steak, bone marrow poppers, and some pasta. The steak was simply AMAZING! Perfectly grilled and tender. It may as well be served in a fancy steakhouse for twice the price. Overall, a great place for a romantic date. The dim lighting and the loud background chat will bring you and your date closer and closer... The cocktails and great food will just be some icing on the cake =)Tips: + make reservation for dining, the food is reasonably priced and you can order their famous cocktail too+ their steak is amazing, must try!+ the fortune teller at the entrance is a real fortune teller",1,,
69,Frannie Y.,"Baltimore, MD",17,154,66,5.0,3/25/2018,"I had a great experience here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and our anniversary! I saw bone marrow poppers on the menu and just knew that this was where we had to go. I would definitely recommend making a reservation otherwise you might have to wait outside in the cold (or heat depending on the time of year) while spots open up inside. It does look like a psychic shop, but their logo is on the awning and looks like a key but is really EO. We ordered the thunder in paradise and almost there for the cocktails. The thunder in paradise was honesty too sweet for me, but it's definitely a good choice for those who don't love the taste of alcohol! The almost there was pretty minty and very refreshing. We got the bone marrow poppers and ricotta gnocchi to start, my boyfriend ordered the ribeye, and I ordered the cavatelli. The bone marrow poppers were amazing, and I don't even like bone marrow that much! It comes with 3 in an order, but our waitress offered to make it 4 so we could each have two. We didn't end up doing that so not sure how much extra that would've cost, but it was a nice offer! The gnocchi was pretty small - it only had about 6 gnocchi, but it was delicious! I loved the butternut squash sauce. I also heard the table next to us order it as an entree, and they offered to make it a larger order. The ribeye was ENORMOUS and was so yummy. It was cooked perfectly, and the potato gratin it came with was also amazing. I loved my cavatelli. It tasted like it was made in house, and the texture was perfect. There was also a solid amount of spicy pork sausage in it. I honestly haven't had pasta that good in a long time. Lastly, we ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was definitely one of the best, if not the best, cheesecake I've ever had. It was so light, almost like a Creme brûlée, and didn't feel heavy at all, which was great considering we were stuffed from our appetizers and entrees. Note: the chocolate tart has the nuts already inside the dish, so we couldn't order it (I'm allergic), but they can put the brittle on the side for the cheesecake!",,,

This is not really a big deal to most people (including me), but I gave two chances and unless someone else with me recommends it, I probably won't. I do love the concept and the vibe inside.

The total number of times I've been speechless adds up to less than the number of times I've been invited into a room labeled ""employees only.""Employees Only is famous thanks to the documentary ""Hey Bartender,"" but more thanks to the people who rant and rave and then bring people like me there to contribute to the rants and raves.People-watching can be picked up as a sporting event at Employees Only: older men picking up young women, older men placing their hands on the lower backs of young women (myself included) while passing through the crowded bar area, young women fresh off the pages of Cosmo discussing the merits of grey being the new black (never), young financiers and their group of trendy non-financier friends, a nervous new NYC import impressing his less-nervous date sitting at the bar knee-to-knee (a surefire indication of attraction but not a second date guarantee), and two people (a guy trying to impress me and me observing visual and visceral queues and summoning adjectives for a review) leaning against a narrow drink landing on the back wall near the door, observing/judging/commenting on the whole scene with two otherworldly cocktails. The Ready Fire Aim cocktail shot me straight in the heart with its recipe of divine intervention: Del Maguey Vida Mezcal, fresh lime juice, house-made honey-pineapple syrup, and dashes of Bittermens Hellfire Bitters. Speechless? More like breathless. If a volcano had a taste, it would be this drink. Apparently volcanos are delicious.If the cocktails at Employees Only are works of art than Employees Only itself is a museum, but in this scenario the artists are there in-person for patrons to praise and bless, a ritual rarely experienced when taking in the work of a master. It goes without saying that Employees Only took all my words.",7,3,6

This has to be one of the best places I've been to. From the service, to the drinks, to the food, we were not disappointed. When we arrived we had to wait a little bit, but we just stopped into another bar, grabbed a drink, then headed over. When we came back, we were escorted right in as promised. We grabbed a small table in the back under a beautiful sky light. The rest of the place has a dark ambience, but it sets the tone perfectly. We ordered an Almost there, and a Fraise Sauvage. The Fraise was mildly sweet and refreshing and the almost there was a strong drink served nice and tall filled with ice. Both drinks were amazing. Since we were bar hopping, we just ordered small plates. The bone marrow poppers, spicy shrimp, and lamb lollipops. They were delicious. We dreamed about them all night. The wait staff were all attentive, clearing plates, filling water glasses, asking if we needed anything. I was truly amazed. I don't have one bad thing to say. This place deserves every star it has been given and then some. We also had Common sense and At first blush. Another set of great drinks. The common sense is like an Old fashion and the At first blush was a bubbly glass of sweet perfection! We saw the steaks come out a couple of times and vowed to come back and try it one day! I can't wait to go back. This place puts other places to shame.",3,,1

Updated review","What's the use of going here anymore when it's always so crowded, can't they set a limit to the number of people they let in at any one time?  Surely they are making enough profit off my martini to be able to afford the place not being like a sardine can. I get that it's popular, or it was to me, but not anymore, like most things in NYC this place has peaked and is now just another high priced bar where you can't sit, it's hard to even order a drink over the backs of those in front of you.  Don't bother going people, there's enough high end bars in this town to pick from where you might actually be able to sit and even order a drink.",2,1,
86,Danny N.,"Newport Beach, CA",52,36,36,1.0,5/27/2018,There is something to be said about a place that says it's open until 4am and the tells you at 1am that they are closing and MAY reopen again at 2:30am.

87,Roger M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6,63,137,4.0,2/23/2018,"Nice little spot if there's no wait to get in. The bat staff are lively and attentive to guests. The food portions are small with some plates. The Cheese plate was okay but not as exotic as i would want it to be. The shrimp dish is yum but small. Drinks are typical hotel ice-loaded small-serving size. The crowd varies, from night to night with typical 50% tourists. Overall a good lively speak easy compared to others aroind town. A lounge dj would be nice to see for some nights.There is a dress code but not too strict. The door staff is cool. There are some slow nights where they close earlier than scheduled. So call ahead.",,,
88,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,5.0,4/18/2017,"Gster had seen this on ""Hey Bartender"", and we happened to be a few blocks from here, and, it happened to be 5:50 (E.O. opens at 6:00). Now this is a ""speak easy"", where I am not sure you would know it is there, unless you know ti is there... but there is no faux storefront either. We were the first in line, and were able to grab a great seat at the bar.  The bar filled up very very fast. The boys were very excited for some excellent cocktails. My favorite part of EO is the art/magic that the bartenders create. It is a true performance to watch them create their drinks, and I was sitting there mesmerized, I forgot to order a drink! The bartenders have such a finasse, it makes sense they have to go through a long ""apprenticeship"" before being promoted to bartender. Several of the bartenders also have the EO key tatooted on their arms ( I mean, there's not much better then that right?)!  They had great personality, perfected skills, and made a profession that is typically looked down upon, into an inspiring artistry.The decor is dark, loungey, romantic, with a small seating area with great natural lighting above it and lots of candlelights.  The bathroom is very small, but has fun, inappropriate decor, which gave the bar a little bit more personality.",5,3,4
89,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",40,265,41,4.0,6/30/2017,"Had a nice dinner at Employees Only.  It's a non-descript place with no indication that it is a restaurant from the outside.  Once inside, it is nicely decorated with a cool bar vibe which is open to a restaurant in the back.  We got there just before dark and the skylight let in a lot of natural light.  It got better as it go dark out.We ordered a few items to share: lamb ""popsicles"", a very interesting salad (look for beets in the description however, don't expect a soft red beet salad) and the poached halibut entree.  Each one was very good.  Drinks were nicely done as well.The service was very good.  They were very attentive and gave us a nice table.",,,1

Employees only does not disappoint. Place is super crowded though, but if you get a bar seat, you're good. I like the crowd here, super friendly. Bartenders are pretty quick too, considering how busy this place is. I had the ready fire aim and the beets by ale. Both were good, but I highly recommend the beets by ale. Will definitely stop by this place when I'm back in town.",,,
92,Nikolette F.,"Pelham, NY",332,2,3,5.0,3/10/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate his 21st birthday and we waited to do so for a very long time. We were initially supposed to go over a year ago, but were denied at the door for not being 21. We went back a second time with the impression that we could go in if it was early enough in the day (miscommunication with the host) but we were again denied. Frustration was an under statement but we swore that if we ever got in that it better be some of the best damn food we'd ever had.... and you know what? It was fantastic! I couldn't have l picked a better place to spend such an important occasion with the one that I love.  For appetizers we ordered: Ricotta Gnocchi with Butternut Squash, Balsamico, Brown Butter & Pepitas - $14& Cheese Plate with Lavash, Herbs, & Honeyed Pistachios - $ 23 We were informed that the Gnocchi was home made and it tasted exactly like that. There were a lot of ingredients but it came together in a very subtle way and ultimately was flavorful but not over powering.  We got the cheese plate because that's been a thing of mine recently. All of the cheeses were imported and fresh. The honeyed pistachios were a beautiful and creative pairing. I actually want to add that to some of my own plates moving forward. The olive oil included went well as well. My only complaint would have to be that the lavash served with it shouldn't have been the only type of bread/cracker. I would have liked something with a crunch or more flavor. In addition there were these powdered nuts? They were nuts with something on them and they didn't bring much to the plate except for redundancy. I'd suggest maybe dry fruit, regular fruit, or a chutney?  Either way it was all pretty impressive and worth the price. For entrées: Skate Paprikás with Spaetzle & Crème Fraiche - $26&Roasted Half Chicken with Celery Root, Broccolini& Heirloom Cherry Tomato - $27 I had the Skate and I hadn't even heard of it until I looked it up at the table. Kudos to them for being so  exotic sincerely. I can't compare it to much, but it was really really good. The sauce was great too and packed a big punch which I like for a main course. I just wish it came with a vegetable and less sauce. A little truly does go a long way with that much flavor. I really can't complain. I can't say a much about the chicken, but I got a thumbs up from him. In addition his Broccolini was sooo good. I wanted some of my own. They offered sides as an item on the menu, but I don't think it's fair to pay for a entree and only get a protein. For dessert: Butterscotch & Mascarpone Cheesecake with Sea Salt & Nut Brittle - $10All I can say is wow. I have never cut into a piece of cake that smooth and soft. The people next to us made the exact same expression when they cut into theirs. It tasted even better than it looked and that's saying something. I really liked the nut brittle and sea salt combination too along with the cake. It created and sour and sweet sort of dialogue.Finally Drinks: Pedro Ximenez, ""Nectar"" Gonzalez Byass, Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain, NV - $12 Employees Only Prosecco Brut, Zardetto, Veneta, Italy, NV - $12The dessert wine was super sweet, but very alcoholic. It paired super well with the cheese cake and didn't ruin the flavor of it at all. The prosecco was a little strong tasting but still pretty solid. I was impressed they had their own brand. Oh and before I forget! The decor is super old timey while still being up to date and trendy. The bar is way too over crowded and the dining area is small, but you won't even mind due to the wonderful service, knowledgeable staff, and great food and drink. All they need is another bathroom :p I would have taken pics but it was super low light and I didn't want to seem obnoxious/immature  (we were the youngest people in there by like ten years lol)",,,
93,Stephanie M.,"Leonia, NJ",155,252,204,5.0,5/8/2017,"Employees Only is a cut above the rest, even in the world of NYC speakeasies. I am new to exploring the upper echelon of the cocktail scene in NYC but that doesn't mean I don't know a quality cocktail when I see (and taste) one. My boyfriend and I stopped in fairly early on Saturday evening (sometime between 5:30-6, I believe) and we had to wait about 5 minutes to go inside. The bar area wasn't too packed. I had the 'Amelia' cocktail which was a deep violet color from the blueberries and garnished with mint, I believe it was.. gin based? I was already a few drinks deep so my memory is a bit foggy. It was a delicious drink and beautiful. My boyfriend tried the 'Stardust', which was a mezcal based drink that was smokey tasting and topped with a thick egg white foam. This drink was truly exceptional. If you don't like smokiness or the taste of mezcal, you'd be wise not to order it, but we both enjoy those attributes. He said this was a drink he was going to remember for a while. I hope we can come back here soon and try more drinks and possibly some food next time. I was too busy chatting with a group of girls to watch the bartenders at work so next time I'll have to pay better attention as I love to watch serious mixologists at work. I forgot to snap pictures of the drinks for my review but I saw a couple pictures of the Amelia in the gallery.",1,,1

97,Martin M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,24,0,1.0,9/12/2017,"So I see the blonde, short-haired bartender with the anger problem and resentment for his parents has struck a nerve with some of the customers. Glad to see I am not alone at noticing what an ass this guy is. What otherwise would be a great experience for expensive but well made drinks is being pretty much ruined by some jerk that doesn't seem to understand that despite how high up he is on the bartender food chain, he's still in the service industry. Apparently this life choice bothers him. This results in him resenting how you order, what you order, and then displaying his own hatred towards himself by slamming shit around, shaking his drink in your face, barking at you if you don't order in a fashion he prefers, and then not taking further drink orders. He must be a gem to date. Killer Martini bro. See a shrink.",6,9,1
98,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",639,413,1077,5.0,7/8/2016,"Wow, this speakeasy is truly spectacular.Our waitress looked like she was pulled out of a 1920s magazine: bob-length haircut, long pearl necklace. I absolutely loved it! All the bartenders looked so professional yet suave and made possibly the best cocktails I've ever had. Starting with the Billionaire cocktail ($16), AMAZING. That drink is so strong yet you won't even know it. Having not eaten earlier, I had already started buzzing from half the drink! But it is delicious and so well made I wouldn't complain to drinking that all night. I got the Ginger Smash ($16) next. Also, delicious. Not the biggest fan of ginger, but it was still really good! And like I keep saying this, very well made. There are many little ginger pieces in the drink. The steak tartare was amazing. A handsome waiter came by and mixed it up for us, adding in several ingredients into the tartare (unfortunately, I don't remember them all :( ). There was an egg yolk on top, onto which he added shallots, and 3 other spices I guess you could call it? You pair that off with these very crispy thin toasted (maybe sourdough?) bread slices and wow, the combination just takes you away. There are so many flavors incorporated into this. They also provide a side greens salad as well. They also brought dark brown bread and the soft butter that came with it was SO GOOD. I think there was lemon in it? I can't quite remember, but it's definitely not just butter. This speakeasy has every alcohol you can name. The bar is the more commonly used area, can probably fit around 15-20 people? There are two tables/booths on the opposite side of the bar where my friend and I sat. Each could probably fit about 4 people? There is also seating outside of the bar, where there is brighter lighting. I didn't get to take a look at it when we went. They offer cocktails that are separated into 3 categories, an EO cocktail, and 2 others. They also offer beer and I think wine as well?You can make reservations for the booths, which I would recommend because I have heard it gets extremely packed on the weekends. We went on a Thursday and it got pretty packed at around 8/9 PM.",5,1,1

Check.  'Secret' Entrance? Check. Enter through the Psychic, except there is actually a psychic.  Dim lighting? Check. Pricey cocktails? Check. Bartenders that know what their doing? Check. Crowded?

Started the night with a Manhattan Which was killer. My girl had an Amelia (I think that's what they called it) which was also delicious.We ordered the steak tartare, as we absolutely loved it when we had it at EO's Miami location, and it was everything that you could ever wish for. No wonder it is so renowned and famous. Don't miss it. Also split the 26oz rib eye (clearly, we are not vegans). I usually prefer a filet, but this steak has me seriously considering changing my ways. Perfectly prepared (medium rare), great char, well seasoned.

The place is a pretty big for a speakeasy, but we were a party of 16, so we still took up about half the back room. NOTE: there's only one bathroom for the place - but there are 'rumors' that if you ask the staff, when faced with a long line, they may let you use a staff bathroom. First - the table bread is served with a cream spread that's friggin delicious.As we were a big party, we had a prix fix menu.  For appetizers, we had the charcuterie, the arugula and asparagus salad, and the ricotta gnocchi - served family style.The charcuterie had smoked/cured Italian-style meats, chicken liver pate, and homemade focaccia.  The chicken liver was incredible, and the spicy cured sausage went quickly - though we could reorder as needed.The ricotta gnocchi had a pea pesto/lemon and pistachio garnish. Toasted and delicious.The arugula/asparagus salad was nice, light palette cleanser when not gorging on the other apps.For my main, I ordered the roasted chicken, which was fine, and the skin was seasoned nicely, but I wish it was a bit crisper. Still fine though, light and flavorful.  I tried someone's cavatelli with house sausage, which was really good and the porn chops looked pretty impressive.For desserts, again served family style, we had the dark chocolate pot de creme, the butterscotch mascarpone cheesecake, and assorted sorbet.  The pot de creme packed some really intense chocolate flavor, and was creamy and delectable. The star, however, was the cheesecake. Light, but still a decently firm texture...just fantastic. Didn't try the sorbets...too busy with the pot de creme and cheesecake haha.For drinks, I had the Manhattan, Common Sense, and Yankee Notion.  The Manhattan was a little sweet for my liking, but was still very tasty.  For my, the common sense was the winner, as it was a bit drier than the Manhattan. Great stuff.  The Yankee Notion was also a fine drink, but again...for me, it was about the Common Sense.The service in the place was prompt and polite.  No complains whatsoever.

Only (as my trendy West Village friend referred to it) boasts interesting, and very well executed cocktails ($16 for signature drinks) in a speakeasy setting.I've been told it's a difficult to find entry, but the door is fairly notable from the street.  Maybe just not well marked with the business name (we were scurrying in from the cold rather quickly).I was told the signature event is chicken noodle soup served at 3:30AM.  We left just ahead of that, so while I can't personally vouch for it, some of the regulars rather emphatically spoke of its epicness.Come dressed in your comfy Village chic, or go as far as speakeasy costume.  We saw both while we were there.  Bartenders are quick to grab a beverage order, albeit sometimes pump out drinks from two people's orders at the same time.  Don't grab the wrong one!Hint - there's a second bathroom downstairs toward the kitchen.",9,1,3
115,Elizabeth H.,"ASTORIA, NY",16,119,75,2.0,8/29/2017,"I don't want to be mean, but this place just wasn't for me. I know its known for their cocktails, obviously, but I had been really excited to go and try their *made-infront-of-you* whipped steak tartare. I especially wanted to come here since I've heard that this is supposedly ""one of the best places in New York"" to eat it.NOPE! Not even close. I wish I could describe to you why the taste of it fell so flat, but I'm still trying to decipher it myself. It was intensely bland. Too many herbs, and somehow absolutely no flavour. If I had closed my eyes, a part of me wondered if I'd even be able to understand *what* I was eating if I hadn't specially ordered it by name.So that sucked. They serve it without the egg, so maybe that was it? No, I don't know. It was just mystifying. I shouldn't have had such high hopes, but I mean - don't serve it table side and expect me NOT to have high expectations.All in all?The place was beautifully decorated and the winding bar is gorgeous. The drinks were okay. The prices are ridiculous and please god don't get the steak tartare.",1,1,
116,Jenny C.,"Providence, RI",386,187,615,4.0,3/19/2016,"It wasn't until after we had our first round of drinks that I learned this bar was ranked in the top of the ""best bars in the WORLD"" list, which I find a pretty bold claim. I don't know how that's judged, exactly, but I'd say it's a neat bar with great drinks, but I think the mass of people made it less appealing. I will say it's not the most warm and welcoming of places, but the bartenders were very talented (Kudos, gentlemen) and clearly I'm not a New Yorker. I did enjoy the speakeasy aspect, though I'd be wary of the psychic whose business is the front entrance. I got some eerie vibes. The best part of the night was when my date and I swapped drinks (both were good, why not?) and we conversed with our neighbors about what we were drinking. ""That's the lazy lover,"" I said, pointing to my drink, in my date's hand, to which he said, ""She picked it out for me."" Funnily enough, he'd given me his ""Common Sense."" Clever drink names, y'all!",3,3,1

In the back are a couple tables- make sure you call ahead to book one.Usually I just get drinks here and on the wkds it can have an half hour line, but to celebrate graduation I came for food.

119,Nam H.,"New York, NY",741,143,614,4.0,4/15/2016,"I have been to employees only several times, always at the request of my foodie friends who really appreciate good drinks.  Everyone is always raving about this place and they say it serves the best drinks in the city.  So with that reputation alone, it is worth coming and checking out.  However, it is VERY difficult to get in past 9PM.  The best workaround is to just make a reservation, and you'll get to skip the line like a king.  Otherwise, be prepared to wait a looooong time, at least 30 minutes if the line is reasonable.  Also, the manager takes the guy/girl ratio pretty seriously, so if your group has a poor ratio, you're screwed!  It is also way better to split up into smaller groups.If you do manage to get in, you'll enjoy the old school vibe to the place.  The bartenders are serious about their work, which really adds class to the place since you know you're going to get some great drinks where people are passionate about their jobs.  I always get either the ""billionaire"" or ""masarati"", which are the most popular drinks.  The price is not cheap though!  With a reasonable tip, you're looking at $20 per drink.  The venue is very small so you're elbow to elbow with everyone else.  There is usually an interesting mix between yuppies and older people there, so it is definitely diverse.  All in all, I would highly recommend you check this place out, but definitely heed my advice about the timing and guy/girl ratio.",2,,1
120,Penny H.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,20,0,4.0,12/17/2017,"I went with my boyfriend on a Tuesday around 7 and there was plenty of space to sit at the bar. They have comfortable swivel stools. The bartender noticed us immediately and was quick to give us menus. I looked over their impressive list and asked a couple people what they'd ordered at the bar. Some lady had a Pisco Sour, It took a while for me to decide what to order. I chose the Ready, Fire, Aim- a mezcal cocktail with pineapple, honey, and some ""hellfire bitters""... perhaps this made my drink subtly spicy. It was delicious and well balanced, I would have had a few rounds if we had had time to stay.My boyfriend can be a bit dull when it comes to drink ordering, so he ordered his usual- a Manhattan. The bartender made his drink very quickly, which initially impressed me. But he sipped his drink and made a face. I took a sip to see what was wrong; it was an overly sweet, not-very cold Manhattan. We asked the bartender what was in it and he walked away. When he came back he said ""Grand Marnier, that's what makes it unique"" kind of with an attitude.This place is a hyped up cocktail bar for a reason. Their cocktails are amazing, the space is classy, and the bartenders are good at what they do. I'm just a little shocked that such a classic drink fell so flat. And I guess when you go out somewhere in the city that's so hyped up, you're going to find a little attitude from the staff, like they know better than you. I don't love going out to feel like my presence is being tolerated. With that being said, I might go back to do some research on how they make that Mezcal cocktail so I can make it at home...",,,

The bone marrow poppers are a must. The cocktails are made to perfection. Dev makes sure of it. My favorites were the Besos Caliente and the Yankee Notion.

The cocktails were okay, definitely not the best I've had, and extremely expensive. The crowd seemed like a lot of pretentious, unfriendly millennials and the staff was equally as unfriendly.

We stopped in for a quick drink early in our evening and despite having to drink standing by the fire, we were super happy we made the time. As everyone suggests, make a reservation. It's the best way to get in and ensure you have a place to sit and enjoy your cocktail. I wasn't bothered as the space is so cool and the people watching was great.The cocktails we enjoyed were at the level you hope and expect from a world-class bar. I enjoyed watching the bartenders work, their movements fluid and precise. Funny enough, I enjoyed my cocktail so much I think I drank it in like 5 minutes because I couldn't stop myself!

As you walk in, the busy bar and fun, not-too-noisy atmosphere (with friendly and helpful bartenders) explain why this place is a favorite. We were seated quickly in the back. LOVED the lamb shank appetizer and trout entree.  The bacon around the lamb shank was wonderfully crispy, and balanced well with the salsa verde. The trout was light and perfectly seasoned. The cheesecake dessert with butterscotch is divine and melts in your mouth.  The Austrian white wine complemented the food. Our servers were gracious, prompt and very attentive. Overall, a wonderful dining experience provided by Employees Only.",1,,
126,Chris F.,"San Ramon, CA",0,23,8,5.0,4/27/2017,"We had to try this spot after Dead Rabbit the night before. Total different vibe, but I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the drinks (had the Yankee Notions), appetizers (spicy shrimp with kale), the dinner (chicken and a cucumber/radish salad), and the german chocolate cake and cappuccino. The place is really loud (good 70's music tonight) and the crowd seems to average early 30's. I thoroughly enjoyed both the Dead Rabbit and Employees Only, but when returning to Manhattan I think I will be back to EO first, unless I really need to hear what the others in my party are saying.  Great spot. Tip: if it works for your situation ask for the two-top near the bar, that way you get a little (very little) bit of quiet compared to the bar area, but also get the vibe of the bar. The back of the dining area seems to allow for a little more intimacy.",,,

I will only drizzle honey on my pistachios from now on. She had chicken, I had skate. The skate was sitting on a bed of spatzle but the creme fraiche was the star. I would drink that sauce if they offered. The service was attentive (water was always filled) and our server couldn't be nicer, even with the mad house that was the bar next to the dinner tables.

When the waitress asked if we were enjoying our meals I said 'No' and then she walked away. Didn't offer me anything else. Although don't think I would want anything else.

I'm a huge fan of bone marrow but the bone marrow poppers were pretty meh. Also, finding space to put a place down at the bar can be a bit of a struggle.The crowd is interesting. It has a hipster trust fund baby kind of crowd to it. It adds a weird layer of bougie but if you can get a seat at the bar or a reservation, it's a speakeasy that's worth checking out.

I've been here on many occasions and never had a thing that I didn't love. Last night was no exception. Cucumber & radish salad with caraway cracker is one of my favorite salads. It comes with a generous amount of dill and is dressed in a refreshing poppyseed yogurt sauce that's pure crack. Gnocchi appetizer with morels was comforting and lovingly prepared. It was so delicious, I wanted more of this and wished the portion was a little bit bigger. Cavatelli with pork sausage in tomato sauce is a hearty entree choice and perfect for those cold winter nights. Cheese plate appetizer is also a great choice to end a meal with. It comes with three different kinds of cheese, pistachios in honey, walnuts, and soft flatbread. Since there's not many tables, I would recommend calling in advance to make a reservation if you have a group, as they are not on OpenTable.",5,1,1

Like Mexicans can't Yelp and have an opinion? I liked the place up until then. That bouncer is terrible. He even denied some chick entry after she asked to just use the bathroom. He said ""you and the people you're associated with can't come in here and I don't give a fuck"" Like seriously??? Whatever the situation is it doesn't give you the right to be racist.

Bartenders here are definitely on their game. My drink was made perfect. I got The West Side cocktail - perfect blend of liquor and mint. Really good and I recommend it. Drink price is very much on the high end though, as it was 16 bucks.I'll give Employees Only another go around in the future. Coming here on the weekday seems like a better idea as it doesn't seem it will be as crowded.  Also, I'm looking to forward to trying the food as the menu looks decent and the food selection looks pretty selective and appetizing.",3,,

This is a pretty small place so it gets crowded fast and there is usually a bouncer by a certain time of the evening that limits how many people can get in (although they should limit this a little more as it was insanely crowded the friday night we were there making it hard to stand and sip on your drink without bumping into someone every two seconds). There are a few tables for dinner but we didn't have dinner so I can't speak of the food. Cocktails are very aligned with many other speakeasy type lounges with prices averaging $14-$18 per cocktail. We got a few cocktails and they were good & strong, but nothing super exceptional that makes me want to run back . There is a nice bustling vibe inside with everyone having a good time.

159,Adam G.,"Phoenix, AZ",419,41,21,4.0,5/14/2017,Getting carded at the door brought back some good memories...for all 6 of us! The drinks were perfect and unique at the same time. A lot of thought was put into the drink menu which was much appreciated. The alcohol level didn't disappoint either. Very casual atmosphere the only sign on the window was for a physic who took up a card table in the front corner when you walked in. Other than that you have no idea what the space is. Seemed like a lot of neighborhood regulars starting off the evening so not getting attended to right away be to be expected. The space is a little noisy so perfect for 2 or 4 people. Note be willing to share with friends as all the choices looked good and where good! Speak Easy meet New York!,1,1,1

I stopped in on a Monday night around 10 and it was pretty busy. The energy of this place is great and while I'm not typically an 80s music fan, it totally fits with the vibe of this place. For our first round we got the West Side and the Manhattan. I loved the West Side, it was light and fresh and not overly sweet. The lemon and mint flavors really came through. I enjoyed it even though it was cold out but it's also a perfect warmer weather drink. The Manhattan was classic and tasty. I also got an Old Fashioned, which was equally as great as the first 2 cocktails. We sat at the bar for a bit and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. The crowd here was great, everyone was there to have a good time. While it's swanky feeling I didn't get the sense of pretentiousness that I get at other similar bars, which is a nice change.

Don't get me wrong, we had a great time and the food was good but just too pricey. I am not a big drinker so when my drink cost almost the amount of an entrée I get nervous. We started with cocktails and I had the ""Amelia- Aylesbury Duck Vodka & St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur Shaken with Puréed Blackberries & Fresh Lemon Juice"" which was good but not uhmmm I need to get another one, especially for the price. For my dinner entrée I had the duck confit salad and the bacon wrapped lamb chops Duck Confit with the Orecchiette which was uhm uhmm yummy.  It was definitely a great combination but anything with bacon is tasty for us pork eaters. LOL. For dessert I had the Caramel & Fudge Brownie chocolate pudding which was layered with the flavors of hazelnut, caramel and fudge and it was scrumptious.

173,Mark W.,"Newark, DE",0,6,0,1.0,5/22/2018,My review is directed towards their service. They ruined my brothers birthday !!!!!!I went to this place to celebrate my brothers birthday. I told them during my booking about the event. I also emphasized that I will be there for few hours. The place is very crowded and narrow. We ordered few cocktails and ordered appetizers. Drinks were ordinary. not worth $18. I would recommend dead rabbit or  death and co for better drinks. It was difficult to differentiate flavors in the drink. Appetizers was ordinary too. Service was horrible. Since we were celebrating we were taking it a little slow. We were however continuously ordering drinks and appetizers. We both had three cocktails each and two appetizers. At 920 PM we were told to finish our meal in 40 min. It seem they had another reservation at 10 PM. In trying to discuss this with her she told me we need to talk to the manager and she walked off. Then came in the host who behaved more like a bouncer. To make the long story short we could not have the main course and we also did not reach the desert section. I hold then responsible for not warning me that they are turning-tables. Never anticipated a place where they charge $18 for a drink to behave like cheaper eateries and turn-tables. They had multiple opportunities to tell me well in advance that they turn tables. The waitress should have warned me in advance the time limitation management is imposing. The manager and staff are completely responsible for ruining a family birthday. It's poor service and bad manners. I will never go back to this place.,,1,
174,Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",95,1542,40,4.0,6/26/2016,"Employees only is a speakeasy/restaurant located behind what appears to be a psychic reader. The menu is eclectic with dishes influenced by Mediterranean, Eastern European, and other cuisines. The staff is courtesy and attentive. Dining here is a superb experience.We decided to have a tapas style dinner. I tried the roasted beet and carrot salad, the bacon wrapped lamb chops, and the Spanish grilled octopus. I'd recommend all three with my favorite being the octopus. The octopus came with a celery salad which had too much root and earthy flavor for my liking, but the octopus was well grilled; it was tender and juicy.The lamb chops were slightly overcooked for my liking; they were served medium though I would have preferred medium-rare or rare. The lamb chops came with a fantastic chimichuri sauce. I would have eaten that sauce on almost anything. The bacon wrapped around the lamb added crispiness and even more savoriness. The roasted beet salad included freshly roasted beets as opposed to pickled beets. It was a tasteful surprise to have fresh beets and carrots rather than the pickled ones I was expected. The dish had more umani and less bitterness than I expected. It was also served with a goat cheese cream which added richness and creaminess.",3,,3

184,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",748,432,173,5.0,4/11/2016,"Let's face it--this place has been on your to-do list for a while. It's considered one of the best bars in the world and you don't need me to convince you to go. So let me make this easier for you and get right down to it. DrinksMata Hari -- This is the award-winning one. Once you taste it, you'll know why. Not too sweet and you can taste the alcohol, but there's no burning or unpleasantness, its sheer enjoyment. Manhattan - EO is known to pride itself on its unique Manhattan recipe. It's different but it's well done. However, this isn't for the faint hearted, aka me. I'd probably die if I drank a whole one of these. Billionaire Cocktail- this is a good medium, it's not too girly and not too manly. This is what I'd imagine a billion bucks to taste like. Ginger Mash - if you typically like ginger-based drinks, you'll like this. If you typically hate ginger-based drinks, you'll hate it. Appetizers Bone Marrow Poppers -- liked the bite size take on bone marrow. It's a must for bone marrow lovers--but not anything too wow. Steak Tartare - YES you can't go wrong. It's made at the table, and there's some aspect of customization in terms of flavor (spicy? Salty? More worchestshire?)Ricotta Gnocchi -- did you even doubt this? It's soft, pillowy, and deceptively simple with a hint of lemon. Not only did I want more, but I wanted to take some home to use it as a pillow it was so soft. Octopus - My favorite appetizer. I can't even remember the flavors because it was so distracted by how tender it was. That's a good sign. Oysters -- fresh, but I found mine were little sandy. Plus they didn't serve cocktail sauce--what the what? EntreesRib Eye -- it's true what they say. It's awesome and it's a must. Dash it with some sea salt, and skip the lemon wedge. Plus, the potato gratin?? Let's just say we ordered an extra one, it was so good. Monkfish - this is on the smaller side, but for a tiny fish, it's pack full of flavor. If you're a fish lover, you'll enjoy this one. Orecchiette with Spicy Pork Sausage, Tomato, & Arugula -- I really enjoyed this one, even though it was so simple, it was the execution. Perfect al dente, light sauce, and chunks of sausage. Arugula - tasty salad, I barely got a bite of this because the other half of my party destroyed it. But I take that as a good sign. SidesPotato gratin -- screw your no-carb diet, this is so good I think they baked crack into it. Kale -I'm not a kale lover, but I dig this side! It was soft, flavorful, and light. Black eyed peas - against kale and potato gratin, it may have been an unfair comparison, but this side did not stand out to me in the least. DessertCheesecake -- This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, and I'm confident you'll think so too. It holds the consistency of Panna cotta, but drizzled with a toasty butterscotch, this will elevate your cheesecake standards. This dish is such a MUST, we ordered two. One right after the finished the first one. Who even does that?Brownie - it resembles chocolate mousse in its shapelessness, but a brownie in heaviness. Good for chocolate lovers, but I would pass on this again. Apple yogurt -- a good balance, not too sweet and not overly indulgent like the others. Sorbet - lemon basil and prickly pear sorbets were great but I highly recommend the prickly pear. It was refreshing and full of flavor!",8,2,4

187,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1398,568,597,5.0,4/4/2015,"This place is definitely good but overrated at the same time. So to begin with the guy outside with the clipboard is pretty intimidating. They take reservations not only for dinner but for bar seats as well so if you're not ""on the list"" you may have no chance snaggin' a table. I had made a reservation so I had no problem walking in.The wine list is great and reasonably priced so we did grab a bottle of Sauvignon Cabernet which was good. Now on to the food:Apps:The bone marrow poppers I actually did not like at all. Reminiscent of a pastry with  bone marrow on top. Definitely not a fan.The arugula salad was very good. Fresh, with the perfect amount of flavor, it was magnificent.Entree:Of course being the steak lover that  I am I had to order the rib eye. The steak was extremely juicy but worth $62??? I don't think so!!! Don't get me wrong the steak was good but not worth the value. I've had other steaks around the city that Ive enjoyed with a price point of $28-$48 so to me $62 never again. Although the steak was HUGE there was a lot of fat, and yes I know rib eye is fatty but still I don't eat the fatty part so a lot of it went to waste. The only side with the steak is the potato gratin, which by the way is amazing!  And although amazing its a very small portion! I also had a taste of the black sea bass which was good but again a very small piece of fish.All in all is this place good, YES. Is the service good, YES! The bit of hassle to get in and the prices of this place  don't match up.  The ambiance  is nice but at the same time casual and I don't find to be that exclusive. Glad I tried it, I would say its a must do but I wouldn't be running back.",6,4,7

It's a very popular kinda hidden place that everyone seems to be at. I ordered my normal old fashioned (great by the way) and I wanted to always try this poppers. First of all, I love bone marrow. If it's on the menu, I order them. These peppers were so good. You get three per order, and I wish it was ten. The pastry is cooked perfectly and it literally melts in your mouth.

The servers here are all really nice, and the cocktails were excellent. We ordered the bone marrow poppers to start, and these were phenomenal. They were perfect small bites and were exploding in flavor! Everyone seriously needs to try these. We also got the ricotta gnocchi to share, and these were probably the best gnocchi I've ever had. The oyster mushroom sauce paired SO perfectly and I only wish the portions were bigger.The Tagliatelle with butternut squash was our main entree, and again the mushroom sauce x pasta combo was done perfectly with this dish. Our side of Brussels sprouts with bacon was also delicious and were gone in less than 3 minutes. For dessert, I HIGHLY recommend the Butterscotch & Mascarpone Cheesecake with Sea Salt & Nut Brittle.

Updated review","I've been a few times for the great cocktails, but never thought to try the food, until this weekend.  Food: - steak tartare - I haven't seen steak tartare mixed table side since my few weeks in Paris as a college student.  They bring the spices to the table and you get to select how much of each gets added in.  It was to die for.  My inner carnivore went nuts.-bone marrow poppers - the bone marrow is sweet and has that meaty buttery consistency that goes so well with philo dough.-oysters - plump and juicy.  I loved that they were lightly flavored and that most of the liquid had not been drained out during shucking.  Well done EO!-octopus - soft and tender but not so flavorful as to blow my mind.Service: really nice and attentive staff you kept checking in on us and refilling our water, and our cocktails.Ambience: great spot for a date or for friends to meet up.  It gets a little loud but the scene is stunning, so it definitely sets the mood for a fun night out",,,
195,Joey L.,"New York, NY",137,283,495,4.0,8/12/2015,"Very dressy bouncers. Test your luck if you don't want to get semi-dressed up (especially if you're a guy). We tried to get in on a Friday, but one person in our party had on shorts and birks, and we were rejected. However, he was very nice about it. Came back on a Sunday and saw a man with shorts and sneakers and the bouncer let him in, but told him he needs to be more dressed up next time.After we got in, we were looking over the drink menu and waiting for a spot at the bar, a waitress saw us and offered us a seat at one of the empty tables. I got the Amelia (apparently a popular choice because 2 other ladies had the same drink) and my bf got a really strong gin cocktail. Both were really good (but mine was tastier, he kept stealing it). This speakeasy also serves dinner. At one point a fortune teller came by and asked us if we wanted our fortunes told. Overall, very cute place. Perfect for drinks and people watching.

Would definitely recommend this place to a friend. You feel like you are walking into a part of New York City history when you come inside.,,,

198,Iliana D.,"Manhattan, NY",99,341,162,5.0,3/2/2016,"Let see I have a lot to say so I'll sum it in a nutshell. Service-I personally found it mixed half employees were super chill other half had that village snobbery that irks me to my core. The doorman was SUPER chill and friendly! Ambiance- we arrived at 6 on a week day. Within 30 minutes place was very busy, loud, we sat near. Bar and it was annoying women walk by with their bags practically knocking food and cups off our table. They stand with their asses in your face. zero Fks given if you're eating. Food- we had few starters the bone marrow puffs we're amazing but you get 3 little ones so yea . I had the rib eye and it was SUPERB. There was enough to feed 3 people, so much. The mashed potatoes were delicious too. Fresh jalapeños nice touch. The desserts were great I had the chocolate pudding or whatever it was, legit it was good. Walked away impressed as this place is known for their drinks I guess... Drinks- so we had a variety and tried each other's and wow they were very good. I can't remember the nameOf the one I liked most I had this SMOKEY flavor, I think it was called ready stand fire or something,  could be wrong but that one was legit too. To the people that say their drinks are underrated like, wtf is your problem? What more do you want from a 16$ cocktail? Everyone at our table was impressed. Price-  yea it's not cheap but whatever you get what you pay for as most things in life, and I thought it was worth it. Enjoy.w",6,,2
199,Lÿda D.,"New York, NY",0,27,15,3.0,6/22/2017,"This is a nice place, but I didn't know what all the hype was about. It's a pretty basic bar. Also, the bartender spilled water all over me and I was completely soaked the rest of the night. He did apologize and comped my drink which was nice. Their signature cocktails weren't really good and overly sweet for my liking. All I could taste was sugar. Overall it was a pretty basic bar, with basic music, basic drinks and a basic crowd.",,,
