0,Waverly W.,"Chicago, IL",261,8,3,5.0,8/18/2018,"Stopped in after a long Monday of exploring in order to relax and take advantage of the fantastic BOGO happy hour deal. The space was fairly empty when we walked in before the post-work crowd, and we were immediately greeted by the bartender. Large selection of cocktails and wines all around the $10-13 price range (so a steal at $5-6 per drink with BOGO!). Coming from Chicago, my boyfriend and I were generally shocked by the lack of plentiful, local craft beer options in NYC bars, so he was happy to find at least a couple beers on draft at Ten Degrees. The space was very comfy and we were happy to post up at the extremely cushioned booths and rest our feet. They turned the ambience up with dimmed lights and candles come around 6pm. Great location in the heart of East Village, comfortable seating, and tasty cocktails at a low price all day - what else could you ask for!?",,,
1,Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",799,2687,266,2.0,9/19/2018,"The pro?  An extensive selection of wines by the glass and cocktails during HH.The cons?  Terribly sluggish and disorganized service (eg. our server had to go back and forth to check what the kitchen actually had available for food...).  Poor presentation and execution on the cocktails.  Sticky tables and wine glasses that had wine dripping down the sides.Even with the popular 2 for 1 deal on drinks, the service and atmosphere left much to be desired.",1,,1
2,Molly B.,"New York, NY",110,43,37,5.0,10/27/2018,"YES I LOVE THIS HAPPY HOUR!! Two for 1 drinks and they are so good, AND it's till 8pm which is longer than most! Not to mention the food is amazing, such fresh quality ingredients. The arugula salad with fresh mozzarella was delicious, as were the paninis. You can really tell that all the ingredients are great quality (especially the panini bread holy crap). Come here for a more inexpensive classy bar experience with great light food options.",,,
3,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,5.0,2/17/2018,"Came here as a party of 6 (with a reservation) around 5:45pm on Valentine's Day. We were seated towards the back. They had Happy Hour going on (2 for 1 wines) and a great selection of drinks! We split a cheese platter and then ordered chips and guac (which also came with salsa and sour cream). It got busy very quickly, but our waitress was lovely and memorized all our drink orders and provided extra chips when we ran out. All in all, good drinks, good snacks, and a cozy vibe.",1,,
4,Alixandra E.,"New Orleans, LA",356,201,1109,3.0,12/4/2017,"Ten Degrees Bar is popular, and for good reason. I went with a friend on a Saturday and it was pretty packed. Their happy hour runs every day noon-8 pm (2-for-1 drinks), so I wasn't surprised by the amount of people. I ordered the special summer drink Coconut Daquiri ($14) and it tasted like it was barely alcoholic. I was feeling a bit ripped off until suddenly it hit me.  I was shocked. Of course it didn't hit me until I had ordered my second drink, a Negroni. The Negroni had a bit too much Campari in it, but the ice mellowed it down. My friend had the Mojito, but it was very sweet. The second time she ordered it with less sugar and it was perfect. The daquiri I had was also pretty sweet, but then again it was a daquiri. Their happy hour is awesome, but busy. The drinks were decent, but not fantastic. It was so loud in there that you had to be sitting next to each other to hear anyone talk. The server was nice, but a bit frazzled by the high demand and the service was a bit slow. It really wasn't too bad seeing as it was 6 pm on a Saturday. I would definitely come back here for their great happy hour and variety of drinks (wine, beer, cocktails, etc).",2,,1
5,Elise W.,"New York, NY",117,222,29,4.0,4/11/2018,"The vibe of this place is one point. Laid back, but still hella cool I am glad my friend suggested this place! The bartenders were very attentive and friendly which is awesome because let's be real, that isn't always the case. They do a 2 for 1 happy hour special where you can order any drink on special. You can even mix and match your alcohol. For example if you wanted to start with a cocktail, but then move to beer that is completely kosher! They did warn us however that the higher priced drink would be the one charged to the card. Lesson - buy two drinks of equal value. I ordered a mojito and a St. Germain Cocktail. The St. Germain was a bit too sweet from the lime juice, but overall the gin balanced it out - worth the happy hour price. The mojito unfortunately was rather mediocre - maybe the guy wasn't paying attention whilst making it (sh*t happens). Either way I would definitely drop back in for a drink next time I am in the neighborhood.",2,2,2
6,Steven S.,"Boca Raton, FL",263,38,7,5.0,4/15/2018,"Just like all the other reviews state, the happy hour is EVERY SINGLE DAY! I went yesterday (Saturday) at around 4:15 PM and there was a private party that was finishing up, so the place was open to the general public. I loved that the 2-4-1 was on every drink and the bartenders were awesome with keeping track of drinks (Phil was the male bartender but I can't remember the woman's name).We ordered the crostini, the grilled cheese, and avocado toast to split among four of us. All the food was great. All of our cocktails were great. It started to pick up at around 6 PM and get busier, but we were sitting at the bar so we were fine. There are some tables in toward the back. I'm not sure that if the bartenders come to you to pick up drinks or if you have to go to the bar yourself. Make sure you're clear when you're ordering as some of the cocktails can sound the same and the bartenders may mishear you.The only thing I would say is that if you're planning to come here, try calling the day before to see if there are any private events. I lucked out, but it's a good thing to check on if you know what time of day you're going to go.Cannot wait to come back here again!",,,
7,Raiyan D.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",8,59,2,5.0,2/27/2018,They have a 2 for 1 happy hour special on their drinks and house shots. It starts at 12 pm and ends at 8 pm. Does this review really need anything else?,,,
8,Betty L.,"Manhattan, NY",300,124,250,5.0,8/18/2017,"I first discovered this gem many years ago and loved it back then. I haven't been around this area lately, until the other day when my friend and I decided to go to Hanoi House next door. There was a long wait so we decided to drop by for some drinks.This place is still awesome! They have great music and a 2-for-1 drink special as part of their happy hour. Note that each person has to get two drinks in order to get the deal. But our server was nice enough to let us have a second drink even a little past the happy hour time. Highly recommended!",,,

10,Joey L.,"New York, NY",137,283,495,4.0,1/16/2018,"One of the best happy hour deals! 2 for 1 drinks (per person) that runs from noon till 8pm. Wide variety of drinks to choose from and some seasonal items written on a mirror/board by the bar. Space is kinda cramped whenever I've been, but that's usually around 5pm and onward when everyone is out and about. Space by the bar/near the front is the best since it feels more open. The back is a bit darker if you go at night.Service is somewhat slow. Seems like they are understaffed since there is only 1 or 2 bartenders and minimal wait staff. Otherwise, drinks are pretty good and absolutely worth it to go with friends.",,,
11,Connie L.,"New York, NY",30,337,138,4.0,1/14/2018,"The 2 for 1 (noon till pm) keeps me coming back even though this place lacks ventilation sometimes. Unless you're day drinking in the afternoon, this place is always packed during prime HH time. There's low couch seating for 6 near the front right, high tables on the left, a bar that wraps around in the middle, and then there's the back room with more space and seating.I used to live a building away and I'm not sure why I didn't take advantage of the happy hour more often.Honestly, the deal speaks for itself.",,,
12,Carolyn Z.,"Flushing, NY",387,254,490,5.0,11/4/2017,"Wow their drinks are S T R O N G. Came here for happy hour on a Tuesday and it was really packed surprisingly. The people inside were all lively and gave off a vibe that made me want to step in. They had a 2 for 1 happy hour special and after ordering a moscow mule and sangria, i was pretty much done. The alcohol content of both drinks were alot and i am a frequent drinker so for me to be drunk after 2 drinks trust me when i tell you you're getting your moneys worth here. I glazed over their food menu but didn't see anything appetizing unfortunately. It was also pretty pricy for appetizers that could honestly be found anywhere for half the price listed. But if you're in the area this place is definitely the spot for a solid happy hour pregame even on a random weekday",2,1,1
13,Lissette C.,"New York, NY",842,105,42,3.0,1/8/2018,"This used to be a great casual meet up spot for us, until I got sick. I was only drinking wine -- which we weren't sure if it was truly thick and funky or just our taste buds playing a trick -- and it was not a good night. However, if you stay away from the wine...it's a nice intimate spot. There were a lot of couples here probably on a rather casual date where the drinks were cheap for the East Village location and the dimly lit environment.",,,
14,Elizabeth K.,"New York, NY",297,141,53,5.0,11/19/2017,"Was looking for a solid weekend happy hour in the East Village and man, did I hit the jackpot with this place. Any place that is endorsed by Ruggy (yelp elite favorite) is a place I need to check out!Walked in at 5 pm on a rainy Saturday and it was surprisingly busy. Some friends and I grabbed some bar stools and ordered from the happy hour. The happy hour is buy 1 get 1 and you can order beer, wine or cocktails. Which is a-hmaaazing. I decided on the apricot wheat beer and got the peak organic pale as my second round.The cocktails were quite popular I must say too. Pretty much everyone was ordering off the cocktail menu. Ended up getting two beers for 8 bucks and happy hour runs until 8 pm. By about 7 pm, the place was packed and people were standing. The back had quite a few nice tables that would be nice for a date but it's a teensy bit too loud if it's a first or second date :) Atmosphere is super cute, candles everywhere and dim.Lastly, the music was on POINT. Out of all the bars in the EV I went that evening, this music was my favorite. Bartender was super nice and I would definitely come back.",1,,

Updated review","After 5 years of coming to this place, BOGO happy hour is still going strong. Drinks are still on point. Ambiance is still the same as when I first found out about this place. I've never gotten food here so I can't comment on that. Drinks on drinks on drink? Why not?This place is great for almost ANY occasion. Leave your baby at home.FAN, still.",6,2,3
17,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,120,201,4.0,11/25/2017,This place has a good vibe to it. It has a dark/low-key vibe to it. There is good music playing in the background; loud bright to hear but not too loud that you can't have convos with people. I went here for dinner & happy hour drinks on a Saturday. The chips & guacamole was was tasty and I had the pasty with spicy sausage as an entree. It was both delicious and fulfilling at the same time. I would defiantly recommend gettin it. I came here for the '2-for-1s' drinks happy hour. I had the bourbon& ginger beer drinks all night and it was pretty good. Could of been stronger but was tasty nevertheless. This is a solid spot to come to if you want a quick drink & meal before going to the next destination for your night out.,,,
18,Jeniffer R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",23,6,0,5.0,8/19/2018,"Always, always, always a spot to go to. They not only have a great happy hour deal from NOON to 8pm, but the cocktails are actually incredible. My favorite is the caipirinha and if you're hungry, the pork sliders will make you fall in love.",,,
19,Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",488,372,1050,3.0,4/7/2018,"Bar hopped and decided to try this place. First off it was superrrrrrrr packed. We were lucky to find seats for 4 people by the bar. My friends ordered the jalapeño margarita and I ordered the gimlet. I liked it and it was a bit strong. The jalapeño margaritas were so good that my friends ordered so many that eventually a couple hours later they ran out. I guess that's the best drink on the menu who knows. The bartender was a jerk off. Definitely needs to work on his customer service. We ordered 3 drinks and the guy gave us 5. We tried to tell him that we only wanted 3 and didn't want to be charged and he totally gave us an attitude. He was probably drinking during the job, I wouldn't be surprised.....",1,,
20,Courtney T.,"New York, NY",192,62,22,3.0,11/1/2017,"I've been here a couple of times. They offer a good deal for happy hour, but they're cocktails are lacking in quality and strength. I would only go if I was planning on drinking wine. Their happy hour deal is buy-one-get-one. The best qualities about their happy hour are 1. You mix and match you BOGO & 2. It goes until 8PM. I have not tried any food here, last time we tried to order they were out of the items we were interested in ordering.",,,
21,Tiffany W.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,164,229,4.0,10/9/2017,"Came here with a group of coworkers for happy hour. Cute little place, nice atmosphere with delicious drinks. My one complaint is it took forever to get the check. Our waiter passed by us a million times, we flagged him down nicely then were a little more aggressive and we were still asked to wait.Finally got our tab and left. I'd definitely come back, but would ask for the check well before we're ready to leave.",,,

The hostess approached me and stated I was at the wrong establishment because ""it's not Hanoi House, this is Ten Degrees"". The only reason she would say such a statement is because I was Asian. The rest of the bar staff were friendly and attentive. However, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.",,,
24,Kia A.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",1,203,1043,5.0,3/4/2018,"I've been here twice and this review is super late! First time was December 16, 2016 for a pre bday celebration with friends. This place was chosen because of its Happy Hour two for one deal- which is amazing and not subject to well drinks. I had multiple mojitos and my friends tried a bunch of different drinks which we all were satisfied with. We also ordered food which was so yummy! We had sliders, and crostina santorini. We left happily a bit after 8pm when happy hour was done. The next time I came here it was in the summer of 2017 on a Friday - can't remember the exact date. I had a blueberry mojito which was great! The alcohol was not cheap and I had an appropriate buzz from it. I had the guacamole and chips which was good. If you read my posts you will know I'm a Guac snob so if I say it's good it is!! The waitstaff was very nice on both visits which rates very higher with me. The DJ was great on both visits as well which always gets high marks in my book!! I will definitely return to this place in the future! The neighborhood is super cute and their is an ice cream place in the vicinity I want to try! What's better than being responsible by eating and drinking then getting some dessert?!",,,

26,Mitch E.,"Brooklyn, NY",836,1027,445,1.0,4/18/2017,"What a disaster this place is. I won't review a place I've never been, but after coming here, I have to get my experience before and my experience after off of my chest. I had reached out to the establishment about their backroom for a party. After a slow reply we began a good dialogue. I explained I could promise a certain number of people. They told me my numbers were good, and that if I didn't have a certain number by a certain time I would have to pay a large fee. Now there is nothing wrong with that. That's normal, and something I've done before. I expressed the price was a little steep, but I would be willing to do it. I just couldn't promise the exact number by an exact time. People run late, they're coming from dinner or a show. So I inquired as to whether or not they'd hold me to it if my numbers showed up a little bit later. Not even saying they wouldn't show up by their exact time, but I wouldn't want to be in the hole if two people ended up showing up 15 minutes later. Every other time I've been in discussion with a venue about something along those lines, they've said no problem. That they weren't looking to nickel and dime me. This is where things get weird. They start replying slowly again. Being vague and not answering my questions. So I reach out again, once I have a better idea. Let them know I have a better idea of things. Now they raise the prices on me. But don't worry, the front couch is available for me, for free. Seemed a bit odd, so I told him I'd get back to him. Reached out again and once again the prices went up and the front couch now costs money. It was very disheartening. I felt like I was getting taken advantage of. Figured I wouldn't go there. And as a result I wouldn't leave a review. However my friend had his birthday there. Nothing planned set or organized. On a Saturday afternoon. Just strolled in. Sure enough, we had those oh so special front couches. They weren't difficult to snatch. The place was packed though. Awful crowd. Loud and obnoxious. Unless you like that type of thing. The funniest part, a friend of my friend said he had his party there in the back. That he organized it through the owners and didn't deal with anything like I dealt with. At a much cheaper quote as well. Anything for an extra buck I guess.",4,2,2
27,Lisa R.,"Queens, NY",446,214,335,4.0,9/19/2016,"Love love Ten Degrees Bar, it's one of those hidden gems that you go to 2 years later and it still has the same vibe. I first came here after walking around the area after a Saturday brunch back in Summer 2014 and noticed they had a 2 for 1 here until 8pm. We walked in and was welcomed with some old school Hip Hop & R&B. I came again this past Saturday and they still had the same 2 for 1 and 90's Hip Hop.The party of 13 that I was with enjoyed themselves and mentioned they never heard of this spot but will come back. They have a back room near the restrooms that you can reserve for a private party, I didn't get to try anything on their food menu but everything I saw that came out from the kitchen looked delish, I will have to come back again and try their food with my 2 for 1 cocktails. The décor and ambience is very Williamsburg, Brooklyn hipster-ish, the customer service is great. Bartenders know their beer & wine list to perfection and if you have a favorite they will recommend something similar from their very extensive menu, come in and enjoy a few drinks before you go out in town.",4,2,4

Moscow Mule $12.00 - Ketel One Vodka with ginger beer on the rocks.  I absolutely LOVE this drink as it was not entirely too strong but subtle.Saint Germain cocktail $7.00- Saint Germain Elderflower Liqueur, vodka, gin, champagne float with lime juice on the rocks.  Too strong for the mixture of vodka and gin were intoxicating combined.Butttermilk Blue Affinee- Wisconsin cow's milk $7.50.  The creamiest and strongest blue cheese served on a large cheese board with un-toasted sliced baguette, hummus, jam spread, dark prosciutto, fresh raspberry and blueberry.  The hummus was insufficient for the large amount of sliced baguette provided.  Unfortunately, there is no Brie cheese  available- my ultimate favorite, timeless tranquil classic.What is the temperature?

A rarity even in Manhattan.This place seems to be known as a bar that focuses on a wine, but I didn't think the list was incredibly impressive. They did have some options though, but I'd expect a few more nicer bottles from a wine list.The atmosphere is very loud, dark, and crowded. The darkness makes it difficult to actually enjoy the wine. Maybe it is best to come during the day.I do like their happy hour specials though I have never made it for happy hour.

And, the staff aren't friendly (except the bouncer was nice). There was one waitress tonight who was especially rude.

Updated review","10 DegreesWhenever I'm on St. Mark's, but especially in my younger days, I would love to make a special stop at this bar for at least two drinks. Their two for one happy hour mandates you to at least two, but it usually winds up being more than two, always an even number. Their spicy margaritas on the rocks are great but don't count out their wine list. They have a great variety of reds, whites, sparklings and rosès. The table and bar service is the perfect blend of capable and friendly while distant enough you can converse, chill etc. They have a little menu, charcuterie plates etc. I think what I love most is the back room which is semi-private, great for dates, groups of friends or even waiting for someone having a cocktail solo. The room also has its own restroom and you can kind of escape the business of the outside part.Tl; dr: come here on a date, or with friends during happy hour and head to the back room. You'll fall in love",2,1,1

They honor the offer- no catch! Affordable drinks and cocktails. Cocktails are $10-12 which is very reasonable for Manhattan. Went on a Thursday evening ~7pm and it was pretty packed all night. We had a reservation for the couch area and the server was efficient, attentive and polite (we had a pretty big group of 20 and she served all of us as quickly as she could manage!). They have a good variety of drinks- cocktails, wine, sangria, beer. Atmosphere was nice but the only drawback was that it was really loud in there.They also have a private room area in the back for booking- visit their website for booking details. This is definitely a great place to have a private event for a reasonable price!

I came with a group of 5 other girls on a Thursday at around 6pm and it was easy to get seats in the back. By the time we left, around 8, the place had gotten fairly packed. Drinks I've gotten here were the old fashioned, gimlet, Moscow mule, and st germaine cocktail. I absolutely love how these drinks are not overly sweet. You'd expect a Moscow mule to be sweet but theirs is more tangy and refreshing which is right up my alley. Important thing to note is that the happy hour 2 for 1 deal is PER PERSON, meaning two drink minimum. All the drinks are about $12-14, though, so it's a good deal no matter what. Also tried the crostinis and mushroom pasta here - unexpectedly yummy! Ten degrees is definitely one of my favorite happy hour places in the city and I'll definitely be returning again and again.",1,,

He told her she couldn't get in, fine that's okay your establishment has rules. But as ladies we were joking with him and was saying we promise she is the same age as us he say that we are in our late 20's  early 30's. He then says something can happen and she added a comment saying she use to live in NYC for 6 years and nothing happened, he then says with a serious face to her the twin towers were up for a long time till something happened.... really... you found the need to bring up 9/11 because someone forgot their ID? Not cool and kind of sad...",1,,
43,Stacey D.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,78,5,1.0,9/14/2017,"My review is mainly for the private room in the back that you could reserve for an occasion or social gathering (must spend at least $500). I visited Ten Degrees and noticed the private back room. I decided to throw my 30th birthday (milestone) in the private room. I spoke with the rep, Moti, to reserve and finalize things for my party. I was told that I could bring a DJ. The day before or a few days before I inquired about the DJ set up and the speakers. I was told that about the DJ set up and that the speakers were perfect (my DJ had their own speakers they could of brought to the event). My friends and the DJ show up to set up and as soon as the DJ set up the entire back room loses power. They regain power and the DJ finished setting up and the speakers are SHOT. There was no manager on site to assist. And, I must admit that the waitress(es) tried their best to rectify the situation but they were also slightly dropping the ball left and right. The private room also was extremely hot; clearly not for summer events. I sent the venue an email to voice my issues and their response was ""I am not sure what went wrong between our system and your DJ."" EXCUSE ME! My DJ was fine. In fact, the waitress apologized the night of and informed me that the speakers blew the night before and there was no way to fix them. A heads up would have been great since they knew I was bringing a DJ.There were other small mishaps including the hot room that I overlooked. However, the DJ mishaps made me the most furious because not only could this have been avoided if they informed me of the speakers because my DJ could of brought their own. But, moreover, because DJs are not cheap so I basically lost hundreds of dollars that I spent on a DJ that could not perform due to the venue. In addition, they did nothing after I emailed them to complain other than try and deflect. Extremely unprofessional. I was going to throw my best friend's birthday there as well, but no thanks.",1,,
44,Mala L.,"Long Island, NY",510,313,1261,4.0,2/16/2016,"Randomly came here Saturday around 4:30pm to kill some time between brunch and another bar that we were planning to go to.I loved the whole set up and vibe. Classy but not pretentious, low key but still poppin - especially for the time that we went. There's a good amount of seating and the bar was filled to capacity. I would come back for the atmosphere alone.For drinks we had the jalapeno infused margarita and the red sangria. I loved the margarita but the sangria was undrinkable in my opinion.Once we got a table, we ordered a meat and cheese board - jamon serrano, prosciutto di parma, marieke golden gouda, and the santa teresa sheep's milk. Everything was delicious and the portion was HUGE. They also gave us a LOT of bread which was unusual but much much appreciated. We devoured it. HOWEVER, I'm pretty certain that they gave us two portions of serrano and no prosciutto... I didn't bring it to our server's attention because she was very hard to reach and I personally like serrano a lot more (less salty, more gamey than prosciutto). The mishap didn't bother me but I can see it bothering others.Would definitely return next time I'm in the area.",4,2,3

46,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,43,16,4.0,10/30/2017,"One of the best happy hours in town! Happy hour runs every day from 12-8pm and you get 2 for 1, which includes cocktails, beer, wine, and if I'm not mistaken, even bottles of wine. It's a nice size space and the few times I've been in, they've been playing awesome music. They have a wide variety of cocktails and a ton of choices for wine, which is nice. As for food, I've only ever ordered the chips and guac, but it was a big portion and they brought us a second huge plate of chips free of charge. The only reason I'm knocking off one star is because the service is a bit slow. I was recently in on a rainy weekend and my friend and I were the only people in the entire bar for most of the afternoon. Even though we were very clearly done with our drinks, it took forever to get the bartenders attention for the next round. This happened several times. But, hey, it kind of forced us to pace ourselves :)",,,
47,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",335,287,1018,4.0,11/30/2016,"If you have never stumbled into 10 Degrees before, you might want to rethink your path through the neighborhood.  This place gets more full than your belly after your third serving of Thanksgiving stuffing, but when 2-for-1 on **any** drink is up for grabs, you expect it. Just suck it up and suck down your drink.  This includes beer, specialty cocktails AND pours of straight liquor so wiggle into a seat (if you can) and hunker down for a few rounds.  It is well worth it. Plus, the 2-4-1 is all week long (12-8) so if you prefer an earlier Saturday to avoid the crowds, then do it up! The food is also pretty delicious. I enjoyed the guac as a table starter.  Their sliders are delicious and perfect belly padding for the alcohol you've been pouring down your gullet. There is table service if you've been lucky enough to snag a seat but sometimes when the place is particularly packed, you may have a hard time grabbing a server.  Ours was pretty amazing the last time we were there.

50,Samantha S.,"Westerleigh, Staten Island, NY",5,18,11,5.0,1/31/2017,"OK so this place was absolutely PERFECT for my cousin's 24th Birthday this past Sunday night. I just wanted a place where us girls (18 of us to be exact) could have some fun. Thanks to Yelp I stumbled upon this place and it was more than I could have ever expected.I e-mailed the bar and within a half an hour I got a response from Moti! He sent me options for reserving the front couch area and having a cocktail party or a private party in the back. He supplied food and drink menus. And this place does 2-for-1 drink specials on ANY drink from 3-8pm. Everyday. (can I get an amen?!) For a spot in the East Village. I immediately told him I wanted the front couch area and I began planning my food menu. He basically told me to pick as many platters as my budget allowed using $10 per person as a rule of thumb. We chose: AVOCADO TOAST (the real MVP of the night, TOMATO & MOZZARELLA CAPRESE BITES, PANINO di PARMA, FRENCH GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES && HICKORY PULLED PORK SLIDERS. Food was great and perfect for everyone to pick throughout the night.Oh I forgot to mention they gave us the BACK ROOM where we were able to decorate, bring balloons and just have an absolute blast. We also were given the CHAMPAGNE TOAST where each girl got a glass of champagne as she arrived and also some CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES.  B*tches love choc covered fruit!!! Our waitress LAURA was an absolute gem. She was so attentive and was able to deal with everyone starting their own tabs and just being on point all night. Super patient and super efficient. Moti was great, I probably drove him nuts all week asking for balloon & bakery referrals but he was so amazingly helpful. It's a shame they don't do dessert there but the cupcakes I ordered from BUTTER LANE were an absolute hit. I swear this was the best time ever. Omg I forgot to touch on the MUSIC!!! Totally fun, totally perfect for a girls night out. It was mainly early 2000 hits. Loved. Every. Minute.Have your next party here!!!",2,,

They have a reasonably good selection as well. Also cocktails. And good beers.But if you want to move, or sit down without people spilling drinks or knocking into you, probably not your place.I will definitely commend our waitress for traversing the huddling masses and making sure we had all of our drink orders filled.

I usually get the Tom Collins - most of the drinks are good & because they are 2 for 1 you can try a few without breaking the bank. One of the main reasons I come here though is for the charcuterie & cheese boards! I usually do 3 meats & 3 cheeses which comes in bread, dried fruits, nuts!

And unlike many bars with happy hour specials, almost their whole menu is included in the deals rather than just well drinks. The deal only works per person though, so don't expect to get one drink and let a friend smooch off the free one...you're gonna be double fisting 2 drinks to finish on your own lolMy friend and I originally came here thinking there would be some bar munchies to snack on, but we didn't see any food items on the menu at the time.

(You can't split with someone though, you have to drink two drinks per person.) They have a pretty good assortment of cocktails, and they can probably make whatever else you want that's not on the menu. I got the Moscow mule and strawberry mojito, which were both good and pretty strong. The place is not very big, but they crowd as much seating as possible in there. On the Thursday night it was lively and crowded, and we were lucky enough to find two seats at the bar. Overall, we had a great experience, place is fun, atmosphere is good, cocktails and prices are good (around $11 each), so very good if you make the happy hour special. A lot of people seemed to be ordering appetizers too, so will definitely try that next time.

But the servers there very politely asked for them to move so we can have more room.The decor is pretty nice here, a perfect place to grab a drink with a friend because it isn't terribly packed. The music isn't obnoxiously loud and you're able to actually hear those around you, which is appreciated since our event was more of the mingling kind. It was a beautiful day so the windows at the front were open, giving us a very welcomed breeze. Happy Hour deal is pretty good.

The cocktails are weak and always leave me wanting something more. The glasses of wine aren't quite adequate pours. It's always a challenge to get a seat, and the volume is so loud it's hard to hear whomever you're with. The one time I attempted to order food, they did not have either options I wanted.Not a bad choice if you're interested in a late happy hour, but recommend going across the street instead.",1,,

Not only do they have beer and wine at 2-for-1, their entire cocktail list was 2-for-1 as well! This is very uncommon anywhere! Therefore, deserving of 5 stars!We were a group of 7 and arrived around 5pm on a Thursday. We were able to sit at the large table by the entrance/window. It was cozy. The place is fancier than what I expected, looks like a classy wine bar. Food was affordable. I highly recommend the Steak Sliders 5 for $20. My boyfriend and I loved them! Sooo delish!

70,Nancy H.,"New York, NY",231,814,2139,3.0,5/11/2016,"For the 2-4-1 deal (12-8PM) stick with the wine, shots, or jalapenyo margarita. You pay for the higher priced drink so stick with drinks in the same general price tag to get the bang for your buck.I had the French 75 and it tasted like a lemon drop, probably the same goes for the lemon martini that they have on the list. Based on so many other Yelp reviews and my own experience, the sangria, caipirinha, and mixed drinks are a no go. I saw the bartender make the sangria and she barely poured any liquor into each vase, it was probably all filler anyways.You can't go wrong with any of the wines because it's so subjective, but ask to taste the wine first because you might get wine tasting a little off. The rioja is a popular pick, it also has the longest description on the menu...I didn't have any food there but charcuterie and grilled cheese are the big things on the menu. Kitchen opens at 3:00PM3:00PM Tuesday and the front bar area was packed already. The U-shaped bar is a great way to seat a lot of people. Good music.

We were able to turn off the music in the back to play our game and then turn it back on for drinking and dancing towards the end of the night. It was really nice that there was a Christmas tree in the back making the area also festive for Christmas time. Apologies that I cannot remember the name of our waitress but she was so attentive and accommodating! She even cut up my cake and handed it out for me. The food was also actually really good. Party platters were bigger than I expected too, which was great, but I felt like I ordered too much food for everyone. The waitress let me cancel my last order, which was so helpful as there was already so much leftover food.

They have such a wide selection too, from wines to fancy cocktails, so what a deal.Because of their fantastic happy hour special, expect the place to be PACKED. The first time coming here, my friend and I had to leave because their was no where to sit. It's a long space, so it's hard to move around with a ton of people their for happy hour. I went back again with that same friend, and even though we missed happy hour, we at least got a table. PRO: Great happy hour special. Probably the best in East Village. Loved the atmosphere of this place, very intimate and cozy with candle lighting. They had a pretty great selection of wines, cocktails, and liquor drinks. A little on the pricey side, but if you're able to make happy hour, you'll get a fantastic deal.CON: The place was so packed, it was hard to even move. Even when my friend and I were able to get a table, It was very loud that we felt like we had to yell over everyone else just to have a conversation.

Ten Degrees has great bartenders, cheaper (and stronger) than usual drinks given the neighborhood, and a pretty welcoming atmosphere. You can't go wrong here. I've only had the food here twice, but it was good. The meat board and pasta were alright. Good luck getting a table or a seat at the bar though.

I love that they have the 2 for 1 deal from 12 pm - 8 pm everyday. The deal goes for all drinks so whether you're feeling classy with your pinot or sassy with your vodka soda you can have it your way. Being a lover of cheese plates, I also was pleased to see that they had an amazing selection of cheeses. I have been here for happy hour and late night, both being a great time. Check it out!",,,
90,Lincy J.,"Williamsburg, NY",299,84,167,4.0,12/7/2015,"Ten Degrees is a frequent stop for drinks with my friends. They have decent HH special- two for one drinks. The drinks can be pretty pricey otherwise, ranging from 10-13 dollars for cocktails and 32 for a bottle of wine. So the HH deal is really the best way to make it worth it. They have a back room that's a little more private, which can also be booked for parties. The staff is very friendly and helpful, but the servers can be a little slow at times- probably to delay people from drinking too much.Usually the drinks are really good, however, last night my first drink was awful. I ordered a margarita and it was so sour and gross, I took one sip and had it sent back. It literally taste like I was sucking on a full lemon. The second one was a bit better so I was fine with that. The bathroom was another issue. It was so gross I debated holding it until i got home. There was pee all over the floor and seat and paper towels EVERYWHERE.They should really try to maintain some cleanliness here. Considering it was only 7:30 pm on a Sunday, you can imagine how it gets during busier times. Those two issues aside from last night, I like this place and find it to be a consistent spot for hanging out with friends and having a good time!P.S. The music is always WAY TOO LOUD. Please consider turning it down so people don't have to shout so much.",2,,

Place was very dark and loud but overall very chill; great place to pre-game if you're into that. In NYC where all the drinks are expensive AF, I was amazed at their Two for One drink special -- 2 Old Fashioned's poured with Maker's Mark for $12? Can't beat that anywhere. Granted it isn't the best but at least they don't use Evan Williams for the cheapest. Also, loved the waitress. So friendly and accommodating when our group wanted to switch tables.

Ordered a Moscow mule and an old fashioned, which came out tasting like a bad gin and tonic and watery rubbing alcohol, respectively.  We asked our waitress if they could be remade, and she was friendly about replacing our drinks, but seemed like she got similar complaints/requests a lot. She defended the bar tender, saying it's his ""style"" and that the ginger beer was ""light"" and that's why the Moscow mule tasted different than expected.  We ended up replacing the drinks with a vodka gimlet and Manhattan, which were ok, but still not good.  I can drink pretty much anything, but these drinks were BAD.  Will not go back.  Only reason it's getting two starts is the comfy couches in the back and the understanding waitress.",1,,

Also, they charge you first full price prior to the second. Technically it's buy one get one. A lot of people get the wine. It is a good selection of wine, but I've never been pleased with my choice.

My friend did not like her red sangria. I ordered a raspberry caipirinha. It was not mixed well and all the raspberry puree stayed at the bottom of the glass.We decided to move on to mojitos. ""Who can put a mojito on the drink list just to screw it up"" - we thought. Worst mojitos that we have ever had in our lives. I've never had the issue of a strong drink being undrinkable, but that was really the case here. Avoid it. It tasted so bad! It tasted like a cleaning product. I guess it's a good deal for most people, with 2-for-1 drinks till 8 pm.  I guess there are better options on the long menu. I guess you also need to order the right drink and sit at the bar for happy hour. There are too many variables and this place is definitely a no for me. Definitely avoid the sangria, caipirinhas and the nasty mojito. I hope you have a better experience than I did - if you decide to go.",4,4,2

Strong speakeasy style drinks at a price that cannot be beat in the city. It's hard to find a good strong drink during HH in any city much less NYC but this place is awesome.It has a wine bar type feel. Light modern rock playing in the background. The music selection that afternoon was kinda depressing - think Adele. Still, A great place to have a conversation. There were a few people here already but we had our choice of seats.  It has some windows so you don't feel like you're in a cave which I like.I would come back.",2,1,2

Updated review","Came here on Halloween night, right before Happy Hour ended and my friends and I took over the front area by the entrance (as we've done many times before). Service was friendly and attentive, clientele was fun and jubilant and good times were had by all!The check situation here was much, MUCH smoother than the last time I was here when Sir Douche-a-lot was bartending (who according to my Yelp correspondence with the manager, no longer works here).We all had a great time and as a result, Ten Degrees is back on my ""yay! I really like this place"" list! Cheers all around! :D",5,,

I ordered a Templeton rye and the bartender gave three.  I have no idea why other than there was three of us.  He just acted like ""what I am suppose to do about it"" so I said it was fine and paid the $52 tab which is a weird $17.33 per drink.

I guess you could forego the second drink, but c'mon,  it's free. Pure genius and a great deal! I was here last Tuesday with some friends for my Birthday Happy Hour. There was a steady flow of people, great music, and drinks at this establishment. We decided to hang in the bar area rather than get a table in the back so we could interact with the other bar peeps. This place is a great place for dates too as we encountered several here on OKC first dates. When I looked at my photos from that night the next day, I noticed several photobombers in the pics. Love it!I had the skirt steak sliders which were super juicy and flavorful. I had a few margaritas,  red red wine, and also a birthday cake shot (thanks Ryan).My friends and I had a great time. I found this place by scrolling through Yelp a week before and it's nice to know that everyone was right about this place...It's solid. Thanks Yelp! Ryan was at the bar and always made sure he had our second drink ready right as we were finishing our first one. My friends and I will definitely be back.",1,,

I was there at 3pm; there was only 1 barista with 15-20 customers, and I had to literally wave at the barista's face (in a nice way) to order our drinks and food. Music turns up at around 5pm.

This place is a bit small and it took us a while to get a table big enough for us. They play their music veryyy loudly (even though there's no dance floor) so it was quite difficult to hold a conversation with anyone besides the people to your immediate sides. However, their Happy Hour deal is great! Two drinks for the price of one (~11$). I tried a few of their drinks (mostly gin based) and they were all pretty good. Did not disappoint and they were strong. We also ordered chips and guac for the table which was good.I definitely recommend this place (if you're coming with a small group).",1,,

The major qualm I have with this bar is how loud the music was when I was here.

During the summer they open up the entire front section so it feels like you're outside and you get great lighting. The lounge area has a super cool laid back luxury vibe. The jalapeño cocktail is fire! Only downside is it is kind of small. If you're looking to bring a huge group for a dancing/club vibe, this is not your destination. Otherwise, highly recommend.",3,,

They also have a buy one, get one deal for pitchers of sangria. I've never heard of a happy hour deal that great! I was drinking margaritas and they were really good. They were pretty strong, which I liked because often times margaritas aren't that strong. My friends drank rose sangria and they really liked it. We ordered the chips and guacamole and two paninis. The food was ok. The panini bread was a little bit too toasted. The bar had a back room that wasn't crowded. We took it over with about 12 people. They had a server attend to us.

113,Chuck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",620,332,2371,4.0,1/23/2015,"Being one of my favorite bar hopping parts of town, I thought I knew all the best happy hour spots in Alphabet City. When my friends told me to meet up at Ten Degrees Bar (not Ten Degrees bistro, their sister restaurant around the corner), I was shocked to find how close it was to places I've been going for a long time. I was even more surprised that this place was so well established/known; I had somehow missed the memo, and never heard of the place. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was the large u shaped bar and low profile lounge seating. This place has a seriously laid back feel that is great for a group of old friends, or a date. We took up residence in the couches / footstool seating in the front, adjacent to a large street facing window (great for watching the frenzied world that is Alphabet City on a drinking night go round). Our server quickly greeted us, and shared the amazing news that EVERYTHING in the bar was buy one get one until eight. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of buy one get one bars in the city (heck, Key Bar is right around the corner), but this place is different. It's hard to find a place that has a happy hour with such a well-rounded (I'm almost tempted to say ""grown up"") menu. I love a good dive bar, and getting a buy back on PBR is great, but it's awesome to find a spot that does the same thing with really good scotch (their scotch menu is extensive and comprehensive - you want a Macallan? Great, will that be a 10, 12, or 15), craft mix drinks, and more (beer, well drinks, wine/wine on tap, etc.). Being linked to Ten Degrees Bistro, the bar has access to their kitchen - they make fantastic use of it. The menu is full of perfect bar food; we had a cheese plate that was tasty (mixed cheeses, dried meats and bread), and steak sliders topped with spicy chipotle mayo that were phenomenal - again the theme here is upscale but not overly expensive (I think we got around 10 sliders for 20$).  If I had any criticism at all, it's that when it got busy (this place gets packed), the service slowed down considerably; they should consider a second server (we had the same lady all night - she was super friendly, but seemed a bit overwhelmed). When you combine the great happy hour, awesome food, extensive drink menu, and intimate atmosphere you end up with one of the best happy hour spots in the city; you'll absolutely find me here with scotch in hand again soon.",33,32,32

Updated review","I have to say, I'm seeing a lot of complaints on monetary issues with this place. And I will admit so far, the 2 times that I have been here there was a pretty huge issue with the bill. The first time I was with a larger group of girlfriends and we split 2 2 for 1 pitchers of sangria. Which should come out to $60 plus tax and tip. Our bill was way over $90. I ended up paying twice the amount I should have. The second time I came here last night I ended up getting 1 2 for 1 pitcher of sangria split amongst three people. Our bill came out to $50 not including tax and tip. And not only that problem occurred but when we were figuring out our bill and collecting change the bartender yelled at us for not tipping him completely when we hadn't even finished paying. Such a lack of respect and such complete horse shit. Not coming back to this place ever again.*Additional Note: The Manager graciously noticed the mix up with the billing of our evening last week here. There was only one additional drink added on perhaps in a mix up with people we were with. But it isn't the end of the world. The only true complaints of the night I would say were with the service of the bartender. I will however stand by firmly with being over-charged my first time being here.",8,4,5

This place is absolutely lovely, really chill ambiance, and the cool layout maximizes seating space. The drinks were strong, and tasty. You pay for the more expensive drink, so pick drinks that are around the same price to get the best value. I loved the raspberry margarita, it was more tart than sweet. skirt steak sliders were juicy, and tender, the addition of the goat cheese & caramelized onions was a delicious balance. grilled cheese was a perfect mix of sweet, salty, creamy, & dense. service was a little below average, snooty, gorgeous waitresses who seemed a little annoyed to be asked questions, so one star off there but definitely not deterrent enough to keep me from coming back, and the food & drinks came very fast after ordering.

Highly highly recommend if you're looking for a party space that is convenient, private and affordable. It may seem out of the ordinary to host such an event at a bar, but we were able to transform the private room and had an amazing time. There was a minimum attached to the room and we were able to pick the menu as well as drinks and were able to take advantage of the 2-4-1 deal. I did my research and there was no other place with such a great deal! The food was actually pretty good and the sangria was great. The hostesses were magnificent and got us everything we needed. So accommodating and even placed our cupcakes that we brought from outside onto silver trays. They passed the finger foods and served the drinks. I will note - the party platters serve more 2-3 people, so order extra food. We didn't have enough food, but we did have a great time. Highly recommend for any party you're looking to have - the space can hold about 40 standing, 20-25 comfortably sitting/standing. Service was phenomenal - from setting the menu to the actual event day, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Will definitely be coming back here to host more parties in the future.",4,1,1

WANT.1 kale and chickpea salad, 2 people, 3-selection cheese board big enough for 3 or more peeps, and 4 drinks, came to about $61 before tip. Pretty sweet deal in NYC.For cheeses, our 3 included the blue that was on the menu, a mild and soft sheep's milk, and a firm goat's milk.  Sorry I don't have the exact names. I enjoyed pairing the milder cheeses with the mustard that accompanied the board.The blue cheese was amazing on its own, with tons of strains throughout.  I checked their menu on their site and it's not updated, so might have to go back soon for another HH rendezvous to snag the names of these cheeses.  They definitely don't skimp on the portions either.  The salad was drowning in dressing and needed lots of fresh cracked black pepper.  It was simple and fresh salad and the dressing was a lemon/citrus vinaigrette that was olive oil heavy.  Next time we'll tell them to go light on the dressing or have it on the side. If you want to go somewhere with a date, and not too quiet where there will be awkward silences?  Or maybe you've got a small group that wants to kick back some cocktails, wine, beer, etc. after a long day in the office.

The room is truly private, spacious (capacity 50 guests), clean, and had 2 private bathrooms (a rarity!). There are comfortable sofas, small side chairs and tables as well. The furniture could also be stored away for more guests. * Allow your own decorations. They had even brought in a lighted Christmas tree for the festivities. * Cash bar and individual tabs. * Could play your own music (to be specific, you must bring your own 3.5mm to RCA Auxiliary Cable Cord) or they hire a DJ for you. The sound is good but doesn't get too loud.* Excellent service, our server (name: EB ""American Idol"" LOL) was friendly and attentive. The owner Moti was also quick to respond to our questions and emails. * Left out carafes of water for self-service. * They provide party platters which you can order beforehand (can access on 10degreesbar.com). We didn't do this, but I enjoyed the delicious Grilled Cheese and Penne Pasta.Cons:* No dessert menu. If you bring your own cake they charge a service fee of $3/person :( Don't try to persuade them that you can bring your own cake and supplies, as they are pretty strict about this. Tips:* Room available with 25 guests minimum requirement from 7-10pm with a $700 minimum spend for this time slot or 10.30pm & on with 30 guests minimum requirement & a $1000 minimum spend. To secure the room, you only have to fill out a guarantee against cancellations or no shows as well as your minimum spend. Highly recommend for a private party! Thanks Moti and EB!",10,1,4

My only complaint is the service. Our waitress took a long time to get our order or even come back to check up on us. She was also very unfriendly and borderline rude.

For me it came out to $12 for two drinks. I got the Mojito and the Steven's margarita, which are both recommended. The drinks are pretty strong for a Happy hour. We got the pulled pork burgerettes which were okay - not worth it for the price. As for the cheese board, we got the 3 for $21 and while I can't remember what we got, it was amazingly fresh and went well with our drinks. Would definitely come back again:)",,,
127,Rakesh M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,211,11,5.0,3/18/2017,Awesome happy hour.  We had cocktails but I want to go back to try some of the wines.  Servers seemed nice as well.,,,
128,Dean W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0,4.0,6/10/2016,"Great place with great vibes. Ten Degrees is in a prime location, right in Alphabet City, and has a 2-4-1 drink policy where included drinks and mixed cocktails range between $11-$14. Strong drinks, well worth your buck. Only reason 4 and not 5 stars is because it is on the pricier side for food which isn't in too large portions.Brisket sliders are my go-to here -- if you're coming in the evening, try to come a little earlier as it does get quite packed as many people go here for the 2-4-1 special.",,,1
129,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,10/26/2015,"I've never not had a good time here. That could be my review right there. But double negatives hurt my Grammar Police roots so I'll elaborate on that. Ten Degrees Bar is just good people. Not sure if it's the layout, the music, the severs, the general ambiance or what, but this place is all things down to earth. Upon walking in, you're immediately greeted with the small bar area as well as scattered seating. Typically, this area is the most crowded so can initially be overwhelming. My advice? Wait it out. Or just embrace it and mingle! I don't find this place to be at all cliquey - the crowd is typically friendly and happy to circulate. I find that in a lot of LES/East Village bars/just bars in general, mingling can be quite difficult despite the high volume of people who come in and out because everyone is already with their designated group. I just don't get the vibe here. Proceeding to the back of the establishment, you'll find two long rows of tables lining the walls up until the private room in back. These spots are fantastic if you're looking to have a few drinks with a small group of friends. I've done this twice during happy hour (more on that below) and it's been a fantastic time. Servers come by often, drinks are a-flowin' and positive energy runneth over.Before I get to the private room, I need to do my due diligence and mention the happy hour special. As plenty of reviewers before me have mentioned, Ten Degrees does happy hour EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. THIS IS BRILLIANT. All caps over. The first time I came here was on a Saturday around 7:30. A server came over quickly to inform us that ALL drinks (okay, I lied, still some caps lock) were two-for-one. This includes beer, wine, and a comprehensive list of classic cocktails (Moscow Mules, Manhattans, Old Fashioneds, Rye and Gingers, Margaritas, Mint Juleps, etc. etc.). Happy hour (I repeat: seven days a week) ends at 8pm, so as long as you order your first drink before 8, the second drink will be free! TIP: Be sure to tell your server if you'd like something different for your second drink. If you don't, you run the risk of being brought the same thing, which seems far too boring for a novelty-seeker like me. Still, two-for-one! Lastly I just want to speak to the private room in back. Not sure what's entailed in renting it out, but it's a great time. I dropped by a friend's Halloween party here this past weekend and it was simply awesome. Okay, maybe not awe-some, but I'm a fan. The room is spacious - plenty of standing room as well as a number of comfy couches - great chatting, dancing...whatever suits your fancy. On this particular night, there was candy strewn across every table (so many chocolate noms!) and those who opted for the couch were in prime position for munching. I can only speak to this one party, but a waitress would come by fairly frequently to take drink orders here - no need to go to the bar up front. Would highly highly recommend for a medium-sized get-together.",11,3,8
130,A R.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,4/27/2017,Favourite bar in EV for happy hour and the service is pretty great - one time I went there my friend thought her drink wasn't strong enough (even though some of them are mad strong) so the bar tender came over to our table with a bottle of vodka and poured it right into her drink. The guac and chips are good too and the portions are huge. Favourite drinks are definitely the bambino and the jalapeño marg.,,,
131,Linh N.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,540,1462,5.0,3/29/2015,"The boyfriend and I have wanted to spend our night at Ten Degrees for the longest time. They have happy hour daily from 12-8pm, which is get 2 drinks for the price of 1 - that's probably the best bargain I've ever encountered. The place is very spacious; they even have a back room. The waitresses are very on-point here; they get you your drink in less than 5 minutes and it's legit. Just because it's happy hour, they don't skimp on the alcohol, just sayin'. Delicious drinks, nice vibe and the meat and cheese platter is such a bargain. So much food that can last you through the nice with endless amount of drinks. The front of the place is great for socializing with lounge chairs and seats by the bar. Further in, you get a little more intimate with couches and high stools and tables. The farthest seating in the back room is more intimate with deep red lighting. I can see why Ten Degrees get so much positive ratings, I'm definitely a fan.",1,,1
132,Eve G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",100,22,0,4.0,10/20/2017,"Came here for happy hour with a group. The happy hour deal is unbeatable, 2 for 1 drinks until 8pm. You can also mix and match cocktails so you can keep trying different drinks. The space is pretty, although it can get very crowded by the bar and there isn't a lot of room to stand. My group got a larger table in the back near the restrooms, and even though some of us had to stand, we're glad we had it since the bar area was packed. I had the St. Germain cocktail, which was delicious and strong, some of my friends had the Jalapeno margarita which they said was good. We ordered some snacks - the guacamole, brussel sprouts, grilled cheese and the crostinis. All were yummy. Our waitress was so nice and came around to check on us often even though it was busy. I would definitely recommend this place for a drink (or 4) or a date.",,,

It definitely looks like a date spot hah, but it's a nice, intimate, venue to spend with some friends. The drinks are also yummy--had the rye & ginger cocktail. Service was good and overall, one of the nicer, chill spots I saw in NYC. Apparently they have a happy hour as well from 12-8pm. Cute place! Fun music as well.",1,,

Updated review","I'm writing this update because of the owner's response to my first review. He actually reached out to me a few days after my previous review was posted, but I didn't see it until today. Clearly, I don't check my Yelp messages very often. While I have not yet been back to Ten Degrees, I will say that his response impressed me a lot. He was not accusatory (although he expressed that he would have preferred I reached out to him directly) and wanted to get to the bottom of what happened. Unfortunately my friends and I no longer have the receipts from December, but Moti's quick response is very much appreciated. He clearly cares about his patrons and is willing to try and make things right! Honestly, I will probably visit again after seeing his message.",,1,

BEST HAPPY HOUR EVER!  The staff was inviting, friendly and seemed pretty happy to be there. Our bartender was Ryan aka ""Bull Rider"" He was amazing; quick, polite, gracious and attractive!

Luckily, the room was available and was ours for a small tab minimum. The minimum is based on the number of people you expect to host - we had a $500 minimum for ~20 people. Best of all, we were offered the happy hour menu of 2 for 1 drinks! And like everyone has noted, their happy hour menu is insaneeeee(ly amazing)!We had our own private waitress who was fast and efficient in getting us our drinks. The room itself was the perfect size, with just the right amount of seating and two bathrooms.All in all, a great night. Only critique I had was that there were various patrons wandering in and plopping down on the seats in the private room. I had to kindly let them know it was a private party, which should not fall under my realm of responsbiility between making sure I say hello to all my guests and that they were happily liquored up. Would be great if the waitress or another employee could handle those awkward situations for their patrons in the future! :) Thanks Moti, for a great night!",12,1,1

There's usually a pretty good crowd despite it being a Tuesday or Wednesday. I've never been to Ten Degrees on the weekend because I'm more likely to venture to the LES, Soho or Meatpacking but I'm sure it's fun if you're into the bar scene. They have food too, which looks good, although I've never gotten it myself. The cocktails are great (I personally like The Gimlet) and the drinks are pretty strong. The crowd on a weeknight is relatively laid back and typically seems like people who live in the area. Great bar, chill vibes, cool people- awesome spot if you're in EV looking for a solid bar.",,1,
145,Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",564,2310,6588,4.0,5/21/2012,"2 for 1 drinks at happy hour from 4pm - 8pm? Say what???Of all the bar hopping I did, Ten Degrees Bar had been the most friendly to my already empty wallet.  Don't think that during happy hour you're stuck with well drinks or beer, no sireee!  You can order that $15 glass of Cab you've had your eye on, a $10 German Pilsner or one of their delicious cocktails. (most are made with top shelf alcohol too: Maker's Mark, St. Germain liqueur, etc)I wanted to get the party started since I haven't seen my friend Jenny W in 2 years. I was excited for my Caipirinha, made with cachaca, fresh lime and sugar on the rocks.  It ended up being too sugary for my taste, so I made sure to down it right away and order another drink.The Tom Collins was much better: gin, lemon, sugar and club soda. It came with a cute Maraschino cherry too!  I found myself ordering light, refreshing drinks because it was so warm out. Plus the happy, bumpy, 90's music just matched my overall mood too. The blonde bartender was pretty fast in making our cocktails, but have the Borat look alike bartender make your Tanqueray and Tonic and it's guaranteed to be STIFF! (um, pun intended?)  he was hella flexing his biceps to please the two gay guys who were totally drooling over him.  Yeah, I know he took his time in acknowledging our presence but what the heck! I enjoyed the show!  ;-)If you can't get into PDT, come hang here instead. Guaranteed fun times for sure!",14,13,10

We heard they had a 2-4-1 happy hour deal so we were super excited to try it out. We ended up ordering and it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks - we were about to be late for our reservation so we slammed both of them. When the bill came we had been charged for both drinks and were informed that the 2-4-1 deal only counts if a person orders two drinks each. what the heck! This should have definitely been explained better. Not wanting to lose that free drink, we ordered another which also took another 15 minutes despite the waitress knowing we had a reservation.

However, once we were actually here we found the place itself to be quite appealing. Ten degrees creates a personable, pleasurable ambiance which allowed us to sit, enjoy our drinks and chat away. We got there around 5pm and the place was fairly empty however, as time went on it really started becoming busy. (Candles lights were placed as soon as it started getting dark outside, which created a classy feeling). By the time we left (7:30) it was extremely packed with people sitting and enjoying each others company. Very elegant indeed! Drinks range btwn $10-$13. I had the lemon drop martini (be careful all the alcohol sits and waits for you at the bottom of the glass). Then I tried the mojito, my goodness was it strong! I had to switch it with my friend who got the campari champagne (also mouthwatering) bc it was too strong for me to handle. These were all delicious and worth coming here for hh.

We were lucky enough to steal the last 2 person table at 5:30 since they were already fairly crowded. I advise you to come early, we walked past the bar at around 7:30 the place was jam packed.We ordered a Moscow Mule and a glass of Red (generously poured). Since the happy hour is 2-4-1 you get the second round included, almost too good to be true! Both drinks were delicious. We went with the Skirt Steak Burgerettes, they look basically like sliders except with a more gastronomic kick. We also went for the 3 for $21 charcuterie board. You can pick anything from the meats, olives, and cheeses. The Jamon was exquisite, you don't usually see this as a menu option. Pretty excited to not have prosciutto for once. The Mousse Truffee (additional $2)  was amazing, my favorite part of the board. Super delicate. Lastly, we got the Cave Aged (Kaltbach) Gruyere as recommended by our waitress as a popular soft cheese. Very strong taste for a soft cheese, delicious nonetheless. The beautiful sprinkle of strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries paired lovely with the cheese. Added brightness and a perfect sweet touch to the board. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the olive oil poured over our bread, made ripping it a bit messy. Great service, our waitress seemed to be serving all the tables in the restaurant while still maintaining her attention to us whenever we needed something.

I have a high heat tolerance and it meets my expectations so if you can't handle spice, order something else. It's my favorite jalapeño margarita in NYC.Ambiance is cool, a little more upscale than the other saint marks bars. If I took people on dates (which I clearly don't), I would take them here.

163,Tiffany L.,"Spokane, WA",537,609,685,4.0,1/9/2013,"In love with this bar. If only it had better service, it'd be perfect.You can't beat their 2-for-1 Happy Hour Mon-Fri until 8PM. They have a nice selection of wines and everything is pretty affordable. The interior is romantic and dimly-lit, perfect for a date or to unwind after a particularly brutal day at work. Besides bar seating, there's some small tables and couches, as well as a private room towards the back.The wine bottles aligning the walls and flickering candlelight provide great ambiance. Their cocktails steer more towards the classics and are quite strong. French 75 was an excellent champagne cocktail and my favorite was The Montparnasse. Apple brandy, lemon juice, St. Germain and Sauvignon Blanc. They also have a nice beer list with even some local goodies. Try the River Horse which stems from Lambertville, NJ (yes, surprisingly, good beer can come from NJ) or the Ithaca Apricot Wheat.They also serve food -- mostly tapas, small plates, cheese and chocolates. Very vegetarian-centric.Our service was okay but our waitress seemed to be the human version of Grumpy Cat and immune to cracking a smile. When the service was slow she did apologize for the wait, however. She was the only waitress taking care of a very crowded bar, so I guess I'd be grumpy, too.",,,

Once I was able to find the venue (thanks Yelp!), the entire experience was very smooth. Moti, the owner, whom I'm sorry to say I didn't get to meet in person, was very professional and accommodating. He made himself available and was able to quickly answer all of our questions via email.We were able to go to the room early to decorate and set up the desserts. They made sure we were comfortable and happy with the setup of the room. The lights were brightened a little at our request and volume of the music was adjusted.They gave us one server to handle all of our drink and food orders. Amazingly, she managed to remember everyone's orders even though there must have been over a dozen credit card tabs and we were all circulating around the room.  We had no trouble meeting our minimum on the group tab so this was a wonderfully affordable party as well. The 2 for 1 happy hour applies to parties too (if you're within those hours). The drinks were good and strong. Some people ordered food and were happy with their dishes. Us organizers were pleased with the party and most important of all, our friend was happy. Thanks Ten Degrees for making this a memorable occasion for her!",4,1,3

It's my go to place to take friends to have good conversations. It can be pretty loud but when you sit in the back that somehow doesn't matter. The loud crowds of teeny boppers in the front can be deceiving. There's actually a lot of back room if you can push through. My favorite thing about this place is its amazing two for one happy hour special. Whatever you get, whether it's a cocktail or a bottle of wine, every day from 12 - 8, you get another one free! It's not just on weekdays...Saturday too. The cheese plates are affordable and great. The best cheeses are offered and most of the time available.

(And he wasn't that good-looking.) We ordered our GOLDSTAR ISRAELI BEER-- nice, easy to drink--, and a cheese plate or something. (THERE IS NO HOT/PREPARED FOOD (except sliders) AFTER 9PM!) It was clearly going to be a ""one drink and we're outta here"" night. But then we discovered THE BACK ROOM. Our waitress told us that one of the two tables there was becoming free, the current occupants were ""just paying their bill, but dawdling a bit."" Doc walked into the room and shot them dead. We pulled the bodies onto the street and MOVED TO THE BACK ROOM. It was quiet bliss. We could talk, have a feeling of luxury, and enjoy several servings of sliders and cheese. The bill came to about $40 each. A bit pricey, but not bad for the (eventual) ambience.   --Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers, a different bar every week",1,2,
167,Hannah K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,23,25,4.0,6/29/2015,What can I say.. You can't really ever go wrong with a 2-for-1 deal for happy hour. Especially if it applies to everything and anything. (Including bottles of wine) like whaaa?The staff here are all attentive and friendly as well. It gets packed so either get there early or wait cause it's worth it.,3,,

Updated review","Great music, perfect lighting and great drinks. I've been here more than a couple times for their 2/1 drink specials. The mojitos  are awesome and would totally recommend them. Happy hour is from 12-8 but get there early because the place gets packed. Usually I go here for drinks first and then head out in the east village for dinner. There's a ton of awesome places around the corner to grab a bite.",,,
169,A. J.,"New York, NY",97,83,23,4.0,8/11/2015,"I recently discovered one of the best happy hours in the EV: buy one drink, get one free! The place has great music and great vibes.  I think this could be one of my favorite spots for the area.  The bartenders come swiftly and are thoughtful and easy going.  I really appreciate the bartender Tayla, who recommended the best white wine when then one I wanted was out.  She goes out of her way to make sure you are doing well. Definitely check her and the team out.  It's worth more than just 2-4-1.",2,,
170,Mendy Y.,"Austin, TX",547,534,421,4.0,8/21/2015,"This place can get VERY crowded, especially during Happy Hour. Drinks are solid though and they make sure you drink your fill: during happy hour, they have 2-4-1 deals, which means you pay for your first two drinks of choice (note that the drinks are the same), but then get the next two (also the same drink) free. So choose wisely, drink up, and have a good time!",1,1,1

172,Dana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,72,17,2.0,11/24/2016,"I only gave it two stars because the customer service is really bad. Well our waitress with the long brown hair was anyway. We came here on Friday 11/18/2016 at 5:45pm. We expected 4 people to be in our group but only two of us had arrived. The place was crowded so my girlfriend asked a girl who worked there if we could grab any seat if it opens up since this was our first time there and we would have at least 4 people in our group. She said sure. So we waited at a two seater table until a bigger table opened up.  When a 3 person group got up we grabbed the table and sat down while we waited for our friends to show up. Then the unfriendly waitress came over & said we couldn't sit there because it's made for 4 people and there's only 2 of us. My girlfriend told her our friends were on there way and the other waitress told us we could sit there a few minutes ago. She said in a very nasty way ""it doesn't matter, your friends have to physically be here, its first come first serve and she's new"". So fine, we got up and waited, while the busboy(chubby latino guy) bad mouthed us to some customers.  Weird. We ordered drinks and a few minutes later one of our friends shows up so we move back to the bigger table and bring our drinks with us.  We ordered guacamole which was just okay and my friend ordered sliders which took over an hour to come out. She gave her order to the blond guy with a pony tail but he never put her order in! Even though he said she could give him her order since our waitress was missing in action. Our waitress then came back and asked my friend what she ordered and my friend told her if the order wasn't put in don't worry about it. We were ready to leave, and the waitress snapped at her ""I just need to know what you ordered!!!!!"" Wow! This lady is angry and should not be working with people at all! The only thing good about this place is the happy hour which is bogo drinks. Drinks were decently priced $12-$13 and that's an even better deal when you're getting two for one.  Food is so so, service is slow and rude/angry. There's so many places to go for drinks and happy hour, I'd much rather spend my time & money somewhere where I feel welcome and not a burden to the people who work there. Their customer service needs to be worked on.",,,
173,Anthony N.,"Orange, CA",138,75,44,5.0,10/2/2016,"Dope spot, good music, and the drinks are made well. 2fers till 8 on any drink so they come out to be $5-6 each not bad Especially for manhattan. Came here on a Sunday night around 7pm most tables were taken so come early and enjoy yourself. Waiter Mike is mad chill if you're nice to him he'll be nice to you. Cheers enjoy!",,,1
174,Hsing-I H.,"New York, NY",6,13,4,5.0,12/1/2015,"Great place to hangout with friends. I just threw a surprise party for my friend and we had a lot of fun! The back room have enough private and cozy sofa, and spacious. The staffs were all very friendly and helpful. Most important, they're food and cocktail are delicious. The only thing I could think of to improve is that the ventilation wasn't good in the back room. Also the red light with the spinning fan made some friends feel dizzied. But overall, I appreciated all the help from the bar and I would recommend this place!",,,

176,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11,4.0,4/25/2016,"Found myself in the area for dinner but the heavy beating of work that day and the allure of 2-for-1 happy hour led me here first. Apparently, happy hour applies to ALL drinks and can't be split between two people who want one drink each. I went straight for the cocktails, and my friend and I had no intention of sharing. I started out with a caipirinha and followed it with a campari champagne. The first was good, the second was ok. Overall? It's a great bar with great happy hour. Nice open bar front. Chill yet lively atmosphere. Age-appropriate (for those who aren't into college bars). Come get a drink or six.",3,,
177,Cristina L.,"New York, NY",52,10,5,4.0,11/19/2015,"I came here for their happy hour, buy one drink get the second for free. It is clear that their drinks are really strong. If you are the person that does not drink that often, the happy hour may not be that worth your money because all I could taste on the drink was alcohol. However, if you are more than just a social drinker, then this is your place. They didn't have good snacks to accompany the drinks, so be aware of that",,,
178,Darina A.,"Union City, NJ",0,1,0,5.0,1/6/2016,"Great bar with amazing service.I've been there several times with my friends and we love it. Bartender, Ryan, is really professional and nice. After I told him that I love Margaritas,he offered me to try something that off the menu. He told me that he is from Texas and he will make me Texas style Margarita. And guess what,it was delicious! I like that he considered  my taste and add something new to my favorite drink. Personal approach is really important.I had a great time. I'll definitely come again and bring more friends to try something new. This bar is number one in my list. And I always recommend it to everybody.5++++",,,
179,Pong C.,"Manhattan, NY",157,127,21,2.0,7/27/2015,"Got there for happy hour on a weekday.., my friend got a table for our party of 3 in the back.  Not bad seating for a very crowded evening.Very noisy.  Service was slow (short-staffed?) but the waitress was nice and friendly.The worst part was the cocktails.  (2 for one for special ""crafted"" cocktails).  We had about 4-5 different kinds and they all tasted bad.  One of my friends was a regular and he commented that it was very unusual and must have been an ""off night"" for the bartender.  The wine he ordered was also bad and had to be returned. (it was left opened too long).So all in all, I don't think I will be coming back.",1,,
180,Laurie V.,"North Canton, OH",591,1129,886,5.0,11/27/2013,"Quintessential East Village bar.  Cozy, warm, and comfy atmosphere. Decent sized tables. Leather sofas. Candles.  Friendly bartenders. Great beer selection.  Awesome happy hour specials (two for one).   This is a good spot for a date.I didn't eat there, because I had dinner plans later, but the food smelled good.  I met an old friend here for drinks.  It was a great volume for conversation, but then the music all of a sudden the music got super loud.  I felt like I was screaming when the song ended.On a rainy Tuesday night it wasn't super crowded here.  Perfect.  Bathrooms are clean, but it's dark back there, so it was a little hard to find.  We were just here for a short time since we both had dinner reservations with other friends, but I could have spent a few more hours hear, drinking in the ambiance.Amazingly we managed to catch a cab in the pouring rain right away.  I rode away, happy, content, and wondering when I'll get to come back here again.",2,,
181,Dana C.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,17,6,5.0,6/12/2016,"Loved this bar! My friends and I walked about 2 miles to try their 2 for 1 happy hour and also heard it was a great spot. 10 degrees did not disappoint. The best part was when manager Mike took our group to a back room to chill on couches and have our own little area, especially since the bar was packed! We really appreciated Mike's hospitality, he was just a really cool down to earth guy! Drinks were made really well. Try the giblet!! Yummmmmy can't wait to back to 10degrees",1,,1
182,Lea B.,"Round Rock, TX",37,159,7,4.0,6/20/2013,"Went here for happy hour on a Wednesday Happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks and the cocktails are $10-$15 for the specialty made.They were well worth the price! strong, but not to the point you couldn't drink them, friends had the jalapeno margarita which had a bit of a kick and I had the Kentucky cocktail.Cons: very small space and if you don't grab a spot its almost impossible to just stand; only 2 waitresses and 2 bartenders. Normally would be ok but each drink is made on the spot so the wait was quite longwill definitely be going for happy hour again",4,,

184,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",556,2581,7,3.0,6/29/2015,"New York often sits high on the list for expensive eating, but if you know what you are doing, you can fuel up on adult beverages in a cheap fashion before heading out to dinner. Specifically, many a 2-for-1 discount make up this city's happy hour culture. Here, any and every liquor, drink, and beer applies.What does make it difficult in the Big Apple is making a decision on what bar to sit down at, as every Lower East Side and/or Greenwich tavern/gastropub/watering hole seems to provide the exact same atmosphere: people watching in tight quarters, with a rather warm temperature in the summer.Nonetheless, they have a decent selection at Ten Degrees, and the food holds its own in a city known for gluttony and drinking to excess. Nothing over the top, but good no-frills establishment at which to get prepped up and pre-gamed for dinner... or perhaps more bar-hopping.",1,,

There is a broad selection of cocktails, beers, and wines. Although it is pretty dark in here to even read the menu. I got the rose sangria, which was okay. I wished it was sweeter. When you kept drinking it ended up tasting like water by the end. BUTTT I think it could have been from trying my friend's drink. She got the jalepeno infused margarita. You can definitely feel the burn in your throat from those jalepenos. I would definitely suggest getting the grapefruit juice (optional). My friend had a hard time drinking it even with it (It came as an after thought for her to add it though). Overall, good place to chill and will be back again.",,,

196,Janis M.,"Campbell, CA",167,123,156,5.0,1/4/2013,"This place ROCKS!It was our first night in New York and we had a HORRIBLE dining experience at a different restaurant. We had a cabbie drop us off on the strip where this bar is located and we just wanted to drink our crappy dinner experience away. We basically decided to come in this bar because it looked crowded and...well, warm....it was FREEZING outside! Once we got in, my boyfriend started chatting it up with Moti - who turned out to be the owner. My BF told him about our bad dining experience and Moti asked if we were still hungry. When we told him that we were, he got us a table and proceeded to bring out the most amazing bar food we have ever had! We had grilled cheese bits, burgerettes and pasta. And this was no ordinary kind of stuff... everyone that walked by our table couldn't help but stop and stare. The service was exceptional, the server was super attentive and Moti even hung out with us for a bit. All in all, this place completely turned our night around and we were as happy as can be. The food was good, the people were fun and Moti and his staff definitely know what they are doing. I would come back here over and over again if I didn't require me to take a plane over here for a jolly good time!Way to go Ten Degrees. Cheers!",6,1,1

They have a great happy hour from 12 to 8. It was packed on a Monday night. They have a good beer selection. The cheese and pate plate was excellent. They offer a variety of unique cheeses. Our waitress, who was very friendly and attentive, helped us make some excellent choices. I highly recommend Ten Degrees for an after-work beer and nice munchies.",,,
