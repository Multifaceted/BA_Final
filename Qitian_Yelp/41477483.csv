0,Oluchi N.,"Nashville, TN",2,5,2,5.0,5/22/2017,"tldr: Yay for free breakfast, free WiFi, and a clean, safe place to rest your head without having to break the bank. Anesha and Josie are rock stars!!! I hope you're fortunate enough to have them help you if you have any issues during your stay. In my book, this hotel gets 5 stars all around for their excellent staff and their facility.The extended version: My family and I (10 people total) planned a short trip to New York for my brother's graduation last week. Six of us stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Manhattan Midtown West. Since I currently reside in Tennessee where we're used to having space, very little street noise, and easy access to our cars, I was a bit nervous about coordinating this trip. I didn't want everyone to hate me if: a) we got stuck in a small room designed for two people and 0 suitcases; b) our hotel was surrounded by sketchiness, or; c) if we couldn't get around New York easily without having to take a taxi everywhere. Thankfully, this hotel was perfect for what we needed. First, the rooms with two queen beds were perfect for three; the king room with the sofa bed was also great for three. There was even enough room for our suitcases. For six adults with a short stay, this was perfect.Next, the hotel is not surrounded by sketchiness, woohoo! Instead, it's located near some good eats (W 48th and 10th Ave) and Ink48's sexy rooftop bar with a great view of the Hudson River (W 48th and 11th Ave). Yes, there's a Salvation Army across the street, but it doesn't make the area any more/less sketchy than the rest of midtown.Finally, we could get around easily either on foot, via the subway, or with a Lyft/Uber. How you get around just depends on where you're trying to go, and how much you're trying to spend. For my brother's graduation, we took an Uber to get to his school, but we walked or took the subway almost everywhere else. Especially when traffic is heavy, it just makes more sense to walk. Columbus Circle, where we entered Central Park, was 20 minutes on foot. Times Square was about a 10 minute walk. Broadway is less than 10 minutes away. Overall, the location was excellent in my opinion.Here are the tips that I'd recommend to help you enjoy your stay:1. Book early and call with any requests that you might have. We asked for a higher floor to minimize street noise, and we were placed on the 7th floor. The staff here will actually try to accommodate your requests.2. If you have an issue, let the staff know as soon as possible so they can help you resolve it. And don't be a jerk to them while they're trying to help--phenomenal staff members like Anesha and Josie will go above and beyond to try and get things to work out in your favor. 3. If you want the complimentary breakfast, get there before 9. Yes, it's a little chaotic because there are so many people and so few tables, but they're trying to do the best with the space they have. Feel free to treat the seating on the patio as an overflow area if the weather allows it.4. If you have a late flight on the day that you check out, ask to leave your luggage behind the concierge while you hang out in the city. Anthony, one of the other awesome employees at this hotel, let us know that this was an option the evening before we checked out.This is not a swanky boutique hotel, so if you're looking for a place with upscale accents all over, you're likely to be disappointed. But I found the service, space, and location to be great for this price point and at this time of the year.",3,,
1,Alex B.,"Denver, CO",0,6,0,1.0,10/6/2018,"Rude people at front desk treat me like a criminals and try to stop me from going to my own damn room. Didn't apologize either, just said I was giving them ""red flags"" because I had forgotten my room number. Only a brief altercation, but enough to make me feel completely unwelcome for the remainder of the trip. Also the rooms are tiny and cramped, even by New York standards. Better to stay in the comfort inn right next door.",,,
2,Jemima C.,"Washington, DC",159,166,158,3.0,2/25/2018,"Very small room and even smaller bathroom. The area it's in is pretty convenient. About 10 minutes walking from 50th street subway and walking distance to restaurants and bars. The staff was friendly and I'm not sure they were helpful. When watching tv everywhere 30 seconds to 2 minutes the tv would go completely black and shut off and then back on. Told the front desk and no one came since the maintenance was on break. Then, while taking a shower. The water shut completely off. Completely off! Can you imagine?! The turns back on. The off again seconds later. So y'all know I was rushing the second time to rinse. Some guy came to look at it and started to explain to me how to use the nozzle. Sir! You really think that's what happened? Lastly, the vending machines in the hallways do not work. But you still get free breakfast.",,,
3,Jennifer N.,"Austin, TX",100,479,3592,4.0,5/5/2017,I am quite pleasantly surprised at how great my stay was here. The price was fair for being quite close to Time Square. I was easily able to walk there and jump on the subway to get anywhere I wanted. The staff was very friendly when I checked in. The room was small but it was comfortable and had everything that you needed. The bathroom was also small but it was functional. Nothing was too small. I would definitely recommend to stay here if you are looking for an affordable clean convenient place to stay that you should stay here.,2,,
4,Russell R.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,0,2.0,9/28/2018,"Had a decent accommodation except for the bug problem. Also, booked a king size room and they did not honor this. Staff was nice and friendly so no complaints there. The last night I was there I was bit by something and then in the morning found a small bed bug. I ended up pulling the manager aside upon my checkout because there were quite a few people down in the lobby to tell her in private. There was no apology or anything. Wasn't expecting anything but there was zero remorse. Would stay away from here. Stayed from 9/26-9/28/18",,,
5,Band E.,"Seattle, WA",0,119,3,2.0,10/21/2017,"Very tiny room. It takes a lot of logistics for 2 people to maneuver around the room. Pretty sure we has a queen bed instead of the advertised king. Very noisy with other guests slamming doors. Hard to sleep. Offered a large breakfast in a room with a terrible layout. Very, very cramped. Elevators are very, very slow, meaning long lines quickly form.Staff was fine.",1,,
6,Noam K.,"Salzburg, Austria",32,9,0,2.0,5/4/2018,"We booked this hotel through hotwire, but the reviews seemed good. We did not enjoy our stay that much however.The room was a bit small but reasonable. Housekeeping was not so good- the room wasn't very clean (we found hairs in the tub...), Each day we had a different surprise with the towels- one day we had more (placed new ones without taking the previous ones), another they just rearranged the old ones, and on the third day they just took the old ones without replacing... We also requested an additional blanket, and got one but with no covers...Breakfast is busy without enough space for all the people.Elevators are too busy so you need to wait about 5-20 minutes to go up or down.Noise isolation wasn't good either- we could hear everything from the room next door although they were just talking normally...Air-conditioning in the room wasn't good and was really loud, we also had to turn off the fridge in the room since it sounded like a truck inside our room...",,1,
7,Julianne D.,"Germantown, MD",157,49,45,5.0,1/9/2017,"Imagine dozens of people coming in at 3 a.m. because they had to be put up for a canceled flight and being the only one working. That's what the front desk,  Fernando did. So polite and worked as hard as he could to get everyone a bed for the night/morning. His hospitality was on point! The rooms are a decent size and clean with smart tv's.  They serve breakfast 630 to 930 Monday through Friday and 7 to 10 on the weekends. It's a drive from the airport,  but I would definitely stay here when I come to New York again.",4,2,2
8,Jina L.,"Issaquah, WA",0,5,1,5.0,1/10/2017,"Her name is Josie Llorea...An employee named Josie made me so happy and warm. After my flight got cancelled at 9pm on Sunday night, I had to come back to Manhattan from the JFK Airport and stay the night at the Midtown Holiday Inn on 48th Street. When I called American Airlines, I found out my flight was rescheduled for 2 days later. I  was trying to call American Airlines to get a voucher for the hotel for one more night, but they were not answering.At the time, Josie was at the front desk. She heard about what I was trying to do and about an hour later, she called me to say that she got a hold of American Airlines and explained my situation. They faxed me a new voucher! She is so smart and knows how to do her job right. She was  very thoughtful and kind for helping me in this situation when I was exhausted and stressed from the delay. I think Holiday Inn should promote her.",1,,
9,Priscilla Y.,"Gaithersburg, MD",384,604,2906,4.0,1/10/2017,"I enjoyed our stay at this Holiday Inn Express. Our room was clean and the king bed was comfy. Plenty of pillows. Normally, rooms in NYC are pretty tight, but this one had a lot of floor space.They offer free continental breakfast, which ends at 10am. The breakfast includes, cereal, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, turkey sausage, pancakes, and waffles. It's a pretty good selection compared to some other free hotel breakfast I've had. There are very limited tables. Coffee is free 24-hours.If you've got the munchies late at night and don't feel like venturing out of the hotel, they sell frozen pizzas and snacks in the lobby. Their doors are not soundproof. You can hear everything when your neighbor leaves their room. It will suck if they are super early birds. Also, only two elevators in this hotel. The hotel is located in Hell's Kitchen so you're within walkable distance to a lot of tasty food options and bars.",,,
10,Carol K.,"Framingham, MA",0,6,0,4.0,10/30/2017,"We had a great stay here. Every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was clean, yes small, but that's fine. Only negatives were that the bathroom sink drain stopper would not work and really, the most important negative is that the breakfast is pretty bad if you care about food quality and health. Not that other chain hotels have better breakfast, I just keep hoping that one will step up and put out some vegetables to go with bagels, some almond milk for coffee, etc. Overall I'd say that this is a pretty good hotel and the staff make it even better.",1,,
11,Lesly C.,"Cleveland, OH",32,3,0,5.0,12/13/2017,Great location! About 10-15 minute walk to Times Square and Rockefeller Center. About 10 minutes from the nearest subway. Free breakfast included which was great and convenient. Very helpful staff. I traveled with my children and I felt safe at all times. The room and bathroom were small but that wasn't an issue for us since we were on the go most of the time.,,,
12,Steven P.,"Burbank, CA",10,24,2,2.0,3/28/2016,"We got a pretty good deal for Manhattan so we shouldn't really complain. But it would be good to note some things... The internet was truly not very good, even though the technician who sorted it out every time was a great man.Also the hotel was so busy that sometimes you had to wait 5-10 minutes to sit and have breakfast and around the same time to enter the lifts because there were too busy. But the most disappointing thing was that we left the 'Do Not Disturb' sign outside our door because we had some sensitive documents in our room and when we got back our room was made up. I stay in around 50-100 different hotels every year and this has never happened to me. For the $220 a night I am sure next time we can do better, even in Manhattan.",2,,1

Updated review","Newish, clean place with comfortable beds, but the noise is irritating at night. We were on the back, but sirens were irritating. Other people's doors also close loudly at night.  The staff is very helpful and nice.  Breakfast is flavorless scrambled eggs, omelettes, pork and turkey sausage, cinnamon rolls, waffles, oatmeal, yogurt, toast, coffee and tea.  There is fresh fruit.  They have late checkout as well as checking your bags early or late.  Seating area out front, where building is recessed.  Too bad they don't have better Windows, for sirens.",,,
14,Jane N.,"Athens, OH",41,13,0,3.0,3/4/2016,Noisiest room I have ever slept in. Ice maker in hall right outside room keeps dropping ice. Going to keep me up all night at this rate. Not happy. On a positive note-- Front desk help at checkin was excellent.,1,,
15,J Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,1.0,10/7/2017,"Only hotel that had a last minute room that's a plus for that. Friendly staff. Good breakfast selection and taste. However I asked the woman behind the desk at check in Do they validate parking? She stated ""YES "" . I then proceeded to ask if there were any stipulations that would cause me to pay any money to retrieve my car she told me ""AGAIN NO"". Time to get car after check out  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  STORY. Before leaving the hotel I asked the morning woman a different one behind the desk the same question she stated "" there's no charge "". The parking attendant said ""That's not correct they should just tell the truth that they ONLY pay a small part off the parking for us that was $10 of our $55 bill. 1 STAR FOR ILL REPRESENTATION OF PARKING. 2 DECEPTIVE WORKERS .

16,Elsa V.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,101,7,4.0,10/2/2016,"Only few words: we had a good 8 day stay here.  Breakfast is served daily, location is at the heart of theatre district and walking distance to times square and surrounded by restaurants. Yes, we recommend this place.",1,,1
17,Gail Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,91,53,3.0,7/6/2015,"Rooms are petite.  If you're on a budget and don't mind literally climbing over each other and you got a deal on price, it is a great place to stay.  If you are traveling with someone who can't climb over things and you are the primary climber, it may not be the place for you.  The beds are really firm, just the way I like them. So even with street noise until around 2:00 in the morning (some of it comes from the people sitting on the chairs outside at the hotel entrance) I had a pretty good night's sleep.  If you are a light sleeper, this is not for you.  (I could hear the conversation of the people walking through the halls.  It's a good thing they weren't sharing secrets--probably forgot that they were not on a noisy sidewalk anymore.)  Location is good--1.4 mi to Penn Station, 1.9 to Eataly, about 1.3 mi to Central Park,  little over a mile to High Line Park, a couple of good bakeries with good coffee around the block, a 24 hr. corner market diagonal from the laundromat that's on the same block (which has all kinds of foods, including cheesecake and pretty decent coffee), about a half mi away from good Mexican food and ramen shops.   The ability to walk up and down stairs is a plus--slow elevators.  In-room refrigerator and safe were pluses.  Don't trust the in-room coffee maker!  I ran water through it and the water came out brown without me putting any coffee in it.  I should have known by the telltale sign of a thick layer of dust on the cover.  They still provide bar bath soaps-bring your own body wash.  Make sure that you ask for complete sets of towels if you don't let housekeeping in to clean your room when it is time, or they will just bring the bath towels.",2,2,
18,Gina B.,"Honolulu, HI",90,158,147,3.0,11/1/2013,"Great price, especially since we used Priceline. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable but fitting 3 people in a room with 2 beds was a super tight squeeze. As mentioned in other reviews, there are some shady-looking characters at the Salvation Army directly across the street but they minded their business so wasn't a big deal. Location was OK if you don't mind a 15 minute walk to the subway. The room wasn't insulated from sound very well...the street was alive at all hours so bring earplugs to sleep if that bothers you.The free apple cider was delicious! The free breakfast affects the speed of the elevator. There are only two elevators and at breakfast time, a longer-than-normal wait so if your legs are able, use the stairs.",2,,2
19,Melissa M.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",15,34,3,4.0,3/9/2015,"I have stayed at this hotel about 4 or 5 times(over 30 nights total) and I am very happy with this hotel. The staff is all great, location is awesome(near a lot of great Hell's Kitchen restaurants,) the rooms are a nice size for Manhattan, and the breakfast is great. There is a gentlemen who works the breakfast shift(I wish I remember his name!) that is great and you can tell he takes a lot of pride in his job. It's always nice to see a friendly, smiling face in the morning. My only reason for 4 stars, instead of 5 is things can be very noisy...I know that isn't a fault of the hotel though. It seems to be a touristy hotel rather than a business travelers crowd, so the noise can be frustrating at times. Other than that, everything else about this place is great and I would highly recommend it!",2,1,
20,Lyn L.,"Springfield, PA",4,25,0,5.0,7/5/2016,"I stayed here for 12 nights(late May-early June). Staff was terrific. The ones whose names I remember are Josie, Ashley, Anesha, Latch, John, Randy, Fernando, Roxanne, Jacky, Sussana, Michael, Gerard, Raymond, Audriny, and Evan.  Sorry for any misspellings and those whose names I forgot.  Everyone  went the extra mile-and more.  I had 2 problems which were fixed in a matter of minutes-when  I checked in my fridge wasn't working(turned out someone-probably the previous guest-had unplugged it) and one night a storm knocked out the tv signal(it just needed a boost-for lack of a better word).Location was perfect-I could walk to many of the places I wanted to see or walk to a bus to take me to them.I would like to address some previous comments by other yelpers:1. Yes, the breakfast room is very small and cramped. What helped during my stay was that many people took their food out to the patio because the weather was so nice. BUT this was a corporate decision when they designed the hotel.  I can't fault the staff for that.2. You only knew there was a Salvation Army facility across the street because the building was marked as such.  The men who hung outside were decently dressed and relatively quiet.3. My room had one big bed, a chair, desk, tv, etc. At least one person claims to have had a similar room and felt it was cramped.  It very well may have been cramped for 2 people. BUT for a solo traveler it was fine.My only real complaint-and again this is something that I blame corporate for, not the staff at the hotel-was the ATM machine in the lobby. There is a $200 limit and a $4 charge. I feel that if $200 is the limit the fee should be lower or if there is a $4 fee I should be able to withdraw more. This is New York City-$200 doesn't go very far.Would I stay here again?  Absolutely, positively yes!",,,1
21,Todd F.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,21,0,1.0,5/4/2017,"Better than expected b'fast buffet.  But the room, we had 3 guests and they put us in a room with 1 bed!  They said the fold out bed in the love seat was better than any of their beds.  They were wrong, it was tippy, uncomfortable mattress that made for an awful night sleep.  WE requested the manager call us @ our issues and the 2nd night of stay we had to give out # 2X and then in AM we NEVER got a call.  When we went to front desk they said they had heard we called but thought we would stop by, I stated 'why did the person ask us for our # TWICE and when we requested a call none came.'  They had no answer.  They offered us $ off on a future stay but WHY go back.  It was a horrible experience which is a shame as we liked the location.  But this summer we plan to stay elsewhere and wont go near this place with horrible beds and bad customer service!",,,

I could go on and on but i wont. i was having an issue with my rental car company. she asked me how my stay in new York was going and i told her almost everything gis going great and except one small issue everyone in new york has been nothing but nice. she asked about what was wrong and i mentioned my issue and she got on the phone and went at it with the rental company even though i told her she didnt have to. It didnt fix my problem with the rental but she gave it one hell of a try. we agreed that what they were doing wasnt right but it is what it is. I will definitely use this hotel next time.,,,1

26,Cynthia W.,"Newark, NY",0,5,15,4.0,4/26/2016,"We stayed 1 night here and overall it was as expected. The front desk was exceptionally friendly and helpful. As IHG REWARDS CLUB members we were given a goodie bag upon arrival consisting of 2 small bottles of water and 2 pkgs of mixed nut snack mix. We had asked for a quiet room on a lower floor. We received as requested. The only negative to that request was that it looked out the back and there was nothing but an empty courtyard to look at. We opted for a standard king room. It seemed as if it had just been remodeled. The bathroom was small but adequate. There was a full tub and bowed out shower rod. It was impeccibly clean; small undermunt sink with dark granite. The room was soundproof from the outside, however we did hear hallway noise although being at the end of the hall it was minimal. Breakfast began @ 630am; we arrived at 7am and had no trouble at all with seating. Nice selection: yogart, milk, juices, coffees, tea, cereals hot and cold, warm cinnamin rolls, scrambled eggs, sausage patties both turkey and pork, biscuits, bread, engl muffins, bagels, pancakes, muffins and fresh fruits. Quite enough for anyone's taste. Our king bed had 2 pillows each; 1 soft and 1 firm. Sheets were smooth but mattress was quite firm. Outside there was minimal activity aside from traffic and an occassional walker. No issues with The Salvation Army residence across the street; just like any other apartment building. We received a good rate for the room for medical appts we were to attend. The wifi worked well for us but we were not on it much. All in all, we felt safe and comfortable and would stay again.",5,,

29,Jason A.,"Providence, RI",506,352,124,3.0,8/19/2013,"Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Manhattan West Side recently with the fiancee.  As other posters have mentioned, this is a brand spanking new hotel, and so if you're the kinda guy/gal that gets new car scent air fresheners, this is probably a place you will have on your ""Hotels in NYC to stay at"" list.  The entire stay was average.  Nothing spectacular, and nothing horrendous.  Further details below:The Good:- It's new.  As in, some of the door hinges still have plastic stuck to them (like they were just purchased from Home Depot and installed yesterday night kind of a feel).- The staff are friendly.- They offer free breakfast, for those on a budget.  See below, though.- Two computers are available for your use, with a free printer.  Though usually they seemed to be occupied by 12 year olds on Youtube.  Don't their parents realize that Youtube is a pretty bad babysitter?- WiFi is reasonably speedy, and free.- For Priority Club members with any status, your gift is chocolate and chips.The Bad:- Location.  There is a Salvation Army directly across the street.  No, not the store where you buy used clothes when you're trying to be hip, or finding a Hallowe'en costume.  Like a place where people who are down on their luck are living.  Be aware that you are several blocks away from the main thoroughfares, meaning you walk through at least a few questionable residential buildings before arriving at the hotel.  During my stay, I never felt unsafe.  Did I feel as safe as I would have if I were staying in the middle of Times Square (albeit, at a hotel that costs 5x as much)?  No.  I just wouldn't want to be walking home, as an attractive female, by myself at 3AM.  But then again, where would that ever be safe?- The breakfast was free, meaning their offerings were average, at best.  Standard Holiday Inn fare (do they all shop at the same discount food provider?), meaning lots of carbs, and little in the way of fresh products.  Waffle makers, cinnamon buns, bacon, eggs etc. are available.  If you're trying to be on an anti-typical-American-diet and doing the whole health thing, your best bets will be limited to oranges and oatmeal.  Also, the crowds are nuts.  It's like they were serving gourmet fare or something.  Lineups starting as soon as they opened the breakfast.- The elevator/rooms situation.  The elevators are about the size of the rooms.  As in, they're both postage sized.  Elevators are slow during prime times, to the point where I just started taking the stairs.  And try fitting in two fatties with their suitcases... it ain't going to happen.  The rooms are the size of your bathroom at home.- Sound proofing.  Why can't hotels do this properly?  I don't get it.  They understand you are there to sleep, but can't make sure you are in a quiet room.  We could hear night club music all night long, and as much as I love Kaskade, I don't want that shit blaring when I'm sleeping.The Ugly:- The clientele.  There are some groups of people who are obnoxious, and they apparently all love to stay at this hotel.  My fiancee was pushed (yes, pushed) off an elevator because she did not immediately step off once the door opened.In summary, you could do better if you were willing to spend a little more.  But then if that was the case, why would you be looking at the Holiday Inn chain?  It wasn't a bad experience, and I'd stay again if the price was right.  If I could, 3.5 stars would be a reasonable rating.",7,2,
30,Duana S.,"Escondido, CA",281,140,49,3.0,8/24/2013,"Stayed here last week on our 20th anniversary trip to NYC.  We stayed 7 nights. The hotel seemed fairly new and nice.Reasons to stay here:  Free breakfast, nice beds, larger than most rooms, friendly hotel staff (gave us an upgrade to a bigger room at the end of the hall)Reasons not to stay here:  About 10-15 minute walk to the subway, cleaning staff needs to step it up (they didn't sweep our bath floor all week, forgot towels, didn't clean the toilet or shower all week), no view.To sum it up:We did call for towels and they were really quick to bring them.  We never complained about the bathroom cleaning they may have worked harder.  The breakfast bar was nice but very crowded.  This hotel was nice because it was newer.  I really didn't care for the location, but if you don't mind walking then this is perfect.",2,,1
31,Kimberly N.,"Fort Washington, MD",32,4,0,5.0,3/15/2015,"This was not my first time visiting New York City but this was my first time staying so close to Time square because it is so expensive.  Therefore, I normally travel far away to stay in a nice hotel but, this time I wanted the convenience of walking everywhere.  At first I was worried about staying here because the price was so reasonable but I must admit, it was above my expectations.  The hotel is located in a good area.  I love to eat and it is located just blocks away from Hell's kitchen row!  The rooms are very clean and comfy.  The rooms are a little small for my taste but who stays in their room in NY but to sleep???  Everything is within 10 blocks, such as Time square, Broadway, restaurants, shopping, and entertainment.  I took my girls for college spring break and we had a blast!  Shout out to Karen.  She was super helpful, always smiling, and went above and beyond to help everyone during breakfast and throughout the day at the front desk.  She made everyone fill like a VIP.  I must admit, the breakfast is pretty tasty.  It was a great stay.  I would stay there with my family again.Tip: Spend a little more or settle for a little less and go for convenience.  I get a lot more out the trip to be closer to all the amenities.",1,,1
32,Lisa L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,0,4.0,10/16/2016,"Super clean (that's a biggee for me), staff is helpful and accommodating, updated furnishings in good shape, rooms are larger than I expected for New York midtown in this price range, location is convenient - easy walk to the Metro and most of midtown, we felt very safe here. Breakfast is too crowded to bother with - maybe they could rearrange the room to make it less of a bottleneck? We just opted for coffee and bagels along the way. Noise - it's Manhattan! Bring your earplugs if you're not used to city noise. I would definitely come back to this hotel. We were here six days and had a great experience.",,,
33,Sarah W.,"Burlington, VT",30,68,189,4.0,5/27/2015,Good location. The rooms are small but what else do you need. Didn't stay for breakfast so I can't speak about that. The receptionists were very nice and helpful.,,,
34,Bill S.,"Allentown, PA",7,38,14,4.0,2/1/2014,"Clean and well maintained. Close to the Intrepid and waterfront. Staff is all very friendly and helpful. Kelly at the front desk was exceptionally pleasant and accommodating. Rooms were small, but clean. Free WiFi ( it's slow)Reasonably priced for NYC",,,
35,Christina I.,"Canby, OR",6,19,0,4.0,4/13/2015,The hotel was very nice and staff was very very friendly! No complaints as far as the staff friendliness! I would say that for the price.....there was a little things here and there that could have been updated. Our room had water damage on the tiles when walking in as well I didn't feel the bathroom was very clean. But overall super great place to stay and close to all major attractions,,,
36,Eric G.,"Clarks Summit, PA",0,2,0,2.0,7/15/2016,"I thought the hotel stay was very good, the place was very clean and well kept.  The staff was nice as well.  My only problem which is a big one is the parking garage that the hotel works with and recommended to park our car at did some major cosmetic damage to my car.  I didn't even think to check my car closely for damage before I left but I wish I had.  My wife and I arrived home to find scratches, dents and chipped paint all over my car.  The vehicle is not new but was in very good cosmetic condition until now.  The parking garage, (Skyline iCon Parking Garage) Primary Parking LLC, 721-735 10th Avenue, New York, NY 100190000 also refused to take a cash payment and said they only take credit cards which was a red flag as well.  I did not want to use my credit card but had no choice because they said if I had to use cash they would have to charge me $97 instead of the $55 rate for having our ticket stamped from the hotel.  Needless to say I am extremely upset and disappointed with the hotel for working with and recommending such a careless parking garage.  I am now stuck with a car that has all this damage for what was suppose to be a nice trip to the city.",1,,1
37,JoLee Y.,"Plattsburgh, NY",22,4,0,4.0,2/15/2016,"The staff was VERY friendly, the room was quite clean, if a little smaller than we're used to.  A variety of hot and cold foods were provided for breakfast ( better even than a diner we visited during our stay!)  Nice neighborhood - easy to walk places.  We will definitely come back next time.",,,
38,Oren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,41,0,1.0,12/20/2015,"I had booked a room with two beds online before coming. When we got there, the room had been changed as a reservation for a room with just one bed and the manager on duty was not willing/able to change it at all. We weren't able to get a refund or to get a second room, or even a roll-away bed added to the room. Overall, they're customer service was horrible.",,,
39,Michelle G.,"Renton, WA",0,13,0,3.0,1/1/2014,"The location of this place is not very ideal. The neighborhood around the hotel is sketchy at best. Everything around seems to be broken or under construction of some sort. The rooms are absolutely tiny at best. I can appreciate the fact that it is New York and that is expected of hotels, and living spaces in general but it's a bit silly how small it is. One thing I did respect however was the service. The people want to help. They were nice and seemed to enjoy their work. However I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Too small, doesn't feel super safe, and not very close to Times Square.",1,,
40,Dawn K.,"Vacaville, CA",11,5,0,5.0,7/6/2014,"My husband, two teens and I just returned from a week's stay here.  Although the room was tight for the four of us, we were very pleased with the hotel in general.  All of the employees  were friendly and helpful.  We took the subway to most of the tourist sights, which was about a 15 minute walk.  The hotel is in a residential area, close to the theater district.  Although the Salvation Army was across the street, it really wasn't an issue.  We had an amazing week in New York. :)",,,
41,Victoria M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,52,0,1.0,7/5/2016,"Visiting NYC and we were very excited to stay in a good rated hotel. Went to check-in to our two bed room I had reserved on Groupon, and they told us it wasn't available. They said I had booked a one king bed room for all three nights we were staying there. I'm traveling with my boyfriend and his brother, mind you. The three of us are not about to share a bed! I had brought a folder with my confirmation receipts in case any places tried this nonsense on me. I showed them the confirmation page clearly showing two beds, and they told me I was wrong, and they were sold out. I asked if we could have a roll away bed or anything, and they were rude and said ""We don't have anything like that."" They did offer us a refund, except it was the pride event in the city, and we knew everything would be sold out. So! We stayed there with my boyfriend's brother having to sleep on the floor for two nights. The third night they found a two bed room for us. They said they would wave the $20/night fees for us, but they never did that. We'd asked them to hold our luggage the day we had to switch rooms, and when we came back that evening- they thought they'd lost our luggage. So we freaked out, then they wandered in the back a bit later, and someone had put it in a place they don't usually keep guest's luggage. I understand people make mistakes, but the fact the staff was so rude and unapologetic really ticked me off.",,,
42,Victoria T.,"American Canyon, CA",1,28,8,5.0,5/30/2014,"Great hotel. Excellent excellent staff. Always smiling, friendly and eager to help you with anything. Awsome breakfast. Beds are so comfortable. What more can i ask for.",2,,
43,C D.,"Alpharetta, GA",7,45,48,5.0,9/7/2014,"This will be my ""go-to"" place to stay in NYC from now on.  Excellent service! Breakfast was delicious.  The staff here really takes the time to do the best for their customers! Loved it! Breakfast & WiFi included with your room rate!  Can't go wrong here! Location was so much fun in Hell's Kitchen, lots of trendy, fun restaurants to dine in all price ranges. We also had our laundry washed and folded (same day service) at one of the nearby laundromats.",,,
44,C C.,"Indialantic, FL",0,28,10,5.0,6/13/2014,"My husband and I plus a teenaged grandson just returned from 4 nights at this hotel. Our experience there was excellent,and contrary to what other reviewers have said about the area, you can feel as safe walking to or from the hotel, it is a residential area. The Salvation Army across the street is well staffed and the residents don't appear to be any threat.The hotel has a friendly, helpful staff, from front desk personnel to maintenance people and housekeeping. As has been noted before, rooms are smaller but well designed and with a little organization you make it work. Breakfast can get crowded, but so many hotels do not offer you a complimentary breakfast that this is a perk that is well received. Most people enjoy their breakfast and move on so you can generally find a table after a short wait. A HUGE benefit this hotel provides is the front patio area with comfy chairs, tables etc. & weather permitting, you can always enjoy your breakfast there. I would most definitely recommend this hotel...and would not hesitate to stay here again.If you're up to walking, the location is pretty accessible to West Side sights. Some complaints have been mentioned that the subway station is a ""hike""...it IS...but here's a tip...you need only visit that subway station once, when you purchase a 7 day unlimited subway/bus MetroCard at the station (50th & 9th Ave). Once you have that MetroCard, from the hotel, you can walk to 11th Avenue and then north 2 short blocks to 50th street and catch the #50 bus crosstown and hook up with other bus routes which link you wherever you want to go. BIG TIP HERE...unless you have to get some place in a hurry, forget the subways and ride the buses. Get a MetroCard, get a bus map (or put it on your smartphone) and just ride the bus...you see everything...no transfers needed, just the best way to view the attractions of the Big Apple I would most definitely recommend this hotel...and would not hesitate to stay here again.",,,
45,Antonio S.,"Aptos, CA",0,7,0,3.0,4/12/2015,"Stayed here after they opened in May '13. It was by far the most reasonably price hotel we found in NYC. It was also so nice to stay in a newly opened hotel in a city with billions of past visitors, knowing very few had stayed in our room. The free breakfast was basic, fruit wasn't the freshest, but being from NorCal I'm super spoiled.  Staff was super friendly and helpful. Called front desk several time prior to stay as it was our first time in the city and they had no problems answering all my questions. The Sullivan street bakery is right around the block and is amazing, a must stop for some delicious treats after  breakfast to ensure plenty of energy on your walks through the city. Neighborhood is a bit rough and far from scenic, also quite a bit removed from anything of note. You'll be walking a bit to subway or paying a few extra bucks in cab fare. However, if you're on a budget you could do far worst then staying here.  Overall a super pleasant stay and would happily stay again, but probably never will.  Reason being, IMO, you're better off spending the few extra bucks to be in a more central location.  If you're going to be out late or wanting to get the absolute most out of every minute of your trip, better to be right dead center and not waste precious time in a cab or suffering through several more blocks of walking after your jammed pack day touring the city from subway.",1,,
46,Daniele M.,"Herndon, VA",5,19,4,3.0,7/17/2013,"While this hotel was clean (because its less than 2 months old) the amenities left something to be desired. There were no towels in our room upon check in after a long afternoon in 90 degree weather a shower was the only thing we had in mind. It took the staff about 15-20 minutes to bring them. Breakfast was pretty pathetic. They didn't offer as much as other express hotels do and there was no one keeping up with the empty items or coffee. While we did encounter one very friendly housekeeping staff and from desk employee on our stay, I might try the one on 39th instead until they figure things out.",,,
