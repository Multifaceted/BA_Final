1,Aliyah A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",42,16,28,5.0,10/18/2018,"It was my first time going there for a friend's birthday. i had an amazing time. it was no line or cover fee (which ever place was doing in LES that night) and honestly i had the time of my life. the drinks are affordable and the music was good. honestly i was drunk so idk if the music was THAT good or not. however, it seemed good at the moment so it was. there's 2 floors. the downstairs played more hip hop and had more of a house party vibe which was cute. overall very fun spot.",,,
2,Tatiana V.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",1440,524,7,5.0,8/11/2018,"Came here with my boyfriend in mine and we are started to dance and it was nice out there, and including the bands so much!",2,1,2
3,Matthew O.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,5,1,5.0,8/24/2018,wow this place may have moved locations but still a nice little treat.  The nights alternate music wise - but always have a good time.,1,,
4,Priti R.,"New York, NY",320,405,57,4.0,3/2/2018,"Great place for dancing absolutely. Different kinds of music ... depends on the night you're here, but it's safe to say that on either of the floors you'll be getting old school hip hop. Downstairs doesn't have many beer options and upstairs is sometimes a giant mess, but generally you'll have a good time!",3,1,3
5,Matt P.,"New York, NY",1243,371,51,3.0,9/6/2017,"If you're numbingly fumbling over some post-empanada mama crumb grumblings, stumble into here...I feel like if Eminem wrote a Yelp review, this may be it. Or at best, Dr. Suess On another note, props to the DJ for the 90's mix all night, head to the basement for the extra convo space!",,1,1
6,Jami H.,"Jamaica, NY",255,6,4,4.0,11/8/2017,"I just celebrated my 22nd birthday here this past weekend and it was amazing!! The owner, Ulli, was very responsive to all of my questions during the planning process and let me have the Basement to myself with my own DJ from 9-11. Could not have asked for a more perfect birthday party or a better venue. Great vibes all around and the music was lit for the most part (people kept telling me the in-house DJ's set was trash towards the end). All in all, a memorable experience and I will definitely be back on a more regular basis. I think all the people who came through share similar sentiments too! The only reason I would not give 5 stars is because a few of my friends dealt with the bouncers making inappropriate comments towards them.. Yes my friends look good af but no that does not mean they or their bodies needed to be objectified whatsoever!!! I mean is it really so hard to look at the ID and keep it pushing?",6,,
7,Max W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/4/2018,"Was excited to visit, loved the Neckface art. Art was ironic considering the bartender did not know Neckface. Furthermore I was turned away because I am from Oregon? My ID is legally from Oregon however bartender turned me and my partner away nevertheless, we are both of age and citizens of Oregon. Sad way to start a night, overall bummer.",,,
8,Becca B.,"New York, NY",499,101,37,4.0,2/3/2017,"I discovered this place about a year ago because of some mutual friends who grew up in Manhattan -- they were kids who used to sneak in here and then try to one-up each other with stories about it the next day at school, for whatever reason. Anyway, the lore of Max Fish has persisted in that group of friends, and they always drag out-of-towners or new acquaintances here at the end of a night out. The bartenders are friendly and service is fast, for how busy it can be in waves between about midnight and 3:30am Thursday-Saturday. Mixed drinks are fairly cheap, they have semi-famous guest DJs downstairs often, you might occasionally run into some major intrigue upstairs around the pool table, and the space doubles as an art exhibit during daylight hours (so decor is unique). It is not ""clubby"" in the way some nicer dance places are around the LES now, but it's certainly a place to check out, if anything else in this review appeals to you, and if you aren't afraid of soaked unisex bathrooms.",,,1
9,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2412,5152,3.0,7/26/2016,"I'm a dive bar kind of guy at heart, and places like Max Fish certainly fit that bill.Pro skaters (both young and old), musicians (Run The Jewels, Stretch & Babbito, etc...hang there often), writers (you name a blog you follow, they probably closed the bar down last night), and every other type of creative person in New York have probably tossed one back at Max Fish over the years. They moved a few blocks south into arguably a much more pleasant bar to be in, but it's the same people, same vibe, and same dive bar experience they've curated for a hot minute.The drinks are cheap enough, there's usually a lot of room, and I generally have a nice time. You have to be tolerant of what some would call ""hipsters"", though...plenty of those to go around.",12,5,7
10,Tailor D.,"Arlington, VA",472,200,495,1.0,4/22/2017,"I would like to say that I had a positive experience here, but it was quite the opposite. We went with a friend of ours who was turned away because the bouncers thought his ID was fake, which it certainly was not. They of course threatened to take it away and we insisted that they let him keep it because he is well over 21. They took him aside and talked to him for a few minutes, ultimately turning us all away! Went to Genuine Liquorette and Top Hops instead :)",2,,
11,Laura C M.,"Capitola, CA",0,8,1,5.0,12/1/2017,"This has got to be the most hospitable brood of bouncers in the LES. These guys take care of you once you step into their bar. Felt like part of the family all night. Best pizza around?  Best late night food? Can I get more of that good tequila?  Check, check and check. Great crowd of people. Sexy as hell. Went here for a bday party downstairs and will keep comin' back!",,,
12,Nadirah H.,"New York, NY",1,8,1,5.0,8/26/2017,I love Max Fish it's probably one of my favorite bars in nyc. Its for the cool kids which can be hard to find with the changes of LES. But this bar is lit. They play the best music on both floors. The drinks aren't pricey. It does get packed in the summer but hey thats new york for you. If your looking to dance to good music this is the pace,,,
13,Talia D.,"ASTORIA, NY",233,76,30,4.0,9/23/2016,"I have no idea what this place is or is trying to be, and I don't care either. It's weirdly bright in here, there's odd decorations, the bathrooms are horrific, there's a pool table that is inconveniently placed for everyone involved.....Still don't care. The music is so good that it drowns out any identity issues of the actual space. The kind of music and dancing that I had to nearly be dragged out at closing bc I didn't want to leave. The crowd is eclectic and diverse, I respect it. If you like bOb bar, you'll prolly like it here (though bOb still numba 1 for me) There's a downstairs that gave me claustrophobia with just the mere sight of how many heads were down there, I didn't bother, so can't comment on it. There was one person behind the bar and for how crowded it was, I thought he handled it pretty well. Drinks are average, not the strongest and not the weakest but cheap. You do you Max Fish.",3,4,2
14,Suzie C.,"Jersey City, NJ",86,4,4,1.0,3/13/2018,"First of all, you need to move the pool table right next to the DJ booth and bar because it led to myself being SHOVED by a man than another male coworker of mine getting punched in the face by the same guy. The worst part is security just asked the two guys to keep their distance from each other, didn't even kick out the guy that assaulted me and my coworker. It was only when I defended myself and threw a cup at the guy was when I was KICKED OUT since I did it in front of the bar manager (the guy that pushed me/punched my coworker got to stay).  This was all because the people playing pool was getting annoyed by the regular bar patrons drinking and dancing getting in each others way. Just know if you are a female or anyone and get assaulted, nothing will be done by any of the staff/security. I did call the police and the guy was eventually arrested but the staff here sucks and don't care about anyone being assaulted at their bar so stay away from this shit hole!",,,
15,Iqrah C.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",297,54,19,1.0,7/12/2017,"This place sucks in every entirety of the word. A true new Yorker, I've been to several dive bars and bars of similar nature, this was quite the opposite. The bouncers are incredibly rude and dismissive. I came one summer night with a bunch of friends and they turned down one of my friends ID. Stating the ID didn't ""match"" they denied entry. I was reeling because this bar is quite underwhelming so it wasnt like there was huge line or people begging to get inside; the lack of demand is what really surprised me- why so resistant to letting people in? The vibe is hipster and tires easily. Drinks are watered down but cheap. My friend was disappointed and we decided to go to a different bar all together. This experience just goes to show how flip floppy these places can be and laughable. Never coming here again",,,
16,Dylan S.,"New York, NY",322,21,9,5.0,3/28/2016,"My friends and I arrived at Max Fish in the Lower East Side at around 12:15AM. We marched straight through the doors down to the basement where there was some ground-shaking electronica music playing. Luckily, I wore my finest low-top dancing sneakers and was ready to cut this place a mighty fine rug. MY THREE KEYS TO RUG-CUTTING SUCCESS:1. NEVER SMILE - IT SHOWS WEAKNESS TO YOUR FELLOW DANCERS 2.  MAKE EYE-CONTACT WITH THE DJ/MUSICIAN ONCE EVERY EIGHT MINUTES3. IF YOU DON'T START THE DANCE CIRCLE, YOU'RE NOT IN THE DANCE CIRCLEAfter grabbing some cheap beverages we circled up on the dance floor letting all the patrons know things were about to get serious. There were a total of six of us and we went straight into The Hustle, then got real funky with a reversed Electric Slide, and finally capped off our routine with an extended Funky Chicken. We continued this for two hours and left our entire hearts and souls out on the dance floor. The music was a sensational mix of funk and modern-day electronica put together by a legend of the underground scene, DJ Preskool. We owe him and the rest of Max Fish a drink for a wonderful night.

17,Julian M.,"Queens, NY",39,67,37,4.0,2/17/2016,"I enjoyed my visit here, I thought the staff was friendly enough.  The crowd were good people too, minus the overly pretentious socialist dude I was talking politics with that thought yelling ""no you're wrong"" in my face constitutes a good natured political discourse.  But hell, it's what you get when you do bar politics.The decorations are creepy weird on purpose.  I think it's supposed to be art or something.Loaded with smart and creative people.  You'll have good talks here, but it's better earlier.  Don't wait for it to get mobbed up and stupid.",2,2,2
18,MaraLee E.,"New York, NY",4,212,12,4.0,1/1/2017,"Gotta give a shout out to them. Every time I've gone they never charge at the door, love them for that! Not like other pretentious places in nyc...the crowd is SO diverse and I love that. Top floor will be playing one music and the bottom floor is like a whole different world. People are cool, one time there was this old dj that can be my grandpa but he was grrrrrreat. Gotta love it",,1,2
19,Kerry M.,"New York, NY",115,39,14,1.0,9/25/2015,"Not what it used to be.  I live in the neighborhood and this bar is so obnoxiously inconsiderate.  Fights outside that don't get broken up, the door left open with music blaring at 2 & 3am and the bouncers do nothing.  Sloppy drunks...not cute.  Used to have a chill vibe now it is just filled with douchery ... eh, next. UPDATE: Ladies beware...two women were roofied and date raped a couple of weeks ago just before Thanksgiving.",7,1,
20,Kenedi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,23,7,5.0,1/6/2017,"Had the best time here on Thanksgiving weekend 2016. Friendly bartenders, great music and fun people! I'll be back my next trip to NYC!",,,
21,James L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,2,3.0,7/19/2017,Cool spot with no cover and no club ratio / formal dress code. Sometimes can get really really live and sometimes can just get really dry. Hit or miss spot to me. Cheap drinks and in lower east side! What else can you ask for?,,,
22,Christopher C.,"Denver, CO",425,1544,295,2.0,6/25/2016,"meh, just not the same, nothing special here. they should have never tried to re-open it again.",1,1,1
23,Rex M.,"New York, NY",0,24,1,4.0,10/31/2015,"Friendly staff , pinball, tastefully decorated . multiple restrooms. Fun place to crack a brew. 2 bad things... 1. Tooooooo bright. Turn down the lights                         2. No beer & shot deal.I'll live... Still a cool place.",,1,
24,Anna T.,"New York, NY",46,21,1,3.0,4/11/2015,"Given what Max Fish once was prior to the re-birth... this bar is a nice try. The drinks are a little pricey during standard hours, the crowd is hit or miss and the vibe is trying a little bit too hard to look like the new location has been there for a few decades. I'll make a stop for a drink once in a while but it's not something I'd go out of my way for.",4,,
25,Edmund L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,1,5.0,8/29/2016,"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars in the city. I don't care if the other reviews say the old location was cooler, I'm not that cool anyways. The drinks are cheap, the crowd is eclectic and the music is ratchet. Definitely a farcry from the average lame posh LES bars that cater to people who like lines and by lines I mean queuing.",,2,
26,Emily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,12,1,5.0,5/21/2016,My go - to bar for over a year now. Jamal and the rest of the staff are friendly and super dope. The music is always on point in terms of old skool to contemporary hip hop and r and b tracks. There's generally great dancing going on here. You can get cheap tecate and shoot some pool or check out occasional art and music expos happening upstairs and in the basement. Still my favorite spot to cut a rug :),1,,
27,Miranda P.,"New York, NY",2,6,0,1.0,1/23/2016,Not like it used to be. Was a really chill place with an overall good vibe and a mix of people but lowlifes who think they're sh*t have ruined it. Go here if you want to be harassed by scumbags who boost their damaged egos by preying on women.  Hope they can change things around because it's not a safe environment for anyone.,4,,1
28,Madick C.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",10,47,17,3.0,3/12/2016,Waiting for a friend to get off work. Chill place was empty when I walk in a full by the time I got out. Throw back urban music and Bruce lee was on. Great 30min,1,,
29,Catherine V.,"New York, NY",6,27,1,4.0,3/14/2016,"I personally like this place because of the decor, ambiance, and the cheap drinks. But I have heard it used to be way cooler and better. Things change o'well what are you going to do. The only negative thing I will say about this place is that the bartenders do kind of suck. They take about 9 years to give you a drink, its not even funny.",1,,
30,Victoria V.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,57,10,5.0,8/4/2014,So effing happy this place has moved and reopened. I look forward to many more drunken nights. I'm just happy a little piece of the LES has been preserved. It's changed so much and this revamp is heartening.,7,2,3
31,Jasmine S.,"Oakland, CA",113,28,0,3.0,1/5/2015,Based on three visits.Pros:Eclectic mix of people - mostly kind/accommodating. Friendly door staff.Pool table.Cons:The bartenders are either annoyed/disinterested or outright dick-ish.Beer selection is disappointing.,1,,1
32,Brittany V.,"Barceloneta, Barcelona, Spain",374,66,59,3.0,4/1/2016,"Pretty small but love the ambiance, pool table and pinball machine. Downstairs very intimate setting with the DJ. I'd def go again",,,1
33,Stephanie C.,"Manhattan, NY",319,297,30,4.0,11/24/2015,A really cute place but best to go on a Monday night when there's no crowd. $3 PBRs and cheap drinks with funky decoration.,1,,
34,anna f.,"New York, NY",2,25,0,5.0,7/7/2015,Walked past the bar after seeing a movie to see if anything was going on and saw a guy rip his shirt open in the middle of the street and six guys tackle him to the ground. So sick 5 stars would def stand outside this bar again.,5,17,2
35,Claudia G.,"Bronx, NY",1,15,1,5.0,4/9/2016,Dope vibes here not expensive the Djs were DOPEEE Played all the jams. It was super lit definitely gets pretty crowded and after some time it gets rowdy but very chill dope spot,,,
36,Judi R.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,15,1,1.0,5/30/2015,"Used to come here in the 90s and then back again in 2010 or so. Who the f-ck are they trying to kid? Bartenders who hail from the outer boroughs and their goateed friends from Cleveland who seem to think its ""classic New York"" to act like a douche in the name of pretension. Give it a rest, guys. You're the actual people that ruined the neighborhood back in the day",7,6,
37,Alexander M.,"New York, NY",116,18,7,4.0,8/31/2015,"Local go to spot... Pool table, great music and cool vibe... The bar gets crowded but the main reason I go there is the $8 Jameson.. Come on $8 for a Jameson... In the city... Gotta love that",1,,
38,Christina W.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,4,5.0,1/2/2017,"Max Fish was suggested by a bartender to us on our first night out in NYC. Max Fish was definitely a chill, non-pretentious bar where we could just hang out and chat over cheaper beers all night. Malik was our bar tender and he was fantastic! Such a personable guy who made our experience fun and super welcoming.",,,
39,Angel W.,"Melbourne, Australia",33,155,19,4.0,11/11/2015,"So glad this awesome dive is back open again. An awesome mix of grungy art kids, skaters, hipster twenty something's and the children of rock stars. The drinks aren't super cheap but this crowd has more money than the kids at say Welcome to the Johnson's. Fun for people watching, fun for drinking!",,,
40,Sara L.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",48,1,0,1.0,10/14/2016,This place is awful.  The bartenders are overintitled assholes. Don't go the bartenders are awful,,,
41,Lee G.,"Union, NJ",10,82,126,3.0,4/20/2015,"I'm giving it three stars only because the place itself was pretty cool. The bathroom stalls are completely covered in graffiti , the have a celeb clock wall , and a pool table covered in stickers. As far as the staff goes, I hate to say they suck but the bartender on staff while I was there was extremely rude. Not really sure why she was even working there if she was going to be that way, so that completely changed my time there. Not worth going back, places like that, in the lower east side are a dime a dozen.",1,,
42,Andrew S.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,3,0,2.0,9/7/2014,"Came to New York on vacation and came here because a friend said it was the coolest.  Showed up and the atmosphere was alright.  The music selection was great (a mix of reggae, metal, hardcore, and punk). But where max fish loses me is the beer select, which is why you come to a bar.  10 different types all in bottles or cans, no drafts, and nothing local.  I have to say, I'm disappointed.",2,4,1
43,Stefanie P.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",4,11,8,1.0,1/16/2016,This place doesn't deserve any stars. If you are a female avoid at all costs unless you want to be harassed by rude staff.,1,,
44,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",15,10,2,2.0,8/15/2014,"Not going to lie, I didn't go in for more than 10 min.... but I had good reason. I LOVED the vibe of the old Max Fish. This is absolutely as far from the old Max Fish as possible, which was disappointing to me for sure. It looks like an art gallery now (which was what the space was before they turned it into a bar). The lamps looked cool, but the lighting was weird (bright for the art pieces). Maybe because I had such high expectations to be at the old bar, is why I was so highly disappointed.... but truly it just seemed lame.",,1,1
45,Liz I.,"Sunnyside, NY",54,75,2,2.0,9/25/2014,"I had really high hopes for this Max Fish. I was super excited it reopened, as were a couple of my friends, so we decided to go there to check it out for one of their birthday celebrations. First, there was a LINE. a freakin line for max fish. I heard one guy walk by and just shocked said ""a line, since when?!"" then when it finally started moving the bouncer checked my ID and checked my friends and the bouncer then tells me to go inside and that my friend will catch up. I was still putting things away in my bag when the bouncer tells me to go in again and then grabs me by the shoulder and pushes me through the door as other people were coming out and then yells at me about it. Obviously not the same ol' max fish, took half hour to get a drink because the bartenders were too busy ignoring the huge crowd of people because their friends showed up, so they were all huddled in the corner hanging out. Music was good actually, but it's almost as if this place became kind of a night club. I left after my 1 drink and went somewhere else.",2,1,1
46,Zander N.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,1/7/2015,"Not nearly as fun as the old location but not nearly as bad as some other bars in the lower east side. The bar staff can be uninterested in newcomers which is off putting. I guess it's their bar and they can do as they please, however there's no need to be jerks. Yet still it's a cool bar that I enjoy my time at, once my drinks are in hand.",1,,
47,Karl T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,1,1.0,3/7/2015,Average bar. Door guy on the Friday night was a complete C U Next Tuesday. Drinks are kinda of pricey for bar like this.,,,
48,Mark R.,"Royersford, PA",0,3,0,1.0,10/18/2015,"I left the bar for a moment to give my friend a call and then the doorman wouldn't let me back in. He acted as if my id wasn't real even though the other doorman checked me in thirty minutes ago. I clearly am and look over 21. The doorman then proceeded to not give my id back.  He told me to find another form of ID in my wallet that had my birthday on it. Well thats the point of having a driver's license, but I don't think he understands that. My credit card or insurance card aren't going to have my birthday on it. Eventually after refusing to leave without him giving my ID back, he handed it over. It was obvious that this guy was just f**king with me, but I don't feel like a returning or new customer should have to deal with that. A little advice to the owner of this ""establishment"": If you're going to have uneducated, power hungry doorman who most likely still live with their parents in Queens, check people in then why don't you invest in a legit ID scanner instead of just having these goons eyeball it. It will make operations much smoother and it will allow them to do even less then they need to as they post up in front of the place fronting and reeking of weed (most likely mids btw). Overall, this place provides no customer service at all and doesn't even have beers on draft. There's plenty of bars two blocks down so I would advise anyone to go there over here.",1,,
