0,Nancy T.,"Wilmington, DE",58,145,1232,4.0,6/15/2018,"Nothing too fancy but its 24/7 and was open for me when my sweet tooth was aching. We stopped by here after dinner to get some sweets to bring back to our hotel room. They also have pizza and sandwiches/wraps. We got a slice of cheesecake w/strawberries & a giant chocolate chip cookie. Nothing special, the cookie was a bit ""firm"" but the cheese cake was good. Service was fast and friendly, was clean inside. They had a wide variety of sweets from cakes to cookies, donuts, cheese cake and fruit tarts and more. There were about 2 groups of other patrons dining in. and 1 or 2 people in and out. So this place seems pretty steady to me. If around and craving stuff late night again I will def return if in town.",,,3
1,Joyce R.,"Tulsa, OK",29,192,407,3.0,11/4/2018,"Hungry roaming near hotel in Manhattan.  Hubby wanted a slice and here we were. Open 24 hrs. Discount to Mount Sinai employees. Reviews are so mixed. We were fine. Grabbed drinks and a couple slices at window. Pleasant employees. Immediately fulfilled my glass/ice request. The pizza was fine. I've had better white. Needed more garlic imho. Place seems really small but people get packed in. Family atmosphere. Locals galore. Then hubby asked if I wanted a cannoli.  Big mistake. I luv cannoli. But this shell was cold, soggy with flavorless filling. Very reasonably priced: $6 for ham/Swiss on croissant, waffles & pancakes $7; scallion bagel $3.75; burger $8, or cheeseburger on brioche $9. Slices of cheesecake $6. You get the idea. With bountiful choices.",,,
2,Stephanny P.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,2,1,3.0,10/23/2018,This is the type of place you find yourself in at 2 am after a night of partying when nothing else is open. The guys were very friendly and service was quick. Their menu looks good and its pretty cheap. We tried their pepperoni and cheese pizzas. They were okay... I mean... pizza is good no matter how crappy it is. But it tastes like every other crappy pizza you get at those Pizza & Fried Chicken places in Jersey. I would like to stop by again but this time I'll make sure to pick something else from the menu.,,,
3,Monique L.,"Irvine, CA",0,11,0,2.0,7/28/2018,Came here because I was craving for Pancakes.So I ordered the Pancakes and added the strawberries because why not.Then I decided to Order the Chai. They kept asking if I wanted chai latte? I said yes. And specifically said small. The order came out to be almost $14z. What the heck?! I saw that they charged me for a large Cappuccino which is like almost $2 more than Chai and  on top of that he charged me for the almond milk - which I know it's normal! But GeeZ!Anyways it tasted bad so don't order that. Pancake yeah skip that too . They also give you a bad pancake syrup and strawberries are not fresh. I think they are the frozen ones. I honestly don't know what the deal is with the cashier. Why are you charging more than you are supposed to. I even addressed to him that he charged me more and he said no and I was like whatever but I shouldn't have left that passedThe Manager was nice but this problem need to be fixed,1,,1

6,Cindy I.,"West Orange, NJ",0,2,2,3.0,9/13/2018,I was looking for something quick and yummy and my friend recommended this place I had a tuna melt and it was good I give it only three stars because the lady at the cashier I was told her name is Ruth was extremely rude ! She was annoyed that I told her that the piece of cheesecake wasn't the one I asked her.. she brought out the whole tray of cheesecake slices and slammed it out the counter and tossed the original slice in the garbage I didn't appreciate her attitude. Other than that the place was cool.,2,,
7,Veronica M.,"Kihei, HI",4,45,3,3.0,10/27/2018,"I got a #4 here which is the breakfast wrap and you get to choose 3 veggies + a cheese. I got spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes and provolone. It was EXTREMELY bland. I also specifically asked for a wheat wrap and received a white wrap. It literally tasted like I was eating a plain tortilla. Pretty tasteless. The pancakes looked great and prices were reasonable, but I feel like I don't have a good reason to go back.",,,
8,Peter M.,"Alexandria, VA",118,458,201,5.0,3/28/2018,"Bottom line: One of the Best breakfast spots in NYC near Central Park.YELP ELITE  ALERT: I posted a check in, and the owner/Manager immediately came over to say hello and hoped we liked the meal. She gave us a short history of Fluffy's Donuts, and how they moved to their current location- and ""OMG"" - NYC SHOP RENT COST PER MONTH!!! (Yeah, I left a nice tip after I heard that!) She then went and helped others dining, and generally tidied up. She had that ""NYC Soul"" to her, which included a smile and a guarded happiness inside. If you get approached- say you appreciate her coming over! We did!More story: We came up for a visit to NYC to catch a show on Broadway, and we're staying near Central Park. A fellow foodie friend in DC (Thanks Beth!) recommended Fluffy's after asking where she had been. This classic deli style storefront has foodie ambassador written all over it. Inside, short order cooks whip up everything you could want in a meal within minutes. Seating is fast turnover, and there is ample rail seating if you are by yourself. (10% discount for student and medical staff!) Highly recommend breakfast here, because the food quality is very good and farm fresh to the counter. Plenty of to go items and fast snacks too.For me, I ordered a egg white omelette with veggies (darn diet!) that was one of the best I've ever had. Got the platter with home fries (cubed fried potatoes with onions and pepper) and thick toast - which are worth the carbs and odd shekel. Latte with almond milk was pretty good too. Wife had pancake & eggs, daughter had a NYC bagel and both were happy. Tried a small bite of pancake - and definitely ones from scratch with a welcomed hint of corn to them. Kid (8+) friendly. Definitely on my list to revisit. Price: For downtown NYC - ""fo-geht"" about it. Worth it. Go, eat, soak it in. Watch people. Definitely a good student drop in spot.",1,,2
9,Christopher T.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,9,3,5.0,6/11/2018,"This is my second meal here at Fluffy's in New York. The first time I got the Philly Cheese steak and it was phenomenal. It was a great sized serving and the flavor was delicious. The owner spent some time talking to us and recommending food and telling us about some things we should do and try in New York.My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal so we decided to come back for breakfast today. The owner was here again so I decided to ask him what he suggested for breakfast. His suggestion was either #8 (French toast with bacon and fresh fruit) or the California breakfast burrito. There was 4 of us so we got 2 CA breakfast burritos, 1 #8, and 1 #5 (2 eggs with toast, home fries, and bacon/sausage/ham).The food was amazing. The serving size wasn't massive, but it was definitely filling. You could tell the food was cooked with quality ingredients. The owner was awesome, he sat down and chatted with us and really made the experience. If you are thinking of coming to Fluffy's, it shouldn't be a question, 10/10 recommend.",,,
10,Howie K.,"Albuquerque, NM",4168,1331,4551,4.0,1/4/2018,"Dear Fluffy's,It may be a few years until we return, but when we do, I'd like to make a request: don't tell my daughter about the Black & White cookie.First of all, we were really impressed by your overall menu selections, nice job. It wasn't so long ago that corner diners and delis in NYC only offered grease for breakfast, lunch and dinner; you guys are a true exception, providing plenty of healthy green options, like salads and quinoa bowls and tasty veggie sammies. Of course, in the end, the tourist got the best of me and I shoveled a slice of pepperoni and sausage down my throat but, hey, I felt better knowing I had options. But getting back to that request. So when we first sat down, this nice woman -- I'm assuming she was an owner -- walked over and handed my daughter a frosted donut with sprinkles, saying ""Eat your lunch and you may have this for dessert."" Look, I'm generally Scrooge about strangers pushing sugar on my kid, but that move, it warmed my heart. And then a few minutes later, this nice man -- again, assuming he's an owner -- came by and handed my kid a Black & White cookie, a big one. At this point my kid was just ecstatic: sugary treats for two solid days! I told her I would save her cookie so she could eat it tomorrow.As soon as that kid left my sight, I ate the Black & White cookie.My kid totally forgot all about it.Don't remind her.It was absolutely delightful, by the way.Sincerely, A Guilty Dad",8,11,6

The worst chicken wrap that I've ever eaten!! $14 bucks for a wrap and oj.Let's start with the wrap, I asked for white cheese and got an overwhelming amount of yellow American cheese.

15,Kaitlyn F.,"New York, NY",252,42,43,5.0,5/20/2018,"This is my all time favorite spot to order lunch while at work. It is centered perfectly between both my offices, and I pretty much order form there every Thursday. There are so many options to choose from so there is really something for everyone to enjoy. It is also great for catering. My team has ordered for large meetings, and the portions are huge, delicious, and the service always delivers.I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich. It comes with chipotle aioli that is to die for. They also give you a side of chips that you can dip in the aioli. I'd seriously put that aioli on a shoe and eat it. The chicken is perfectly grilled and pairs nicely with the aioli. The sandwich is huge and is served on a hamburger-ish type bun. It is not too much bread, but enough to keep everything together.  I have also gotten wraps and salads from here as well. They will pretty much make anything that you request and it always ends up being delicious. The prices are reasonable and the service is quick. You do have the option to sit and eat or take out. I usually take out, but I have sat inside as well. I always leave here extreme satisfied, and will be back next Thursday :)",,,

It is quick cheap eats to satisfy a craving of the now and it fulfills that purpose.

However, the lady who works the register on Saturday mornings is extremely rude and unwelcoming. Today my partner and I had an awful experience with her. We ordered 35 dollars worth of food and then we paid with a credit card. We then decided we wanted to add strawberries to our order, we told her and she said ""ugh, okay that will be 2.5 extra,"" in a very grumpy way. We handed her the credit card and she pointed to the ""5 dollar minimum"" sign after we already spent 35 bucks there.  I have never had this happen to me anywhere in New York before, this is extremely inappropriate.

However this morning I popped into Fluffy's after the gym and was hoping for breakfast but realized I was too late in the day. Instead, I selected one of their quinoa bowls (mixed in broccoli, kidney beans, walnuts and a sesame ginger sauce) and was so incredibly happy as I was eating it. Delicious, fresh ingredients.I also ordered a coffee with soy milk, more because I like the taste and not because I'm lactose intolerant. They had run out of soy milk at the counter, but someone left to find more that had recently been delivered. I was happy to wait or swap for cream, nibbling on my food but the manager (owner?) Spiro rushed over and offered a free bottle of water while I waited. I declined, as I had my own bottle, but thought that was very kind. He also hand delivered my coffee once it was ready, and suggested I make use of the free condiments to add more flavor up my dish.

61,Matt K.,"New York, NY",263,93,22,4.0,6/26/2016,"To preface, Fluffy's is your standard, very crowded midtown cafe swarming with tourists (this place is steps from Carnegie Hall, Times Square, and Central Park).  That said, the food here  is shockingly incredible (particularly the breakfast specials) and more than worth the commotion.  As someone who lived half a block from Fluffy's for two years, there is something about the way they make french toast (and I can't figure out what it is) that makes their french toast some of the best in Manhattan.  The custom pasta option menu is also a favorite, with nearly every type of pasta, sauce, and add-in imaginable.  Outside of the bakery items (which Midtown cafes have a tendency to excessively markup), most of the menu items are very attractively priced (with most of the breakfast and dinner items anywhere from $5-8 dollars).  Service is fast and friendly.  Definitely swing by if you're in the area (and don't forget to try the French Toast).",5,,1

The owner came by and checked in on us as well, to ask if we were alright and offer us free black and white cookies to compliment our meal.As for the food, it was also pretty great! I had 2 slices of pizza which were better-than-most for a place like this, and my friend got a salad which she also really enjoyed.

I also love their yogurt and fruit parfaits that they make everyday fresh (as all their food is).Although I am unfamiliar with their pastries (I do not eat sugar or flour) but have been given great reports by good friends and family that have accompanied me to Fluffy's since I cannot let them miss out on this hidden gem.If you live here and have not stopped here, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

First off they were open despite the weather and all of the employees were so nice! I ordered a slice of pepperoni and sausage pizza as well as a vanilla donut. Both items were so good and filling! We also had the chance to meet the owner who shared with us how he got to own the shop. He was so kind, he even gave us free cookies. I enjoyed my meal and great customer service so much that I went there again for more pizza the next day lol I had the BBQ chicken pizza and the pepperoni with sausage again.

The food was a lil cold, obviously.. but, it was still good cause we were very hungry. My advice is to have milkshakes, fried pickles  and sweet potato fries on the menu.

So when I booked our hotel for this trip I looked for something close to fluffy's...true story. Our first stop today was fluffy's. They have up dated but still the same great food at a good price.

I've got another NYC trip coming up next week so naturally, last night, I dreamt about my mornings at Fluffy's. I guess there isn't anything subliminal about that. My sisters devoured their waffles with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. My father stuck to his morning routine, bagels with cream cheese and a hot Celestial tea (some earl grey flavor that it seems only Fluffy's carries), all while stealing bites from my sister's waffles. My mother savored every bit of her cheese and broccoli quiche (her favorite) while I stuck to my egg-white ""Healthy Omelet"" as they've branded it. Despite this all being in my dream, this hardly strays from reality. The food, especially breakfast, is delicious and delightful, made fresh right as you order it. The staff is always friendly. One morning they really spoiled us and gave us some complimentary pastries that we had no idea where we're going to fit in our stomachs. Last summer, they knew my father had been hunting for that Celestial tea and gave him a box to take home with him (should have seen him at home, like a kid on Christmas morning, every morning). They're always fun to chat with and despite how busy it can get in their little bakery during the morning commuter hours, they're always on top of things. Fluffy's is a spot I wouldn't pass up. As long as we visit The Big Apple, we'll keep coming back.Side note: Last year, I bought a Fluffy's mug, which unfortunately didn't make it in one piece on the trip home. Good thing we're going back :)",3,2,2

A business has one hair out of place and it's ""NO SOUP FOR YOU....ONE STAR!!!!""This is a fantastic little gem in the heart of midtown and anyone who is visiting owes it to themselves to try to stop here for coffee, breakfast, lunch, whatever. It's absolutely fantastic and the family who runs it (for over 38 years, it started off as a bakery) is delightful. If you are tired of paying $20-$30 for a continental breakfast at your Midtown hotel, then take a little spin around the corner (7th and 55th) and grab a delicious bite. The prices are fantastic, the food is made fresh daily and very authentic and you will leave with a happy, warm and full belly and a smile on your face. We love to get their quiche for breakfast. It's fantastic, just rich, creamy, light and fluffy, but nicely filling. For lunch, try one of their paninis and definitely have some homemade soup. The vegetable is like my Grandmother used to make...just fantastic and tasty and perfect for a light lunch on a cold day. The owner chatted with us today and was so sweet and gracious, and made sure we loved our meal and even brought us a few melt-in-your-mouth Greek cookies to finish our meal, on the house. What a wonderful touch....Tables are small, but it's cozy and wonderful and although people have complained about a lack of space, again, get over it. The food and service MORE than make up for any space issues. Good food (for a good price) is a GOOD THING. Ignore the whining nay-sayers because frankly, they will find fault anywhere they go. Eat here. You will love it and tell your friends about it, and you will DEFINITELY be a customer for life.Yes, it's that good. Oh, and be sure to get a Fluffy's red coffee mug while you're there (which entitles you to a free cup of Joe). I love my mug and start my morning every day with a little cup of Fluffy's!",6,2,2

I ordered an omelette through Grubhub at around 11:20 am  and received a message that my food is going to be ready in an hour at 12:20-12:30pm. The place is literally 3 blocks away from my location. However, after it's been an hour and a half (12:50pm) I called the restaurant and the guy on the phone said that  ""it's Thanksgiving and he has 100 people in front of him"" and that they will have to ""remake"" my order. After I tried to get an answer on what does he mean by ""remake"" , if it has or hasn't been made yet, he would only say ""I have 100 people in front of me"". Well, I'm really sorry about that? And then he finally said that it hasn't been made yet.I work in the same industry for years. I understand that you can get slammed. I understand that it's a holiday and you're busy. It happens. But you can't just assume that people wouldn't have a problem waiting for delivery for 2 hrs ( best case scenario, taking into consideration that they still would have to cook and deliver it after 1,5 hrs. What if I didn't call?). If you're busy or the kitchen is busy you have to be considerate enough to at least call and let the customer know that there will be a delay and if they are okay with that. People understand. Or you can say ""unfortunately at this time we can't make your order, sorry about that"". No big deal.

Updated review","I have not had any of the baked goods, so I cannot judge based on that. I have, however, had their pizza and falafel. The pizza was not good by any means, and the falafel was decent. Let it be known that though the food is below average, Fluffy's is CHEAP comparatively, especially for it's location. I stayed at a hotel close by for a week, and Fluffy's was a great, affordable option.",,22,

Updated review",After eating two lemons for rejections in a span of two days I so needed comfort food.  Since there were no Crumbs in the nearby vincity of my workplace Fluffy's for sweets during my lunch break works for me.At $4.00 per cupcake it was certainly no Crumbs standards but came close.  Fluffly's is revamping their take-out menus but is one of the very few bakeries that offer business cards.,2,1,2

The small was pretty large and I shared with my son.My husband had a turkey cobb wrap, he was still talking about it hours later. I had a turkey sandwich - which again was pretty decent. The spicy mayo they provide has a little kick, but not spicey. My son is a pastaholic, and he had a fresh made alfredo with bacon and mushrooms (the pasta came from the fridge, but the rest was made to order right there and you can pick 3 add ins and its no more for the 6.95- he ate it all, he NEVER eats it all.

Although I just had a heavy lunch, I could not resist the cheesecake calling my name. It is my serious weakness.The price for one slice of any of their cakes was more than what I was carrying (I had $4.37) and it nearly dashed my hopes of enjoying my favorite treat. After five minutes of debating with myself, I decided to pull out the credit card, ordered a slice, and ran back to my office. I sneaked the cake to my desk past all the vulchers in the accounting department and stuffed my face with the cake. Much to my chagrin, the cheesecake was not that good. It was spongy and soft.

Best desserts in New York? Fuhgeddaboutit! But then, I will always give yelp's reviews the benefit of the doubt and cast cynicism aside - so I thought be bold, try the place, maybe I had missed out on and passed by this gem while traipsing around the city.It's a standard deli - with a very cheerful and friendly staff. I wasn't here for salad or sandwich, so I looked around the dessert offerings - pretty standard as you would find in any deli - be it Food Merchants / Cafe Metro...By now I was committed to sample the goodies and so ordered the Mudpie cake with Cappuccino - The rating is for the Capuccino and service, or it would have been lower.As they teach in behavior and management classes: Satisfaction = Outcome - Expectation. If my expectations had been lower, I may have been satisfied!But, this is an opinion of one - as yet, I am in the minority here. The brownies indeed did look fresh.

181,ELIZABETH d.,"Huntington Beach, CA",137,77,14,1.0,6/18/2012,"This place was terrible!!!  Ugh, was in NY on business, and I must say, I was saddened by the poor quality of food that we had just about EVERYWHERE that we ate.  My coworkers and I were craving a sweet treat after seeing a show, so we stopped at this little place to satisfy our little craving.  We got a red velvet cake to share.  It was SUUUUUUUUUPER dry.  This was probably the worst red velvet I've ever had.  It tasted like it had been sitting there for a week.  We each took 1 bite and tossed it.  The crappy taste was NOT worth the calories.  Sad day in NY",,,

183,Sarah C.,"Norwalk, CT",182,223,3,1.0,3/3/2012,"This place is vile and should be shut down. I went here once and only once to order a coffee and a biscotti. As i was looking at the glass cases of goodies, a freaking cockroach 2 inches long ran across the cupcakes. Appalled, I ran out of there and never came back. Avoid this place like the plague - there are tons of other places in the area where you can get sanitary food",,,
184,Zach L.,"Brooklyn, NY",106,46,0,2.0,8/1/2011,"I was in a hurry to get to a play, while dealing with a massive craving for a chicken caesar wrap and a hole in my stomach. I ran in here and sadly, they were out of caesar wraps, but no time to waste, so I opted for the buffalo chicken wrap. I was sorely disappointed; ""served hot"" meant microwaved and the chicken was really tough. The people behind the counter weren't responsive or helpful. I was on the go, but if it happens again, I won't be going here.",1,,
185,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,672,0,4.0,9/4/2013,"Passed it on the way to work million times and decided to give it a try today for my personal breakfast favorite-eggs and cheese on a wrap because the usual place where I would get this before has not been so good lately, not mixing the white and the yolk, stale wraps, or too much cheese.  Fluffy's was perfect-the eggs were mixed well, there was enough cheese to provide gooey goodness but not clog my arteries, the wrap was warm and soft, excuse the pun, but the wrap was fluffy, and it melted in my mouth.  Also, it stayed hot while I walked a long block to my office, used the bathroom, washed my hands and made coffee.  And, it was only $3.54, yum, will be stopping here again and maybe try them for lunch.  The place seems clean and some of the sandwiches were not the usual grub you get at every Midtown deli.",,1,
186,Andrew B.,"Cambridge, MA",6,66,0,2.0,2/17/2011,"Came in about 10pm to pick up dinner to go. Service was fast. Price was fine. Black&white was passable, although I had to remind them to put it in my bag, which I got the feeling was intentional. Falafel was--I kid you not--microwaved. The person in front of me walked out when he saw them microwaving his pasta; I should have followed suit.This place is for dumb, desperate tourists.",1,,1
187,Mia K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",239,496,18,5.0,11/15/2006,"Think you've tried it all?  If you haven't been to Fluffy's - your dessert taste buds have yet to lose their virginity!Fluffy's is a small cafe and bakery just above Times Square (about half way between Times Square and Central Park), and it's a nice leisurely walk away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square (read: lots of fun little touristy shops to stop in between Times Square and Fluffy's) specializing in lunches and the best desserts in New York City.The first time I went to Fluffy's was purely accidental.  We stumbled in after grabbing a bite at the infamous Ray's Pizza and decided to try a dessert. - One was not enough!  No, they're not small.  On the contrary, the portions are quite large, but your tongue just can't get enough of each flavorful rich morsel.After my first trip to Fluffy's, to my waist-line's dismay, Fluffy's became a weekly thing.  I wouldn't even go to Times Square or Central Park.  I would take the train to the city just to get a dessert from Fluffy's and then get back on the 7.  I found myself driving from Paterson, Astoria, even Nassau just to get more Fluffy's!  Even worse, I found myself telling everyone about Fluffy's and making them come with me, spreading my addictive illness.I can't even recommend 1 dessert over another because they're all so amazing. . . By far the best desserts in New York (which in turn makes them the best in the world!)",4,2,4
188,Dylan S.,"Silicon Valley, CA",2,431,31,4.0,10/29/2013,"had the regular cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, chocolate canoli, chocolate mud pie.  yes, I went overboard.   everything was great.",,,
189,Christina M. R.,"Long Island, NY",3,220,54,3.0,4/8/2007,"The desserts draw you in but the sweet meal deals get you to stay.  A wide variety of salads, quiches, fruit, and wraps that you can mix and match make for a filling meal that's easy on the wallet.  Then of course you can have dessert.  Choose from cookies, cakes, all kinds of puffy sweets.  Or have dessert first--be the rebel you've always wanted to be.The decor is cheesy.  The actual seating area is cramped and not very comfortable.  But this isn't a place you'll lounge in for hours on end anyway.",3,,1
190,Tony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,16,3,3.0,1/29/2011,"Good place to grab a bite for under $10, which is hard to come by in the city. Nothing extraordinary, but the service is quick and it's cheap.",1,,
191,V K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,152,0,2.0,7/25/2011,"I used to like Fluffy's okay. It's super close to the hotel I usually stay at in mid-town. The food is passable (nothing special) and cheap. During my trip to NY last week, I needed to grab a quick bagel breakfast so I went there to save time. I ordered a toasted sesame bagel and was told their toaster was broken. Um, okay a bagel place with no toaster? I left without ordering. The next day I unfortunately had to go back (out of desperation again) and jokingly asked the guy if their toaster was fixed. He said no. I really couldn't believe it--at least two days with no toaster? How about hopping over to a DR or CVS and buying a little toaster for the business? I left again without ordering.",,,
192,Joe X.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,222,4,1.0,6/5/2011,Avoid at all costs.  These were the worst desserts I have ever had.  Took a canoli and a chocolate mousse back to my hotel.  A three year old could make more edible desserts.  Absolutely awful!,,,
193,Ivy L.,"Philadelphia, PA",139,141,5,1.0,11/18/2010,This was the worst place Ive ever eaten at in NYC. Dirty diner like place... and dirty is being nice. We had hair in our food and no manager apologized or offered anything to make up for it. It was way over priced... the only good thing was the cake. We never were even offered refills of our drinks. I wish we would have left after seeing the scummy bathroom.,1,,

Ok.. maybe thats how it is, so ill let it slide. I then moved on to the velvet cake. This was a nasty one. It was very dry and tasted nothing like a velvet cake. None of the flavors were there. Its just a pretty looking cake. It was so unbearable that I had to spit it out. I was very disappointed. These are seriously a few days old. After a bite at each i threw both in the trash. What a waste of money. Please don't call yourself a bakery.",1,,
197,Kris M.,"New York, NY",3,12,1,3.0,12/26/2008,"My parents recently came to spend a long weekend in New York City forthe first time, effectively, ever.  They'd been here on a couple of day trips and my dad came for a few days once in the 1970s, but other than that, they've generally stayed pretty far from the city.Their hotel was across the street from Fluffy's, and my dad kind of fell in love with the place.  I think it was 50% the name that he liked, to be honest.  Something about saying ""I'm gonna run down to Fluffy's real quick"" is kind of appealing.As far as I can tell, Fluffy's is a deli like any other, but it caters to a lot more tourists and serves desserts.  The one time I joined my dad there, the price of a bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll seemed ridiculously high to me.  On the other hand, given the proximity to Times Square, they're probably charging the same as anyone else in the neighborhood.If you are visiting New York and staying close to Fluffy's, however, I would recommend paying them a morning visit.  The service isunusually friendly for a deli and the food is certainly cheaper than breakfast at your hotel or any of the sit-down restaurants nearby.And did I mention how fun it is to say ""Fluffy's""?",2,1,1
198,Jill S.,"Weatherly, PA",0,5,0,4.0,5/13/2012,"Love Fluffy's! I've been stopping here for lunch or dinner for a few years now and have never had a bad experience. Good food at reasonable midtown prices. The service has always been polite and that means alot. If you need to catch a quick but good meal, this place does not disappoint.",,,
199,William C.,"Austin, TX",0,4,0,4.0,11/27/2011,"The staff was really nice and friendly. :) My buffalo chicken sandwich was really delicious. I did not mind the fact that it was warmed up in a microwave. Granted, made-to-order would have been better, but you can find many chicken wraps much less tasty, microwaved or otherwise. My chocolate brownie was a little dry, but, once again, quite tasty. I was certainly not disappointed by Fluffy's, but it is only a few blocks away from where I'm staying. I would not describe it as a destination, but it is a cut above the generic chains, and their ingredients tasted healthy.",,,
