0,Jessica D.,"Wall Township, NJ",85,161,137,5.0,11/8/2018,"Went to see American Son with Kerry Washington at the Booth Theatre. This theatre is a little smaller then others and I am giving it five stars because I sat in the last row and I was able to hear every single performer clearly and every part of the stage was visible to me. I was not able to stop at my hotel to drop my stuff off and was panicking because I didn't know what I would do with my things. I called ahead and I was informed that they were able to hold my things for me ($2 per item), during the play which I really appreciate. The women's bathroom has a section blocked off outside of the stalls that allowed me to get myself together since I had to do a mad dash fro lm34th street to 45th. There are drinks and snacks that you are able to purchase in the front or in the basement which cuts down the line.",1,,1
1,Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",183,2014,3152,4.0,7/4/2018,"This intimate theater seats about 750, about half as many people as the bigger venues (I.e. Shubert & Winter Garden.) Perhaps that's why there seemed to be enough bathroom stalls in the ladies' room, for once! The theater seats, though quite close together, were clean & looked to be newly upholstered. We saw ""The Boys in the Band,"" a limited-run show with a star-studded openly-gay cast. From our seats, only about five rows back, we got a fabulous view of Matt Bomer in his skivvies for the first 10 minutes of the play. (Can you tell this was the highlight of my week?! Let's just say this was the first time I've hung around after a Broadway show to meet the cast.) Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, & Andrew Rannalls were the only other actors I recognized, but every single actor brought something amazing to the story & the stage; moments of vulnerability, humor, bitchiness, morality, violence, & self-hate tell the stories of gay men & their struggles with friendship & love. Though the play is set in the late-60s, the issues & overall message transcends time & is still relevant today. The script is witty & gripping & at times, heart wrenching. And this all takes place at a birthday party! Go see this revival before it leaves the Booth Theater in August. No intermission.",4,2,3

I saw it today June 13, 2018 at the Booth theatre and found it simply insightful and reminiscent of days past.  all scenes were set in a 2 floor appartment setting, back when mirrored walls, shagg carpet and sunken livingrooms where the latest crave. And oh gosh...so much red!. Beautiful red.I loved it. I found Zacharys' character to be a hoot!The cast also included Robin De Jesús as Emory, Brian Hutchison as Alan, Michael Benjamin Washington as Bernard, Tuc Watkins as Hank, and Charlie Carver as Cowboy.",,,1
3,Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3823,2159,6353,4.0,5/8/2018,"The Boys in the Band is now playing a limited run at the Booth Theatre. I had the pleasure of seeing a weekday matinee and enjoyed it very much!There was quite a bit of anticipation around this particular show, with a line down the block to get inside before 2 pm. That being said, once patrons were allowed inside, we moved quickly into our seats, grabbing some white wine along the way (because it's not an afternoon show without white wine!).Everyone working that day made sure to remind us several times that there was no intermission and once we exited the theater, we would not be allowed back inside. I'm sure that's often an issue and never hurts to repeat. The set design for this play is particularly awesome -- lots of smoky mirrors... and yes, there's plenty of man candy to enjoy. I particularly liked Andrew Rannells and Matt Bomer, they're two of my favorites anytime. One small complaint is that the street noise can be heard from inside the theatre, especially during a quiet moment during the show. NBD if the play is set in Manhattan or a busy city like it, but I can imagine that it could be problematic if that's not the setting. Beyond that, it was a true Broadway experience and I've been raving about Boys in the Band all week.",7,2,5

The seats were comfortable, the chairs were freshly covered, and the decor seemed restored from the original design.

The views can be limited on far sides (the sets tend to the middle and we missed almost a third of the stage with a row E far right seat), and in rear orchestra (setting second level of stage if there is a second level was rough).

And I believed them. But, it was a sold out show and the woman at the window did easily find my seat and had me wait in a corner for 15 minutes for the theater manager. As the show was sold out and everyone checked in she found my empty seat easily.I then heard her say "" he will have to climb over ten people.""  Well of course I would.  That was the seat I purchased.  She then closed her curtains. Like I was worse than I dog. No "" sorry sir, we can't help you or we can't be bothered,""  nothing.

We come from an alcohol related industry and know what the cost of a drink is. Really! $54 for a Dewars and water (no ice of course) and glass of wine. 3.

Men's bathroom only on bottom floor.Good acoustics and sight lines. As with most of these places the seating is a bit cramped with little leg room. Seats are padded and comfy though. Really good AC keeping the place cool. Nicely kept theater. It's been renovated very well.It gives off the vibe of a cozy spot to see a show as it's not one of the bigger venues.

22,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1107,1096,4.0,10/27/2016,"The Booth Theatre, located right next Junior's and across the street from the Marriott Marquis, is one of the smaller theatres in the area. In fact, it might be the smallest one I've been to so far on Broadway. The theatre features two seating areas: orchestra and mezzanine. Since the theatre is so small, even seats in the rear mezzanine offer a great view of the stage. We were in the side seats in the front mezzanine and were able to see everything on stage - and even the actors' faces! This doesn't often happen in bigger theatres, so it was a nice touch. I don't think there is a bad seat in the entire theatre! There was plenty of leg room for me in the mezzanine seats, which is not always the case (I'm looking at you, Majestic Theatre!). Souvenirs and drinks are standard Broadway prices. There are only two ladies stalls in the mezzanine restroom so using the restroom during intermission might be a bit of a problem if you're not fast enough to run to line up. We were probably 15 people in the line and only finished 3-5 minutes before intermission was over. They use warning bells here about 5 minutes before intermission is over and then again when intermission is almost over. I quite like this as it tells people they need to hurry up! The Booth is a solid theatre and I wouldn't mind returning again to see another play.",1,,1

I'm giving it one star because the attendant (an older black lady with a limp) in the upper floor was rude and screamed at me for my asking if there were more people coming in. ""WHY do you care"" she says. Obviously I'd want to know since she told the whole rear mezzanine to move closer before the show started. Downright rude, unprofessional, and inexcusable. And I was right to ask. Two parties that moved because of her had to move again during the show since some people came late. Pretty much ruined the whole experience for me.

25,Mark D.,"Miami, FL",42,315,872,4.0,6/22/2015,"My future Broadway diva daughters really wanted to see ""Hand to God"" and I had yet to attend a Broadway play, so I said WTF let's do it!! Daughter who lives in UWS of Manhattan suggested going early to the Booth to get ""rush"" tickets. These were very reasonably priced and easy to purchase, for a show nominated for multiple Tonys, and even though they were almost back row of the mezzanine, cashier said it's a small theater, you won't be disappointed. She was absolutely right. The view and the sound were just fine. A little hard to see the shaded nuances of the actor's expressions, but still not bad. The theater itself is ornate and beautiful. Seating is a little tight, but not intolerable 2 Jack n' Cokes were a tad pricey, but again, considering the show, I was ok with it. We attended the Friday, June 5th performance on the eve of the Tony Awards, and you could sense the excitement and optimism of the cast and the audience. Even though it didn't win, this play was still  great and thought provoking, and I laughed so hard my sides ached afterwards. The theater's location also was advantageous to us as Junior's Restaurant (see my review) is next door. Also, next to Juniors is a parking garage. For logistical reasons, I had to drive into NYC (ugh!) and the garage was $50 for about 5 hours, but at least it was close by.All in all, although all the expenses combined were a bit much, I had a very memorable time with the whole family attending a great play at the venerable Booth Theater.

Though I am sure they used to it at one particular part in the play the photo police stopped the person next to me from raising her camera up. Yes, it actually seemed to happen that fast -- as she was not even able to take a picture. Not that this is good or bad -- I know it is against the rules to do so -- but I was just surprised at the speed to which it happened.

Lots and lots of steps! I was winded and I workout so I feel bad for anyone over 40. But I really appreciate the austerity of this place. The dim lights and vintage furnisher makes for the matureness of the play. I didn't enjoy Glass Menagerie AT ALL. But that's because I'm a big kid inside. Ill stick with the musicals.

32,Edward R.,"Dallas, TX",41,42,224,2.0,11/14/2015,"REVIEW OF ""Hand To God"":I had heard Hand To God was offensively funny so I was expecting Book of Mormon (which was the most offensive musical I've ever seen and also the funniest musical I've ever seen). Well this is no Book of Mormon: it wasn't as overly offensive as Mormon (though it did pass it in a couple of ways in Act 2) and it wasn't nearly as funny. It was more like the non-musical parts of Team America: World Police had a love child with the non-musical parts of Avenue Q and they left it to be raised by the dad from Full House who had moved from San Francisco to Cypress, Texas.Speaking of, when I saw Hand To God, Bob Saget was playing the part of the pastor. He was the least funny of the five actors in the play, but it wasn't his fault: he just had the least funny lines. He actually acted the part well. The best lines are saved for a sock puppet.I did laugh a lot particularly in the second act which was much funnier than the first. The funniest moment of the entire play is when there are three diametrically opposed things happening at once. I don't want to give it away, but the actors, puppets, and audiences are all doing very, very different things at one point in the second act. You'll know it when you see it, and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.I wouldn't go again, but I would recommend it to the right sort of person: someone who didn't get offended at Book of Mormon, liked Avenue Q, and thought those two musicals would have been a lot funnier without all that damned music all the time.",,,

Take advantage of intermission to stretch your legs even if you only stand at your seat.I noticed beer and wine available on every floor and it's a bit pricey, a double glass of wine $23.00, That's a quick 25.00 :/  However you do get a cute cup with lid for future use.Be sure to make reservations after investigating restaurants on Yelp.  While the area offers many, they can vary greatly.",2,,
35,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592,5.0,1/12/2015,"Bradley Cooper in The Elephant Man - a tremendous performance and based on a true story. Do not miss this limited engagement!The theater itself is located in the heart of the Theater District just west of Broadway on 45th street. It has one of the lit on marquees on the top of the building, which I just love. The space isn't huge and must have been recently renovated or well kept up because the architecture and painted details looked splendid. The seats were a bit cramped from a depth standpoint - we were seated in the center orchestra section and to even let people by us going into the row for seats was a trick. As with most theaters, beverages and snacks are available at a rather steep price, both at the concession stands and from some people walking the aisles before the show and during intermission.As for this show, I truly cannot say enough about the stellar cast - Bradley Cooper, Patricia Clarkson and Alessandro Nivola. Bradley, who has reprises his role as the main character, John Merrick from its earlier run at the Williamstown Theater Festival, exudes the complexity of his character with ease. After the initial introduction to him, you are instantly captivated by all that is left unsaid yet still so pronounced in his embodiment of the role of such a profoundly disfigured yet intensely intelligent and thoughtful person. Patricia Clarkson, who plays Mrs. Kendal, quickly charms the audience at her introduction yet goes on to show her sensitive, kind side with the deep friendship and love she has for John. Not to give too much away, a scene with such raw emotion involving Mrs. Kendal and John's characters brought the audience to tears. Alessandro Nivola, a new actor to me, was engaging and compassionate as Dr. Frederick Treves - the man who singlehandedly pulls John out from under the clutches of his dark, enslaved past and provides him with his first ever ""home"".This play reminds you just what people are capable of - from the worst of our nature to the best.

The interior design, after a few different alterations through the years, is simple and sturdy. It would fit somewhere in the middle between the grandeur of the Shubert Theatre and the atrocious hideousness that is the Gershwin Theatre. 1979 is the last year that this theatre saw a large renovation...lighting fixtures were switched out, colors altered and seats replaced. What we are left with is a simple, elegant, no-frills space that still has great wood and tan/brown house with great views from every seat.

I've never read the book, so I didn't know what to expect. Contrary to what many have noted here and in other reviews, I don't think Cherry Jones was that stellar. Her accent came across as extremely fake, which really hurt the delivery of her lines. On the other hand, I do think that Zachary Quinto and Celia Keenan-Bolger's performances were quite powerful. The silences and purposeful pauses in this play really brought it all together, and it really gives the audience an opportunity to digest and understand what is really happening on stage. It's a simple play. But it's a lovely one.",3,,2

We went and got a bite and came back an hour later and the lobby was packed. We were told that there were two balcony seats available, but we had to pay cash as the original ticket holders already charged them and that is the only way they could swipe the dough! Oh! Did I say that! Made me feel like I never left Chicago! Cute little theater that doesn't have a bad seat. We were about 30 feet from Miss M over looking the stage. Comfortable seats with a birds eye view. If their were a fire though, we would all be screwed as people couldn't even manage to get down the stairs with any sort of semblance.Now about the show that has nothing to do with the star rating! If I had a tamata or do you say tomata, the little lady would have been wearing it! Did I really pay two hundred and eighty four dollars to hear this broad complain for almost two hours? She lit about 25 cigarettes and sat their bitching about her life as Sue Mengers! I know I'm in NY, but I could have gone to a deli and for the price of a pastrami I could have listened to old people ca-fetching and it would have been more enjoyable! I did go thru the playbill and managed to give her a couple of goatee and eyebrow combos. That took all of 6 minutes! Pass on the I'll Eat you Last!",2,3,2

With this play though it was actually really nice.  I felt I was in the room with them and its crazy seeing how into character all the amazing actors were.  Its great when an actor/actress can make you hate them so much.The theater itself is great. The seats are comfortable and the atmosphere is very intimate, as someone else said.  Its a smaller theater but I like that about it.  And I like that the back of the theater just leads straight out into the street, so no crazy lines to get out.  And even though it leads out into the street, I didn't hear any traffic noise or anything, but i was sitting in the front...  Bathrooms are downstairs and very cleanWas about to give this theater 4/5 stars, then remembered something...The bitter hostess or whatever you call them that show you your seats.  Well this lady was super rude to people.  Sure I understand its bad for people in the front row to lean on the stage during breaks, but geeze... there is a nicer method to get them off than by yelling ""STOP LEANING ON THE STAGE"" (no please or anything) and calling people ""Smart-ass"" when they say something to try to play it off as to not draw attention like she was doing.  I didn't do the leaning but I was still annoyed with her.  And she was rude to a lot of other people as well.  Seriously, if you hate your job so much then quit but don't be rude and ruin this experience for them for small mishaps.  Almost made me want to leave... BUT the play was so good so I just tried to ignore her.All in all, great theater.

51,Melissa V.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",0,6,0,3.0,2/13/2016,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer...HUGHIE was mildly interesting and I did feel that some lines were patched together by Forest Whitaker because they were missed. Maybe I should give him credit because he did the majority of the talking for an hour but I have seen other one-man plays that were flawless. I usually tell people they should go see a play I've seen, but not this one. As well, the play was probably only 50-55 minutes long because it didn't start on time but ended at 3:05p.  For Broadway money, there should have been two short plays presented.I got several emails beforehand from Telecharge telling me to not be late because latecomers would not be seated, but that was not true. The poor usher was exasperated because she had so many late people to seat, and it ended up being a distraction as we watched the performance. I definitely understand why people were late - that entire area is impossible to navigate through due to surrounding construction and traffic. If possible, take the subway there or give yourself at least one hour to park (and I'm talking about parking in a LOT - so many of them were full and parking was hard to find),I had an aisle seat in the last row of the mezzanine.  VERY uncomfortable because I have very long legs. So uncomfortable I am starting a database with theater seat details because I don't want to go through this again -  thank goodness the play was short. This experience makes me only want to buy orchestra theater seats in the future.  I was going to do that for HUGHIE but the only seats available for this matinee were all the way in the back of the orchestra. I generally feel that most mezzanine seats are better than any seat in the rear orchestra.",,,

For Next to Normal, which I saw on Saturday, most seats seemed to offer great sight lines because of the rake of the audience. However, the set is three-teired, so sitting in the first four rows of the orchestra may allow Alice Ripley to spit on you, but you will miss the acting that goes on in the ""attic"" of the house. Other than that issue, the sight lines seem unobscured. I wish when they renovated the space that they did not remover the central chandelier. Those center light pieces are always so breathtaking.

73,Beck H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,0,1.0,2/8/2013,"Have yet to see the production of Virginia Wolf due to the blizzard in which we had to postpone to another date. But the reason I'm writing this is to reveal the horrendous  and rude box office assistant who we dealt with this evening. Yes, we understand that even if you purchase your tix in advance at the box office (which is through Telecharge anyway) you will not be able to deal with any postponements/customer service via telephone and must do so in person. And yes, we were fine with trekking down to the box office in person during the blizzard since there is no official telephone number which enables you to contact the Box Office directly. Fine. We can deal with that.  The box office assistant asked for our tickets, then scrambled on the computer for a few minutes to transfer our purchase to another evening, announced she made an error and then started the process over. She then asked for my sisters bank card in which the purchase was originally made, printed a ""refund"" slip, then entered the new date into her system.  She then flicks the bank card back through the window and states "" Your card has been denied"". No explanation.  So we questioned what she meant and why we were being charged again for tickets, and she literally looked at us and said ""your card is denied. Call your bank"".  What she should have done, as anyone with mere social skills in a customer service position is explain that the ""refund"" she swiped back onto my sisters card may take a while to go through and that we would have to front the $400 dollars again to postpone to another date before obtaining our tickets. Thankfully my sister had another credit card on her. Obviously she was incapable any such reasonable dialogue and if it weren't for the fact we promised our Mom these tickets for her birthday (who lives in CT, hence unable to make it down for the show due to the blizzard) we were ready to book tix at another theater.  This really left a bad taste in my mouth as far as the representation of The Booth Theater. I don't understand why people choose a customer service position when they have the personality of a rude snob. Oh I had also complimented her on her jewelry when we approached the window and it turned out her sister was a designer as I am. She gave me her sisters biz card...but I guess I'll ""deny"" any future purchases from there as well.",1,1,
